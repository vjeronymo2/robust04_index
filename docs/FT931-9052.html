			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): UK agriculture faces up to inevitability of change - A more realistic mood was apparent at last week's annual meeting of the National Farmers' Union THE LOUDEST and most spontaneous burst of applause at last week's annual meeting of the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales came during a debate on farmers' survival in the free market. Some delegates had welcomed the challenge of unfettered competition with the farmers of other countries. 'Give us a level playing field,' they declared, 'and we can compete with anybody in the world.' Then a delegate from the back of the room went to the microphone. He introduced himself as an international farmer from Kent and Brazil. 'Free trade and a level playing field are illusions,' he said. 'If I told you the details of social and environmental policies in Brazil I would make you weep. Suffice to say they consist mainly of bullets, bulldozers and boxes of matches. Farmers in the UK can never hope to compete with that and I don't advise them to try.' The rousing response this received from most of those present indicated clearly that they too wished to cling to some system of guaranteed prices and/or protective tariff barriers for European Community countries to insulate them from unfair competition from low cost producers. For there is a fear among British farmers that the high costs, the safety standards and the rules and regulations imposed on them are not shared by many of the countries from which Britain accepts food imports. But this was a rare moment among the two days of discussion. Most of the rest of the event was carefully orchestrated to present an industry that was prepared to confront and accept change; to take greater responsibility for its own market making and to avoid public whingeing. For, notwithstanding the fact that in spite of a small rise in UK average farm incomes in 1992, they are still only half what they were in real terms 10 years ago, there is a different mood in the NFU of the 1990s to that which prevailed a decade ago. At least there is among the leaders of the union. It is taking a little longer to reach the shires but if last week's meeting is an accurate guide it is getting there. This new mood accepts that the government does not owe farmers a living; that there is not enough cash around to guarantee such security anyway, even if there were a shortage of food - which there is not. It recognises that this is an age in which expectations of market forces and expanding free trade dominate political thinking. It is acutely aware that alongside all this it is necessary to show that farmers care for the environment. The tone is set by Mr David Naish who was re-elected president of the union for a third one-year term last week. A consummate politician, aware of the need to play to the gallery at times, he takes every opportunity to castigate government ministers over their parsimony towards British farmers in comparison with of other EC ministers. Such actions as the reduction, by Britain alone in the EC, of special payments to hard-pressed hill farmers and the confiscation of the Pounds 750,000 residue of a pig producers' own fund for the elimination of Aujeskys disease in the UK, gave him sticks with which to beat Mr David Curry, junior agriculture minister, when he visited the annual meeting. So thoroughly did Mr Naish do it, in fact, that his members gave him a standing ovation. In spite of that personal success however, the president clearly has other priorities. The first, and one for which delegates also applauded him loudly, is to ensure that British farmers do not face unfair competition . And that is as likely to come from inside the EC as from outside it, he implied. He spoke particularly of the danger that British milk quotas might be cut in order to accommodate increases in Italian quotas; and that after Italy has virtually ignored the restrictions on production, without penalty, since milk quotas were introduced in 1984. He complained at the complexity and cost of complying with UK bureaucracy in order to claim new headage payments for a reduced national beef herd and asked, rhetorically, whether Greek peasant farmers really had to do the same. And so on in that vein. But during his keynote speech he concentrated mainly on the changes agriculture faces following common agricultural policy reform; the uncertainties, still, of what a deal in the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade might mean; and the challenges and opportunities these could bring to those farmers who were energetic and sharp enough to exploit them. Doubtless this reflected the fact that he has accepted an invitation from the prime minister to chair a working party to address the problem of the UK's food trade gap - now standing at some Pounds 6bn per year. It was also an acknowledgment that farmers must, in future, derive their incomes from a variety of sources. Of these the market-place will be the most important. Increasingly it will be a market that is relatively unsupported compared to the past; hence the need for farmers to find and develop the best outlets for quality commodities that consumers demand rather than assume that the government or the EC will bail them out. Alongside that there will still be a vital role for government to play. For even the most aggressive EC officials and Gatt negotiators do not press for total abolition of farm support. A substantial proportion of farm income will still come, therefore, from the government and the EC although these will be increasingly tied to set-aside schemes to reduce production and to encourage positive environmental management. It is up to every farmer to work out the most profitable mix of these income sources for his circumstances. Some will wish to follow old instincts and go for maximum production hoping that market prices will enable them to make a profit. Others, who may be less ambitious or have lower-quality land, will opt for the extensification approach - that is farming less intensively, taking extra special care of the environment and hoping that government compensation payments will make up the deficit. The president of the NFU is trying to prepare and galvanise his members for these changes and challenges. But many farmers are conservative by nature and cling to old values. Some of them will leave adaptation to the new conditions until it is too late. Indeed some have already done so and it is estimated that about 100 UK farmers are going out of business each week. But that, of course, is what free trade and market forces are all about.</p>

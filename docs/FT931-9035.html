			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Grand Met in demand SUPPORT from NatWest Sec-urities helped Grand Metropolitan hold up in a brewery sector weakened by comments from Foster's, the Australian group, which owns Courage in Britain. GrandMet moved into the NatWest 'Top Ten Buy' list as the broker decided recent underperformance had been overdone and that next week's agm statement would be cautiously optimistic on current trading, particularly in the weak North American food business. Analyst Mr Geoff Collyer said the chances of the group making a rights issue, a factor behind the stock's recent poor performance, had diminished as the currency market had moved against sterling. GrandMet rose in early trading, but weakened as the Foster's news hit the market. Foster's reported that its UK margins were under pressure, beer volume was down and the government's drinks legislation was creating difficult market conditions. The shares closed 2 down at 438p in turnover of 4.1m. Bass lost 5 to 573p, Allied-Lyons 3 to 580p, Scottish &amp; Newcastle 7 to 423p and Whitbread 'A' 8 to 474p. Unigate buoyant Food conglomerate Unigate enjoyed a further buoyant session as it announced another acquisition and sought to assure the market that it did not intend to raise cash through a rights issue. The company clinched its second deal in four days with the purchase of Glass Glover Group for Pounds 54m, after picking up Clifford Foods on Friday for Pounds 50.4m. Unigate won more plaudits as it held out the prospect of recovering most of its outlay by floating its US restaurant operations. Analysts said this would realise more than Pounds 100m. Yesterday's moves were also welcomed as another component in Unigate's strategy of concentrating its business on the UK in general and the food manufacturing sector in particular. Analysts said that, because of cheap borrowings, the Glass Glover acquisition should boost earnings. As with Friday's deal, most analysts raised profits forecasts by between Pounds 1m to Pounds 3m. The shares jumped 15 to 357p. Lloyds sold Further consideration of the results from Lloyds Bank imposed a drag on the share price, which fell 8 1/2 to 513p xd. The negative view was emphasised by Mr Mark Eady of NatWest Securities, who published a sell recommendation yesterday, arguing that the figures had been flattered by foreign exchange trading profits, currency translation gains and write-downs for third world debts. The shares were further affected by recurrent speculation that the bank might bid for TSB. US house Lehman Brothers also voiced caution, arguing that: 'The shares looked stretched without a new source of operating gains.' Lehman suggests switching into Abbey National, up 3 at 359p, or Barclays, 12 higher at 447p. TI lower Shares in aerospace and engineering company TI Group were hit by reports that American Airlines was considering returning some of its 34 Airbus aircraft as a cost-cutting measure. The shares lost 11 to 294p. The company is exposed to Airbus through the Dowty subsidiary it acquired last year. Hoare Govett yesterday reiterated its caution on several of the aerospace and engineering stocks, including TI, which weakened sentiment in the stock further. However, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to be positive on TI. Oil shares were marked lower as the market awaited agreement on oil production cuts at the Opec meeting in Vienna. BP, trading ex a 2.1p dividend, was down 4 1/2 at 267p, while Shell Transport was a penny lower at 590p. Volumes were low principally because of the closure of the US market for President's Day. Mr Fergus Mcleod of NatWest Securities added: 'I think the poor turnover shows that people are sitting on their hands waiting to see how Opec turns out.' There was particular concern that Kuwait appeared to be standing firm against an output reduction and crude oil prices were also depressed. Building products group MB-Caradon attracted attention after the company said it was to seek shareholder's permission to sell its 25.3 per cent stake in packaging manufacturer CarnaudMetalbox. At the day's best, MB shares were up 11 at 321p, as dealers speculated that the sale signalled a more lucrative purchase for MB-Caradon. But profit-taking later in the day saw the stock surrender the early gain and close unchanged at 310p after trade of 1.3m shares. CarnaudMetalbox rose 62 to 2675p. Old bid favourites Hepworth, up 11 at 347p, and Marley, 4 ahead at 113p, were put in the frame as a result of the MB-Caradon deal. Blue Circle put on 4 at 213p as NatWest Securities declared itself more positive, describing the stock as a 'highly marketable long term recovery play'. BPB firmed 3 to 222p following a series of recent presentations. The speculation that someone will bid for Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group, refused to die and the shares added a further 4 at 245p. Hanson was yesterday's predicted suitor and shares in the conglomerate eased a penny to 254p ahead of first-quarter figures due today. Hanson was also very actively traded in the options market. Reuters Holdings recovered more ground following last week's figures and closed 12 higher at 1348p. Rothmans International improved 13 to 622p in reaction to last week's news that the company plans to restructure its Singapore and Malaysian tobacco companies. The pound's general weakness also helped the shares as 90 per cent of the tobacco group's earnings come from outside the UK. Inchcape, the motor and consumer goods distributor, rose 14 to 578p after Nikko Europe raised its 1993 profits forecast to Pounds 300m from Pounds 270m. Political speculation in Hong Kong, fuelling rises in the Hang Seng index, helped HSBC and Cable and Wireless. The latter was also given a push by Hoare Govett, which said the stock had extra value from currency movements, benefiting Pounds 4m for every one cent movement in the US dollar against sterling. The shares advanced 14 to 733p. HSBC ordinary rose 8 to 598p and the Hong Kong registered 9 to 580p. The insurance sector gave a strong performance, with buyers encouraged by a positive note from securities house Smith New Court. Mr Steven Bird, Smith's insurance analyst, said: 'All the composites should see a significant improvement in their earnings over the next few years.' The team's 'nap selection' is Commercial Union, but an early gain of 5 was whittled away by the afternoon and the shares closed a penny easier at 605p. The house also likes General Accident, 9 higher at 575p. Ratification of the EC agreement on bananas boosted Geest, which surged 26 to 419p. Further press speculation on the prospects of VAT being imposed on food failed to have any more impact on retailers, whose shares have been consistently weak in recent sessions. But, similar worries taxed WH Smith, the 'A' shares shedding 7 to 415p xd. Interim results and an increased dividend from Dalgety pleased the market and the shares added 3 at 470p. While its areas such as pet foods and crisps were stronger, prospects of margins squeezing elsewhere led many analysts to reduce profits slightly for the full year. Dividend hunters sought out Rank Organisation and the shares added 8 at 696p. Comment in the Sunday press attracted early support for Castle Mill International, the handbag maker. A subsequent shortage of stock left the shares up 2 3/4 at 8 1/2 p. International trader Lonrho was in demand as investors reflected on the changes in the company's management. The stock gained 5 1/2 at 87p xd in heavy trade of 9.5m. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (233).

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Campaigns in Colombia 'drug-free' Colombia's prosecutor-general said yesterday that an investigation had found no proof that drug traffickers financed the election campaigns this year of President Ernesto Samper and of his main rival, Mr Andres Pastrana, Reuter reports from Bogota. 'It was not proven that money from drug trafficking reached the presidential campaigns, fortunately for Colombian democracy,' Mr Gustavo de Greiff said in a radio interview. He had launched an investigation in June after allegations, based on audio-cassette tapes, that the heads of the country's most powerful cocaine trafficking organisation, the Cali cartel, offered cash to Mr Samper's campaign. The allegations, which came only days after Mr Samper's victory on June 19 in a close contest, caused uproar in Colombia and led to severe questioning in the US of the country's commitment to the global war against the illicit trade in drugs. The cassettes were made public by Mr Pastrana after his defeat, although they also contained an ambiguous reference to drug money in his campaign. Both Mr Pastrana and Mr Samper vigorously denied that their campaigns had received any drug money. Marxist guerrillas in Colombia killed seven members of an anti-drug police patrol on Monday, in an ambush in a mountainous area of the south-western department of Cauca used for growing opium poppies, a police official said yesterday.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Angolans wait for election results ANGOLA waited nervously last night for the publication of final official election results as Mr Pik Botha, South African foreign minister, continued his efforts to resolve the country's crisis, writes Julian Ozanne in Luanda. The National Electoral Commission said it would release final results yesterday, despite threats by Unita, the former rebel movement which lost last month's elections, that doing so would provoke a violent reaction. Unita, which has alleged massive election fraud, has demanded that an investigation into its claims be allowed to complete its work before final results are released. Observers were pressing the MPLA government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to wait 48 hours as a concession to Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader. Western observers said that unofficial returns indicated that Mr dos Santos might not get more than a 50 per cent majority needed to avoid a presidential run-off. Mr Botha yesterday met top government officials to pass on messages from Mr Savimbi to Mr dos Santos, whom he was due to meet last night.</p>

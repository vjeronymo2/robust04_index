			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANGS AND SCHOOL LIFE  </P> <P> I was very disappointed at the way my school was described.  </P> <P> First of all, not all of us are gangbangers or wantabes. I am a B-plus student  with all intentions of being a successful gynecologist one day. Most of my  friends here also have ambitions to have a successful future. We compete  academically, we challenge our teachers, we thrive on learning new and  different things and we even have fun! We respect our teachers, administrators,  and every adult who is here for us.  </P> <P> Judy Pasternak inflated the negatives about Markham and the few students who  say that they are gang members. Very little was said of the many magnet  students who come here by choice and who are bused in from as far as  Westchester and Carson. Nothing was said about the long waiting list of  students wanting to get into the Health Careers Magnet Program. Nothing was  said about many of our parents who have college degrees or who are working  everyday to make things comfortable for us, instead of our being on welfare.  </P> <P> TIFFANY COCHRAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

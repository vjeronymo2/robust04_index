			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Bomb defused in Rome near PM's office ROME police yesterday defused a car bomb placed in a narrow street within 200 yards of the prime minister's office and parliament. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, prime minister, who was in talks with representatives of unions and employers, declined to evacuate his office and pressed ahead with the meeting. The authorities immediately claimed the incident was part of a campaign to destabilise Italy. It followed the two car bombs in Rome and Florence since May 14, killing five people and damaging the famed Uffizi Gallery. The discovery of yesterday's bomb in the heart of Rome at midday has increased the pressure on the authorities to pinpoint those behind the campaign. The two previous car bombs have been blamed on the Mafia but there is a strong suspicion that elements of the security services - long linked to right-wing extremist groups and the secret Masonic lodge P2 - might be involved. The government is understood to be considering ways of reorganising the security services, which have always been a law unto themselves. 'It is no accident,' commented Mr Ugo Pecchioli, deputy of the Party of the Democratic Left, 'that every time in Italy's recent history there begins to be a change in the existing balance of power, events occur like this morning's which seek to condition the democratic outcome.' The recently stolen car involved in yesterday's incident contained 20kg of a mixture of ammonium nitrate and petrol, plus a detonator. Such a mixture has been used by neo-Fascist groups in Tuscany and is different from that employed in the Rome and Florence attacks. Responsibility for planting the bomb was claimed by Armed Falange, the same organisation which said it was behind the two previous bombs; but the authorities have so far not taken these calls seriously. Officials said the car bomb appeared deliberately timed to coincide with yesterday's celebrations of Republic Day (the first car bomb went off on National Police Day). Although the Mafia is being linked to the destabilising campaign, the government yesterday was able to announce another success against Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia. Security forces arrested Mr Giuseppe Pulvirenti, the most wanted boss in eastern Sicily and head of a well-armed clan in the Catania region. He had been on the run for 11 years. His arrest followed that of Mr Nito Santapaola on May 18, the acknowledged boss of the Catania Mafia and the most wanted man in Sicily following the arrest in January of Mr 'Toto' Riina, considered the 'boss of bosses'. The arrest also underlined the crackdown under way in Sicily both against Cosa Nostra and those with links to it.</p>

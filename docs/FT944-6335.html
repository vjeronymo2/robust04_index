			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television Wildlife Showcase (8pm BBC2) and Survival Special (9pm ITV) remind us of what television has come to do uniquely well. The latter, a look at the perpetually embattled Serengeti, is especially riveting. Wildlife of a less predictable nature gathers in the jungle clearing of The Midnight Hour (12.05am BBC2). This political forum has the uncertainty of a safari in search of a threatened species. Those elusive creatures, politicians, have grown wary of the attention they once courted and are correspondingly hard to pin down. Their mimicry can be splendidly entertaining, particularly when making the noises they think we like to hear. How much of it learnt parrot-fashion? Sometimes you could swear these shy beasts, with their mixture of evasiveness and bouts of exhibitionistic showing off, are human. Long lunchers or job-sharers can catch up with the urban jungle of those women cops in Cagney and Lacey (2.15pm BBC1), their blend of heart and toughness brilliantly acted. They make LA Law (12.10am Channel 4) look plush and bland.</p>

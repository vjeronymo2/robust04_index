			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIDEAST OIL AND U.S. TROOPS IN SAUDI ARABIA  </P> <P> Because the Middle East has most of the world's oil reserves, the region will  be a problem until sufficient alternate fuels are developed to take the place  of oil. Our government and the energy companies have known about this problem  for years.  </P> <P> As pointed out by President Carter in the late 1970s, the oil problem is the  moral equivalent of war. Part of Carter's response to the oil shortage was to  call for conservation and to initiate alternative-fuel research, although these  measures were later canceled by the Reagan Administration. Now, a decade later,  we realize that Carter was correct. The world's oil reserves will be gone  within the first half of the next century.  </P> <P> Who will control the final pool of oil in the Middle East while it is being  depleted? This is a critical question, and its answer involves the reason why  the United States reacted so quickly to the crisis. If Saddam Hussein were to  be left unchecked, he could easily control the economic destiny of the entire  world.  </P> <P> President Bush and the United Nations need to take this opportunity to create  safeguards rather than obfuscate the issue with talk of war. Gulf oil is a  permanent world problem that requires a permanent solution. We must spend money  on the problem, but let us spend it for diplomacy, and a permanent and peaceful  solution. One permanent solution could be, for example, to establish a U.N.  presence headed by a coalition of Middle Eastern countries. Pay for peace, not  war.  </P> <P> President Bush must establish a clear energy policy for our country. While it  is reprehensible that Hussein has taken over Kuwait, this does not threaten  American security, as does the much larger potential threat to oil supplies.  </P> <P> Mr. President, you have a chance to lead the world into the next century with a  long-term and peaceful solution to one of its major problems -- energy. You  have a chance to break the historic chain of reaction and war.  </P> <P> RICHARD V. FISHER, Professor of Geology, UC Santa Barbara  </P></p>

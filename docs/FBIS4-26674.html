			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Seidlitz in Shanghai] </F>   [Text] Heavy losses on the metal futures markets in  Shanghai and London have triggered firm action from Chinese  authorities.    Prominent traders have been detained, an investigation team  dispatched from Beijing to Shanghai and personnel changes made  in leading Shanghai trading companies. According to  highly-placed sources, several hundreds of millions of United  States dollars were lost last year when Chinese traders dealing  through U.S. and British investment houses ordered huge amounts  of copper at top prices for China's strategic stockpiles without  the central government's consent. Prices collapsed and caused  an uproar in the People's Bank of China, the central bank  chaired by Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, sources said.    Several high-rolling and well-known Shanghai traders had  been  detained. Under detention were two employees of the  metal-trading department of Shanghai CITIC [China International  Trust and Investment Corporation].    An investigation had also been launched against an official  of the Shanghai Machinery and Electrical Bureau, who alone was  alleged to be responsible for the huge trading losses on the  London Metals Exchange, according to the sources. Several other  companies which also suffered losses were also under  investigation.    "The futures trading losses in Shanghai made the Beijing  government realise that commodity trading was becoming a casino  for rich individuals and government companies," said a trader in  Beijing. Sources close to Mr Zhu, an advocate of strong central  government action and discipline, claim he was furious with the  losses made as a result of speculation in Shanghai.    "The futures markets were intended originally for price  monitoring, not market speculation. The markets were totally  misused when people thought they could become rich overnight on  commodity market speculation, said the traders. As a result,  the central government has further tightened controls on trading  in metals as well as other commodities.    All foreign currency allocations needed for letters of  credits in the commodities field must now be approved by the  People's Bank and other relevant central authorities. In  addition, several metal futures departments of Shanghai  companies were closed.    In the last two years traders could get letters of credit  from Chinese banks that organised currency on provincial swap  markets opening the door for favours and special relationships  between commodity traders and swap centres' foreign currency  allocation managers. Beijing wanted to stop this practice and  recentralise decisions.    The huge losses in Shanghai are not unique. Mr Zhu was  reportedly equally furious when during a recent inspection tour  of provinces in northern China he discovered that enormous steel  orders had been made with Russia outside central government  plans and without Beijing's knowledge. Last year, China also  suffered huge losses when large amounts of steel were imported  to feed the building industry.    Hong Kong traders made a fortune in deals with Chinese  companies which stockpiled steel only to see the building  industry and prices collapse. Steel exports to China this year  have fallen dramatically. But the central government was said  to have been particularly annoyed at the recent Shanghai case as  traders were speculating with orders for strategic stockpile  reserves, for which selected trustworthy Chinese companies can  buy on behalf of the government.    The huge copper orders were for government reserves. The  Ministry of Finance now has to foot the bill for commodity  reserves. which were purchased at the highest possible world  prices.    Mr Zhu is now on a confrontation course with the leading  brokerage houses that were main advocates of commodity future  markets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dubai, May 13 (AFP)--Northern Yemeni leaders  rejected late Friday a southern ceasefire plan to end fighting  which has opposed rival forces for the past nine days, and  demanded the surrender of southern chiefs.    An official spokesman said by telephone from the Yemeni  capital Sanaa that there was "nothing new" in the seven-point  plan put forward in Aden by the southern Yemen Socialist Party  (YSP).    He said that "the legitimate leadership in Sanaa demands the  surrender of the war criminal" ousted vice-president 'Ali Salim  al- Bid, who heads the YSP.    They also wanted the surrender of "all the others  responsible  for the war, so that they can be judged for war crimes."    The plan put forward Friday by the YSP called for an  "immediate end to the war" and the creation of a government of  national unity.    The government would be charged with "wiping out the  consequences of the war" and conducting an inquiry into "those  responsible for the war," a source said in the southern  stronghold of Aden.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Revolt by key party shakes Swedes The minority coalition government in Sweden has been shaken by uproar in the small right-wing party that holds the balance of power, just as Prime Minister Carl Bildt is preparing to fight a general election in September. The New Democracy party late last week declared it would no longer act as 'the fifth wheel' under the four-party coalition of the right and centre led by Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party. This role has underpinned the government since it took office in late-1991. The New Democrats said they would join the main opposition Social Democratic party and the small Left party in voting next month to abolish a controversial healthcare reform at the centre of Mr Bildt's attempt to streamline and liberalise Sweden's welfare system. Together, the three parties could defeat the government in parliament. With less than three months to go until parliament is dissolved before the election, a change of government is not being discussed. A deep split in New Democracy, whose leader Mr Ian Wachtmeister announced his resignation a few weeks ago, has left in doubt the willingness of all its parliamentary members to follow the new party line. Mr Bildt's room for manoeuvre has been narrowed, particularly over healthcare reform. A move now being implemented, to let Swedish family doctors set up private practices outside direct local authority control, and to let Swedes choose their family doctors, could be stopped next month. The momentum of Mr Bildt's efforts to break down welfare state monopolies and introduce more competition seems likely to be halted.</p>

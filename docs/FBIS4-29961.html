			<p>BFN     [Text] On 14 June, a government source disclosed that an  idea has surfaced to formulate a new 10-year public investment  plan to be effective beginning FY1994 or FY1995. The new plan  will not be drawn up by simply increasing a 430 trillion yen [Y]  budget for the current basic plan for public investment  (effective FY1991 to FY2000), which is under government review.  The source said the government is considering appropriating  about Y550 trillion for the new plan, which is over Y100  trillion more than the budget for the current plan, and using  65-70 percent of it for investment in programs to improve  "living conditions and cultural facilities" in view of the need  to better a quality of life. The new plan's formulation is  aimed at showing other countries the government's strong  determination to stimulate domestic demand. The government will  finalize the plan in June and will present it to the July G-7  summit (Naples summit) as a main pillar of Japan's macroeconomic  policy.    In an external economic policy outline issued at the end of  March, the government indicated a plan to increase the budget  for the current public investment plan and to review the budget  allotment in the plan. Based on this, the government has been  studying specific measures. But the budget increase is possible  only if financial resources are secured. Thus, depending on the  final content of a tax reform program, the size of the increase  may possibly be reduced.    The idea about the new plan has surfaced because the current  plan no longer fits the actual situation, as a result of an  increase in public investment proposed in a series of  pump-priming packages. Public investment during the FY1991-93  period is expected to increase about 10 percent from the  previous period. Even if the government increases public  investment by merely 3 percent every year from now on, the  current plan will easily be carried out.    Since Japan entered the era of low economic growth,  commodity  prices have stabilized. Now, the target of 5-percent economic  growth in nominal terms, a prerequisite to carrying out the  current plan, does not fit the actual state of the economy at  all. Therefore, some government officials are calling for  reviewing the rate of year-on-year increase in public investment  (which is set at 5.7 percent under the current plan) accordingly.    However, even if the increase rate is lowered, "it is still  possible to increase the budget for a new plan by Y100 trillion"  from that for the current plan because planned spending on each  year's public investment is already high due to an increase in  public investment proposed in pump-priming packages, a  government source said.    The current plan appropriates about 60 percent of the budget  to investment in programs to improve "living conditions and  cultural facilities," including water supply and sewage systems,  parks, housing and housing sites, and welfare facilities. In  the third supplementary budget for FY1993, the government  allotted most of public investment budget for living-related  programs. It also reviewed the ratio of allotment in the FY1994  budget. As a result, if a new plan is formulated based on the  FY1993 and FY1994 budgets, investment in programs to improve  "living conditions and cultural facilities" will increase to  65-70 percent.    The reason the government is studying the new plan is that  it  thinks it can show other countries its strong determination to  expand domestic demand if it forwards a new plan with an  increased budget. Also, the new plan will enable the government  to speed up the review of the ratio of budget allotment to  public works projects, although many are opposed to it.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Elkem rescue package to include rights issue ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, yesterday announced details of a state-backed rescue package which includes a rights issue to raise NKr580m (Dollars 91m). Trading in the group's shares was suspended briefly on the Oslo bourse yesterday pending details of the plan, but the A-shares closed 25 per cent up to NKr17.50 on the news. The company is making a one-for-two rights issue with the two leading shareholders, Saga Petroleum, the biggest Norwegian independent oil company, and Orkla, a domestic branded foods group, underwriting NKr390m of the issue while the Industry Ministry plans to guarantee up to NKr190m. The state will effectively acquire a stake in Elkem of just under 22 per cent. Orkla owns a 29.9 per cent stake in the company and Saga Petroleum 12.4 per cent. The banks involved are Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, Norway's two biggest banks. The company has been forced to write down the face value of its shares to NKr20 from the current NKr50 which means its share capital will increase to NKr865.6m from the current NKr700m, after the write-down and the new issue. The rights issue would be made at a price of NKr20 a share and underwriters of the issue have demanded that the new shares receive preferential treatment for up to three years against a possible write-down of the stock. 'After this period, all shares will be treated equally,' Elkem said. Another condition demanded is for the group to acquire new bank loans of NKr550m, including extension of a NKr300m credit facility which expires in 1992. Yet another condition for the rights issue and the loan is that the state postpone repayments of a NKr270m loan used to acquire a 45 per cent stake in Norsk Jern Holding, a domestic steel producer, and unspecified loans acquired to upgrade environmental standards of plant. Elkem will have to pay principal on these postponed loans. The state's participation in the package will have to be formally approved by parliament and therefore a date for the rights issue has not yet been set. Elkem is due to have a board meeting today to finalise details of the arrangements. It said that it is holding negotiations to cut employees' wages.</p>

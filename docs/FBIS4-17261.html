			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 21, BNS -- The Chief Election  Commission [CEC] of Lithuania on Wednesday [20 April] circulated  a statement denying accusations that its decisions are  politically biased.    The statement came as a reaction to allegations that the CEC  unlawfully refused to register Conservative Party candidate  Liudvikas Sabutis for a by-election in the Kaisiadorys district.  The conservatives filed an appeal against the decision to the  Supreme Court.    Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Lithuanian parliament's  opposition, said CEC is manipulated by the ruling Lithuanian  Democratic Labor Party.    The CEC said Sabutis was denied registration because the  Conservative Party did not register itself specially for  elections, although the conservatives are an officially  registered political party. The Conservative Party says the  commission misinterpreted the law on election, which does not  require special registration for elections.    In its statement, the CEC said Landsbergis' allegations are  "groundless and insulting." The commission said it "always  observed and will observe the Constitution and Lithuanian laws."    A by-election election in the Kaisiadorys district to fill a  vacancy left by President Algirdas Brazauskas is scheduled for  May 15. Bakery worker Albinas Visockas, leader of the newly  founded extreme-left Socialist Party, is the only candidate  registered for the election. Visockas nominated himself as an  independent candidate.    Justinas Karosas, chairman of the ruling LDLP faction,  categorically denied accusations of manipulating the CEC.  Karosas told reporters Wednesday that the party in power will  neither support nor hinder Visockas's participation in the  by-election.</p>

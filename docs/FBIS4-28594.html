			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Radio commentary] </F>   [Text] After the lifting of the United States trade  embargo against Vietnam, the United States Asia Private  Commercial and Technical Council conducted a public opinion poll  and the results show that United States trade opportunities in  Vietnam could be worth about 2.7 billion dollars in 1994 and  1995. The figure may increase to 8.2 billion dollars in the  following eight years.    At the same time, representatives from well-known American  companies came to Vietnam and worked out a promising future of  doing business in the country. The director in charge of  selling Kodak products in Indochina said Kodak could gain from  four to eight million dollars in its first year of doing  business in Vietnam. The Boeing Aviation Company predicted that  Vietnam would have from 60 to 80 passenger planes within 10  years and the company hoped that its income from selling planes  to Vietnam would be from three to five billion dollars. The  Caterpillar Construction Machine Company said it was considering  selling heavy excavators and other construction equipment worth  700 million dollars to Vietnam. There are many other plans for  doing business with Vietnam by American companies.    But while the embargo was lifted, the United States has not  yet granted Vietnam an opportunity to equally trade with the  United States. Vietnam is one of ten countries in the world who  do not enjoy the most favored nation status. Vietnamese goods  imported to the United States are taxed very highly in  comparison with the same goods imported from elsewhere.    In order to be an equal trade partner, Vietnam has to join  the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff, or GATT. Concerning  this matter, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said that  Vietnam was ready to participate in the GATT system. He was  speaking at an international conference called New Waves:  ASEAN, Vietnam, and China, held in Singapore last month.    Therefore, it is clear that obstacles in trade ties between  Vietnam and the United States were coming from the United  States. If Vietnam was not able to enjoy the most favored nation  status, trade relations between Vietnam and the United States  would not develop and American companies would lose their  opportunities in the Vietnamese market. Therefore, while 30  American companies have set up representative offices in Vietnam  and the embargo has been lifted, American businessmen's  operations in Vietnam have not yet boomed.    The potential for the development of trade ties between  Vietnam and the United States exists and this potential can only  be fully developed if there are equal opportunities.</p>

Svirin maintained that his country's position and the  directions of its foreign policy are determined by the Russian  president, who "has unequivocally stated his views on this  issue."    The diplomat hinted that Russia is much more concerned about  Estonia's cold attitude toward proposals for solving the  problems of Russian-speakers' citizenship and social protection.    He claimed Russia presented the principles of troop  withdrawal from Estonia already at the Dec. 1-2 meeting in  Tallinn.    "Unfortunately, the Estonian delegation insisted even then  that the pullout of Russian troops be completed by Jan. 1,"  Svirin claimed. He said he has no information about Estonia's  proposals for the next round of talks scheduled to take place  Jan. 18-19 in Moscow.    Svirin said the Russian delegation expressed during the  latest round of negotiations its displeasure at the Estonian  government's Dec. 1 decree on granting residence permits to  retired military and their family members.    In his opinion, the requirement that military pensioners  sign a promise to honor Estonia's constitutional order, not to  endanger the country's security with their activity and not to  participate in the activity of armed groups, is humiliating.    Svirin also said that, in the field of economy, Russia is  preparing for "constructive work" this year to study closely a  draft agreement on economic and commercial cooperation, as well  as contracts on the use of ports, on transportation and on  questions related to the Soviet Union's foreign debt. He said  the drafts for about a dozen economic agreements will come under  negotiation.    Svirin stated that Russia intends to tie the conclusion of  economic agreements favorable for Estonia to the signing of  humanitarian accords.</p>

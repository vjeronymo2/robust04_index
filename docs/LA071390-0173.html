			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FEATHERS FLY WHEN MASCOT ANGERS THE MANAGER'S WIFE  </P> <P> Former major league infielder Dave Cash has been transferred from his job as  manager of the minor league Batavia Clippers after a dispute between his wife  and Chipper the Clipper, the team's mascot.  </P> <P> Cash, a former All-Star second baseman, was reassigned by the Philadelphia  Phillies to his previous position as roving minor-league infield instructor. He  will be replaced as manager of the New York-Penn League team by Ramon Aviles, a  coach with the Phillies' Double A team in Reading, Pa.  </P> <P> Cash's wife, Pamela, said she had encountered numerous problems at the ballpark  since her husband took over as manager less than a month ago.  </P> <P> On Monday night, during a game with the Oneonta Yankees, Pamela Cash said  Chipper the Clipper blocked her view of the field during a Batavia home run.  </P> <P> She said she asked the blue-feathered, yellow-beaked mascot to move, then  tapped him on the shoulder.  </P> <P> "He shook his behind in my face in front of my two young children. I thought  that kind of behavior by a mascot at what's supposed to be a family-oriented  place was totally uncalled for," she said. "This wasn't the first time he shook  his butt in my face."  </P> <P> Pamela Cash said she then got into a fight about the incident with the team's  assistant manager.  </P> <P> Team officials would not reveal the mascot's identity.  </P> <P> "The mascot is there to entertain people, not offend them," said Dwight  Thornton, a member of the team's board of directors.  </P> <P> "You should see him. He's like Big Bird on 'Sesame Street.' It's unfortunate  that the only person he offended all year was the manager's wife."  </P> <P> Dave Cash said the Monday night incident was "the culmination of many things.  </P> <P> "From my perspective, we experienced a lot of rudeness," he said. "It's best  that we no longer are in this situation."  </P></p>

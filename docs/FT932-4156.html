			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Demerger appears successful as Racal Electronics recovers THE RECOVERY in Racal Electronics pre-tax profits, from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 51.5m, is the latest evidence Sir Ernest Harrison's demerger of the group has added to shareholders' value. The group may have benefitted from a general rise in the market since Williams Holdings launched its hostile bid in 1991. But the turnround at Racal and - surprises apart - the continuing strong performance at Chubb which reports today, suggests that had the bid succeeded, it would have been a deal of a lifetime for Williams. This is not to say Racal has left its troubles behind. An overwhelming Pounds 370.6m of sales - 39 per cent of group turnover - still comes from data communications. Margins may have recovered to 3.4 per cent from less than 0.5 per cent last year. But rather like the personal computer market, this industry remains fiercely competit-ive with margins and prices permanently under press-ure. Adding two more percentage points of margin over the next two years as the group has targetted, will have an impact on profits and earnings. But data communications is hardly an area likely to generate strong long term growth once that margin recovery has been achieved. Elsewhere Racal remains a mixed bag of businesses which analysts say still appears to lack clear strategic direction. Some businesses, like military radio, in-flight telephony and area data networks would appear to have strong long term potential. There again, Redac the computer aided design business, continues to disappoint in the short term and will continue to make losses this year, the problem now being in the tough Japanese market. Racal has sharply increased cash flow and hopes to do the same this year in the data communications area, which should lead to further strengthening of the balance sheet. Recovery should lead to profits this year of Pounds 63m, giving earnings of 13.8p, rising to Pounds 72.5m or 16p next year. This puts Racal's prospective earnings mulitiple on a 15 per cent premium to the market this year, which given the tough nature of some of its markets, seems high enough.</p>

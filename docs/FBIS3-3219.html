			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporters Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524) and Li </F> Anding (2621 1344 1353): "Jottings on the Two Sessions: Prices  Brook No 'Riding Without Tickets'"]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- During group  discussions of the two sessions [The Second Session of the  Eighth National People's Congress and Second Session of the  Eighth National Committee of the Chinese Peoples' Political  Consultative Conference], a relatively large number of deputies  and committee members spoke about the price issue. They  requested that while taking measures to maintain an overall  balance between supply and demand this year, the state control  price hikes to an extent tolerable for the people. At the same  time, they pointed out: An undercurrent lurked in the midst of  price reform. Brandishing the banner of price reform, some  people took the opportunity to wantonly raise prices, hiking bus  fares and increasing prices in disguised forms. Deputies  vividly depicted such an occurrence as "riding without a ticket"  [wu paio cheng che 2477 4384 0042 6508].    The phenomenon of "riding without a ticket" is especially  marked in the service industry. It may appear in various  places, ranging from parking a bicycle and making a telephone  call to hotel services and house renovations. When the people  became more inquisitive and began questioning the validity of  the hikes, it was couched with the fine-sounding terms of "we  are now undergoing price reform."    This sort of "riding without a ticket" price reform is  highly  pernicious. Deputies and committee members pointed out sharply:  This kind of behavior has created confusion, defamed the reform,  and also increased the people's burden, and adversely affected  the stability of society. When introducing a series of price  reform measures, the state must consider the people's ability to  withstand certain increases. Price readjustment should proceed  in an orderly manner and step by step. However, "riding without  a ticket" may appear at every level and out of the blue.  Confronted with such a situation when least mentally prepared,  people tend to pay additional charges out of their pockets. If  we let this kind of phenomenon drift freely and go unchecked,  will our price reform not go upside down?    Deputies and committee members proposed: This phenomenon of  "riding without a ticket" must be resolutely curbed, and we must  not be soft in handling this matter. Instead, we should resort  to legal, political, and economic means, and deal with it in a  comprehensive manner. As soon as such a case is detected, we  must investigate and deal with it accordingly.    To deal with the tactic of "fishing in troubled water"  adopted by those "riding without tickets"; and those taking  advantage of the situation to indiscriminately raise prices when  the public are not clear about service industry charges and the  price of some commodities, some deputies and committee members  suggested we set up a consultation center so that if the people  are doubtful about the prices of certain commodities and  services, they may telephone to seek clarification and avoid  being taken for a ride by someone "riding without a ticket."</p>

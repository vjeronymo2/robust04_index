			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rising hopes on US trade talks help Nikkei ahead Reports that US and Japanese trade officials had agreed to resume bilateral framework talks encouraged investors, and share prices ended a volatile session slightly higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index gained ground for the fifth consecutive day, rising 53.41 to 20,622.12 as the Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 1.41 to 1,655.62. The 225 fell to a day's low of 20,501.00 in the morning session and peaked at 20,748.75, falling short of 20,781.98, the high for this year. Profit-taking depressed share prices in the morning session, but buying by arbitrageurs, along with foreign and domestic institutional investors pushed share prices higher. Index-linked selling and profit-taking towards the end of the session eroded some of the gains. Volume totalled 550m shares against 388m. The Nikkei 300 index rose 0.17 to 302.67 while gainers led losers by 621 to 421, with 148 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.71 to 1,357.63. Traders were encouraged by active buying on the part of domestic institutions. However, a Japanese broker said that heavy selling around 21,000 will make it hard for the index to rise much further. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y15,000 to Y842,000, rebounding for the first time in eight consecutive days. East Japan Railway, on the other hand, lost ground for the third straight day, falling Y1,000 to Y505,000. Large capital steels, which led Monday's index rise, eased gently on profit-taking. Nippon Steel fell Y1 to Y368 and Kawasaki Steel lost Y2 to Y399. Banks were lower ahead of their earnings announcements tomorrow. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30 to Y3,230 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost Y40 to Y1,990. The likely resumption of the deadlocked US-Japan bilateral trade talks brought investors' attention back to the automobile sector, which is one of the central issues on trade between the two countries. Nissan Motor added Y27 to Y884 and Toyota Motor gained Y60 to Y2,090. Higher commodity prices pushed up non-ferrous metals, shipping and shipbuilders. Sumitomo Metal Mining rose Y16 to Y944, Navix Line by Y11 to Y379 and Hitachi Zosen by Y3 to Y563. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 91.90 to 22,711.49 in volume of 27.2m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y190 to Y6,310 on weak earnings figures released on Monday. Roundup Pacific Rim markets were in subdued mood yesterday.

SINGAPORE was dragged lower by big falls in index stocks although trading was mostly subdued. The Straits Times Industrials index closed 36.45 or 1.6 per cent lower at 2,302.86. Yeo Hiap Seng, however, rose 8 cents to SDollars 4.08 in volume of 5.7m as speculators continued to buy amid anticipation of a takeover by Ng Teng Fong. KUALA LUMPUR was broadly lower as investors worried about the overnight fall on Wall Street and domestic inflation. The composite index closed 11.84 or 1.2 per cent lower at 987.26 although activity was restricted ahead of a national holiday today. TAIPEI saw late selling after earlier attempts at a technical rebound failed, and the weighted index ended 48.56 lower at 5,769.12, off a high of 5,835. Turnover was a slow TDollars 32.67bn. The weak performance was attributed to local reports that the Taiwan exchange planned to downgrade eight shares to the second category from the first because of their poor profit performance in the past four years. All eight shares fell, with Taiwan Paper and Oriental Union limit down to TDollars 28.70 and TDollars 30.10, respectively. SYDNEY lost some ground in afternoon trade as profit-takers emerged, but still ended higher on the day in response to firmer gold and resource prices.

			<p>CSO     [Text] Jakarta, KOMPAS--ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces]  continues to hold firmly to its principle that it will not  interfere with the internal affairs of any sociopolitical  organization. Therefore, the report is not true that ABRI  supports persons were nominated for the chairmanship of certain  sociopolitical organizations, including the Development Unity  Party [PPP].    Lieutenant General R. Hartono, chief of the ABRI  Sociopolitical Staff, said this to reporters Friday, 22 April,  in Jakarta. He further stressed that in the PPP congress to be  held in the middle of this year, ABRI will not give any special  support to specific candidates promoted for the general  chairmanship. "ABRI will merely encourage that the congress be  conducted on the basis of norms that apply to the nation and the  organization concerned," he said.    When asked about reports that B.J. Habibie (minister of  research and technology) supports KH [Islamic Scholar and  Pilgrim] Yusuf Hasyim for the August congress of the PPP.  Hartono quickly replied, "I have never heard that."    He acknowledged the possibility that NU (Nahdatul Ulama  [Muslim Scholars League]) members may personally channel their  aspirations through the PPP in the next election. Thus, it is  understandable if there are now calls for candidacies of NU  people for the PPP chairmanship in the next term. What is clear,  he said, is that ABRI will not choose sides.    When asked his opinion on the leadership of PPP General  Chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum, the three-star general  commented, "All right."  <H5>  Continues To Have No Part in Politics </H5>   On a separate occasion on Thursday, 21 April, Abdurrahman  Wahid, general chairman of the NU PB [Executive Council]  declared that the NU's position continues unchanged, namely that  it will not take part in politics and will not be bound to any  sociopolitical organization. If the recent reports that "NU  people" are prepared to seek PPP leadership are true, they refer  to personal positions and rights, which have no connection with  the NU as an organization.    Commenting on the meeting of about 50 NU politicians who  gathered at TMII [Beautiful Indonesia Minipark] last week and  agreed on leadership of the PPP, Gus Dur [nickname of  Abdurrahman Wahid] said, "The meeting needs no response from the  NU. Let it be. They were acting personally, were they not? There  are NU people in personal capacities in all three sociopolitical  organizations," he said.    Gus Dur strongly objected when he was asked about the  impression among some people that a number of NU politicians are  "returning" to the PPP because of not having received any place  in GOLKAR [Functional Group] or the PDI [Indonesian Democratic  Party]. "Who said they (i.e., those who held the meeting at  TMII) are the NU? They were all PPP, not NU. Any NU manager (KH  Yusuf Hasyim) present, was there in his personal capacity. Those  who want to plunge into sociopolitical organizations in an  organizational way are prohibited from using the name of the  NU," he declared.    When asked whether he personally supports an NU member for  PPP leadership, Gus Dur replied, "There is no need to give  support. If they want to perform, they should do so--not only in  the PPP, but in GOLKAR and the PDI, too."    On a different occasion, Ali Masykur Musa, general chairman  of the PB of the Indonesian Islamic Student Movement (PMII),  said there would be nothing wrong and it would not violate the  1926 Policy if the NU were to return to politics. "Is not one of  the points of the policy the promotion of political maturity in  the Islamic community?" Ali asked. The public demand that the NU  return to politics, he continued, is an expression of public  political maturity and is "synchronous" with the NU.</p>

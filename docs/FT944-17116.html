			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Iraqi moves unnerve Israelis Uneasiness in Israel over the latest developments in Iraq and Kuwait left the Tel Aviv equity market's blue chip Mishtanim index down 3.68, or 2 per cent yesterday at 182.58. Turnover stayed low at Shk137m, Shk10m higher than last Thursday's figure. In Kuwait itself, brokers sold shares on Saturday on news of Iraqi troop movements north of the border, but volume remained slim and the index fell by just 11 points, or 1.1 per cent to 956. Here, turnover was 2.7m dinars against 1.3m dinars last Wednesday. The reaction was similar in Jordan where the Amman general price index fell 1.47, or 1 per cent to 144.36. In Morocco, meanwhile, geographically far removed from the Iraq/Kuwait border, brokers on Saturday were complaining mainly about a lack of liquidity in the market.</p>

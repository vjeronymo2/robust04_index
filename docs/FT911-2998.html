			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21): A simple but impertinent way into blue-chips with the Woolwich - Unit Trusts WOOLWICH Building Society attempted in January to simplify the world of unit trusts with the launch of its Stockmarket fund. Investors are able to buy and sell units at their local building society branches, with the help of a plastic card, which can also be used to get an update on the value of their holdings. Contract notes are being issued, but no unit certificates. There is only one fund on offer, which will invest largely in UK blue chips and will be managed by Mercury Asset Management. There is a minimum investment of Pounds 500, or monthly savings of Pounds 25. In addition, a special account has been established, where only the interest is invested in the fund. So far, over Pounds 10m has been raised and the Woolwich says it is 'on target' for 50,000 account holders in the first year. The majority of accounts opened have been personal equity plans, and there is a a high proportion of regular savings plans. However, after all the effort that was involved in establishing the fund, it was a pity that the Woolwich did not eliminate one obvious drawback. Savers in the Woolwich Prime Gold account, the main savings account, might imagine that they can simply transfer a monthly payment from their savings into the new fund. But that is not possible. They can transfer money from their bank account, or they can invest a lump sum. Alternatively, they could open a Woolwich current account, transfer the money from the savings account to the current account, and then transfer again into the stock market fund. This last solution, however, means that savers have to fill in a current-account application form, which means answering a vast number of impertinent questions about their salaries and past employers. To endure so much questioning for the privilege of giving the Woolwich money seems well beyond the call of duty.</p>

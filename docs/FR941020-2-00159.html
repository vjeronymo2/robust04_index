The factor used to adjust the injured person's remaining life-years is called the Functional Capacity Index. It combines decrements in each of ten dimensions of functioning into a whole body score. This notice announces the completion of the initial phase of the development, the availability of a final report on this initial phase of the development, and the current plans for further development. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen Luchter, Office of Plans and Policy, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 7th St. SW., Washington, DC 20590.

Work on this project has continued and a final report is now available on the initial phase of the development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its present state of development, the Index is applicable to previously healthy adults for their condition one year post-injury. For each injury to the head, face, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvic contents, spine, upper extremity, and lower extremity body regions listed in the Abbreviated Injury Scale published by the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, an expert panel has determined the appropriate level of each of the ten attributes. In addition, relative weights for each attribute/severity level combination have been developed based on the value judgments of a diverse set of sub-populations, and an algorithm for combining these into a whole body score has been developed. This results in a whole body numerical index for each of the injuries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A clinical evaluation of the index in order to establish validity and reliability will begin in FY 1995 (59 FR 36829&hyph;36832). Current plans, subject to revision as the program progresses and future budget allocations become available, include development of a separate index for pediatric injuries, as the attributes of normal healthy children are not described by the present definitions and development of a separate index for geriatric injuries, as the same level of trauma has a greater effect on older people and there is some evidence that the value judgments of the effect of reduced capacity are different for older people. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: Pop 'Establishment' left out in the cold - The Mercury Prize is likely to raise some hackles in the music industry What would we do without arts prizes? The Turner gets the conceptualists and the painters at each other's throats and the Booker sets post-modernists against readers. And now the Mercury Prize for the British pop album of the year is shaping up nicely to make many music people very cross. This is the third year in which ten albums have been short listed by 'experts' to compete for Pounds 25,000 - and a barrage of promotional opportunities. Inevitably the award goes to a band that hardly needs it - last year Suede generously gave the money away, although, like the 1992 winner Primal Scream, it probably expected a bigger career boost from the prize than actually happened. This year's ten albums suggest the careful mix and match of a finely balanced committee. There is a representative from most of the myriad faces of pop - except one. There is no room for the Establishment. Albums by the Rolling Stones, Elvis Costello and Kate Bush made the final 20, and then stalled. Pink Floyd failed to get even that far. The Mercury is obviously going in for a bit of proselytising, for the shock of the new, but in the most balanced way. So what is on offer? The only big name listed is Paul Weller who, with Wild Wood, has contributed the whimsical hippy album. This is what happens to abrasive young punkers when the pop business gets to them, especially in the wallet. The lyrics go nowhere, slowly, and the melodies come packaged from some Californian dream factory. What a contrast this is to the punk album on the list, from the Ulster band Therapy. Troublegum hits you like a sledgehammer, and does not loosen its grip through a welter of songs which are almost a parody of life seen from the gutter. So much youthful angst, so much raw energy and power - it is as stimulating as Weller is soporific. The inevitable black soul entry this year is Shara Nelson with What Silence Knows. She has more genuine emotion than last year's representative of this form, Dina Carroll, and seems equally happy with the heart-torn ballad and the old fashioned disco whirl. This is much easier listening that the pseudo-classical contestant, Michael Nyman's The Piano Concerto which shares the CD with TGV, his pean to the French express train. Nyman takes a tiny little tune and adds layer after layer of sound, breaking the back of the simple melody. The Piano Concerto was originally the soundtrack of Jane Campion's movie The Piano and has that unneccessary, background, feel to it. There must be an album to keep the largest sector of the pop buying public, young girls, happy, and naturally Take That's Everything Changes makes the top ten. Gary Barlow writes some very infectious songs: indeed the band is much better than its hunk poster image, and if Take That are very clever they could avoid the inevitable three year life span that dogs pretty boy bands and become a serious music making machine. Old rockers will like Ian McNabb's Head Like a Rock, which keeps the Bruce Springsteen tradition alive. Little surprise that it was recorded in LA with Neil Young's backing band, Crazy Horse. With its crashing chords and harmonious melodies, this will restore the faith of jaded 30 year olds in the redemptive power of pop. Naturally there has to be a 'British' pop album and what better than Blur's Parklife. This is how todays youth likes to see itself: urban, street wise, funky, and basically light hearted. There is something of Madness, something of Squeeze in this generous hotchpotch of 16 songs. It is slightly too sharp for its own naivety, but anyone wanting a musical commentary on Major's Britain could hardly do better. When the young are not being cheeky they are dancing, and the three dance albums included once again neatly cover the musical range. His'n'hers by Pulp is what might happen at a suburban diso when filtered through the ears of an imaginative spectator; Music for the Jilted Generation by The Prodigy is hard core techno rave, pretty unrelieved, insistent, body jerking, stuff; and M-People's Elegant Slumming is the type of disco music loved both by inveterate clubbers and the Christmas office party crowd. To build up more excitement before the announcement on September 13, the organisers of the Mercury Prize have persuaded William Hill to give odds on the contestants. Blur is favourite at 2-1, with Take That at 7-2. My choice would be M-People (5-1), not because it is likely to win  - it is too light heartedly predictable to carry weight with the judges - but because it has all the virtues of good pop: immediate accessibility, a wonderful beat, and insidiously memorable melodies. You recognise such hit singles from it as 'One Night in Heaven' and 'Moving on Up' from their opening bars because they are the songs that are played in the boutiques, the hairdressers, the sounds of the age. The Mercury Prize helps to give the chaotic pop world some shape and substance but it still seems to skim the surface of the art form. No regrets at the failure of dreary, one dimensional, rappers to make the list, but why no jazz, currently enjoying yet another revival; or big band blues; or country? Still the sampler, which includes a track from each album, should be out in the next two weeks, and gives an instant run-down on the current state of British pop.</p>

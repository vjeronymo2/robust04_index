			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 17 (ATA) -- The "Mother Teresa"  humanitarian association of Pristina refuted Serbian claims that  "Arms have been dispatched" to its address. The deputy chairman  of this association, Jak Mita, stated that "No such shipments  have been sent to us as Serbian television and the newspaper  POLITIKA say to our address."    He stressed that "The donator they refer to is unknown to us  and that there are no facts in border points of Hungary proving  these shipments as the Serbian mass media reports," Mr. Mita  said adding that even the ecumenic community has refuted this  accusation. It has stressed that the community has received 30  tonnes of clothes which can be testified to by Engel Ferdi, the  transporter of the contingent.    Serbian information sources said recently that Novi Sad  customs officials found a truck, during a check of 3 trucks with  humanitarian aid, "Filled with weapons and military equipment  weighing up to 10 tonnes." According to the Serbian mass media,  which refer to customs officials, the trucks had been sent by  the ecumenic humanitarian service of Hungary for the "Mother  Teresa" humanitarian organization of the Albanians in Pristina.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Income tax query I wonder if you would be good enough to set out for me, step by step, the income tax calculation for 1993/94 assuming one has a salary of Pounds 20,000, investment (equities gross) of Pounds 10,000, a gross income of Pounds 30,000, and one is under 65 and married. It is the treatment of the married couples allowance at 20 per cent which has perplexed me. I might add that I phoned the Revenue Enquiry Room for an explanation but they 'regretted that they had no instructions yet'. The restriction of relief on the married couple's allowance to 20 per cent does not come into effect until 1994-95; it will be restricted to 15 per cent for 1995-96. Your 1994-95 tax liability on the suggested figures would be as follows:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Schedule E  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     Pounds  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 3,445 personal allowance Pounds 3,000 at 20 per cent                         600 Pounds 13,555 at 25 per cent                      3,388.75 Pounds 20,000                                     3,988.75  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Schedule F  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 7,145 at 20 per cent                       1,429 Pounds 2,855 at 40 per cent                       1,142 Pounds 10,000                                     6,559.75 Less: relief on Pounds 1,720 at 20 per cent                                      344.00 Income tax chargeable                             6,225.75 Less: credit on Pounds 8,000 at 25 per cent                                    2,000 Income tax actually payable                                           4,225.75 Less: PAYE tax under code 482                                          3,644.75* Tax payable on December 1, 1995                                    571.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * In fact, the PAYE tax deductible under code 482 would be slightly less than Pounds 3,644.75: Personal allowance                                3,445 Married couple's allowance: 80 per cent of 1,720                              1,376 Rounding-up                                           8 Allowances given by code 482                                          4,829  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PAYE tax: Pounds 4,829 tax free pay Pounds 3,000 at 20 per cent                         600 Pounds 12,171 at 25 per cent                      3,042.75  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 20,000                                     3,642.75  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns.

			<p>920605 FT  05 JUN 92 / Gaza turned into 'huge prison' THE ARAB League yesterday accused Israel of having turned the impoverished Gaza Strip into a 'huge prison' by sealing the narrow coastal territory for 11 days and cutting off its 750,000 Palestinian inhabitants from access to work in Israel, their main source of income. The closure, imposed after a Gazan had stabbed a 15-year-old Israeli schoolgirl to death in a Tel Aviv suburb, has become bound up in the campaign for the Israeli general election on June 23. The ruling Likud party of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, is afraid another stabbing might follow the end of the closure, provoke a repeat of angry anti-Arab riots and draw criticism from the opposition Labour party. Yesterday, a Palestinian was shot dead in Bethlehem, in the West Bank, after stabbing and wounding an Israeli policeman.</p>

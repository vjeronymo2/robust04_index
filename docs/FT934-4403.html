			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: No news is bad news at Saudi bank - Mark Nicholson, recently in Jeddah, discovers the good figures but not the bad at NCB The first gesture of Mr Abdulhadi Shayif, deputy general manager of National Commercial Bank (NCB), as he greets visitors in his lofty office overlooking Jeddah is to hand over a slim 12-page brochure containing the bank's results for 1991 and 1992. 'It makes a nice change to be able to give people something,' he says, with open delight. His delight is not surprising. The figures are the first that Saudi Arabia's biggest and oldest bank has published in three years, and the first passed unqualified by the bank's auditors since 1987. They cap, Mr Shayif says, the end of a troubled few years for a bank which was a foundation stone of the kingdom's banking system and is probably still its best connected financial institution - meaning closest to the ruling al-Saud family. 'The abnormal period is over,' he says. The figures show the bank returned a profit in 1992 of SR427m (Dollars 114m), up 168 per cent on 1991. No results, however, have been released for 1990. Says Mr Shayif: 'They were audited but are not available for publication.' Asked if they show a loss, he replies 'no comment'. NCB's missing 1990 results are a clue to the damage done by six years of internal disputes over non-performing loans - the cause of the auditors' qualification and last year's suspension of the bank's credit rating by Cyprus-based ratings agency Capital Intelligence. There was also last year's indictment in New York of Mr Khalid bin Mahfouz, then chief operating officer, on fraud charges connected with the BCCI scandal. Mr bin Mahfouz has since resigned, and the BCCI affair is dismissed by Mr Shayif as 'a separate and personal issue - the damage is behind us and the confidence of international banks is back'. Nevertheless, that affair, along with the non-appearance of results, contributed to NCB's closure of its New York, London and Cayman Islands branches - in the former cases under pressure from the US and British authorities - which stripped Dollars 2.5bn from its total customer deposits. These closures, says Mr Shayif, are the reason deposits have fallen to Dollars 13bn from Dollars 17bn between 1989 and 1992. The bank's balance sheet has shrunk to Dollars 17bn at the end of 1992 from Dollars 23bn in 1989, while its market share of commercial banking assets in Saudi Arabia has slipped to 22 per cent from 34 per cent. The bank's notorious and mysterious bad debts are also a thing of the past, Mr Shayif says. 'You could now classify our portfolio as normal, and the provisions are quite adequate,' he says. However, the provisions shown in the 1992 figures merely hint at the debt problem bank analysts believe NCB has now put behind it. These totalled SR470m in 1991 and SR81m in 1992. But according to analysts at Capital Intelligence, which last month reinstated NCB's credit rating, loan loss provisions taken by the bank since 1980 - including CI's own estimate of provisions or write-offs made in 1990  -probably amount to nearer SR10bn, suggesting problem loans were between 25 and 30 per cent of its entire portfolio. Mr Shayif has no comment on the debts - which have been shrouded in speculation for years and attributed to what analysts wryly describe as 'very senior Saudis'. In 1991, the accounts also show that the bank allocated the full balance of its other capital reserves, a total of SR910m, as provisions against the 'decline in value of investments', which CI takes to mean cover for about 70 per cent of the bank's residual holding of BCCI convertible bonds. But the longest awaited step in restoring the bank to a sounder footing was the decision of the bin Mahfouz family to recapitalise NCB with an injection of SR6bn - a considerably greater capitalisation than anyone in the Saudi banking industry had expected and one which makes the bank the biggest in the kingdom, not only by assets but also capital base. The move brings NCB's BIS formula risk/asset ratio to a comfortable 13.76 per cent, according to CI. For the present, the recapitalisation has not altered the shareholding structure of Saudi Arabia's only privately-owned bank, which is 90.5 per cent in the hands of the bin Mahfouz family with most of the remainder held by members of the Kaki family. Mr Shayif says the injection has taken the form of bridging finance, until the two shareholding families determine how and if the shareholding is to be altered. He adds that the move is also likely to defer for the foreseeable future any plans to float part or all the bank's shares on the Saudi stock market - an option which had been under consideration last year. Mr Shayif denies that NCB's internal problems caused it to take its eye off its place in an increasingly sophisticated, profitable and competitive Saudi banking market, where consolidated profits in the sector rose by 29 per cent in 1992 and are about 25 per cent up for the first three quarters of 1993. But while the bank claims a lead in the number and efficiency of its ATMs, an edge in the breadth of its local coverage and market leadership in unit fund management in the kingdom, NCB has undeniably lost market share to nimbler rivals - notably such joint-venture banks as Saudi British Bank, Saudi American Bank and Saudi Hollandi Bank. But the bank hopes to address this with the appointment earlier this year of Mr Michael Callen, former head of Citibank's global finance operations, as special adviser on a management restructuring. Costs are being cut, staff reduced by 10 per cent to 6,900 by the year end and a programme of rationalisation and modernisation is under way. If all of this has the desired results, at least this time they will be publicly visible.</p>

Hartford Life is a stock life insurance company originally incorporated under Massachusetts law and redomiciled in Connecticut. On June 2, 1986, the board of directors of Hartford Life established the Account. The Account serves as the funding medium for the Contracts and consists of several subaccounts (the ``Subaccounts''), each of which invests in certain underlying registered investment companies. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In December of 1993, a registration statement on Form N&hyph;4 was filed with the Commission to register the Contracts. As of the date of this notice, the registration statement had not yet been declared effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. HESCO, the principal underwriter for the Contracts, is registered with the Commission as a broker dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Owners of the Contracts may allocate purchase payments to one or more of the Subaccounts, to the fixed account (the ``Fixed Account'') which is part of the general account of Hartford Life, or to a combination of the Subaccounts and the Fixed Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A Contract owner may select an annuity option on either a fixed or variable basis and may select one of four annuity options: Life annuity; life annuity with 120, 180 or 240 monthly payments certain; joint and last survivor annuity; and payments for a designated period. Each annuity option provides for a series of annuity payments beginning on the annuity commencement date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. If upon death, prior to the annuity commencement date, the annuitant or the Contract owner, as applicable, had not attained his or her 90th birthday, the beneficiary of the Contract will receive the greatest of: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The Contract value determined as of the day written proof of death of such person is received by Hartford Life; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) 100% of the total purchase payments made to such Contract; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The maximum anniversary value <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  increased by the dollar amount of any purchase payments made and reduced by the dollar amount of any partial surrenders (commonly referred to as a ``stepped up'' death benefit). If the deceased, the annuitant or the Contract owner, as applicable, had attained age 90, the death benefit will equal the Contract value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The maximum anniversary value is equal to the greatest anniversary value attained as follows. The anniversary value is equal to the Contract value on a Contract anniversary (anniversary of the effective date of the Contract), increased by the dollar amount of any premium payments made since that anniversary and reduced by the dollar amount of any partial surrenders since that anniversary. As of the date of death, Hartford Life will calculate an anniversary value for each Contract anniversary prior to the deceased's attained age 81. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

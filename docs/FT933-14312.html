			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Names reverse Norman conquest FEUDAL TITLES, some of which date back to the Domesday Book, have become the latest assets to be auctioned off by distressed Lloyd's Names to help them stave off financial difficulties. 'It's like the Norman conquest only in reverse,' said Mr Robert Smith, of London-based Manorial Auctioneers, who specialises in the area. 'The Anglo-Saxons are getting their own back.' Mr Smith said his firm has sold more than 200 Norman titles in the first six months of the year. 'It's a very painless way of raising a bit of cash,' said Mr Smith, who added that at least 100 Names - the individuals whose assets support the insurance market - have sold their titles this year alone. 'They are trying to stave off the evil day. A lot are bankrupt and don't know it.' One Name who sold recently was the Earl of Carlisle, who raised Pounds 55,000 by selling his barony of Gilsland in Cumbria to an American. The titles are among more than 13,000 which date back to the Domesday Book. Titles like the Lordship of Aisby, in Lincolnshire, the Baron of Teerraghin, in County Sligo, and the head of the Fief of Craqueville, in Jersey, have long since lost their rights to large estates, although they sometimes have access to mineral rights. Even so, British and US businessmen are prepared to pay many thousands of pounds for the social cachet conferred on barons, earls, viscounts and marquesses. 'They become the most recent link in a chain of owners going back centuries and they like the feeling,' said Mr Smith. 'Some actively replace the old families in the local firmament.' Mr Smith is marketing 70 titles including the Lordship of Shrewsbury's Fee in Isleham, Cambridgeshire - a snip at Pounds 5,500 - and the Lordship of Bermondsey in London - a more expensive Pounds 35,000. The Barony of Eye in East Anglia is the costliest on offer at Pounds 85,000. These are useful sums for Names, who have been hit by cumulative losses of more than Pounds 5bn in the past three years. Names have also been contributing to a surge in the antiques market, with increased business at auction houses as heirlooms are sold. But few Names have been forced to sell their properties. Mr Patrick Ramsay, of estate agent, Knight Frank and Rutley, which specialises in country house sales, said that relatively few country houses had come on to the market.</p>

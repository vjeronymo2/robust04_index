			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Right winger wants role for army 'My name is Eneas' is a strange political slogan, but Eneas Carneiro is no conventional politician. Seen by most Brazilians as an unbalanced and slightly ridiculous rightwinger with a short temper, 'Eneas' - as he is known - attracted 300,000 votes in the 1989 election. This time he will pass the 1m mark, according to opinion polls which give him 4 per cent of the vote. His Party for the Re-edification of National Order (Prona) is campaigning for a strong and nationalist Brazil, a clampdown on corruption and the purging of all sex from prime-time TV. Eneas, a former army heart specialist, is said to favour a leading role for Brazil's military. When the Financial Times requested an interview to verify these reports, an adviser said: 'We don't need the press, especially not the foreign press.' Eneas is a Brazilian cross between Ross Perot and Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Prona seems to have support from a small cross-section of Brazilians, some of them profoundly disillusioned with existing politicians and the country's corruption scandals, others who hark back to a 'golden age' of stability under the military from 1964 to 1985. At the recent launch of the party's programme in Sao Paulo, most of the several hundred supporters who attended were well-dressed, young to middle-aged apparently conventional people who queued quietly to meet their leader.</p>

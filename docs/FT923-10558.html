			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Councils meet housing standards LOCAL authorities are meeting obligations imposed by the Citizen's Charter in the maintenance of their housing stock, but need to include tenants more in housing management processes, according to the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog. In a report on housing services, the commission says 95 per cent of urgent repairs were carried out within target times - often as little as a few hours - set by the councils surveyed. Most tenants were offered choices when significant work was carried out on their homes. Tenants were represented on estate management bodies in only 13 per cent of the district councils surveyed.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Not the credit crunch There are times when the banking system appears to operate on a set of rules of its own. The present reporting season, in which the leading British clearing banks reveal their half-yearly results, provides a good example. Here is a case of an industry rejoicing in the party after the hangover - an inversion of the normal sequence that may well surprise those who witnessed the credit binge of the 1980s, and the subsequent debt-induced recession. Profits are soaring when the economic recovery has yet to impress itself on many of the banks' own customers. What, it might be asked, is afoot? The simple answer is that, in a highly cyclical business where the accountancy profession captures only very imprecisely the trend of real profitability, the upsurge in profit is heavily driven by a fall in the provisions for bad debts. The more striking feature of the figures from both Lloyds and National Westminster was, in fact, the weakness of loans and advances, more than three years after the trough of the recession. They tell us that the financing of this recovery is different. In effect, the corporate sector has been giving the banks an unprecedentedly wide berth. While companies normally reduce their debts during a recession, the rigour and duration of the process has been quite exceptional this time. As Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research recently pointed out, companies have now paid down debt in 10 of the last 12 quarters. Yet there has never been more than a couple of quarters of debt repayment in previous cyclical downturns. Exceptionally strong Notwithstanding the repayment of debt, which amounted to a net Pounds 11.4bn to the banks in 1993 alone, industry's external funding requirement has been rising. It has been met by the financial markets. The result is that the corporate sector's balance sheet is not only looking very healthy; cash flow and profits are exceptionally strong. As the latest Bank of England Bulletin indicates, the pre-tax return on capital, excluding the North Sea sector, recovered to 8.3 per cent in 1993 - almost twice as high as at the comparable stage of the last recovery in the early 1980s. Both banks and industry are thus awash with cash. The question is how they will deploy it. And in both cases there are difficulties in arriving at a satisfactory answer. Where industry is concerned, the obvious outlet is fixed capital investment. So far, investment has contributed less to the growth of gross domestic product in the present recovery than in the two previous ones. Last year it grew by only 1.7 per cent compared with 2.4 per cent in the comparable year of 1982. The Bank of England Bulletin speculates that companies have been paying down debt because they do not expect it to be eroded by inflation as in previous economic cycles. Yet this sits oddly with the fashionable concern that investment is inhibited by excessive target rates of return, which are said to reflect the authorities' failure to convince industrialists that their anti-inflationary credentials are trustworthy. Why is it that the industrialists have been so slow to climb off the fence? Financial housekeeping Part of the explanation is that where balance sheets have been overstretched, good financial housekeeping has to precede big investment outlays. Another reason is that investment has anyway remained higher this time, as a percentage of GDP, than in the recession of the early 1980s. In practice investment tends to follow changes in profitability and to respond to capacity constraints. More recent figures suggest that investment in the first quarter, like consumption, has in fact been rising at an annualised rate of more than 3 per cent; and the recent CBI Industrials Trends Survey pointed to increasing capacity utilisation. Industry may be coming up with the investment goods already. In the banks' case, the clearers that have reported to date have provided clues as to where the cash will go. Abbey National has cut its overdraft lending rates. Past experience suggests that if others follow this could reduce the overall profitability of retail banking to the benefit of the consumer. Lloyds is still expecting to see a reduction in capital and cash flow if its plans to acquire the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society go ahead. National Westminster, meantime, has declared that it will respond to price cutting by its rivals to maintain market share. There is no more effective way to reduce profits and cash flow than to engage in all-out competition in a mature industry. Yet the precise form of the competition is not easy to predict when the corporate sector appears to have little use for short-term variable rate bank money. It might just be that the banks' personal customers, who have been so heavily squeezed while the banks were restoring the hole in their balance sheets after the last binge, are due for a pleasant surprise: a modest but enjoyable party without a hangover. Stranger things have happened.</p>

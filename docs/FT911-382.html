			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Lift off with sweat and tears: The painful birth of the jet engine 50 years ago ON A cloudy wartime evening 50 years ago Britain's first jet-propelled aeroplane made its maiden flight from RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. It was a pretty little thing and it swooped around smoothly for 17 minutes before making a perfect landing. This event, of such vast significance to the the world, was witnessed by only a handful of people and filmed by a hand-held camera in monochrome. This was entirely in keeping with the story of how jet propulsion came into the world. It was the fruit of 13 years theoretical and experimental work by Sir Frank Whittle, on a pitifully small budget and in the face of much official scepticism and wrangling. The wonder is that Whittle did not chuck his hand in or that the strain, increased by the stress of war, did not cripple him. Perhaps it did in some ways. A small fraction of the recognition which he eventually gained would have done him a lot of good in the discouraging 1930s and 1940s. On Wednesday, 50 years to the day, he is due to stand, if his health permits upon that same airfield while an array of aircraft from the vast progeny of his invention will thunder past in salute. It is, however, a sad irony that the anniversary falls at a time when Rolls-Royce is in serious difficulties. The aero-engine maker, which used the original Whittle engine to develop its Wellend, Derwent, Nene and Dart power plants, announced only last Thursday a sweeping new round of job cuts because of the recession in the airline and defence markets. Wednesday's fly past will be followed by a ceremony at Cranwell College where, as an RAF flight cadet 64 years ago, Whittle wrote the thesis which fixed his destiny, Future Developments in Aircraft Design. He was born in Coventry in 1907, less than four years after the Wright brothers' first powered flight. His father was an inventive mechanic with a small engineering business who encouraged his son's mechanical abilities. Aviation was the novelty of the time and the young Frank read everything he could on the subject. When he was 15, he applied to join the RAF as an apprentice. Initially rejected because of his size - he was only five feet tall. After growing three inches in six months he was accepted as a Cranwell apprentice in 1923, graduating as a Pilot Officer from Cranwell College five years later. Whittle's thoughts on aviation's future grew from his conviction that high speeds and long range necessitated high-altitude flight in the less dense and therefore less resistant air. RAF fighters in those days had a top speed of about 150 mph. Whittle was thinking of 500 mph. The essential requirement was a propulsion system capable of operating in thin air. The speeds of propellers and reciprocating engines are limited by tip speeds and air intake. Whittle considered various possibilities including the newly developed gas turbine driving a fan. Then it occurred to him that a gas turbine could be developed to provide an exhaust jet which alone would be sufficient to propel an aircraft. He was encouraged by one of his flying instructors to place his ideas before the Air Ministry. The Ministry considered them impractical. It was biased against any form of gas turbine because materials which would withstand the stress and temperatures in an aircraft application did not then exist. That was in 1929. Although depressed by rejection, Whittle filed a provisional specification with the Post Office on January 16, 1930. The Air Ministry said it had no official interest in the patent. This gloomy year was brightened, however, by marriage to his Coventry fiancee. Despite rejection by officials and industrialists, the idea of jet propulsion increased its grip on Whittle. He continued his theoretical explorations using any relevant data he could find, such as supercharger performance in the Schneider Trophy aircraft. Meanwhile Whittle's RAF career prospered. In 1934 he was sent to Peterhouse, Cambridge, to read Mechanical Sciences. In 1935 his jet patent fell due for renewal. Astonishingly, neither he nor the Air Ministry felt it was worth the Pounds 5 fee, so the patent lapsed. Soon afterwards, tentative support began to gather behind Whittle's idea. A new company called Power Jets was formed in 1936 with authorised capital of Pounds 10,000. Whittle, still an undergraduate, was allowed by the Air Council to act as Honorary Chief Engineer provided that such work did not interfere with his RAF duties and that in any case it should not exceed six hours a week. The engine work and his studies combined to affect his health but nevertheless he graduated with a first in 1936 and continued as a post-graduate. Power Jets had neither workshop nor test premises. The engine of its design was sub-contracted to British Thompson-Houston, the industrial steam turbine maker, of Rugby. By April 1937 the first crude engine was ready for test. Good engineering practice required that novel components should be developed independently. However, money was so short that the engine had to be tested as a whole. Whittle himself was at the test controls for the first run. The engine, mounted on a truck in the turbine factory, was spun up. The flame in the combustion chamber was ignited and Whittle gradually opened the control valve. 'For a second or two the engine speed increased slowly,' he recalled. 'Then, with a rising shriek, like an air raid siren, the speed began to rise rapidly and large patches of red heat became visible on the combustion chamber casing. The engine was obviously out of control.' Everyone around ran for their lives. Whittle, badly frightened, immediately shut down. Speed control was to remain a problem for a long time. British Thompson-Houston asked Power Jets to take its project elsewhere, eventually offering part of a dilapidated and disused foundry a few miles away. For nearly four years that engine, altered as repairs and experimental work went along, was the only test piece. It was set up in ramshackle premises, the project was inadequately staffed and funded, and war was looming. Whittle was listed for special duties with Power Jets, a curious position in which from time to time he had to choose between the advancement of his more orthodox career as an RAF officer and his invention. Conflicts of all kinds arose between Power Jets, BTH and later, Rover, as well as with the Air Ministry. The Lutterworth outfit became known as 'the Cherry Orchard', after the play by Chekov in which preoccupied characters wander in and out, making seemingly irrelevant utterances. Whittle's habit of breaking off to take pot shots at rabbits with his .22 rifle doubtless helped foster the allusion. In 1938 the Air Ministry at last ordered an engine to power an aircraft. A year later, on the brink of war, it ordered a fast, single seat aircraft, the G28/39 Pioneer, in which to fit the engine from the Gloster Aircraft Company. Then designs for a twin jet fighter were put in hand. A second experimental engine was tested at Lutterworth, much to the pleasure of the cows in the adjacent field, which gathered in the warm jet stream. In keeping with many of the bizarre aspects of the project the first jet aeroplane, with its 29 foot wing span was assembled in a former 19th century horse emporium in the middle of fashionable Cheltenham, a location chosen because of the risk of an air raid on the main factory. The completed aircraft was taken to Brockworth and on April 7, 1941 it made 200-yard six-feet hops over the grass airfield, Whittle piloting some of the runs. Then it was fitted with the latest engine and taken to Cranwell which has a long runway, for light tests. Gloster's chief test pilot, Flight Lieutenant Gerry Sayer, made the first flights and was charmed by the aircraft's smoothness and by the lack of noise and vibration associated with propellers. It was about as fast as current Spitfires but it was very thirsty. 'It's the first time I've flown an aeroplane where you can actually see a fuel gauge moving,' said one pilot. Another took his eye off the gauge for too long and ran the aeroplane dry, then having to make a risky landing on a dead engine. The aeroplane was used to gather test data for the proposed twin-engined fighter. It was retired in 1944 and now hangs in the Science Museum. The Gloster Meteor fighter entered squadron service in 1944, the first jet aeroplane in the world to do so. Shortly afterwards a German equivalent also entered squadron service - the Germans had been working along similar lines and actually had a jet plane, the Heinkel 178, in the air 21 months before the Pioneer. Fortunately for Britain they failed to take full advantage of their lead.</p>

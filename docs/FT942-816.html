			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Swedish coalition narrows gap Sweden's right-centre government has narrowed the lead held by the opposition Social Democratic party in the race for the general election on September 18, but still trails by almost 10 percentage points, according to two new opinion polls. They gave Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, some encouragement that a return to economic growth this year would win voters back to his market reform policies despite record unemployment. A poll in the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet showed support for the four coalition parties rising to 40.8 per cent from 39.3 compared to a similar poll in May. Both polls showed Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party was now more popular than at the 1991 general election. However, the Social Democrats, under Mr Ingvar Carlsson, remain clear favourites to form the next government. Although the party slipped by 1.2 percentage points to 49.5 per cent in one poll, in the business daily Dagens Industri, it held steady at 50.4 per cent in the Svenska Dagbladet poll.</p>

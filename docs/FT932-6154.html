			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Jardine strengthens defences JARDINE Matheson's quest to insulate itself from possible interference by China after Hong Kong reverts to the mainland in 1997 took a bizarre turn yesterday. The company said the government of Bermuda had agreed to pass a law which would bring it under a statutory version of the London Takeover Code. Jardine, a Hong Kong-based trading group controlled by the Keswick family, moved its domicile to Bermuda in 1984 and has been given a legal status there by acts of the colony's legislature. The proposed changes would mean that Jardine is subject to the same regulatory framework as a company incorporated in the UK. The company has long feared that after 1997 it could have its property confiscated by administrative means, as happened in Shanghai after the communist takeover of China in 1949. It has recently been subject to attacks by the Chinese government for its alleged interference in Hong Kong politics. Nearly two years ago it unsuccessfully sought to avoid Hong Kong's takeover code by moving its primary stock exchange listing to London. Mr Greg Terry, an executive director, said yesterday's announcement had nothing to do with China's attacks on the company, but represented a further step in a process that had been under way for some time. The company would be subject to a more stringent regime of regulation, he said. It is understood that Jardine informed representatives of the Chinese government of the planned changes this week. In Bermuda, the statutory version of the Takeover Code, which comes into force in July next year, will apply only to Jardine and its subsidiaries. It will be administered by Bermuda's Monetary Authority, which will convene a panel in the event Jardine is subject to a takeover bid or makes one itself. Jardine said it continued to be bound by Hong Kong's takeover code, but that it intended to discuss the implications of the change in Bermudan law with regulatory authorities in Hong Kong. The Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, said: 'If Jardine were to seek exemption from our code, our overriding consideration would be the protection of investors and Hong Kong's credibility as an international financial centre.'</p>

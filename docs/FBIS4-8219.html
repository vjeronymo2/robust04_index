			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- All political parties  in Yugoslavia on Monday condemned the NATO air strikes against  Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde on Sunday, and set out  that the siding of the international community with one of the  warring sides could effect an escalation of the war not only in  the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina but also  beyond in the Balkans.    The ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) issued a  statement  warning that NATO forces had "directly militarily aided the  Muslim offensive and clearly declared support to the forces  which want war," while the United Nations, "by lending its name  to the aggressive act," had lost credibility for its peace  mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "By covering up and falsifying facts, concealing the Muslim  offensive, delivering arms to the Muslim Army, deciding to  engage Turkish troops, and now resorting to bombing, the United  Nations has shown to be merely an instrument in the hands of the  countries which want to achieve their interests and aspirations  in the Balkan region by prolonging the war," the SPS statement  set out.    The U.N. took the decision to engage NATO aircraft at the  request of the U.N. peace-keepers in the field, who have accused  the Bosnian Serbs of allegedly launching attacks on the civilian  population in Gorazde.    However, the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, which should have  been demilitarized last spring as one of the six U.N.-proclaimed  "safe areas," has been used by the Muslim side to mass around  10,000 troops and launch the offensive operations against  Bosnian Serb positions in the area.    The U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), itself, has said in  its  reports that the fighting in the area of Gorazde has been  provoked by the Muslims. Bosnian Serb military sources have  said that the Muslim offensive was launched with a view to  winning territories before the internationally brokered peace  talks resume.    The SPS said that a solution to the existing situation  called  for peace to be signed immediately so that conditions would be  created for further talks. The ruling SPS underscored that  talks were the "sole means of equitably and lastingly resolving  the conflict in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Serbia's Democratic Party (DS) termed the air strikes  against  Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde an "act of aggression."    The DS statement recalled that the U.N. Security Council  resolution proclaiming "safe areas" in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina called for the protection of the civilian  population and the full demilitarization of the respective areas.    The Gorazde "safe area" has, however, been turned into a  real  military base which is used by the Muslim army to prepare troops  and launch offensive operations, the DS statement said. It set  out that the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) took the necessary  measures to neutralize the dangers of the misuse of "safe areas"  and the bombing of Serb positions by NATO was, therefore,  totally unfounded.    The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) recalled that UNPROFOR  reports from the field had said that the fighting around Gorazde  had been provoked by the Muslim troops. The DSS set out that  "NATO, that is, those who are irresponsibly pulling its strings,  have shown with the attack on Serb positions that they have war  and not peace on their mind."    The Serbian Radical Party (SRS) qualified the NATO air  strikes on Bosnian Serb positions as "aggression against the  entire Serb people."    The SRS called for the Yugoslav parliament to hold an  emergency session "clearly and loudly to take a stand on the  aggression." It urged the federal government urgently to take a  decision to terminate Yugoslavia's membership in the United  Nations, close the Yugoslav U.N. mission in New York, expel all  United Nations personnel from Yugoslavia, and ban transit across  Yugoslavia to all U.N. missions.    The SRS called on the state leadership of the Bosnian Serb  Republic (R.S.) within the shortest period to expel UNPROFOR  troops and United Nations and European Union representatives  from its territory.    "We are convinced that the Serb army should counter with all  available means every attack from the air," the SRS set out.    The Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) said that it was "against  every violence, even if carried out at the orders of the U.N.  secretary-general." The SPO statement said that "peace is the  only alternative" and "everybody in Bosnia-Herzegovina has had  enough of death, devastation, and suffering."    The SPO, nevertheless, feels that the "United Nations is not  an enemy of the Serbs" and that the enemies are those who are  "pushing (Serbs) into a war with the whole world."    The New Democracy (ND) said that "the use of force leads to  a  further escalation of the war and draws the entire region  further away from the much needed equitable and lasting peace."    The ND maintains that "the siding of UNPROFOR with one side"  and the use of NATO aircraft were reckless moves.    The Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), the ruling party  in  the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, expressed deep concern and  indignation at the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serbs  positions around Gorazde, and said that the moves were a  violation of the basic United Nations commitments and principles.    The DPS statement said the NATO air strikes threatened to be  an introduction to the dangerous practice of the imposition of  solutions by means of force and the favouring of individual  interests without the acknowledgement and equal participation of  all warring sides.    We consider unacceptable and extremely dangerous the use of  external force against any side in the civil war, especially at  a moment when an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been  initiated with a strong diplomatic action on the part of the  international community and its most important representatives  -- the United States, Russia, and the European Union, the DPS  statement said.</p>

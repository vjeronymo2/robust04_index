			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Earnestly Studying Volume 3 of the Selected </F> Works of Deng Xiaoping column"; article by Xie Shijie,  secretary of the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee: "Promote  Development Through Opening Up"]    [Text] Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed: "Development is  the last word," "poverty does not mean socialism, nor does slow  development." For a large developing country like ours, only by  paying close attention to the central task of economic  construction and vigorously developing the productive forces can  we constantly improve our comprehensive national strength and  enhance the people's standard of living.    The domestic conditions are very good at the moment. The  international environment is favorable, and Sichuan is also  equipped with the conditions for more rapid development. We  should bring into full play the initiative of cadres and masses,  seize the opportunity, deepen reform, and widen the scope of  opening up, so that our province will have sustained, rapid, and  healthy [chi xu gao su jian kang 2170 4958 7559 6643 0256 1660]  economic development and scale a new height every several years.    In the last 15 years since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee, under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, Sichuan Province has registered a comparatively  good trend of development in its economy. In 1993, in  particular, encouraged by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's southern tour  talks and the instructions of 14th CPC National Congress, our  province made encouraging achievements in economic development.  The province's gross domestic product increased by 12.8  percent, the gross industrial output value at the township level  and above increased by 20.9 percent, and there was a good  agricultural harvest despite natural disasters, the increase in  the gross output value being 1.5 percent over the previous year.    We should soberly understand, however, that there is still a  large gap between our province and the developed coastal  provinces and cities, and that some total economic indices are  even lower than the country's average. Therefore the cadres and  masses in Sichuan have a strong desire for accelerating the  province's economic development. Their common understanding is:  If Sichuan does not seize the last several years in the 1990's  to speed up its economic development, the gap between the  province and the developed fraternal provinces and cities will  become wider and Sichuan will make a historic mistake.    Being aware of an opportunity is good, but a more  important point is to seize and use that opportunity to  formulate an economic development strategy with a scientific  attitude in light of the new situation and to take practical  measures to implement it on schedule.    The year 1994 is a crucial one for China to establish the  socialist market economy structure and is also an important year  for Sichuan to fulfill the second-step strategic target three  years ahead of schedule. We will comprehensively put into  effect the instructions of the 14th CPC National Congress and  the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee;  continue to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development; and strive to increase the province's GNP by 9.6  percent on the basis of achievements in 1993. We will increase  gross industrial and agricultural output value by 12.8 percent,  industrial output value by 15.6 percent, and agricultural output  value by 4 percent. Though this development task is arduous, it  corresponds with the province's actual conditions, and we have  full confidence in fulfilling it.    According to the dialectical materialist concept of  development, internal factors are the basis for the development  of things. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out repeatedly:  Things in China "must be fulfilled by relying on the efforts  the Chinese themselves," and "independence and self-reliance  were, are, and will be our standpoints." He stressed: "For a  large country like China, it cannot but rely on its own efforts  in construction. It must mainly rely on its own efforts; this  is called self-reliance." Sichuan is a large province, covering  an area of 570,000 square km, with a population of more than 100  million. In developing its economy, it must, as Comrade Deng  Xiaoping said, "rely mainly on its own efforts." Sichuan is  already equipped with some basic conditions for more rapid  economic development: It has huge markets -- high-potential  rural markets, in particular; it has tens of thousands of  hard-working and capable workers; it has a large number of  scientific research units and scientific-technological  personnel; it has rich natural resources; it has a large number  and a certain scale of large and medium-sized state enterprises,  as well as town and township enterprises; it has a corresponding  scale of basic facilities and is carrying out a number of  traffic, telecommunications, and energy projects; its productive  forces have greatly developed after some 10 years of reform and  opening up; and the province now is experiencing political  stability, nationality solidarity, and social progress. Taking  the country as a whole, the decision of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has provided us with  the basic framework for establishing the socialist market  economy structure; the party Central Committee and the State  Council have put the development of the western region and the  exploitation of its resources at the top of the agenda and have  instructed Sichuan to develop more rapidly and to actively  explore ways of reform and opening up in the western region.  All these serve as very favorable conditions for our sustained,  rapid, and healthy economic development.    The dialectical materialist concept of development suggests  that the internal factors of things are the basis of their  development, but no one thing is isolated from another.  External factors are the necessary conditions for the existence  and development of things. Their impact on the development of  things varies with specific conditions, and some external  factors even play an important role. Comrade Mao Zedong vividly  described such internal factors as "temperatures." Without the  proper temperature, eggs cannot develop into chickens.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed not only the importance of  "relying mainly on one's own efforts" in development, but also  the important role of external conditions. He has dialectically  integrated these two. He pointed out: "An important reason  China remained for so long in stagnation and backwardness was  that it closed itself to the outside world. Experience has  proved that carrying out economic construction behind closed  doors cannot succeed. China's development cannot be separated  from that of the world." He also stressed: "Without opening  up, there can be no development," and "we should be bolder in  reform and opening up" and "should carry out a large-scale  opening up."    Taking the world as a whole, none of the countries and  regions with economic achievements have failed to pay close  attention to utilizing external conditions. Reviewing China as  a whole, rapid economic development in Guangdong's Shenzhen,  Shanghai's Pudong, and Shandong's Yantai has proved the  correctness of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory.    In 1993, in accordance with the spirit of the 14th CPC  National Congress and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's southern tour  talks, we organized people to actively explore new ways to widen  the scope of opening up, and we achieved some new progress.  Through various channels and tiers, we carried out investment  and capital orientation activities, and successfully held  business talks in Hong Kong, Macao, Thailand, and the ROK on  investment and capital orientation. We held "Sichuan Festivals"  in Moscow and Sofia to advertise Sichuan's achievements in  reform, opening up, and economic construction, and to explore  the prospects for economic and technological cooperation. Last  year, agreements throughout the province on introducing foreign  capital amounted to more than $2 billion and newly established  foreign-invested enterprises totaled more than 1,900. Some  large international financial groups began to take an optimistic  view of Sichuan and expressed a very deep interest in some of  its important infrastructural projects, such as energy and  communications, and in exploiting its superior resources. Both  sides are negotiating on some major projects. Apart from this,  the province also made new headway in exploring export markets,  contracting for international projects, labor service  cooperation, establishing enterprises outside the borders, and  tourism.    Although Sichuan is equipped with the internal factors for  sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and has  explored some new ways, done some work, and made some progress  in understanding and utilizing external conditions, there are  still some restrictive factors, such as fund shortages and  backwardness in infrastructural construction. Whereas  accelerating infrastructural construction requires a large  amount of capital injection. We must seek a new idea to resolve  problems in Sichuan's economic development. In this way, we  will fulfill the target of the province's development strategy.    In accordance with the principle of integrating theory with  practice, in the fourth quarter of 1993 we repeatedly and  seriously studied Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping on seizing the opportunity, speeding up  development, and scaling a new height in the national economy  every several years; on China's development being inseparable  from that of the world, and opposing seclusion and isolation;  and on using the criteria of "three favorable's" in our  judgment, in light of the difficulties and key issues in our  province's economic development, thus further improving our  understanding of the importance of widening the scope of opening  up.    Sichuan is a large hinterland province with comparatively  backward economic development. Although we have done a certain  amount in opening up to the outside world, on the whole the  impetus of opening up is not strong enough. Export volume,  particularly foreign exchange earned through exports, does not  match the scope of the province's economic development, and  foreign investments and "three-capital" enterprises still lack  high-tech projects. What needs to be pointed out in particular  is that the country's opening up to the outside world is  developing more profoundly and in a broader field, but some  comrades still have obstacles in their minds which affect the  widening of the scope of opening up and they have not regarded  widening the scope of opening up as a strategic task in  invigorating Sichuan's economy. We feel deeply that  widening the scope of opening up has become a key point in  accelerating Sichuan's economic development. Sichuan's future  development rate and progress depend, to a certain degree, on  the progress and achievements in its opening up to the outside  world. Only large-scale opening up will bring about large-scale  development. Therefore, in planning Sichuan's economic work  for this year, we have placed widening the scope of opening up  and improving the actual results of opening up at the top of our  list of six key tasks.    Opening up to the outside world is also an inherent  requirement of the socialist market economy structure. The  market economy is, in itself, an open economy. Opening up to  the outside world will help widen the room for resource  distribution. Some countries and regions in the world are not  very rich in resources and their ability to accumulate capital  is not strong, either. However, they can seize the opportunity  of economic and capital internationalization to distribute their  resources around the world, creating rapid economic growth  rates. Looking at Sichuan, it is comparatively rich in some  resources, but these need exploitation and a way out. Sichuan  is short of resources in some aspects and needs to introduce  some from abroad. Thus, it is necessary for Sichuan to open up  to the outside world so as to absorb others' strong points to  make up for its weakness and to accelerate its economic  development.    Widening the scope of opening up is an effective way  to resolve the province's shortage of funds. Rapid  economic development is inseparable from a huge amount of  capital investment. This is a very simple theory. Sichuan is  weak in capital accumulation and it has long been faced with a  shortage of funds. China is a socialist country. We can neither  plunder nor loot to accumulate capital. If we carry out  development by means of slow accumulation, this could cause a  long delay and make us miss the opportunity, thus widening the  gap between Sichuan and other provinces. Widening the scope of  opening up will enable us to absorb and utilize foreign capital  to make up for our shortcomings. This is a common practice in  some newly emerging industrialized countries and regions during  their development period, and there are exploitable funds in  some countries and regions in the present-day world. We can  borrow others' money for our use, particularly for the  construction of basic industries and basic facilities. We  should be bold in this matter. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said:  "Basic industries are, simply speaking, the raw materials  industry, communications, energy, and so on; investments in  these fields should be strengthened and this should be carried  out for 10 or 20 years. This should be strengthened, even if we  become indebted. This is also a kind of opening up. In this  respect, we should be bolder and there will not be major faults."    Widening the scope of opening up is also an important  method for promoting scientific, technological, and social  development. Over the last decades, modern science and  technology have brought about new leaps in almost all fields,  rather than in just some individual fields or production skills,  nor have they given rise to progress or reform in only general  terms; they have and are producing a number of newly emerging  scientific and technological projects. Comrade Deng Xiaoping  pointed out: "There is a wide gap between our science and  technology and the advanced world level; our scientific and  technological strength is still weak and far from being able to  meet the needs of modernization." Therefore, we should continue  to widen the scope of opening up, absorb a large amount of  advanced technology, introduce talented people, and carry out  exchanges of scientific and technological achievements according  to our needs. In the meantime, we also should introduce advanced  managerial experience to promote our scientific and  technological progress.    Widening the scope of opening up will bring about rapid  economic development, which is the basic guarantee for social  stability. In this sense, widening the scope of opening up is,  in itself, fundamentally promoting social stability.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping profoundly pointed out: "If we do not  carry out modernization, our scientific and technological level  is not boosted, the social productive forces are not developed,  the country's actual strength is not increased, and the people's  material and cultural life does not improve, then our socialist  political and economic system cannot be consolidated and our  national security will not have a reliable guarantee." Sichuan  is a large province, with a population of more than 100 million.  Its situation is complicated, its economy is comparatively  undeveloped, and its people's material and cultural life needs  further improvement and enhancement. To preserve social  stability -- apart from distinguishing between two different  kinds of contradictions and handling them correctly, stabilizing  the overall situation, and properly handling relations in all  fields -- there is also a need to firmly widen the scope of  opening up, accelerate economic development, improve the  comprehensive strength, and enhance the people's material and  cultural life. In this way, the people will love and support  the socialist system more, and our society will become more  stabilized and developed.    Widening the scope of opening up does not in the least  mean neglecting agriculture or the peasants. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping pointed out: "Eighty percent of the Chinese population  are in the rural areas; whether or not China is stable depends  on whether or this 80 percent is stable. Cities, no matter how  beautifully they are built, will not stand without the rural  areas, which serve as a stable basis." Therefore, keeping  in mind the objectives of "stabilizing grain production,  increasing income, and moving toward moderate prosperity," we  will continue to take positive measures to speed up agricultural  and rural economic development so that the peasants will  increase their income and become better off. In accordance  with the requirement of establishing the socialist market  economy structure, we will continue to deepen reform, transform  enterprises' operational mechanism, form a modernized enterprise  system, and improve large and medium-sized state enterprises.    General Secretary Jiang Zemin recently pointed out: "Seizing  the opportunity, deepening reform, widening the scope of opening  up, promoting development, and maintaining stability [zhua zhu  ji yu shen hua gai ge kuo da kai fang cu jin fa zhan bao chi wen  ding 2119 0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245 2368 1129 7030 2397  0191 6651 4099 1455 0202 2170 4489 1353] are major aspects of  the work of the entire party." Jobs in all fields must be  subordinated to these major aspects, and Sichuan must make its  contributions in this respect. Proceeding from Sichuan's actual  conditions, we should make bold experiments and endeavors;  promote development through opening up; and under the leadership  of the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  core, work harder for the achievement of sustained, rapid, and  healthy national economic development and overall social  progress in Sichuan.</p>

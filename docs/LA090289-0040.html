			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANT OF THE WEEK: SPATHODEA CAMPANULATA: AFRICAN TULIP TREE  </P> <P> Tropical tree with brilliant, showy flowers  </P> <P> The African tulip tree is rare in Southern California, probably because it is  from tropical Africa (western Kenya and Uganda) and needs special conditions to  grow here. But it is slowly gaining popularity.  </P> <P> Some horticulturists say that much of the year, Spathodea campanulata is not  such a good-looking tree; that during the winter, when the leaves have fallen  off, its structure and twiggy limbs do not make an attractive picture. (In our  climate it is deciduous; in more tropical areas -- Hawaii, for instance -- it  is not.)  </P> <P> The big however, the plantsmen say, is that starting in September it bursts  into bloom with the most brilliant orange-red flowers tipped in yellow. Set in  clusters, they unfurl what looks like the clutched furry brown fingers of an  upturned hand. And the blooming keeps up for about two or three months.  </P> <P> The large, multiple, dark-green leaves are about 2 feet long, with four to  eight pairs of leaflets. There is an even rarer version that has yellow  flowers.  </P> <P> Possibly the oldest -- about 40 years old and 45 to 50 feet tall with equal  spread -- is growing at the San Diego Zoo, at Bear Canyon. In the West Los  Angeles area, there is another large one (about 35 feet) on Venice Boulevard.  </P> <P> A much smaller one (but just as spectacular) is on the UCLA campus at Circle  Drive and Tiverton Avenue. At the time the tree is in flower, red-yellow aloe  spikes bloom at its base, giving the illusion that orange-red paint is dripping  out of the tree and splashing on the ground.  </P> <P> Usually planted as a specimen tree, it must be protected from the wind and cold  -- it is sensitive to 28 degrees; the limbs are brittle. An older tree will  recover from frost damage but a younger one might not. It does best in coastal  areas (but not right on the ocean). It does not like heavy clay soil and needs  full sun to bloom. In the summer months it likes water.  </P> <P> Available at Coastal Zone Nursery in Malibu (24-inch boxes and up), Rancho  Soledad Nurseries in Rancho Santa Fe (15- and 35-gallon) and from your local  nursery if ordered from San Marcos Growers in Santa Barbara.

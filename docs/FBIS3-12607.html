			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Cutting Short the Bilateral Negotiations"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Arab parties' move of  cutting short the bilateral negotiations in Washington can be  understood as a natural response that has been dictated by the  repercussions of the horrendous Zionist massacre in Hebron and  by the need to pause for a while to reconsider this course.  After over two years of negotiations, the Israeli Government  did not budge from its obstinate stands. Rather, it persisted  in intransigence.    Had the Washington negotiations led to any tangible and  practical results, or had they heralded such an outcome in the  foreseeable future, then we could have said that the Arab  parties' move of cutting short the negotiations was a prize for  the Zionist extremists, who did not hesitate to publicly declare  their desire to abort this process. But since the negotiations  became an end in themselves, then cutting them short now or  suspending them in the future will not much change the general  standoff characterizing the talks.    It seems that the Arab parties were in need of such a  dreadful shock so that they might wake up from the dream of  running after the mirage of the Washington negotiations and from  the effects of Israel's unrestrained policy all this time. The  Arab parties need to pause a while to catch their breath and  reconsider this futile negotiatory course. They should use this  time to reunite their stands, coordinate their negotiating  policies more effectively, and work to achieve some of the basic  requirements for the return to Washington. This is in order to  achieve what is hoped from these negotiations, which have  consumed a great deal of time and effort and resulted in more  inter-Arab doubts and differences.</p>

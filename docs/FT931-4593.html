			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hambros Bank backs radio bid Hambros Bank is backing a management-led bid for RFM, the French radio network which went into receivership following the collapse of Crown Communications. The main contenders for the network are thought to be the management team led by Mr Andrew Manderstam, who has run RFM since Crown took over in 1989, and a consortium led by NRJ, a rival network. Under the plan, which would involve financing of some Pounds 12m and an immediate injection of Pounds 1m, Hambros European Ventures Development would take 26 per cent of the equity. A media subsidiary of La Caisse de Depots, the French government investment bank, would take 20 per cent. The magazine L'Evenement de Jeudi would also take 20 per cent and the staff would subscribe for a significant stake.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GLOBE PAYS FOR LIBELING DALTON  </P> <P> Timothy Dalton, star of the latest James Bond films, accepted libel damages at  a London court today from the publishers of a North American movie magazine  that suggested he was to be replaced in the role.  </P> <P> Dalton's lawyer, Philip Conway, said the reports in Globe magazine that the  actor could be dropped to save future James Bond films from financial disaster  were untrue and had distressed and embarrassed him.  </P> <P> Conway said the producers of the films were very satisfied with Dalton's  performances as Bond in "The Living Daylights" and "Licence to Kill" and with  the financial return from them.  </P> <P> The amount of damages paid by publishers Globe International was not disclosed.  Their lawyer, Timothy Atkinson, told the court they welcomed the opportunity of  setting the record straight.  </P></p>

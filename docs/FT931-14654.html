			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Motoring: A Jeep off the old block - Four-wheel drives are now also kings of the road THE MYTH is that four-wheel drives are bought to be driven over trackless country into the wild blue yonder. The reality is that most of them - in the civilised west, at any rate - are used on hard roads, just like normal cars. All of which makes the future look bright for the Jeep Cherokee estate cars, newly arrived in Britain with right-hand steering, because they are more car-like to drive than any rival. The Cherokee also makes most of its rivals look rather expensive. Prices start at Pounds 15,345 for a 2.5 litre, four-cylinder, 122 horsepower Cherokee Sport with a five-speed gearbox, and rise to Pounds 20,995 for the leather-seated and wood veneer-trimmed Cherokee Limited SE. This Jeep flagship has a four-litre, six-cylinder, 184 horsepower engine, automatic transmission, air conditioning, ABS brakes, power-adjusted front seats and heated door mirrors - to name only the most important of its goodies. After more than 600 miles (1,000 km) of on-road - mainly motorway - driving in several six-cylinder, two-pedal Cherokees, I do not think any recreational 4x4 can match it for a combination of performance and value. This four-door plus tailgate estate takes four adults in considerable comfort, five without too much squeezing. The large, internally-stowed spare wheel makes luggage space adequate, rather than generous. The Cherokee is nimble in traffic and as parkable as a family car because it has light, power-assisted steering and a commanding range of vision. It rides more like a family car than any of its on-off road rivals. Winding roads do not make it wriggle or roll and one feels very little thump from its big tyres. The beefy engine and smooth-shifting automatic take a Cherokee from 0-60 mph (0-96 kph) in 9.5 seconds, outpacing any on-off road 4x4, the Pounds 38,393 Range Rover LSE included. A top speed of 112 mph (180 kph) is claimed. High gearing (under 2,400 rpm at 70 mph/112 kph) makes the Cherokee a relaxed motorway cruiser. The transmission kicks down smoothly and eagerly for quick, safe overtaking. Engine, transmission and tyre noise are subdued; the main disturbance to radio listening on a motorway is wind roar. The plastic storage boxes between the seats and in the fascia need a lining to stop things put in them from rattling around. On the road, you can choose between rear-wheel or four-wheel drive at any speed. On a fast, 300 mile (483 km) drive in wet weather, I tried both. All-wheel drive on the return journey made the Cherokee feel even more sure-footed but it was no noisier and fuel consumption (19 mpg or 14.86 l/100 km) was unchanged. The four-litre Cherokee will pull a 2,500 kg trailer. Also in the UK's Chrysler Jeep dealerships this week are the first of a range of Wranglers. These have their roots in the Jeeps of world war two. They still have leaf springs all round, but power steering, a good heater and a hardtop with wind-up windows make them infinitely more civilised. Last summer, I spent two days bumping and banging seemingly unbreakable and unstoppable Wranglers over the sun-baked rocks of the Rubicon Trail in California. More recently, I found they went just as well in good old English mud. But even rugged Wranglers are more likely to be seen on British roads than slithering up and down hillsides or plunging into wader-deep water. Young drivers, dismayed by the cost of insuring hot hatchbacks, have been turning to what they perceive as sporty four-wheel drives. I could live happily with a Cherokee as a road car, though I would find a Wrangler too much of a hair shirt. But Chrysler Jeep UK believes the Wrangler (from Pounds 12,495 with a 2.5 litre engine and five-speed gearbox) will give Suzuki's Samurai and Vitara and the Daihatsu Sportrak a run for their money. Is Cherokee a challenger to Britain's Range Rover and Land Rover Discovery? The Range Rover I doubt, though its low price and lavish specification could seduce some Discovery buyers. Most of these, however, now choose the turbo-diesel, not the thirsty petrol V8 which is the only one with automatic transmission. The arrival of right-hand drive Jeeps will make Britain's recession-resistant 4x4 market expand further. Next year, the bigger, V8-engined Jeep Grand Cherokee will meet Range Rover head on. Also coming are diesel Cherokees, powered by an improved version of the Italian VM engine used until recently in Range Rovers. Before then, a 4x4 estate car jointly produced by Ford and Nissan in Spain will also have gone on sale in Britain.</p>

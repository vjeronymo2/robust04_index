			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National </F> Assembly, delivered at the closing ceremony of the third  ordinary session of the Third National Assembly in Vientiane on  14 March -- recorded]    [Text] Our meeting studied and endorsed the amendment to  the Law on the Promotion and Management of Foreign Investment in  the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] and the Labor Law.  This is another important part in the implementation of the  primary task of our legislative organization.    In studying and considering the two draft laws, members of  the National Assembly made impressive efforts to contribute  invaluable views to the improvement of the two laws by linking  them to realities. This clearly shows that our National  Assembly members always adhere to the party's stand and the  roles of the National Assembly. That is why they have again  firmly maintained a sense of mastery and held aloft a sense of  political responsibility.    Compared with the old laws, the two new laws that have been  amended and endorsed are more exemplary and conform to the  current reality. Almost all articles in the Law on the Promotion  and Management of Foreign Investment in the LPDR have been  amended to conform to our party and state policy of broadening  economic relations and cooperation with foreign couuntries. The  amended law will serve to attract, persuade, and create  confidence for friendly countries, international organizations,  and foreign investors to invest in Laos; to ensure the rights  and interests of investors as well as the interests and  sovereignty of our country; and to create favorable conditions  for foreign investors in our country. Some articles of the Labor  Law have also been amended and added to. This is to plug  certain loopholes, ensure and protect the legitimate rights and  interests of both employees and employers, thereby encouraging  them to fulfill their respective obligations, gradually making  its contents more universal and accommodating to the  requirements in the implementation of the party's policy of  restructuring and the state's socioeconomic plan, effectively  contributing to the development of human resources in our  country.    Our meeting studied, considered, and elected the chairman of  the Supreme People's Court and the people's general prosecutor.  Their election was carried out through secret ballot. This is  the first time National Assembly members have exercised their  voting rights through secret ballot to elect suitable persons to  two important judiciary organizations. The process reaffirms  the full exercise of democratic rights by National Assembly  members.    The meeting also studied and contributed views to the draft  internal regulations of the National Assembly. This shows that  we have transformed the contents of the National Assembly Law  into details to suit the reality of resolving assembly work.  This law serves to further consolidate and perfect the National  Assembly machinery and to create favorable conditions for  members to conduct their duties of representing the people and  safeguarding their rights and interests.    The meeting reviewed and assessed the strengths and  weaknesses and drew lessons from National Assembly activities  carried out since the convening of the second ordinary session.    It assessed that these activities have just begun and that  we  must continue to endeavor to overcome numerous obstacles with a  sense of revolutionary enthusiasm to fulfill all historical  obligations entrusted by the people.    Respected personages, the enactment, amendment, and  promulgation of a law is always important. But the most  important thing reflecting the effectiveness of the promulgated  law is its implementation and translation into reality. To  effectively implement a law, first of all, I would like to ask  the government to adopt appropriate measures to facilitate its  implementation. Meanwhile, National Assembly members also have  the duty to train, educate, and mobilize the people of all  strata to take part in the revolution.    Our meeting elected the chairman of the Supreme People's  Court and the people's general prosecutor. This is to further  consolidate and invigorate the two judiciary organizations in  implementing the Constitution and other laws. To achieve this,  we must continue assisting these organizations to carry out  their tasks to ensure justice in our society.    To put the successful results of this meeting into practice,  I call on all National Assembly members to consider again Party  Chairman Khamtai Siphandon's speech at the second ordinary  session of the Third National Assembly on the duties and  responsibilities of the National Assembly and its members.    To raise our political responsibility as representatives of  the rights and interests of the multiethnic people, let us  strive to overcome all obstacles and difficulties in  disseminating the successful results of this meeting among the  people in all regions, and mobilize them to translate the  resolution adopted at this meeting into reality. At the same  time, I call on all of you to begin drafting the substance of  certain laws which will be deliberated in the coming ordinary  session to ensure the quality of the laws enacted and amended,  thereby gradually perfecting our legal system. This is the  urgent central task which National Assembly members must fulfill  in the immediate future.    I call on all compatriots of all strata, ethnic groups, and  ages to further enhance the tradition of patriotism and a sense  of mastery, to unite in implementing the tasks of national  defense and reconstruction, and to translate into reality the  1993-94 socioeconomic development plan and the Constitution and  other laws.    I call on all party, state, and mass organizations as well  as  administrative organizations and services at all levels to  cooperate and to create favorable conditions for National  Assembly members to carry out their role as people's  representatives to fulfill the tasks entrusted by the party and  people.    On this auspicious occasion, on behalf of the National  Assembly, I would like to once again thank the party chairman,  all members of the Political Bureau, and advisers to the party  Central Committee for sacrificing your precious time to attend  this meeting.    I hereby officially declare the third ordinary session of  the  Third National Assembly closed.    Thank you.</p>

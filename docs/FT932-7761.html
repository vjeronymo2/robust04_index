			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fiat tightens grip on Italian market THE PURCHASE of the outstanding 51 per cent of Maserati for L75.8bn (Dollars 51.3m) has allowed Fiat, Italy's leading private company, to tighten its hold over the domestic car industry. Fiat bought 49 per cent of Modena-based Maserati, best known for its expensive sports saloons, in 1989. The acquisition included 51 per cent of Innocenti, the Maserati-owned maker of compact cars. The agreement to buy out the remaining shares in Maserati follows the illness earlier this year of Mr Alejandro De Tomaso, whose family controlled the company via the New York-listed De Tomaso Industries concern. Mr De Tomaso's continuing ill-health prompted the decision to sell out. Maserati made about 1,000 cars last year, well down on its pre-recession output of between 1,500 and 1,800 units a year. The company has been badly hit by the slowdown in sales and is believed to have suffered rising losses in 1992. Sales are divided almost equally between Italy and foreign markets, notably Germany, France and Switzerland. The seemingly high price for Maserati in view of its financial performance may be explained by the inclusion in the deal of the company's former Lambrate plant on the eastern fringe of Milan. Production at Lambrate ceased recently and Fiat is expected to redevelop the site as a big new shopping centre. Fiat said the acquisition would not trigger any change in Maserati's identity nor closer contacts with Ferrari, the prestige Fiat-owned sports car maker also located near Modena. Fiat's original investment in Maserati was expected to give it a new lease of life. but, despite some limited financing, the investment had few obvious benefits for Maserati. That may be explained by the fact that the stake was purchased in the same year as Fiat failed in its bid to take over Saab of Sweden and may have reflected a broader strategy of developing synergies between Fiat's Lancia marque and Saab and Maserati. By contrast, Fiat has had some success in developing Innocenti, which no longer produces cars, as an additional brand for vehicles from its foreign factories. Innocenti's Elba model is actually the station wagon version of Fiat's Uno model made in Brazil. GFT, the troubled Torinese clothing and textiles group, said talks on selling a substantial stake to Miroglio, another privately-owned clothing concern, had been broken off by mutual agreement. The two companies said negotiations between them and with outside partners had revealed 'considerable difference in the interpretation of and ways of looking at methods of operation in the market'.</p>

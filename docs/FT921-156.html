			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Tackling the decline at Taylor Woodrow: Tim Dickson on Peter Drew's departure from the UK construction group On the face of it, the retirement of a 64-year-old company chairman is an unexceptional piece of news. However, last week's announcement that Mr Peter Drew was stepping down from the big UK construction group Taylor Woodrow looks anything but routine. His departure, officially to pursue his alternative career as a watercolour painter, comes at the end of a turbulent period in Taylor Woodrow's long history. It was also embarrassingly close to next month's anxiously awaited 1991 results. Mr Drew's spell at the top coincided with probably the worst conditions in the contracting industry for 50 years, the collapse of UK commercial property prices, and a severe recession in the UK housing market. Pre-tax profits, which peaked at Pounds 117m in 1989, have almost disappeared with analysts' best hopes that last year will be just the right side of break even. The dividend is safe for the moment, but is likely to be cut next time. The share price, a star performer in the middle to late 1980s, has underperformed the market by 63 per cent and the construction and housebuilding sector by 34 per cent in the 2 1/4 years since Mr Drew took the reins. Last week, amid reports of boardroom acrimony, he paid the price. One important question for investors is how far the ills of Taylor Woodrow can be blamed on Mr Drew, and to what extent there is a deeper malaise within the company. The issue is relevant to whether his successor Mr Colin Parsons - head of Taylor Woodrow's successful Canadian subsidiary Monarch Development - will be able to restore the company's former blue chip status. In many ways Mr Drew was an unlikely company chairman. His love for the performing arts goes beyond the obligatory hospitality evening at Covent Garden, and, as his recent exhibition in London demonstrated, he is a talented painter and sculptor. He made his name in property by pioneering the development of St Katharine's Dock near the Tower of London, which gave him the standing to challenge for the Taylor Woodrow succession when Sir Frank Gibb's original replacement as chairman, Mr John Topping, decided on doctor's orders not to take on the task. Ironically, the board is thought to have turned first to Mr Parsons, but he was not yet ready to come back to the UK from Canada. Critics accuse Mr Drew of having been unpredictable, of lacking the necessary grasp of detail, and of having confused the stock market in his desire to take Taylor Woodrow in new strategic directions. In this context his ambitions in the leisure field were seen as most puzzling, particularly the purchase of 5 per cent in the unsuccessful Daybreak morning TV consortium. More serious, however, was the hostile purchase by Taylor Woodrow last June of a near 5 per cent stake in a struggling fellow housebuilder and contractor, Y J Lovell. Seen as the prelude to a possible bid, the move turned into a fiasco as Lovell shares collapsed on the back of unexpectedly large provisions. They are now languishing at 21p, against the 130p-135p per share Taylor is thought to have paid for its stake. 'This was the first clear sign for me that all was not well at Taylor Woodrow,' recalls Mr Malcolm Brown, buildings analyst at stockbroker James Capel. 'An experienced contractor does not make a hostile move on a competitor without knowing what it might be getting.' Mr Parsons, a 58-year-old chartered accountant, looks a safe pair of hands by contrast. Experienced in running a public company in Canada - outside shareholders own 40 per cent of Monarch - he can be expected to attack overheads and concentrate the group on its core housebuilding, property, wholesale trading and contracting activities (though there has been some speculation about the company's commitment to contracting in the US). There will be emphasis on the traditional Taylor Woodrow virtues of conservatism and financial prudence. The City, however, will not be easily convinced that a new chapter has begun: there is no obvious end to Taylor Woodrow's trading difficulties, in spite of the strength of its balance sheet (borrowing as a proportion of shareholders' funds was not thought to be more than 30 per cent at the last year-end). The housebuilding division, which even in a good year sells a mere 1,000 homes, is too small to cash in on any housing uplift. The contracting side has a tail of unprofitable work. And although the portfolio is understood to be almost fully let there will have to be more balance sheet writedowns. More serious, though, are suggestions that Taylor Woodrow's supercharged performance in the middle to late 1980s masked deeper weaknesses in the organisation only now coming to light. To many observers there is an inbred look about the board which made it predictable the directors would again choose one of their own to try to dig themselves out of the present hole. Boardroom harmony is likely to be restored - with Mr Parsons throwing his weight behind the previously eclipsed chief executive Mr Tony Palmer and the rift with life president and company founder Lord Taylor likely to be healed. One day, though, Mr Parsons may find the pressure to bring in more outside blood irresistible.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TAYLOR WOODROW  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1921 Founded as a housebuilder in Liverpool by Frank Taylor (now Lord Taylor) 1936 Becomes public company Extends housing activities into US, and begins contracting in UK 1942 Acquires Greenham Group (foundation for wholesaling business) 1964 First serious investment in property 1987 Started work on Channel tunnel 1990 (January) Petter Drew becomes chairman  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Clowes audit inquiry reopened AN INVESTIGATION into the auditors of Barlow Clowes, the disgraced fund management company which was closed by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1988, has been reopened by the accountants' professional body. The Joint Disciplinary Scheme (JDS) of the institutes of chartered accountants in England, Wales and Scotland and the Association of Certified Accountants confirmed yesterday that it had recommenced investigations into the involvement of Spicer &amp; Pegler and Touche Ross as auditors to the company. The two firms, which merged in 1990, could be fined substantial sums and ordered to pay inquiry costs - believed to total more than Pounds 1m already  -if the inquiry finds against them. The move comes after the 112-day Barlow Clowes trial ended earlier this month. Mr Peter Clowes, the company's founder, was jailed for 10 years for theft and fraud. A committee established by the JDS to investigate the case began work in January 1989 but was suspended in July last year following a request from the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO is believed to have argued that continuing the investigations before the trial could have interfered with the course of justice. The JDS inquiry was already well-advanced and it is believed that the costs incurred to date make it the most expensive investigation yet undertaken. No decision is expected from the committee before next year. The committee comprises two accountants and a judge, with the assistance of an accountancy firm. The JDS examines questions against accountants and accountancy firms only where allegations are complex and raise matters of substantial public concern. Last week it fined Arthur Young, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 40,000 costs for its role as auditor to Milbury, the collapsed house-building group controlled by Mr Jim Raper. The only other case it is considering at present is against Arthur Young as auditor to Alexander Howden and Minet, the insurance companies. Both companies were criticised in a 1990 DTI report for the diversion of reinsurance funds. Most investigations are handled internally by the disciplinary committees of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the other professional bodies. Touche Ross said yesterday: 'We believe it is absolutely inappropriate for us to comment on matters in this case at the moment.'</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: Tide that turned in favour of Noir ONE of the few to have withstood the tide of mainstream conservatism last night was Mr Michel Noir, mayor of Lyons and former member of the RPR Gaullist party. Key to Mr Noir's 58 per cent vote in the run-off was the fact that his opponent, Mr Alain Merieux, the official RPR candidate, gained the unwelcome personal endorsement of the National Front candidate eliminated in the first round a week ago. Mr Merieux thus seemed to have gained fewer votes from the NF than he lost from left-wing electors who came out to back the mayor in what they saw as a proxy fight against the NF. Mr Merieux had come out of the first round on March 18 narrowly ahead of Mr Noir. He seemed well placed to capitalise after a campaign funding scandal at the centre of which was the mayor's son-in-law, Mr Pierre Botton. Mr Botton, a Lyons businessman, is now in jail. What turned the tide in his favour, Mr Noir claimed last night, was the sense of independence of the Lyonnais who did not want to see their city's politics dictated by RPR party HQ in Paris, and Mr Merieux's 'alliance' with the NF. Mr Noir was once an RPR minister of trade, but left the party several years ago to try to form his own local movement. That failed because 'Noirist' candidates did not win any seats in Lyons. He said last night he saw himself as a member of the parliament's 'new majority', but added it was not clear in which group he would sit.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN THE SIVER SCREEN TURNS RED: OPINIONS ON MOVIE VIOLENCE;  </P> <P> 'BATMAN THE KILLER IS NOT A HERO FOR OUR TIMES...'  </P> <P> Try comparing the carnage in the 1967 James Bond film "You Only Live Twice"  (shown on television here last Sunday) to the latest film; "License to Kill"  doesn't even come close.  </P> <P> Twenty-two years ago the Bond movie included two people eaten alive by piranha,  myriad stabbings, shootings and poisonings, a pitched battle with a body count  in the hundreds.  </P> <P> Protest all you like against the current upswing in movie violence (like Sheila  Benson in her July 23 article, I too found the Joker's art-museum rampage in  "Batman" highly objectionable), but leave "Licence to Kill" out of it; as these  things go, it's kids stuff.  </P> <P> FRANK LOWTHER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

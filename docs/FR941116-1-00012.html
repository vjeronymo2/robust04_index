			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA has determined that a savings of more than $100 million per year is likely to occur as a result of the implementation of the regulation. Therefore, this action is a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 and significant within the meaning of DOT regulatory policies and procedures. Because it is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be significant, the FHWA has prepared the following regulatory evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA collected and evaluated considerable amounts of VE data in 1992 while preparing and writing its VE Report to Congress. During FHWA's 1992 evaluation of the effectiveness of its VE program, the FHWA analyzed data for all SHAs (50 States plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia) describing their VE usage for the 4-year period from fiscal year (FY) 1988 to FY 1991. The data showed that the SHAs performed over 1500 VE studies, recommended an accumulative $3.6 billion in VE savings, and implemented VE savings worth $615 million. The majority (71 percent) of these 1,500 VE studies were made by just seven States. These seven SHAs, with ``active'' VE programs, averaged 39 studies per year. Nearly all of the remaining VE studies were made by 27 other SHAs, an average of only 4 VE studies per year, with the 18 remaining SHAs performing only 12 VE studies over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4-year study period. The overall results showed the SHAs implementing an average of $154 million per year in VE savings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to evaluate the reported VE savings, the FHWA analyzed the FY 1991 bid information reported and published in its Bid Opening Report (Pub. No. FHWA-PD&hyph;92&hyph;017). In FY 1991, the SHAs accumulatively awarded $10 billion worth of Federal-aid highway construction projects. The seven ``active'' VE States awarded construction contracts worth $2.5 billion, the 27 ``limited'' VE States awarded construction contracts worth $5.0 billion, and the 18 ``inactive'' VE States awarded construction contracts worth $2.5 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA has concluded that because the seven SHAs (accounting for 25 percent of FHWA's construction program) with ``active'' VE programs and the 27 States (accounting for 50 percent of FHWA's construction program) with ``limited'' VE programs were able to save $154 million per year, that an opportunity exists to save significant additional Federal-aid highway funds if all SHAs develop ``active'' VE programs. With 25 percent of FHWA's $10 billion construction program not exposed to any VE analysis and 50 percent of its program having only a ``limited'' exposure to the VE process, the FHWA believes that additional savings of more that $100 million would occur by requiring all States to develop and administer VE programs as proposed in this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The additional annual savings that would result from the implementation of this regulation would remain with the affected SHAs. The funds saved through VE could then be used to design or construct additional highway projects, thereby allowing SHAs to get additional work accomplished each year with the same overall amount of Federal-aid highway funds. By being able to expand the amount of work accomplished with their Federal-aid highway funds, SHAs would also be able to save or free-up State funds for other projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on more recent VE information collected by FHWA field offices for FY 1993, the FHWA found that during FY 1993, 27 SHAs had performed at least 1 VE study, while 18 of these 27 SHAs performed at least 5 studies, and 9 of the 27 SHAs performed 10 or more studies. The FHWA believes that these States either have VE programs in place or are familiar with the VE process that would be required under this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule will not significantly increase the burden upon State governments. This regulation would require SHAs to develop VE programs where a sufficient number of projects, representing at least 50 percent of the Federal-aid highway funds expended by the State, will be identified for VE studies each year. An average VE study takes 4 to 5 days to complete and requires a 4 to 6 person team. In FY 1993, 349 VE studies of various highway projects were made by 27 SHAs. According to the information provided to the FHWA, the average cost per project for the 349 VE studies was $9,600 while the recommended savings (if all recommendations were accepted) was $3.4 million per project. Assuming a recommendation acceptance rate of 25 percent, implementation of the VE recommendations would result in a cost savings of approximately $0.86 million per study. The VE cost savings should more than offset any VE study or redesign costs to the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, some State highway agencies have resisted establishing VE programs for various reasons. Many were concerned about the additional staffing requirements and potential delays to projects. Some considered the application of VE to be superfluous in light of the review processes already applied in developing projects. These concerns have been considered and addressed in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

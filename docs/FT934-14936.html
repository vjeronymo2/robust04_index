			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / People: Badgerline group bags new recruit The Badgerline group, comprising bus and coach operations in the south of England, Wales and west Midlands, has appointed Andy Higginson, right, as a non-executive board member. Higginson has been finance director of Laura Ashley Holdings since 1990 and was previously finance director of Guinness Brewing International. Badgerline is busying itself preparing for its float on the London Stock Exchange, planned for November. Its executive chairman, Trevor Smallwood, says that Higginson's experience of public companies was a key factor in making his appointment. Smallwood, who says that he has 'been in buses for 27 years', felt that the five executives already had sufficient knowledge of the transport business. Higginson joins two other non-executives on the board: Bill Forman, who joined on his retirement from Vickers in 1991, and Philip Williams, who is with Hill Samuel in Birmingham. Badgerline started life in September 1986, being one of numerous splinters from the old state-run National Bus company, privatised as a result of the 1985 Transport Act.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Good rally from early bout of selling INVESTOR's confidence was challenged in the UK stock market yesterday by some discomforting corporate profits statements and by a Pounds 200m selling programme from a leading securities house. Equities were hard hit in the first half of the session but staged a successful recovery to regain the important FT-SE 2,850 support level. Profits news from Wellcome, the leading anti-aids drug manufacturer, and from Redland, the construction group, were negative factors, but traders stressed that, in both cases, it was the meetings with City analysts that did the damage. Higher profits at Wellcome failed to save the shares from worries that future growth rates might be less dependable. At Redland, concern focused on the preponderence of overseas earnings. Early firmness in equities melted away as analysts returned from these two important company meetings and the market reaced strongly to the sell programme, reportedly from UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew. Stock market confidence had to meet its first significant test this week without the benefit of any more of the large share placings which have recently been a feature of equity trading. There was a Pounds 147.3m rights call from Slough Estates. Share prices tumbled quickly and trading volume increased as the programme struck home. By mid-session, the FT-SE Index had lost 27.2 points to 2,833.4 and traders were looking uncomfortably towards 2,800 which some have suggested could be the next base mark. However, a good recovery set in later as Wall Street opened higher and the UK power generating stocks brightened after the Government White Paper appeared to leave their regulatory position unchanged. At the close of business, the reading of 2,852.8 on the FT-SE Index showed the day's fall reduced to 7.8. Some 4.6 points reflected falls in Wellcome and Redland shares. Traders expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the session. While some sizeable lines of stock had come on offer, buyers had come forward. Seaq volume increased by more than 8 per cent over Wednesday's total to 904.3m shares, of which around 63 per cent was in non-Footsie stocks; the total included 128m shares in Ticketing, one of the market's lesser-known stocks. Retail, or customer, business rebounded sharply in the previous session to record value of Pounds 1.69bn, although this figure was swollen by the heavy share placing in George Wimpey. The heaviest losses yesterday came in those sectors which have most noticeably outperformed the rest of the market since the turn of the year. Properties, where the Slough Estates rights issue could be the first of many, ran into the sellers. But the heaviest losses came in the merchant banks which have been benefiting from excellent profits statements from some leading names. The FT-SE Index has now lost the gains achieved in the run-up to the UK Budget on March 16. But selling has been moderate and comfortably absorbed in the market. Nor has the flow of rights issues upset share prices to date. However, most strategists agree that share prices will remain vulnerable until there is further indication that the UK economy is securely on the recovery trail.</p>

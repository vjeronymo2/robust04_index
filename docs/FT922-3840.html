			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Complaints body says coverage of royalty 'odious' THE Press Complaints Commission attacked newspaper coverage of the apparently strained marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales as 'odious' yesterday and warned that it threatened the future of press self-regulation. Further criticism of newspapers came from Dr George Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury, who said: 'The current speculation about intimate personal matters has exceeded the boundaries which should be observed in a society claiming to respect basic human values.' Speculation over the state of the royal marriage has filled many newspapers since Friday, when the front page of the Daily Mail claimed that the Princess had attempted suicide during the 1980s. The story was based on a biography of the Princess to be published in the US next month. Other newspapers followed with detailed allegations from a rival biography, serialised in The Sunday Times. The Press Complaints Commission described some reports as 'an odious exhibition of journalists dabbling their fingers in the stuff of other people's souls in a manner which adds nothing to legitimate public interest in the situation of the heir to the throne'. It added: 'The state of the marriage has been put into the public domain in part at least by the outward behaviour of the spouses and it is therefore a legitimate subject within the public interest for report and comment by the press.' But it said that frequently the manner and tone of the reports was without doubt in breach of the newspapers' code of practice. Mr David Mellor, national heritage minister, welcomed the commission's statement and said the government would take its views into account in the government's review of press self-regulation at the end of this month.</p>

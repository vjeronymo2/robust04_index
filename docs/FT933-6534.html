			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Qureshi criticises US for applying 'unjust' sanctions against China and Pakistan Mr Moeen Qureshi, Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, last night criticised the US for applying 'unjust' sanctions against China and Pakistan over transfer of M-11 missiles, writes Farhan Bokhari from Islamabad. In a statement, Mr Qureshi said that Pakistan would lodge with Washington against the decision. Mr Qureshi said the missiles, sold by China to Pakistan a year ago, were within the perimeters of the Missile Technology Control Regime. The procurement of the missiles had become essential for Pakistan to defend itself against Scud missile attacks from Afghanistan during the rule of its previous communist regime, and also as a precaution against the development of a variety of ballistic missiles by India. Officials said sanctions were unlikely to damage Pakistan's economy, since US aid had already been cut off because of allegations over Islamabad's nuclear programme.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Enrique Salas Romer, Carabobo State governor, has  requested support from the various parliamentary wings so that  the Chamber of Deputies will label as urgent the draft law for  reforming the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors.  Raina Rondon reports from Congress.    [Begin recording] [Rondon] In the afternoon, Governor Salas  Romer already had the support of the Democratic Action [AD],  Copei [Social Christian Party], and MAS [Movement Toward  Socialism parliamentary wings], support he feels guarantees the  draft reform will be submitted to Congress within the next few  days.    [Salas Romer] Based on Article 22 of the Constitution--which  establishes that Congress will issue a law on the election and  removal of governors--it is possible to establish the conditions  within which one could go to the extreme of dismissing the  governor.    [Rondon] Meanwhile, Antonio Ledezma has announced Congress  decided during the session to declare the health sector in a  state of emergency due to the serious hospital crisis prevailing  throughout the country and the doctors' conflict.    Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the lower chamber Finance  Commission said Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom made a  mistake when he said the Executive Branch would be willing to  study a draft of a special powers law which will include  mechanisms for resolving national social and administrative  issues inasmuch as the Constitution establishes that special  powers may only include economic and financial issues.    [Tarre Briceno] The government had not asked for anything up  to now. AD comes and makes an offer. The executive branch,  rather than accepting or rejecting that offer, now proposes, via  the interior minister, more special powers to include  administrative and social issues, which is evidently against the  Constitution.    [Rondon] To conclude, Gustavo Tarre Briceno said Congress is  only waiting for the executive branch to decide what it wants  regarding the Special Powers law. [end recording]</p>

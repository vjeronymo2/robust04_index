			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Judge rules against three Names in US A LEGAL ruling in the US against the Lloyd's of London insurance market was overturned in a Chicago district court yesterday. Judge Charles Norgle overturned a decision made last September by magistrate Ms Joan Gottschall in favour of two Names, Mr Kenneth Bonny and Mrs Francesca Bonny. A third Name subsequently joined the action. Several cases are being brought against Lloyd's in the US by loss-making Names - individuals whose capital backs underwriting at Lloyd's. The three Names whose cases were heard yesterday alleged that agreements signed with Lloyd's and the agents who handle their affairs should not be enforced because Names' rights to the protection of US securities laws take precedence. The court upheld Lloyd's contention that under the agreements any dispute must be heard in an English court. A Lloyd's motion to dismiss the entire case is pending before the same judge. Last autumn a federal judge in Denver found that the US courts had no jurisdiction over similar plaintiffs' claims. An appeal has been lodged against that ruling. The US courts have still to hear a third case brought against Lloyd's and a group of agents by 91 US Names. In the UK a High Court judge will today hear a motion by Lloyd's to have litigation between it, members' agents and Names transferred to the commercial court. Several hundred Names are seeking injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down their deposits in order to meet cash calls. The agents have agreed to freeze the deposits temporarily pending a full court hearing which is expected to begin later this month. Meanwhile Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, is expected to begin his investigation into alleged malpractices at Lloyd's this week.</p>

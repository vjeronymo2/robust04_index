			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE;  </P> <P> 'WHO COULD BE BETTER THAN BELLA LEWITZKY?'  </P> <P> When it came time for UC Irvine to celebrate its silver anniversary, Betty  Tessman, manager of Lively Arts and Lectures at the university, knew just who  to ring up.  </P> <P> "We wanted to have a dance company here," Tessman recalled during a recent  phone interview, "and I thought: Would there be anybody I could pick who would  be better than Bella Lewitzky?  </P> <P> "The Lewitzky Company is one of the foremost modern dance companies in the  United States as well as internationally, and it just happens to come from  California. I always feel we should honor the folks at home."  </P> <P> So the 25th Anniversary Committee commissioned what would become Lewitzky's  "Episode No. 1: Recuerdo (Remembrance)," a work that will receive its premiere  performances by the Lewitzky Company on Friday and Saturday at the Irvine  Barclay Theatre. Tessman declined to reveal the amount of the commission.  </P> <P> Lewitzky said that UCI approached her without placing any restrictions on the  work other than stipulating that "they were interested in receiving a  premiere."  </P> <P> "That was fine with me," Lewitzky said in a phone interview from San Jose,  where her company was performing last week.  </P> <P> "It means I am forced to the wall to complete a new piece. So much time is  spent in bringing in new company members, maintaining repertory and just  handling financial woes that it's a pleasure to be able to do the reason for  all the of the above, which is make a work.  </P> <P> "The work doesn't have a specific link to UCI," she added. "But it has links.  UCI has been very kind to us. We have appeared again and again on that campus.  It feels like a home to us, which would be true for UCLA, Occidental College or  Pepperdine University -- the people who have taken us under their wing. We  celebrate with all of them. I'm not sure they celebrate, but we do."  </P> <P> The new piece will fall in the middle of two otherwise different programs at  the Barclay. The other Lewitzky works will be "Game Plan" and "Impressions No.  2 (Vincent van Gogh)" on Friday; and "Impressions No. 3 (Paul Klee)" and "Pas  de Bach" on Saturday.  </P> <P> Lewitzky described the new piece, set to a score by her longtime collaborator  Larry Attaway, as lasting approximately 17 minutes.  </P> <P> "Basically, it's like an extended woman's solo, which explains the 'I Remember'  part of it," she said. "It starts with a trio of women and then introduces a  solo woman. Then the trio of women, who act in a kind of a choric fashion,  disappears behind a scrim, and a man enters and there is a duet. Then the man  also retreats to the past, and the woman remains in the final solo.  </P> <P> "It's dark, yes. I think 'sad' is a good word. But it's very touching, I hope.  At least all my company is responding in that fashion.  </P> <P> "I'm so involved in the making process, it's hard to gain distance from it.  It's an emotional piece in a very simple fashion.  </P> <P> "Usually it takes me a tour of a new work before I can distance myself from it  and look at it objectively and not subjectively."  </P></p>

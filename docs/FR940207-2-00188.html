			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Under the Amended Variable Pricing System, all expenses incurred by a Shearson Fund are allocated among the various classes of shares based on the net assets of the Shearson Fund attributable to each class, except that each class' net asset value and expenses reflect the expenses associated with that class's Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan or Plan Agreement (if any), including any costs associated with obtaining shareholder approval of the Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan and any Class Expenses. Expenses of a Shearson Fund allocated to a particular class are borne on a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  basis by each outstanding share of that class. Applicants request an exemption to permit the Funds to allocate expenses among the classes subject to the terms and conditions of the order permitting the Amended Variable Pricing System.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. The CDSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Prior Orders permit the imposition of a CDSC in connection with the redemption of Class B shares of the Shearson Funds and on certain redemptions of Class A shares sold pursuant to a complete waiver of the front-end sales load applicable to large purchases, if the shares are redeemed within one year of the date of purchase. Applicants request a renewal and continuation of the Prior Orders to permit the Funds to impose a CDSC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to permit the Funds to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings, and does not affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves. The proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of a Fund, since all such shares will participate in all of the Fund's appreciation, income, and expenses in the manner described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Letter: An additional burden on those who save, but with no commensurate addition to their state pension (2) Sir, Mr John Smith, speaking on behalf of the Labour party on the Today Programme (January 28), said that he thought it was unfair that people earning more than Pounds 405 per week should not have to pay national insurance contributions on their full earnings whereas people earning less than that did have to. Mr Smith should be made aware of the fact that those earning more than Pounds 405 a week earn no state pension in respect of that excess. People earning less than Pounds 405 a week do earn a state pension in respect of those earnings. An increase in National Insurance contributions for those earning more than Pounds 405 per week is a straight income tax of 9 per cent on that excess. There is no state benefit given in return. H R Wynne-Griffith, Burnett Waddington &amp; Co, 11 Tufton Street, London SW1P 8QB</p>

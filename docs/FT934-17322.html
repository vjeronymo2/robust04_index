			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / German housing lifts Redland THE STRONG house-building market in Germany helped Redland, the international construction materials group, to report a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 108m in the first six months of the year. The profit performance was better than expected and compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 88.5m in the first half of 1992. Redland's share price gained 9p to close at 564p. Mr Robert Napier, chief executive, said conditions were improving in all Redland's main markets. Overseas operating profits rose 41 per cent to Pounds 106.8m, benefiting from 'another excellent performance' in Germany, where the group has a 51 per cent stake in Braas, the country's biggest roof tilemaker. Overall the German contribution rose from Pounds 41.1m to Pounds 56.2m. Profits were also supported by improved results in the Netherlands, Italy and Australasia, a strong recovery in profits in the US and sterling's devaluation. France was the exception. Mr Napier said further interest rate cuts and implementation of the Balladur package were needed to revitalise the economy. Group operating profit increased 39 per cent to Pounds 120.9m, but interest payments nearly trebled to Pounds 19.3m largely reflecting the acquisition of Steetley in March last year. Turnover rose 30 per cent to Pounds 1.14bn. The UK contributed Pounds 14.1m in profits, the Pounds 2.8m increase reflecting cost savings from the rationalisation of the Redland and Steetley brick and aggregates businesses. Redland's roofing operations raised operating profits to Pounds 85.2m, up from Pounds 58.9m. Braas's roof tile volumes in Germany rose 7 per cent, an increase of 2 per cent in the west and 33 per cent in the east. Redland's aggregates business posted operating profits of Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 18.1m). In the UK, volumes in sand, gravel and ready-mixed concrete fell but profits were slightly ahead. Brick operations also reported higher operating profits of Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 10m). Brick volumes in the UK were similar to last year but prices were down. Net debt fell from Pounds 664m at the end of December to Pounds 641m at the end of June, gearing of 39 per cent. The interim dividend is maintained at 8.25p and the group is offering an enhanced scrip dividend alternative worth 12.375p. Earnings per share slipped to 11.6p (11p), reflecting increased minorities, mainly in Germany, a higher tax charge of 29 per cent and an increase in the number of shares.

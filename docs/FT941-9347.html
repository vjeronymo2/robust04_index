			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Record investment at Venezuelan telecom CANTV, Venezuela's nationalised telecommunications company, is lifting capital investment for 1994 to USDollars 705m, its largest annual outlay. Investments this year are part of a Dollars 6bn capital spending programme planned for up to 2000. CANTV, formerly owned by the Venezuelan government, has since 1991 been controlled by an international consortium headed by GTE of the US. Other non-Venezuelan partners in the consortium are Spain's Telefonica and AT&amp;T. CANTV's capital investments in 1993 totalled Dollars 650m. Just over 67 per cent of this year's investments will be used to expand telecommunications services; 5 per cent will go to new services, 15 per cent to modernisation, and 11 per cent to services, including mobile phones. The privatised company has improved Venezuela's telecommunications services substantially since it took over. However, it still has a long way to go in establishing a reliable and modern network for its population of 20.7m. Mr Bruce Haddad, CANTV's president, said demand for 1m new telephone lines would not be met until the end of the decade.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: The one-man English Development Agency - The rising influence of Lord Walker THOUGH retired from politics, Lord Walker, the former cabinet minister appointed to co-ordinate measures to help the communities affected by pit closures, wields more influence than some still in government. His remit has expanded almost imperceptibly to include advising Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, on the broader implications for regional policy and for inward investment measures. Before the election, he was appointed chairman-designate of the urban regeneration agency, also by Mr Heseltine, who was his junior minister at environment in the early 1970s. The two share a conviction that government should work in partnership with industry. Some Whitehall officials believe that in Lord Walker, Mr Heseltine has realised an ambition thwarted by some of his colleagues and found a one-man English Development Agency in all but name. But so far, Lord Walker's mission has been somewhat hanging fire. The URA will not begin its work until the autumn, and the coalfields project has been held up while the government reviewed its endorsement of British Coal's decision to close 31 pits. The white paper should, however, mark a watershed in terms of making progress. Lord Walker said yesterday that while the delays had been 'frustrating', the time had been usefully spent in meetings which brought home to officials the need to ensure that their activities dovetailed. Measures were now ready to be activated 'immediately' a decision had been reached on a particular pit. Though the great affection he expresses for the coal industry is not universally reciprocated by those who remember him as energy secretary at the time of the bitter 1984-85 miners' strike, some of the areas which feel most at risk have invited him to visit, and he has been to Durham, Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. 'You have to have a team,' he says of the need to get local councils, industry, training and enterprise councils, and government working together. One of his biggest fans at Westminster says, however, that it is his 'bullying manner', which makes him ideal for the job. While Labour admits he has abilities as a 'super-salesman', opposition MPs are more doubtful about what they see as his belief that simply by insisting a venture is a success it can be turned into one. A few express more serious reservations as well: last week some Labour MPs tabled Commons motions accusing him of misleading MPs about discussions on private sector involvement in the Welsh Development Agency.</p>

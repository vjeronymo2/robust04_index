			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: Money-lust to music / Review of 'McTeague', William Bolomb's first opera IS THE American opera entering a boom period? Signs are disparate, and not necessarily indicative of a coherent larger pattern or trend; but certainly, something seems to be stirring. New operas are being commissioned by the big houses, put on with flair, and greeted with genuine audience interest and enthusiasm. The unexpected popular success of Corigliano's Ghosts of Versailles at the New York Metropolitan a year ago was the starting point; early last month Philip Glass's Columbus Centenary opera The Voyage had a splashy send-off in the same theatre; and at the end of same month, Lyric Opera of Chicago enjoyed a notably warm reception for the unveiling of its first large-scale commissioned opera for 14 years - McTeague, music by William Bolcom, libretto by Arnold Weinstein and film director Robert Altman, who also served as the show's producer. The common factors of all three operas are their largeness of scale, their determination to find audience-wooing ways of blending drama and music, and their lavish production schemes. McTeague is the most obviously American, in subject matter and in its determination to adopt native accents in the exploration of that subject matter. It is based on Frank Norris's novel (1899) of the same name, a landmark in the development of the country's literary movement; and it tells the Zola-like tale of a physically mighty but slow-witted quack-dentist, brought up in cruel poverty, who briefly achieves domestic bliss and a measure of social status in turn-of-the-century San Francisco and then, falling into a web of greed, intrigue and envy, loses it all. The theme - the corrosive power of money-lust on personal and social relationships - has in no way lost its sting: reading the book and then encountering the theatre-work against a backdrop of the American election caused all sorts of bells to ring. And, most 'American' of all, the composer has attempted to make music-drama by drawing deep on the sound and style of American popular music. Gershwin (in Porgy), Blitzstein (in Regina) and Weill (in Street Scene) managed to do this, in their very different ways; but more recently the line of succession seemed to have passed to the musicals of Bernstein and Sondheim. Bolcom, an important composer and - as recital pianist for his wife, Joan Morris - performer of American songs, has mingled the categories of 'popular' and 'serious' throughout; he would seem a promising candidate for the re-establishment of the Porgy line. His two-act, two-hour structure, though 'continuous' in its use of orchestral linkage, is a succession of enjoyably bright-pointed numbers  - arias, duets and ensembles, often fleshed out in the metres of contemporary popular dance (waltz, rag, cakewalk) when not shaped in more conventional Grand Opera forms, and flavoured by the barbershop-quartet or cowboy-octet. All this is set within a modern-music frame: long-held cluster-chords, a variety of dissonant orchestral melodramatics and much else drawn - free-handedly but not promiscuously - from the higher altitudes of 'serious' opera. The approach is clear-minded: a language of buoyant simplicities to represent the main characters' emotions and aspirations, compromised and gradually stained by the language of their darker sides. In the richest moment of the opera, this musical duality fixes the turning-point of the plot: the wedding scene of McTeague and Trina, interrupted by the award of her Dollars 5,000 lottery prize - a passage of flexibly achieved operatic comedy shaded with dark portents, and here brilliantly realised by the conductor Dennis Russell Davies and the Lyric Opera orchestra. This is, one remembers, a first opera, and its weaknesses are condign: lack of steady dramatic development, lack of narrative clarity, plethora of Good Ideas that in practice prove to be not quite so good. The back-and-forth of flashback device is cumbersome, the expanded treatment of Norris's Mexican maid Maria as a comic nemesis figure likewise. And, given Bolcom's imaginative resourcefulness in placing his dramatic layers, it is odd how impermanently the melodic writing imprints the characters on our consciousness. McTeague seems to me an opera of moments - but beguiling ones, at least. I wonder, though, whether a sparer, defter production style might have altered the impression; Altman's was gauze-ridden, part deliquescently abstract and part atmospherically 'period', and surprisingly lumbering. - Russian set-designer Yury Kuper had risked too many ambitious scene-changes with all their noise and clutter. The strongest advocates for the show, apart from Davies, were the cast, large in number and superlatively 'in the skin' of the drama - for this Altman no doubt deserves a share of praise as well. They were led by the baritone Timothy Nolen (a smooth-voiced, subtly dapper agent of doom), the soprano Catherine Malfitano (singing with dark lustre, moving from Trina's youthful freshness to her miserly obsessiveness in finely graded stages), and the tenor Ben Heppner in the title role. I proclaimed the beauties of Heppner's 1988 Melbourne Bacchus and 1990 Scala Walther to the skies. In music that needs Wagnerian power, Straussian high notes and a different sort of rhythm- and interval-etching agility, he proved himself a magnificently clean, ringing-voiced singer; in addition, he brought to the central character a tremendous physical presence. To say it is all but impossible to imagine McTeague without him is to suggest the splendour of Heppner's performance, and also, to a degree, the limitations of the work itself. In repertory at the Civic Center Opera, Chicago, throughout November</p>

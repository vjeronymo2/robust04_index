			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 7 Jun--An executive staff member of the  Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent today that Tokyo does not think that it makes any  sense in the current situation to seriously study Russia's  proposal on holding an international conference on the Korean  peninsula with the participation of the two Korean states,  China, the Russian Federation, the United States, Japan, the  United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.    He noted that Tokyo now intends to achieve a solution to the  problem of Pyongyang's nuclear program primarily on the basis of  close consultations with the United States and South Korea. The  Government of Japan, the member of the Foreign Ministry staff  stated, also places hope in the upcoming session of the UN  Security Council relating to this issue. On Monday, Tokyo  officially announced that it is prepared to join in the  sanctions against the Korean People's Democratic Republic,  within the framework of its Constitution, if the United Nations  agrees to this measure.    Earlier, Pyongyang itself did, in fact, reject Moscow's  proposal that an international conference should be held to  settle the tension on the peninsula, having confirmed its  intention to discuss with the United States alone the issue of  its nuclear program and the possible complete withdrawal from  the system of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear  weapons.    To all appearances, Washington is also taking a passive  attitude toward Russia's initiative, although President Bill  Clinton has also stated that it would possibly make sense to  implement it if events were to develop in a certain way.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Yevgenyev: "Different Poles of Reform"] </F>   [Text] To judge by operational information from the State  Committee for Statistics May has been a record month in terms of  the decline in industrial production. In terms of physical  volume it declined 6.5 percent compared with April and 28  percent compared with May last year. As a whole over the first  five months of this year 25.9 percent less output was produced  than for the same period last year.    Of course a part was played by the fact that there was less  working time in May than in April ("we were taking time off and  enjoying ourselves"). Nonetheless we cannot fail to draw  attention to the increasing stoppages of enterprises, mainly, as  the State Committee for Statistics notes, because of the  impossibility of selling their output.    The volume of production declined most in the sectors of the  investment complex and nonfood consumer goods. Thus, while the  fuel and energy complex showed a decline of 12 percent and the  food industry a decline of 22 percent, the pulp and paper  industry's production declined 32-34 percent, the chemical and  petrochemical industry declined 35 percent, light industry 41  percent, and machine building 45 percent.    Of 406 of the most important types of output taken into  account in operational returns, the production of 20 articles  increased compared with January through May last year while the  production of 381 declined.    Capital construction continues to be reduced. Over the five  months 25-30 percent fewer investments were channeled into the  republic's economy and 40 percent fewer were channeled into the  production sphere than a year ago. The commissioning of housing  has declined 6 percent.    As for agriculture, as of 30 May agricultural enterprises  had  sown 50.6 million hectares to spring crops as against 53.2  million last year. It is true that spring grain crops have been  sown on 34 million hectares, which is 2 percent more than a year  ago. A motley picture characterizes livestock raising. As a  whole the production of meat and milk has declined 8-10 percent.  But on private farms it has actually increased while at  agricultural enterprises it has declined 15-16 percent.    In foreign trade exports rose 9 percent and imports declined  28 percent, which ensures Russia a reliable positive balance.  But little is changing in the structure of exports. Gas (20  percent), crude oil (19.5 percent), petroleum products (7  percent), and ferrous metals (10 percent) continue to  predominate in it while machinery and equipment account for a  miserly share (33 percent). Essentially it is the trade balance  of a developing country. But we must realize that substantial  changes here are possible only as a result of profound  transformations in the entire economy.    In recent months inflation has been markedly checked.  Compared with December 1993 consumer prices have increased just  72 percent. Average wages have increased 5 percent compared with  april (prices have increased 7 percent) totalling 180,000 rubles  [R]. The highest wages are for workers in the fuel industry  (R420,000), electricity (R381,000), and the credit and insurance  sphere (R366,000). Real disposable monetary incomes (incomes  left after counting essential payments corrected against the  consumer prices index) increased 11 percent over the past year.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FACTORY OPERATING RATE DIPS 0.2% 2ND MONTH, COOLS INFLATION FEARS  </P> <P> The operating rate for U.S. factories declined for the second consecutive month  in March to 84%, the first back-to-back drop in nearly three years and a clear  sign that the economy is cooling, the government said today.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve Board said the March operating rate was 0.2 percentage  points lower than February's 84.2% level and 0.4 of a percentage point below  the January level of 84.4%, which was the highest in nearly a decade.  </P> <P> February and March represented the first consecutive declines since  August-September, 1986.  </P> <P> The closer factories get to full capacity, the greater the fear they will have  trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price  increases.  </P> <P> Today's report is likely to ease somewhat economists' worries that a  substantial pickup in inflation is ahead. Analysts generally consider an  operating rate of 85% to indicate inflationary pressures.  </P></p>

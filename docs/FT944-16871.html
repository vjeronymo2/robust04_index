			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee auction plan opposed Brazil's coffee growers are to urge the government not go ahead with the sale of up to 900,000 bags (60kg each) of stocks to domestic roasters, reports Reuters from Rio de Janeiro. 'The National Coffee Council will recommend that the government does not hold the auctions because international prices have fallen to a level that makes the auctions unnecessary,' said Mr Manoel Bertone, the council's president, yesterday. The proposal to sell 300,000 bags a month between October and December was made by roasters and is still under review.</p>

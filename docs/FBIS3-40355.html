			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It appears that some good news about the  development of the new VEGA (European Advanced Generation  Carrier, an original acronym that reveals the international  ambitions of the program) Italian launcher project, has reached  the management of BPD Difesa e Spazio (Gilardini/Fiat group)  during these last weeks of 1993. In fact VEGA uses technologies  that have been perfected by BPD for other national and European  projects (these being the boosters for the Ariane launchers, the  Zefiro propulsor and the perigee engine IRIS [Italian Research  Interim Stage]) and uses the same philosophy as the San Marco  Scout launcher, designed some years ago by Prof. Luigi Broglio  of La Sapienza University in Rome.    The first piece of good news came from the Italian Space  Agency (ASI). ASI Commissioner Prof. Giampietro Puppi appears  to have signed a contract valued at about 10 billion lire that  would allow BPD and the other subcontracting companies,  Contraves Italiana and Riva Calzoni, to acquire the necessary  sophisticated technologies for the development of the new  launcher. Secondly, another go-ahead for the VEGA, that is no  less important, seems to have come from the commission of  experts nominated last summer by University and Scientific  Research Minister Prof. Umberto Colombo to definitively settle  the question of the realization of a national light launcher and  what has become the violent contraposition of the two programs  that have been launched by the ASI in this sector. On one hand  there is the San Marco Scout, proposed by Rome University, using  mainly technologies and subsystems that have been produced by  the U.S. company LVS, and on the other hand there is the VEGA,  that initially started as a progressive industrialization and  Italianization of the San Marco Scout, but that has slowly  acquired its own form, proposing itself as a valid alternative.  The commission of experts, presided over by Dr. Sergio  Ristuccia, a magistrate from the State Audit Court, has recently  ended its work and delivered its conclusions to Minister  Colombo. According to some indiscretions, the Ristuccia  commission has expressed a negative evaluation of the San Marco  Scout project, mainly because this carrier would use  technologies that are now obsolete, and because the public  funding that would be necessary to update it would largely be  spent in the United States, without a valid economic and  technological return for our country. Vice versa, the report of  the commission would have expressed a favorable opinion on the  development in Italy of an industrial project (this being the  VEGA). It also confirms that there are real market  possibilities for a light launcher able to launch small  scientific, applications, and commercial satellites, weighing  between about 400 and 1,000 kilograms, into low orbits.  According to some estimates, the current BPD project, which has  been derived directly from the so-called "F configuration" of a  study of an optimized national launcher, that was put forward by  the ASI would have global development costs of about 400 billion  lire. The most important market opportunity for the VEGA, apart  from the eventual launching of small scientific satellites for  the ASI, such as the CESAR [Central European Satellite for  Advanced Research], would today seem to be flights to put the  Iridium satellites, developed by the U.S. Motorola company for  the Motorola global personal communications system, into orbit.  This business involves between two and four launches each year  for at least 10 years. The VEGA, which could be sold at about  $14 million, should be the ideal candidate. This depends on  whether Italy, the ASI, and BPD quickly manage to demonstrate  (some say before 1996) that they possess an effective and  reliable launching system and that they do not just have one of  the many "dreams in the drawer."</p>

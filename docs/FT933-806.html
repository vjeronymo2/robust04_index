			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Father of football pools outlived his critics: Obituary - Sir John Moores Sir John Moores, who has died at the age of 97, made his fortune by inventing football pools in 1923 with his brother Cecil. He then used the money to build the Liverpool-based Littlewoods retailing and mail order group into one of the largest privately-owned businesses in the world. Born in January 1896, the son of an Eccles, Lancashire, building contractor, he became one of the UK's most successful entrepreneurs. But in contrast to many who achieved much less, he spent most of it an outsider as far as the British establishment was concerned. He was made a CBE in 1972 but it was not until the safe old age of 84 that he was knighted. By then, it was impossible not to acknowledge his achievements, not only in creating thousands of jobs throughout Britain, but also as a patron of the arts who had created a family dynasty. It was the origins of his wealth in football pools that almost certainly precluded faster recognition. He was also small, unprepossessing in appearance, reclusive, and disinclined to promote himself or his image - or reinvent his origins after he had long outlived his early critics. The 'pools' - now a British national institution in their own right - purport to be a game of skill in which people try to predict the results of soccer matches. In reality, they are a form of gambling, the odds against winning significant sums by skill being astronomical. When the Moores brothers started them in 1923, Ramsey MacDonald, who became Britain's first Labour prime minister a year later, attacked them as 'a disease which spread downwards to the industrious poor from the idle rich.' The industrious poor, recognising the pools as one of their few chances in life to become rich, took no notice and started filling in the coupons. The Moores brothers were millionaires within a few years, but were never idle: they set about building a business empire in Liverpool. They split the business in 1932, with Cecil running the pools and John founding Littlewoods, first as a mail order house selling via a pioneering catalogue and then as a chain of retail shops. Catalogue and shops were pitched at lower middle and working class tastes and markets. Catalogue agents were generally housewives, selling to their neighbours. Rebuffed by a snooty Football Association when he tried to pass some wealth back into the game, John Moores adopted a provincial strategy, putting money and effort into Everton, and becoming chairman of the football club. Everton became famous for its skillful play; Goodison Park, its stadium, was nick-named the 'School of Science' by its fans. Liverpool, Merseyside's other famous club, was not neglected. Moores became its biggest shareholder too, although he kept this so quiet many fans never realised it until a couple of decades ago. But although he intervened personally to sack a couple of Everton managers who had fallen from the heights of success, these were hobbies. The real business was at Littlewoods, which became another British institution in its own right, eventually turning over billions of pounds. Whether he managed the enterprise or ruled it is open to question. He was known universally as 'Mr John' and played the patriarch. Staff were in awe of him and sometimes in terror, but he also commanded great loyalty. Some still tell of his showing underlings large bonus cheques for the year - and then tearing them up before their eyes because targets had been missed. This glimpse of what might have been was supposed to spur victims to greater effort. His parsimony was also the stuff of legend, but underneath it lay a hatred of waste and profligacy. Managerially, he was a hands-on chief executive who was on top of the detail, which he often jotted down in his notebook while touring his empire. He tried to retire at 81 but trouble struck and three years later, he was back in charge. By this time, he knew his sprawling empire needed new brooms who had learned their management elsewhere. By the mid-1980s, he had recruited Des Pitcher, since knighted, as chief executive and John Clement, the head of Unigate, as non-executive chairman, with himself hovering in the background as president. Clement nearly turned the job down after spending some time wandering round Littlewoods to assess the atmosphere. 'You interfere too much,' he told Moores, seeing himself having to spend too much time arguing with the old man. 'Well, of course I do,' Moores told him, giggling at a rebuke he saw as proof of Clement's mettle. Sir John's philanthropy was notable. There are few charities and social initiatives on Merseyside that have not got Moores money or family members or Littlewoods managerial talent involved in them. The biennial 'John Moores' contemporary art exhibition and competition at Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery quickly became one of the most important in the cultural calendar. A lasting monument was assured when Liverpool Polytechnic took the name of Liverpool John Moores University last year when it was elevated to university status. In his last years he lived quietly in his house in the pinewoods near the sea in Formby. Apart from his Rolls Royce - registration number JM1 - which he drove himself and with unfailing courtesy towards other users of the A565 through Crosby, he was never ostentatious. He suffered for his wealth when burglars attacked him at home in 1989, knocking him on the head after he put up a fight. Well into his nineties, with his health impaired, he was seldom seen in public afterwards. A family squabble in 1990 saw divisions about whether Littlewoods should go public, but Sir John's allies prevailed. So there may well be a pent-up head of steam now to change tack. The 32 family shareholders are rich on paper but mostly merely well off in cash terms. Sir John's legendary parsimony extended to dividends and they got only Pounds 400,000 between them in 1992 - of a business likely to be worth Pounds 2bn on flotation. Since some have pushed to realise their equity already, Sir John's death may well spur them to try again.</p>

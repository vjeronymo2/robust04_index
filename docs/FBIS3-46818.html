			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam by </F> unidentified correspondent; from the 1 January NHAN DAN --  place, date not given]    [Text] [Correspondent] Dear Comrade Foreign Minister: Last  year we made remarkable achievements in our diplomatic  activities. Could you please elaborate on some of them?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] Last year, we made great achievements in  our nation's diplomatic activities. We have entered a new stage  of development in our relations with neighboring Southeast Asian  nations, thus opening up a new era of cooperation with these  countries on a larger scale, especially in the trade and  economic domains. The most important event was party General  Secretary Do Muoi's official visit to Singapore and Thailand.  On this occasion, Vietnam declared a four-point policy toward  the region, asserting Vietnam's firm policy of strengthening its  multifaceted relations with each and every ASEAN member.  Vietnam also stressed its willingness to join ASEAN at an  appropriate date. ASEAN members have become our trading  partners. As of mid-1993, investment in Vietnam by ASEAN  members had reached $483.4 million, while their trade with  Vietnam was valued at $1.8 billion in 1992.    As for the People's Republic of China, Vietnam highly  treasures its relations with this country. It has consistently  consolidated its friendship and strengthened bilateral  cooperation with China to resolve all outstanding problems step  by step through peaceful negotiations. In this context, in  October 1993 both sides signed an agreement on fundamental  principles for resolving the issue of land and sea borders  between the two countries, especially the land border and areas  in the Gulf of Tonkin. Both sides agreed to continue talks on  issues related to the sea in order to reach a fundamental and  long-lasting solution. This is in the interests of the two  peoples and of regional peace, stability, and cooperation.  President Le Duc Anh's friendly official visit to China last  November was a new step in accelerating and developing relations  between the two countries.    With Prime Minister's Vo Van Kiet official visit to Japan,  the Republic of Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, we completed  the process of establishing and normalizing relations with all  the countries from Northeast Asia to the South Pacific region.  This creates favorable conditions for Vietnam to solicit  capital and technology from these countries and promote trade  and economic relations. Japan has become Vietnam's top trading  partner. The country increased its development aid to Vietnam  from $360 million during the 1992-93 fiscal year to more than  $550 million in 1993-94.    Relations between Vietnam and the EC, the world's foremost  politico-economic center, have developed remarkably. The  European countries have highly appraised Vietnam's achievements  in renovation and foreign policy. They attach importance to  Vietnam's position in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific  region. As a result, they have reached agreements with Vietnam  to carry out long-term cooperation projects and have pledged to  continue increasing development aid to Vietnam. Having signed  an agreement on textile production with Vietnam in late 1992,  the EC is making preparations to sign an agreement with our  country on economic, trade, and scientific-technological  cooperation.    Vietnam and Laos exchanged visits by high-level party and  state delegations to consolidate and strengthen the traditional  friendship and special solidarity between the two peoples as  well as to accelerate bilateral cooperation in line with the new  situation.    Vietnam's neighborly and friendly relations with Cambodia  have been strengthened to a new level. Both sides have agreed  to settle bilateral issues step by step through peaceful  negotiations and on the basis of respecting each other's  independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and legitimate  interests in line with international law and practices and in  accordance with each country's law and customs.    The Cuban people face acute difficulties. Vietnam provided  material aid to our Cuban friends and positively supported the  Cuban people's struggle against the U.S. embargo. Our party and  government delegation's official visit to Cuba in July 1993 was  a vivid manifestation of the traditional relations and  solidarity between the two peoples.    A prominent result of last year's activities was the  normalization of our relations with international financial and  monetary organizations. On that basis, the IMF, the World Bank,  and the Asian Development Bank agreed to lend us more than $700  million in 1993, and promised bigger loans in the coming years  to improve, upgrade, and construct Vietnam's infrastructure.  The first international conference to provide financial  assistance to Vietnam convened in Paris in November 1993, with  the participation of 22 countries and 17 international  organizations. They agreed to provide us $1.86 billion in grant  aid and concessional loans during the 1993-1994 financial year.  Recently, sympathetic to our difficulties, the members of the  Paris credit club decided to reduce 50 percent of our debt,  extend our loan repayment period, and reduce the interest rates  on the remaining loans. These things testify to a clear change  in the world community's attitude toward Vietnam, a country that  is enjoying success in its renovation policy and foreign policy  of openness and is moving ahead with promising steps.    [Correspondent] Vietnamese-U.S. relations have not been  completely normalized. There have been some significant  changes, however. Could you evaluate the progress and its  effects?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] America is the only big and developed  country that has not normalized relations with Vietnam. It  still maintains a trade embargo against Vietnam. The  development of Vietnam's relations with regional nations,  developed countries, and major politico-economic centers,  however, clearly shows that the U.S. trade embargo runs counter  to the common trend.    Nevertheless, there was certain progress in the  normalization  process last year. Many meetings were held at different levels  to exchange views on issues of mutual concern and accelerate  normalization, especially the meetings between Deputy Prime  Minister Pham Van Khai and American politicians, including  high-level American officials in Washington; and the meeting  between our foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state in  Singapore.    The normalization of Vietnam's relations with international  financial and monetary organizations was effected by U.S.  President Bill Clinton's 2 July statement ending opposition to  other countries providing loans to Vietnam for the repayment of  its debt to IMF, and the 13 September statement and 23 December  decision by the U.S. Treasury allowing American companies to  participate in projects carried out in Vietnam by international  financial and monetary organizations. These moves also helped  encourage other countries to develop relations with Vietnam.    [Correspondent] Do you have any comments and predictions  regarding our foreign affairs activities in 1994?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] In 1993, our active, vivid, and  diversified  foreign affairs activities were carried out with a positive and  active spirit and with the participation of all echelons and  levels of the party, government, National Assembly, and mass  organizations. These activities achieved important results and  improved Vietnam's reputation and position in the international  community. This creates an environment of peace and stability  and favorable international conditions for Vietnam to attract  more foreign capital and technology for our economic development  and national construction and protection. This is also the  foundation for the implementation of our foreign affairs duties,  including foreign economic affairs, in 1994 and subsequent years.    Our important victory in foreign affairs confirms the  correctness of the line set forth by the Seventh National Party  Congress, concretized by the Third Plenum Resolution of the  Seventh Party Central Committee in June 1992. From this line  and from the vivid activities in past years, especially 1993, a  prominent feature of Vietnam's new diplomatic policy has been  formed. This is the policy of treasuring harmonious and  friendly relations for mutual benefit with neighboring and  regional countries. This is also the policy of diversifying  multilateral relations with all nations in the world community.  This harmonious combination is a special feature of Vietnamese  diplomacy in the renovation era that meets the rapid and  complicated changes in the world situation and regional  political and economic forces. This diplomatic policy is also  suitable to the common trend in the world following the Cold War  era.    In the new international environment, our open-door foreign  policy is integrating our country with the world community on  the basis of our chosen path and on the principles of  independence, sovereignty, international unity, and preservation  of national characteristics and interests.</p>

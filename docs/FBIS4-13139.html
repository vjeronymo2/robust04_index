			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Impotence and Despair Are Behind Israel's </F> Accusations"]    [Text] The accusations the Rabin government has leveled at  Jordan about alleged activity by Hamas [the Islamic Resistance  Movement] on Jordanian territory and about Jordanian-Hamas  relations are baseless.    These accusations stem from the Rabin government's failure  to  end the intifadah in the occupied territories and from its  frustration and despair about limiting the fedayeen operations  carried out by Hamas and other Palestinian organizations. No  doubt, Rabin himself is fully aware that the Hamas leadership in  the occupied territories is the party that plans the operations  and activities against Israeli occupation.    The Rabin government also knows that Jordan has no role in,  or any link to, the activity of Hamas or other organizations in  the occupied territories. Hamas does not consult Jordan or any  other party when it, or other Palestinian faction or  organization, carries out fedayeen operations against Israeli  occupation in order to avenge the massacre committed by the  Jewish settlers in cooperation with Israeli occupation troops.    Rabin himself certainly knows that Jordan is participating  in  the peace process and making a great deal of honest and sincere  efforts in order to champion a comprehensive and just peace in  the region at a time when Hamas opposes both the peace process  and the Oslo agreement signed by Israel and the PLO.    Jordan warns against a collapse in the peace process due to  Israel's intransigence and procrastination. It also warns that  the region could face a real disaster if the negotiations fail  on all tracks. On the contrary, Hamas and 10 other Palestinian  factions reject the Israeli terms on whose basis the Oslo  agreement was signed.    The accusations by Rabin and Peres that Jordan supports  Hamas  are either part of the pressure and harassment campaign being  pursued against Jordan -- including, for example, the siege of  al-'Aqabah -- or a new link in this campaign designed to force  Jordan into signing a declaration of principles with Israel  before, or even without, addressing the water, border, and  refugee issues.    The accusations leveled by Rabin and Peres against Jordan  and  their instigation of the U.S. Administration against Jordan are  a new sign of their government's bankruptcy and failure to take  a courageous step in order to activate the peace process on the  four tracks based on UN Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and on the  land-for-peace principle.    The Jordanian media only reported the 'Afula and Hadera  operations, carried out by Hamas, just as foreign media did.  The Jordanian media also cited foreign sources that reported  the Hamas announcement on its responsibility for these  operations from loudspeakers in Gaza mosques prior to the  statement made by a Hamas information official during his  stopover in Jordan. Israel's fabrications about an alleged  Jordan-Hamas relationship only seek to conceal Israel's  impotence and bankruptcy.</p>

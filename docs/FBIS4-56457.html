			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luiz Augusto Mendonca from Planalto Palace] </F>   [Text] Marcelo Pimentel, former Superior Labor Court, TST,  president, is the new labor minister. This afternoon President  Itamar Franco invited Marcelo Pimentel to head the Labor  Ministry. Pimentel immediately accepted the position.    Marcelo Pimentel stood out in the TST for his frank dialogue  with workers when decisions had to be made about collective  bargaining accords, and as TST president.    Pimentel possesses all qualities President Franco wants in a  labor minister. Franco wanted the labor minister to be well  accepted by all labor unions. He will replace Mozart de Abreu  Lima, who has been acting labor minister since Walter Barelli  resigned to run in this year's general elections.    The date for Pimentel's installation as the new labor  minister has yet to be set.</p>

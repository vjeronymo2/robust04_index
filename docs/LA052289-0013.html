			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> An Atlanta resident has accused actor Rob Lowe in a civil lawsuit of making  sexual videotapes with a minor female. The lawsuit was filed against the Brat  Pack star on Friday in Fulton County State Court. The lawsuit alleges that Lowe  seduced a minor into appearing in the tapes with him and another person while  he was in Atlanta for last summer's Democratic National Convention. The lawsuit  contends the 25-year-old actor "used his celebrity status as an inducement to  females to engage in sexual intercourse, sodomy and multiple party sexual  activity for his immediate sexual gratification and for the purpose of making  pornographic films of these activities." The lawsuit, obtained by an Atlanta  television station, was sealed within an hour of its filing. Fulton County  Dist. Atty. Lewis Slaton said he has a copy of the tape and is reviewing it to  determine whether criminal charges would be filed. Criminal charges would  include allegations that Lowe violated Georgia statutes involving the making of  pornographic movies with minors, Slaton said. The penalty upon a conviction is  1 to 20 years in prison. Lowe was out of the country an unavailable for  comment. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KILLEA ENTERS RACE, SETTING UP FIGHT OF THE INCUMBENTS FOR STIRLING SEAT  </P> <P> Setting the stage for a rare political showdown between two incumbents,  Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) on Monday announced her candidacy in  this December's special election in the 39th State Senate District -- a race  that will pit her against Republican Assemblywoman Carol Bentley of El Cajon.  </P> <P> Killea, a former San Diego city councilwoman who traditionally has run well  among Republicans, will need to draw on that political attribute again in order  to have a serious chance to succeed recently retired Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San  Diego) in the heavily Republican 39th District. Stirling stepped down from the  Legislature last month to accept a gubernatorial appointment to the San Diego  Municipal Court.  </P> <P> With Republicans holding a 49%-38% registration edge in the district, many of  Killea's own advisers recommended that she not enter the Dec. 5 contest.  Although Killea acknowledged that the district's demographics are slanted  against her, she also enters the race with confidence born of the fact that her  own 78th Assembly district, which she has represented for seven years, is the  most heavily Republican district held by a Democrat in the state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Choose for Themselves'  </P> <P> "Conventional wisdom has it that a Democrat, regardless of record, experience  or position on the issues, could not win in this (39th) district," Killea said.  "Perhaps they are right. On the other hand, many residents of the 39th . . .  have urged me to give the people an opportunity to choose for themselves who  should represent their interests in the state Senate, making that choice based  on a broader criteria than party affiliation."  </P> <P> Killea's entry in the race sets up a compelling contrast of styles and  philosophy with Bentley, a longtime state legislative aide who was elected to  the Assembly from the 77th District only last November.  </P> <P> Noted for a low-key style that disarms many opponents, Killea, 67, served for  four years on the City Council before moving to the Assembly. The 44-year-old  Bentley, meanwhile, is more aggressive -- and, from Killea's perspective, a bit  too eager to quickly move up the political ladder after only 10 months on the  job in the Assembly.  </P> <P> "She's not waiting very long, is she?" Killea asked, rhetorically, when Bentley  entered the race.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Differing Opinions  </P> <P> The two also differ on myriad issues -- none more potentially significant than  the always volatile topic of abortion. Killea is pro-choice on abortion, saying  that "a woman's right to make this decision is paramount and does not belong in  the hands of politicians or judges." Bentley, meanwhile, opposes abortions  except in cases of rape, incest or where the mother's life is endangered.  </P> <P> "This issue goes beyond abortion to the more constructive solution of family  planning and how to prevent the tragedy of an unwanted child," Killea said. "My  opponent voted against family planning, even when those funds could not be used  for abortion. The choice here could really not be more clear."  </P> <P> Among their other notable philosophical differences, Killea supported the ban  on military assault rifles and opposes oil drilling off the California coast,  while Bentley has cast opposite votes on both issues.  </P> <P> Though the names of about half a dozen other potential candidates have been  mentioned, only one -- El Cajon lawyer Thomas Connolly -- has taken out  candidacy papers to date. If no candidate in the December primary receives more  than 50% of the vote, the top Democrat and Republican -- along with the top  vote-getter of any minor parties entered in the primary -- will compete in a  Jan. 30 runoff.  </P></p>

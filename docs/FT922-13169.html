			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Japan reports monthly trade surplus of Dollars 11bn JAPAN yesterday reported a record monthly trade surplus of Dollars 10.98bn (Pounds 6.3bn) for March, bringing the surplus for the full fiscal year to Dollars 88.35bn, a 62.7 per cent increase and a potentially large source of trade problems for the Japanese government. The customs-cleared surplus for the year was close to the record of Dollars 89.7bn in fiscal 1986, and prompted Mr Kozo Watanabe, the trade and industry minister, to promise to rekindle domestic growth in an attempt to halt the expansion of exports. Japan's economic slowdown was reflected in the 29.3 per cent increase in the March surplus, as imports fell 8.2 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 19.32bn, while exports rose 2.6 per cent to Dollars 30.30bn. Exports for the year rose 8.1 per cent to Dollars 320.58bn, imports dipped 4.2 per cent to Dollars 232.22bn. The US Congress will note a marginal 1.2 per cent increase in Japanese imports of US products and that the bilateral deficit rose for the first time in five years, and query whether market opening measures have been effective. The US deficit in bilateral trade last year was Dollars 38.46bn, up from Dollars 38.12bn, following a 1.1 per cent increase in exports from Japan. However, the Ministry of Finance's seasonally adjusted figures showed that the surge in surplus over the past few months could have peaked, with the March surplus at Dollars 9.17bn, down from Dollars 10.43bn in February. Exports decreased 3.8 per cent to Dollars 27.92bn, imports increased 0.9 per cent to Dollars 18.75bn. For the year, exports to the EC were 5.6 per cent higher at Dollars 59.76bn, while Japan's imports from the EC declined 11.4 per cent to Dollars 31.32bn, highlighted by a 14.3 per cent fall in imports from Italy and a 25.1 per cent plunge in imports from France. Both countries' exports were hurt by the slowing of demand for luxury products. China became a lucrative market again last year for Japanese companies, with exports 45.4 per cent higher at Dollars 9.42bn, and imports up 13.8 per cent to Dollars 14.56bn. Exports to the rest of Asia rose 12.9 per cent to Dollars 106.57bn and imports rose 4.1 per cent to Dollars 72.46bn. Japan's trade with the newly industrialised economies of Asia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea now outstrips that with the EC. Exports to those economies rose 13.1 per cent to Dollars 67.78bn, and imports were 4.7 per cent higher at Dollars 27.35bn. The most significant increases in Japanese exports last year were in cars (7.7 per cent), video cameras (16.1 per cent), semiconductor equipment (12.3 per cent) and ships (22.6 per cent). Japan's machinery imports rose by only 4 per cent, and imports of cars fell 20.4 per cent by value and 25.9 per cent by volume.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Strikers win above-inflation pay accord in Bolivia Bolivia's trade union confederation emerged strengthened at the weekend after a 23-day public sector strike which forced the government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada to concede above-inflation pay increases, John Barham reports from Buenos Aires. The COB labour confederation mobilised Bolivia's largest protest movement in recent years and won pay rises of 6-12 per cent for public sector employees. Even so, public sector wages remain very low. Teachers, for instance, earn the equivalent of Dollars 90-Dollars 200 (Pounds 60-Pounds 134) a month. Bolivia's unions hold strikes almost every year as the government prepares its annual budget and negotiates a new minimum wage. The strikes this year were very bitter. Protesters blocked roads in the interior of the country and demonstrated often in the capital, La Paz. Union leaders, headed by three women from the teachers' union, went on hunger strike. Security forces broke into COB headquarters to take them to hospital for force-feeding. Mr Sanchez de Lozada, a US-educated millionaire businessman, was elected last year and is committed to continue Bolivia's market-oriented reforms, which he began as planning minister in 1985.</p>

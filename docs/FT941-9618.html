			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Arts: Youthful promise - Concert At the Wigmore Hall Marks &amp; Spencer is sponsoring a three-concert series, 'Outstanding Young Artists'. The second concert was given on Thursday by the 20-year-old pianist Leon McCawley, who failed to win the Leeds competition last September. The jury was widely thought to have made the wrong choice - especially because McCawley was roughly ten times as creatively illuminating in Beethoven's First as the eventual winner was (his name escapes me) in the 'Emperor'. My own vote would have gone, like the BBC-2 viewers' ballot, to the American Mark Anderson - unmatched for 'mature range and communicative power', I wrote here at the time. McCawley's virtues were more specialised, though brightly original and winning in the right repertoire. An 'outstanding young artist' he certainly is; but his Wigmore recital made one reflect once again that the best thing for most OYAs would be to emerge for public appearances just a few times per year, and then return to private, self-critical development. The recital's best moments had a true first-water sparkle, above all in four Scarlatti sonatas. McCawley turned period-ornamental passages with rare grace and feeling, as he had done at Leeds in Haydn and early Beethoven. Though he was artfully tender with the rubato breaks, he indulged too many of them for the good of Scarlatti's brilliant energy - and he varied them hardly at all in the many repeats. Instead of more Haydn or early Beethoven, McCawley chose to offer us the last and most monumental of Beethoven's sonatas, op. 111 in C minor. Only in the last generation or two have ambitious young pianists taken to displaying themselves in late Beethoven, like novice conductors undertaking late Bruckner or Mahler symphonies because those are famous test-pieces. The trouble is that late Beethoven is neither very showy nor outstandingly tuneful. McCawley's op. 111 was sincere and thoughtful, not much more. A fine sense of the near-orchestral muscle in the Allegro, once past a pallid prologue; then some moments of shining simplicity in the Adagio variations, not threaded upon any continuous, compelling purpose. After the interval he played Skryabin's moonstruck op. 57 pieces exquisitely and bloodlessly (which may be right). The earlier, more robust op. 42 Etudes had sensitive moments, but in no. 1 the tune disappeared altogether. In Liszt's Venezia e Napoli suite, McCawley delivered the gloomy central 'Canzone' louder than almost anything else in his programme, and the showpiece fizz of the final Tarantella never accumulated the head of steam it deserves. (Balasz Szokolay, a 1990 Leeds competitor, made something memorably electrifying of it, despite far more fingerslips.) If McCawley were to concentrate for the moment on the rich range of what he does best, that would be far better than trying to stake claims to the whole virtuoso repertoire.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Scottish spending plan is criticised The government yesterday described the 1994-95 public spending settlement for Scotland as an increase, while the opposition attacked it as a cut in real terms. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, told the Commons the Pounds 14.25bn settlement was an increase of about Pounds 250m on this year's spending and 1 per cent higher than previous plans. The 'very fair' settlement amounted to more Pounds 6,200 for every home in Scotland. Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, said total spending over the next three years would fall by more than 4 per cent in real terms. He warned that jobs and services would be cut. Comparing the spending plans with those for Wales, Northern Ireland and England, he complained that Scotland was being 'short-changed yet again'. The settlement was 'nothing short of a personal humiliation' for Mr Lang and a 'hammer-blow for Scotland'. Mr Lang said that thanks to lower inflation, spending power in 1995-96 would be 2.5 per cent higher than expected. But the government could not let that 'feed through into a higher level of real spending without jeopardising' the broader objectives of sustained growth. Apart from the Scottish Prison Service, which would get extra cash, the cost of running other departments would fall over the next three years by more than 10 per cent. Mr Lang was 'tightening up aspects of the capital control regime', and from April next year notional receipts from the lease of assets to third parties would not entitle councils to extra capital spending. But with capital spending from all sources likely to exceed Pounds 1.2bn next year, the resources available to local authorities for investment remained substantial. Mr Lang also said education spending would exceed Pounds 1.35bn next year and Pounds 1.8bn would go on industry, enterprise and training over the next three years.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Silver's retreat continues Any hope that the silver market might soon mount a successful assault on the Dollars 6-a-troy-ounce barrier appeared to have been abandoned by the end of this week. As the hedge fund buyers who recently drove the metal to a four-year high took their money elsewhere the cash price on the London bullion market subsided to Dollars 5.25 1/2 an ounce, adding 24 cents to last week's 22-cent fall. The weight of recent physical selling of silver and a fall in demand in India, the biggest market for the metal, 'suggests that Dollars 6 to Dollars 6.50 silver are unattainable levels unless the funds want to throw huge resources into the market,' said Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group. Silver's weakness further undermined other precious metals. Gold ended the week Dollars 8.95 down at Dollars 377.25 an ounce, while platinum surrendered another Dollars 12 to reach Dollars 394.25 an ounce at London's afternoon fixing yesterday. The London Metal Exchange copper market tried to regain its foothold above Dollars 1,900 a tonne (for three months metal) in mid-week. But the ground quickly gave way after it clambered to Dollars 1,901.50 on Wednesday afternoon. Rumours, emanating from Shanghai, that China would relax its tight monetary policy in the near future, helped to limit the damage but by yesterday's close the price had slipped to Dollars 1,882.50 a tonne, down Dollars 6.75 on the week. Chinese buying interest was the main support for the aluminium market after it too failed in an attempt on its next upside target - at Dollars 1,330 a tonne for three months delivery. That level was narrowly breached on Monday but by yesterday's close the price was down Dollars 12.75 on the week at Dollars 1,306.75 a tonne. Yet another market to pay the price of ambition was lead. After losing its grip above Dollars 470 a tonne on Thursday afternoon stop-loss selling pushed the three months price to Dollars 455.50 a tonne, up Dollars 2.75 overall. Traders at the London Commodity Exchange were meanwhile watching similar scenes unfold in the robusta coffee market. A continuation of the technical rally that lifted the July futures position by Dollars 74 to Dollars 1,437 a tonne last week took that price to Dollars 1,502 on Wednesday morning, but by then the traders were already looking over their shoulders for a downward 'correction', which they considered overdue. They did not have much longer to wait. By yesterday's close all but Dollars 9 of the Dollars 65 gain had been eliminated and dealers were hoping for a period of consolidation. 'The last bit of the recent rise between Dollars 1,375 and Dollars 1,500 has been very sketchy and as our previous base was around Dollars 1,350 it would be good if we could move this to Dollars 1,400,' one told the Reuter news agency. An altogether brighter performance was put on at London's International Petroleum Exchange, where the prompt delivery position for Brent Blend crude oil moved above Dollars 15 for the first time since February 3. Dealers explained that the rally was encouraged by tighter North Sea supplies and brisk demand. Earlier the market had ignored a report that members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased production last month. The Middle East Economic Survey estimated the cartel's output in March at 24.99m barrels a day, compared with the February figure of 24.76m b/b, which was already 240,000 b/d above the agreed production ceiling.  ---------------------------------------------------           LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  --------------------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------------------- Aluminium         +3,450    to    2,589,550 Aluminium alloy     -400    to       42,640 Copper              -650    to      495,475 Lead                +700    to      336,075 Nickel              +963    to      136,482 Zinc              +1,675    to    1,128,975 Tin                 +490    to       25,505  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

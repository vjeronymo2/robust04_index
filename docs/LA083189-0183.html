			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZZZZ BEST CO. INSIDER IS ORDERED TO PAY $900,000  </P> <P> A federal judge on Wednesday ordered a former ZZZZ Best Co. official to  disgorge profits and pay damages totaling nearly $900,000 stemming from insider  trading violations while at the now-defunct carpet cleaning firm.  </P> <P> Jack N. Polevoi of Woodland Hills, who pleaded guilty in June to four counts of  stock and tax fraud and other violations and is serving an 18-month prison  sentence, was ordered by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher to disgorge  $224,861 in illegal profits plus interest, and pay triple damages of $674,582.  </P> <P> The action against Polevoi, a former ZZZZ Best vice president, was based on  findings that in mid-1987 he and his twin brother, Jerry, ordered 54,200 shares  of the Reseda firm to be sold short.  </P> <P> At the time, Polevoi had inside knowledge that company founder and Chairman  Barry M. Minkow was considering resigning and the firm was "in a state of  disarray and chaos."  </P> <P> Selling short is a method by which an investor seeks to profit from a decline  in the stock price, by selling borrowed shares and buying them back later. ZZZZ  Best shares fell from more than $5 each at the time the short sales were made  to 75 cents when Polevoi completed the transactions.  </P> <P> Polevoi and others also laundered $712,000 in ZZZZ Best corporate funds and  bank loans through Las Vegas casinos in the days before the firm collapsed.  </P> <P> The penalty, while large, is dwarfed by the $26 million in illegal profits and  restitution charges levied against Minkow. He was found guilty on 57 counts of  fraud, conspiracy and other violations, and sentenced to 25 years in prison.  </P></p>

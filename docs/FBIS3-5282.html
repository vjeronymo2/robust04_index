			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 5 KYODO -- The government of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will hold a ministerial meeting  Wednesday [9 March] to map out voluntary market-opening  measures, officials said Saturday.    The government officials said the decision was made during a  50- minute meeting between Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura at Hosokawa's official residence Saturday  evening.    The ministerial session follows a U.S. decision to reinstate  the Super 301 trade retaliation provision against countries  deemed to engage in unfair trade practices.    U.S. President Bill Clinton took the action after Japan-U.S.  talks for a new framework for bilateral trade broke down last  month.    The ministerial meeting is timed to coincide with a visit to  Japan by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrives  on Wednesday for talks the next day with Hosokawa and other  government leaders on trade and other issues.    The officials said the Japanese Government plans to work out  market-opening measures by the end of March.    Japan has been under pressure from the United States and  Europe to open its markets to reduce its growing current account  and trade surpluses.    The officials said Hosokawa hopes to convey Japan's market-  opening package to Christopher at their meeting Thursday.</p>

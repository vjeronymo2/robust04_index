This conforms not only to the long-term interests of all  involved, but also benefits the peace and stability of the Asian  and Pacific region, said Qian at a meeting this afternoon with  visiting William Sutherland, deputy secretary of the South  Pacific Forum.    Sutherland stressed that the forum sticks to pursuing a  "one-  China" policy and only maintains its partner relationship with  China through dialogue. It appreciates the assistance that  China has granted to the forum and also its cooperative spirit.    He arrived here yesterday as guest of the Chinese Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs.    This morning, Liu Huaqiu, Chinese vice-foreign minister,  held  talks with Sutherland on the growth of relations between China  and the forum, as well as the South Pacific countries.    The two reached identical views on a wide range of issues.    The south Pacific forum is a government-to-government  organization with 15 members.    China has diplomatic ties with nine member countries of the  forum.</p>

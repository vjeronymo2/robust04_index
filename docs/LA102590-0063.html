			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> CIVIC CENTER PROJECT NOT INQUIRY TARGET  </P> <P> Ventura County Grand Jury Foreman Lyle Wray announced Wednesday that the jury  is not investigating Thousand Oaks' plans to develop the former Jungleland  site.  </P> <P> Wray said in a written statement that the jury "feels some members of the  Thousand Oaks community, in an attempt to influence public opinion about the  Jungleland project, may have given residents of the city of Thousand Oaks the  impression that such an investigation was being conducted."  </P> <P> Wray declined to elaborate on his statement or name the source of the  information.  </P> <P> A Thousand Oaks group has acknowledged that it distributed copies of a form  letter urging citizens to sign it and send it to the grand jury. The letter  requested an investigation of the city's handling of the $63-million project.  </P> <P> Dick Booker, a spokesman for the Committee for Government by the People and for  the People, which opposes construction of a civic center and arts auditorium at  the former wild animal park, claimed that more than 200 letters were sent to  the grand jury.  </P> <P> The committee is collecting signatures with the aim of placing a Jungleland  measure on the ballot in a special election.  </P> <P> Wray, in his statement, said he refused to allow the grand jury to get involved  in a political campaign.  </P> <P> Some city officials, including Mayor Alex Fiore, have been critical of the  Committee for Government's tactics in its attempt to stop the Jungleland  project.

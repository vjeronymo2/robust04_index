			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Just how hot is Diller's sizzle? - A look at the man behind a Dollars 7bn proposal to merge QVC and CBS Two of America's biggest takeover bids in the past six months have been multi-million dollar bets on the talents of a single individual: top Hollywood executive Barry Diller. Can he really be so very special? The question may be raised this week at a board meeting of CBS, the US television broadcasting network, which will vote on the recently proposed Dollars 7bn merger between CBS and QVC, a much much smaller television home shopping network headed by Diller. CBS would buy QVC, but Diller would become chief executive of the combined group. CBS shares rose strongly on the merger announcement, partly because of hopes this might flush out a hostile bid for the company, but also in the expectation that Diller will inject fresh vitality into the network's programming. What Hollywood calls the 'Diller sizzle' also enabled him to raise Dollars 10bn from investors and banks at the start of this year to support an unsuccessful bid for Paramount Communications, the film and book publishing company, which was ultimately acquired by media group Viacom. This faith is based on the 52-year-old Diller's impressive track record over the past two and half decades at master-minding commercially successful films and television shows. Yet there is a danger of over-inflating his reputation and creating a 'cult of Diller,' based on the proposition that everything he touches inevitably turns to gold. Being a successful Hollywood executive requires a rare combination of talents: a hard head for business, a gut instinct for popular taste, and an ability to nurture yet control creative individuals who may be wildly unconventional, profoundly egotistical and more than a trifle paranoid. 'Barry,' says one leading Hollywood figure, 'has been able to follow that fine line between being a responsible financial executive and allowing talent enough room to go out and create something very special.' The same can be said of a tiny handful of other Hollywood executives, but Diller has achieved his track record in a much greater diversity of film and television contexts than any of his peers - and in ways which show a gambler's delight in proving conventional wisdom wrong. The son of a wealthy Beverly Hills real estate developer, he dropped out of university and joined the film industry by way of the mailroom of the William Morris talent agency. He rose rapidly through the ranks of the ABC television network in the early 1970s, pioneering ideas such as the 'Movie of the Week' and the television mini-series. In 1974, aged only 32, he was appointed chairman of Paramount Pictures, one of the big seven Hollywood film studios. For the next 10 years he presided over what was widely regarded as a golden age, with hit films which included Saturday Night Fever and Raiders of the Lost Ark. He quit Paramount in 1984 after clashing with Martin Davis, the new head of its parent company, and joined the Fox studio shortly before Rupert Murdoch added it to his News Corporation media empire. Together Murdoch and Diller set out to do what most people in the industry regarded as an impossible folly: turn Fox into a fourth national broadcasting network, alongside ABC, CBS and NBC. After a hesitant start they pulled it off, but in early 1992 Diller resigned, saying he 'yearned' to be an entrepreneur like Murdoch, and wanted to run a business of his own. There then followed a 10-month Odyssey in which Diller cross-crossed America, analysing the future of the converging entertainment, computer and telecommunications industries. It was a period in which he acquired the mystique of an entertainment 'visionary' - though his public pronouncements suggest he has little clearer idea than anyone else where the brave new world of 'multimedia' entertainment is leading. The sojourn ended in a manner which shocked the Hollywood glitterati. Diller announced in December 1992 that he would become chief executive of QVC, a cable television shopping channel, the merchandise of which included tawdry costume jewellery and tacky knick-nacks. He let it be known that he saw QVC as the cutting commercial edge of a technological revolution which would transform American television: inter-activity, allowing viewers to summon up a cornucopia of goods and entertainment at the touch of a remote control button. QVC, moreover, was to be just the first step in the creation of a broad-based Diller entertainment empire. CBS could turn out to be the second step. Former colleagues say he would bring to the network an extraordinary intensity of of energy and an ability to spot creative talent, use it in a context that may not be immediately obvious, and give it free rein. But while his management style is generally hands-off, he also has a tendency to swoop down on a business and ask the right questions. He also has a reputation for impatience, intimidation and for not suffering fools gladly. Colleagues suggest this is due in part to his tendency to play devil's advocate, opposing ideas put up by his staff to test how well they have been thought out. 'He likes people who are so sure of their ideas they will lay down under a train to get them done,' says one long-time associate. 'If you're not ready for someone to challenge your ideas, then don't work for Barry Diller.' Diller has a great deal to prove on the much larger stage he now wants to command. At QVC, for example, he has done much to enlarge and improve the quality of its programming. But the group's sales growth and gross profit margin dipped in the first quarter of this year. Diller has yet to show that the up-market American consumer is ready for electronic shopping, and he faces increasing competition from established entertainment and retailing giants, who are preparing to gamble on the sector. Nor has he been very explicit about his plans for CBS and how a broadcasting network fits into his vision of interactivity. Indeed, he appears to have changed his views on broadcast television over the past year: in an interview given not long after he joined QVC, Diller was quoted as rejecting the idea of owning a TV network: 'It would be fun, but even as I say it, I bore myself.' This very private man also has to prove he has the temperament to run a large, publicly-quoted company, and be a successful entrepreneur like his mentor Murdoch. First, however, he has to capture a big enough vehicle for his talents, and he badly needs the CBS deal to go ahead: to lose one multi-billion dollar bid may be regarded as misfortune. To lose another merger partner might seriously dent the cult of Diller.</p>

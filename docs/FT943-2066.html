From the sublime to the ridiculous. Major tried a joke or two, claiming that Norma throws bread rolls at him if he drones on too long. Zulu leader Chief Buthelezi managed a better, if somewhat more obscure jest, telling reporters that he had always considered Lady Thatcher to be a man - a Zulu compliment, apparently. It was left to Nelson Mandela to lend a proper tone to proceedings. Rather than kow-towing to the parade of UK business types jostling round Major, the great man peered over their shoulders and was heard to say: 'Yes, but where is Sir Colin Cowdrey?'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Lebanese Hizballah Spiritual Leader Shaykh </F> Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah at a ceremony eulogizing Basil al-Asad  40 days after his death, held in al-Qardahah, Syria, in the  presence of Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad--live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] We have noticed, and we do not  want to accuse anyone, that there are a number of groups in this  nation who are in a hurry to achieve peace, in a hurry to  achieve normalization before peace, in a hurry to lift the  economic boycott, and in a hurry about everything. This is  because they have the new world order in mind, and because they  want to tell you something about the new world situation. They  speak about all this because they are frightened. So, they want  to achieve security quickly from here and there.    However, we see that the wise leadership in Syria,  represented by President Hafiz al-Asad, has a strategic mind. I  know him as a man who has in his awareness the history of his  nation and more. He studies this history and takes from it all  the bright points in order to illuminate all this new darkness.  This is out of his concern for the nation's strategy, that his  tactics may create a stand that people may term moderate or as  making small concessions here and there, for enlightened and  accurate tactics can never cancel strategy.    We appreciated your stand, Your Excellency the president,  when the U.S. President spoke to you about terrorism, resistance  in Lebanon, and the intifadah in Palestine. You spoke to him  about the Americans when they stood in the face of the Britons.  What stand did they have? Neither this aura with which the  U.S. President is trying to surround himself, nor this new world  order prevented you from doing all this. This is because you  believe that we are a strong nation, and that we all must, in  our media, politics, and economy, work to concentrate the  elements of strength in this nation in order to produce new  elements.    We need a cultural battle that instills in the nation the  deep values that enable it to expand. We also need a political  battle that prevents the nation from collapsing before  intimidation from here and there, but gives it confidence in  itself rather than borrowing it from here and there. The issue,  which we are experiencing now, and which we feel that the wise  leadership is now making clear, is that the international news  media, and maybe some of our own political media, claim that  peace will cause the collapse of the Arab nation because Israel  possesses creative economic capabilities, creative genius, the  strength, and the international cover, It calls on the Arabs to  prepare for collapse and arrange their matters with the Israeli  train after you arrange your matters with the U.S. train. This  is as if the nation has lost its energy, and as if the nation  has no political, economic, or media creativity. The nation has  a lot of all this creativity. A nation that has created  civilization throughout history can build civilization at times  of war and peace. The question is to be patient, to study  matters carefully, to study the situation carefully, and to  study the future carefully so that we will be free with Imam  Ja'far al-Sadiq, may God peace be upon him, who says: A free  man is free in all his affairs. He is patient over all  catastrophes, and if all catastrophes befall him will not be  able to break or coerce him.    Mr. President, you have proven that you are a free man in a  world that wants to enslave itself before others enslave it.  Catastrophes might befall you, whether they are personal or  public, in order to try to defeat your steadfastness, to  suppress you, and to prevent you from pursuing this long march.  We believe that in your experience with the nation, you were  the man who could not be defeated by catastrophes or challenges.  Based on this, we believe that you still have the awareness of  the free men. We feel that you constitute the force that has  stood strong, despite all the negative political and security  aspects, with the resistance in Lebanon, and has also stood  strongly with the intifadah in Palestine, because you know that  resistance in Lebanon and the intifadah are the bright points  amid this darkness. Therefore, we are with you concerning the  overall issue of freedom. We are with you concerning the issue  of challenge. We also agree with you that the nation must  continue to be lofty, zealous, and firm. We are also with you  in all stands that necessitate open awareness and a strong will  to see in you the man who does not care about what others say,  but cares about what the nation says, a man who does not care  about others' challenges, but cares about the challenges of  building the nation on strong bases. In light of this, we  believe that, in your great sadness, you were the great patient  man. He who has the nation's zeal in his mind and heart has the  zeal of patience in his emotions and stands. We beseech Almighty  God to preserve you for this nation, and to have mercy on the  soul of the deceased. May God make paradise be his final abode,  and grant you and the nation patience and great requital. May  God's peace and blessing be upon you.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 AUTOS PLUNGE INTO RIVER AS BRIDGE COLLAPSES  </P> <P> A temporary bridge collapsed Friday, plunging as many as four automobiles into  the swollen Great Miami River, and the people inside were feared dead. A child  was found dead in a creek flooded by the same heavy rains.  </P> <P> Widespread flooding in southwestern Ohio sent people scurrying to rooftops and  high ground. One couple and their 10-year-old son were stranded on the roof of  their house from morning until 5:30 p.m. when rescuers reached them by boat,  the Butler County Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> In Camden, rescuers used lifelines and boats to lead 30 occupants of a trailer  park through chest-high water to safety. A total of 200 people were forced from  their homes in the town of about 1,900 people southwest of Dayton.  </P> <P> Divers recovered the body of 20-month-old Brandon K. Irwin of Springfield in  Donnels Creek, northeast of Dayton, about 7:30 p.m., the sheriff's department  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Swept Out of Reach  </P> <P> Four hours earlier, authorities received a report that Brandon wandered away  from his grandmother, fell into the creek from a bridge and was swept out of  her reach. Sheriff's Lt. Vaughn McKenney said two helicopters helped rescuers  search for the boy.  </P> <P> Swift currents and the danger of floating debris prevented rescuers from going  into the river where the bridge collapsed near Miamitown, about seven miles  east of Cincinnati, authorities said.  </P> <P> Witnesses gave varying accounts of two to four vehicles falling into the river,  said Bruce Smith, chief of the Colerain Township Fire Department.  </P> <P> Hamilton County Sheriff's Lt. Col. Ramon Hoffbauer, when asked if anyone could  have survived a plunge into the river said: "I wouldn't think so.  </P> <P> "The current is moving pretty fast. I can't tell you how fast, but the rescue  crews didn't go into the water at all," Hoffbauer said.  </P> <P> Bill Brayshaw, deputy county engineer, said an engineer at the scene of the  accident, 15 miles west of here, had wanted to close the bridge. "He must have  called me just moments before the collapse," Brayshaw said.  </P></p>

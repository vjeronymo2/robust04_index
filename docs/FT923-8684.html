			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Industry pay deals remain stuck above 4% INDUSTRY pay settlements have remained above 4 per cent for three consecutive quarters, suggesting that wage inflation remains a threat to UK competitiveness. Manufacturing wage settlements averaged 4.3 per cent in the second quarter of 1992, according to the latest Confederation of British Industry pay databank, unchanged from the final quarter of 1991. The news comes a week after calls for a freeze on public sector wages from some Tory MPs and a proposal from Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's new director-general, that the government pay bill should not increase in cash terms. Any rises in pay rates should be financed, he said, through 'improvements in efficiency or reductions in government activity'. The CBI said the settlements data were evidence that pay behaviour had settled into the non-inflationary patterns of Britain's European competitors. Separate CBI figures showed that settlements paid by service sector companies have fallen to 4.3 per cent in the first half of 1992, from 7.1 per cent a year ago. 'If that pattern can be maintained into the upturn, the wage-price spiral will be broken to the permanent benefit of UK competitiveness and jobs,' said Mr Ronnie Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the CBI. But economists expressed surprise that the fall in wage settlements had ground to a halt. 'The behaviour of wage settlements has been mystifying,' said Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg Securities. 'These figures suggest that the adjustment within the European exchange rate mechanism has a long way to go.' Pay settlements had to fall to 3 per cent if UK exporters were to hold their own in Europe, said Dr John Philpott, director of the Employment Policy Institute, the employment think tank. 'We need to see considerably more progress if we are to be optimistic about maintaining Britain's competitiveness when the recovery comes,' he said. 'The question is how much more pain we have to endure to get settlements down to a competitive level, let alone to a level consistent with Mr Major's target of zero inflation.' Unemployment in July is expected to have risen by 25,000, the 27th consecutive monthly increase following an unexpectedly low rise of 7,000 in June. The figures will be released on Thursday, with average earnings data expected to show wage inflation still well above 6 per cent a year. Further evidence that the government faces mounting pressure to restrict public sector pay emerged yesterday as the 6.5 per cent pay increase recommended for top policemen was attacked. Two Tory MPs - Mr John Townend, chairman of the backbench finance committee, and Sir John Wheeler, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee - called for a smaller deal.

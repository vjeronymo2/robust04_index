			<p>BFN     [Text] Viatel and USA Link, American international call  service retailers, are engaging in unauthorized international  phone services in Korea, the Communications Ministry said  yesterday.    The ministry found the Viatel's service here was illegal in  1992 when the American firm introduced the service.    The domestic law governing telecommunications service  stipulates that the international call services shall be offered  only by the public telecommunications service providers such as  Korea Telecom and Dacom Corporation.    However, the U.S. firms resorted to clandestine services to  bypass the outright violation, employing automatic collect call  and call back systems, ministry spokesman Yi Chong-son said.    Such clandestine services are provided by Trans Pacific  Service and Link Korea, the local agents of the U.S. companies.    The call retailers have subscribers place a call to the  switching system, based in the United States, to get a return  call from the destinations in the U.S., using the call back  system.    When using the international toll free service method,  subscribers dial a secret code and the destination number. They  collect the fees by billing them on credit cards.    While taking advantage of U.S. rates which are lower than  the  domestic charge by 30 to 40 percent, the signals are identified  as originating in the U.S., making it impossible to slap a  surcharge on the services.    However, the service itself still illegal in that it uses  domestic circuits without paying a fee, Yim Song-man, a director  of international phone service of Korea Telecom, pointed out.    The connections by call back system even interfere with the  ordinary Telecom services by crowding the lines, he claimed.    The subscribers are presumed to be business firms and U.S.  servicemen who make frequent international calls, the official  said.    "On the other hand, there is no way to dissuade customers  from using the services, as the subscribers can not be  identified," he said. "Even when they are identified, it is  hard to secure evidence of the illegal service."    Though the market share of the firms remains at a meager  level for now, they will further expand their service activities  if left unchecked, he said.    Meanwhile, Viatel and USA Link reportedly claimed that their  business cannot be subject to domestic law, because the  switching actually takes place in the United States.    The ministry has delivered its complaints against the  "illegal" business, but the response from the U.S. side was the  Korea should lift the ban on the international call services by  U.S. firms, instead, the ministry spokesman said.    "Because of concerns over possible retaliation by trade  sanctions, the ministry could not take any action against their  business," he confided.    So the ministry remains helpless in the situation with its  hands tied, he added.    Spain and Japan have also undergone problems with such  infiltrations by U.S. firms into the phone service market, he  said.    To counter the low rates of the U.S. services, the ministry  will study, with Korea Telecom and Dacom, lowering the domestic  rates, he said.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Yeltsin appoints reformer as prime minister MR YEGOR GAIDAR, who has led the reform process in Russia for the past six months, was named prime minister yesterday in a surprise move underlining President Boris Yeltsin's continued support for radical economic reform. The announcement, made just before Mr Yeltsin flew to the US for talks on arms cuts and economic aid, demonstrates the Russian president's concern to reassure foreign governments and international financial institutions about the pace of reform. On his arrival in Washington, Mr Yeltsin promised 'a meaningful practical dialogue' with the US. In contrast to the cool US attitude to Mr Yeltsin a few years ago, President George Bush lavished praise on him in a TV interview, describing him as a good and courageous man. Government sources in Moscow, many of whom were unaware of Mr Gaidar's appointment, said it had not been discussed at a cabinet meeting on Thursday. Mr Gaidar has established credibility with the International Monetary Fund and with the main foreign governments as a consistent proponent of reform. Yesterday's announcement buttresses his position. Mr Yevgeny Yasin, the government's plenipotentiary to the Russian parliament, said: 'It is obvious this appointment was considered to be a higher priority, because of its international implications, than the concerns of industry about the reform programme and the government's management of the economy.' Mr Yeltsin said only last week that a new prime minister would not be appointed for some months and that he would continue to head the government as well as be president. Mr Gaidar's appointment still has to be approved by the Russian parliament, where opinion is divided. Mr Yasin said it would be 'hard to get' a majority for Mr Gaidar, while Mr Sergei Filativ, the parliament's deputy chairman, welcomed the move. In any event, it is unlikely to be settled before parliament breaks for summer at the beginning of July. This would give Mr Gaidar more than two months in which to establish his authority. Mr Gennady Shipitko, a presidential spokesman, said that the post was a 'permanent one' and signified Mr Yeltsin's 'trust in the course of reforms carried out by the Gaidar team'. President Bush said he expected his summit meeting with Mr Yeltsin to go well because of a 'comfortable personal chemistry' he had established with the Russian leader. But Mr James Baker, secretary of state, warned that the US and Russia had still not settled their differences on a new agreement to cut nuclear weapons. 'We have four or five problems, at least two of which are extraordinarily difficult,' Mr Baker said. Unholy alliance, Page 2 Mr Yeltsin goes to Washington, Page 20</p>

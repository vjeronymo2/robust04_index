			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Russian reformers to free coal price THE RUSSIAN government will free coal prices next month in its latest attempt to adhere to a radical economic reform programme agreed with the International Monetary Fund. Mr Sergi Vasiliev, director of the government's centre for monitoring economic reform, said a presidential decree published yesterday marked a victory for radicals within the government over conservative ministers' preference for an administrative increase in fixed prices. He described the decision, which was taken after 'a very big fight within the government', as a breakthrough for efforts to lift remaining price controls on energy in the face of fierce opposition from industrial lobbyists and the state bureaucracy. In an attempt to help mines earn more from exports, the decree also reduces requirements for the compulsory sale of hard currency earnings to the state, abolishes export tariffs for coal, and promises to do away with all quotas and licensing rules for coking coal from January 1. But the Russian government's timing seems geared more to reassuring the IMF as it prepares to disburse a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) loan to Moscow, and to obtaining more foreign aid when G7 leaders meet President Boris Yeltsin at their summit next month. While most other prices were freed last year, remaining controls in the energy sector have helped fuel inflation, reduced pressure on Russian industry to become more efficient, and exposed exporters to accusations in the west that they enjoy unfair subsidies. Mr Yuri Shafranik, the fuel and energy minister, said on Friday that the government aimed to free all energy prices by the end of the year. But Mr Vasiliev said yesterday it was not yet clear how and when remaining controls on the domestic price of oil would be freed and quotas on its export removed.</p>

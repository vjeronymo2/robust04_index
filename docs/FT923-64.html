			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: International interest in Latin paper to be tested A NEW spate of Latin American borrowings in the international bond markets is under way, further testing the interest of foreign investors for Latin American paper. Yesterday saw the pricing of the latest issue from the Rep-ublic of Argentina, the third since its return to the international bond market. At Dollars 250m, with a maturity of five years - longer than it has previously attempted - the issue marks a new test of the country's acceptability internationally. The bonds were priced yesterday to yield 300 basis points over US Treasuries  -considerably higher than the spread of little more than 200 basis points that has been talked about in recent weeks. Discussions with potential investors proved that Argentina, still rated only a B1 credit by Moody's after a July up-grade, has not yet achieved such levels of financial acceptability. Compared with the yield spread of some 400 basis points on another five-year issue from Telecom Argentina, the bonds were considered to be fairly priced, though an issue of this size is expected to take some time to sell. Meanwhile, another new Latin credit is about to be presented to international investors - the Corporacion And-ino de Fomento (CAF), the de-velopment fund for the Andean Pact countries (Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Colombia). The Dollars 75m issue, led by Chemical Bank, is not expected to be launched for some weeks, after a road-show to potential investors. CAF is regarded as a good credit, since the Andean Pact countries are likely to regard their debts to the fund as ranking before other international commitments, said Mr Paul Luke, an economist with Morgan Grenfell in London. In a further new issue from the region, Venezuela is preparing to borrow Dollars 115m. Unlike other borrowers, though, it is launching the bonds in Colombia in a move aimed at attracting some of the excess dollars in the country.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / France in surplus France's trade account returned to the black last month with a surplus of FFr6.2bn (Pounds 650m), fuelled by a sharp fall in imports and a modest increase in exports, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. This means that France has had a trading surplus for six of the first seven months of this year, the exception being June. This has left an accumulated surplus of FFr22.5bn from January to July, compared with a deficit of FFr26.8bn in the comparable period of 1991.</p>

A reduction from 35 to 25 percent was intended to be temporary for the period July 1, 1993, through August 31, 1994. The current issue of the Code of Federal Regulations shows the percentage requirement to be 25 percent. The percentage of a cooperative association's member milk that must be delivered to pool distributing plants to qualify the cooperative's reserve processing plant for pooling continues to be 25 percent until December 31, 1995, rather than 35 percent. This action is necessary to prevent uneconomic movements of milk for the purpose of pooling much of the market's supply. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The amendment of &sect;1036.7(d), published on July 30, 1993, and effective July 1, 1993 (58 FR 40724), will continue through December 31, 1995, and will expire January 1, 1996.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This revision is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions of &sect;1036.7(f) of the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 33922) concerning a proposed relaxation of the cooperative association reserve processing plant shipping requirement. The revision was proposed to be effective for the months of September 1994 through December 1995. The public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed notice by submitting written data, views and arguments by August 1, 1994. Three comments supporting the proposed revision were received. No opposing comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule continues to ease the pooling requirements for cooperative reserve processing plants by 10 percentage points, to 25 percent, for the period September 1, 1994, through December 31, 1995. Under the revision the total minimum quantity of a cooperative association's milk supply that is required to be delivered to distributing plants in order for the cooperative's reserve supply plant to maintain pool status is reduced from 35 percent to 25 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order for a cooperative association plant that does not qualify as a pool distributing or pool supply plant to be a pool plant, the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order requires that the cooperative must deliver to pool distributing plants a minimum of 35 percent of the total quantity of milk marketed by the cooperative, either during the month or during the 12-month period ending with the immediately preceding month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk order provides authority for the Director of the Dairy Division to increase or decrease the required shipping percentages for cooperative reserve supply plants by up to 10 percentage points if such a revision is necessary to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

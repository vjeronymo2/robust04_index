			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MIRA COSTA, NO. 1 IN NATION, TO OPEN VOLLEYBALL SEASON  </P> <P> Mira Costa High's boys volleyball team, ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA  Today, will open the season at 7:30 Friday night with a non-league match at  Loyola High, west of downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> This marks the 11th consecutive season the Mustangs have opened against Loyola.  </P> <P> Mira Costa leads the series, 6-4.  </P> <P> Coach Mike Cook's squad returns three starters from last year's team that came  within one victory of a CIF title and a perfect season. The Mustangs lost to  Corona del Mar in the Southern Section 4-A final to finish 21-1.  </P> <P> Mira Costa will center its attack around 6-foot-4 setter Canyon Ceman, 6-5  middle blocker Patrick Ivie and 6-4 outside hitter David Swatik, a first-team  All-CIF choice last season.  </P> <P> The three seniors, along with 6-7 middle blocker Mike Ashenfelter, are all  being heavily recruited by major colleges, Cook said.  </P> <P> Outside hitter Mark Shoptaw, a 6-3 junior, is the top varsity newcomer.  </P> <P> "I call them the Magnificent Five," Cook said of his leading players. "We're  just trying to find another one to fill out a starting lineup."  </P> <P> After Friday's match, Mira Costa resumes play March 9 at Palisades, one of the  top teams in the L.A. City Section.

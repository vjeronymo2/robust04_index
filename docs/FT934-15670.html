			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Bosnia partition plan unleashes expulsion wave FEARS that a plan for the ethnic partition of Bosnia-Hercegovina would unleash a new wave of forced expulsions have been confirmed. Serb authorities are evicting Moslems who over 18 months of war have remained in their home towns, designated part of the proposed Bosnian Serb mini-state. Bosnian Croat forces, too, have stepped up their drive to expel the last Moslems from territory under their control. In Bijelina, north-eastern Bosnia, Moslems willing to describe the terror seizing the prosperous town, where they once comprised half the population, speak only on condition their real names are not used. Muhamed, a middle-aged teacher who was sacked by Serb officials, tells about a state commission which rounds up Moslems and forces them to cross front lines to the Bosnian government stronghold of Tuzla. 'First they check out the houses. They choose the big ones. In broad daylight, three men arrive in a black metallic Nissan jeep. If you are lucky, they give you three hours to pack,' said Emira, his wife. In a store front on a quiet street lined with well-groomed gardens, a group of tattooed thugs boast that they are the commission's security team. One man, carries a Luger pistol, which, mimicking the sound of a gun shooting, he says he will use against anyone who interrupts his 'work'. He says his commander is Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, whose paramilitary unit in concert with the Yugoslav army in spring 1992 killed or expelled tens of thousands of Moslems from eastern Bosnia. Moslems once comprised half of Bijelina's population of 32,000. The town was the first to fall to Serbian control. The Commission selects 'candidates' for the deportations. In what amounts to a trade-off, Serbian leaders allow looting of the Moslems as long as they are expelled. Fearing retaliation, local Serbs opposed to the newest wave of ethnic cleansing remain silent. A Serbian eye-witness of the nightly round-ups says: 'A group of Serb hooligans gathers about 40 Moslems every second or third night . . . after that they are taken to agricultural high school. They steal everything from the Moslems.' Muhamed's wife, Emira says local officials place Serb refugees from central Bosnia with Moslem families in a process called cuckoo's nesting. But most Moslems are not allowed to leave. Some pay up to DM500 (Pounds 200) to 'travel agencies' to be dumped at the Serbian border with Hungary.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht bill clears first hurdle THE GOVERNMENT cleared the first of many hurdles last night in the debate over the detailed provisions of its Maastricht treaty legislation. With a comfortable majority of 132 (296 votes to 164) it succeeded in forcing an end to discussion of the first suggested amendment to the European Communities (Amendment) Bill after almost two full days of debate. The amendment - tabled by Sir Russell Johnston, a Liberal Democrat spokesman  -was then overwhelmingly rejected with a government majority of 364 (392-28). Although Euro-sceptics succeeded in delaying proceedings with a series of long speeches and much tactical manoeuvring, the outcome will enable prime minister John Major to point to some tangible progress along the road to British ratification of the Maastricht treaty when he plays host to other EC leaders at the Edinburgh summit next week. The House is not scheduled to return to the bill until the new year. In what turned out to be the final speech of yesterday's second day of the committee stage, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, emphasised that MPs were not 'discussing ratification of the treaty'. He said: 'We are engaged in detailed examination of a piece of domestic legislation required to incorporate into the framework of UK law those provisions of the treaty that need to be so incorporated.' In conciliatory vein, Mr Garel-Jones said the House owed a debt to Sir Russell for placing an amendment that went right to the heart of the matter at issue. Earlier, Mr Tony Benn, the former Labour cabinet minister, called for the abolition of the European Commission. 'No civilised democratic country would allow any power whatever to be in the hands of people who were not elected and cannot be removed,' he said. Mr Benn's was one of a number of heartfelt speeches which interspersed bouts of tactical thrust and counter-thrust as inveterate Euro-sceptics vied with government forces for strategic advantage. Interest had focused on whether Mr Bill Cash, Tory MP for Stafford, would break the modern-day record for the longest Commons speech by extending his 2 1/2 -hour contribution of Tuesday night by a further two hours. In the event, Mr Cash sat down after 14 minutes.</p>

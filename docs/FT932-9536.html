			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Sainsbury moves ahead 16.7% as sales top Pounds 10bn: Chairman says gains due to aggressive trading and cost control J. SAINSBURY, Britain's biggest retailer, yesterday reported a 16.7 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits, writes Paul Taylor. The results of the group, whose sales exceeded Pounds 10bn for the first time, compare with the 6.5 per cent profit gain posted by its rival Tesco. Sainsbury's pre-tax profits in the year to March 13 increased to Pounds 732.8m from Pounds 628m the previous year on sales that grew by 11.6 per cent to Pounds 10.27bn (from Pounds 9.2bn) including Pounds 584.2m of VAT and US sales taxes. The profit improvement, which was nevertheless at the low end of market expectations, was underpinned by a small increase in like-for-like sales volumes in the group's UK supermarkets and Savacentre hypermarkets, and by higher operating margins and a 0.7 percentage point gain in UK market share to 11.3 per cent. Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said the 'extremely strong' results had been achieved in 'very competitive market conditions'. He attributed the gains to the group's aggressive trading position and improved price competitiveness, enhanced quality and controlled costs. On prices Mr Sainsbury said: 'We have either maintained or improved our price position against all our major competitors with the exception of Asda which has been sharpening up its pricing quite significantly.' He brushed aside the threat from discount chains like Kwik Save saying: 'We have traded alongside them very successfully for years.' In the UK, supermarket and Savacentre sales increased by 12.6 per cent to Pounds 8.9bn with 23 new stores contributing 8.8 percentage points of the gain - the largest contribution from new space for 10 years. Eight stores were closed and like-for-like sales rose 3.8 per cent which, with price inflation of 2.5 per cent, resulted in a real volume gain. Another 23 new stores are due to open this year at an average cost of Pounds 17m each and 14 stores will close. The foodstores' operating profits were 19.1 per cent higher at Pounds 752.2m. Sunday trading at 160 supermarkets was only marginally profitable. The Homebase DIY store operations managed a 16.3 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 17.8m on sales which grew by 9.8 per cent - 2.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis - to Pounds 282.8m. However Sainsbury's US supermarket subsidiary, Shaw's, suffered from the continuing recession in the New England economy. Sales increased by 2 per cent to Dollars 1.85bn (Pounds 1.2bn) but operating profits fell by 11.9 per cent to Dollars 31.5m. Earnings per share were 28.47p (up from 25.69p) and an increased final dividend of 7.30p (against 6.35p) per share makes a total for the year up 14.3 per cent to 10p (from 8.75p). Lex, Page 22</p>

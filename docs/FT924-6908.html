			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Trade News: An airline decision born of embarrassment THE decision by Japan's airlines to remove the ceiling on compensation to victims of accidents on international flights was born of embarrassment shared by most world airlines and their insurers that limits on compensation set by international conventions are too low. Dissatisfaction with liability limits set by international agreements stretches back to 1955, when the US refused to be party to the Hague Protocol doubling the original compensation limits of Dollars 10,000 (now Pounds 6,622) set by the Warsaw Convention in 1929. When the Convention was adopted, a cap on liability was seen as necessary to protect the infant aviation industry from catastrophic loss for which adequate insurance cover might not be available. But by 1955 the industry was well established and the US refusal to ratify the Hague Protocol (because Congress felt Dollars 20,000 was inadequate compensation for the loss of an American life) marked the beginning of the end of uniformity on the issue of liability. The US remained a party to the 1929 convention but by 1966 had persuaded air carriers serving the US to adopt the Montreal Agreement limiting liability to Dollars 75,000 regardless of fault for all flights starting or ending in the US. In 1971 a further attempt to raise the limit to Dollars 100,000 and restore uniformity was made in Guatemala. Among other features, the Guatemala Protocol allowed parties to it to adopt a domestic system to supplement the legal liability limits for passengers. The US had been a prime mover in trying to lift the compensation limits, but did not sign the protocol, which could not come into force without US participation. Instead, it tried in 1975 to amend the Montreal Agreement by adding protocols, the third of which, Montreal Agreement Protocol 3 (MAP3), dealt with liability, raising maximum limits to Dollars 130,000. MAP3 picked up many features of the Guatemala Protocol, allowing states which are parties to it to set up supplemental compensation plans (SCPs), so that a two-tier system would arise under which airlines could be liable for the first Dollars 130,000 per passenger and the SCP, for which passengers would pay an enforced levy, would be expected to provide compensation above that amount. The UK and a number of other Warsaw countries have ratified MAP3, but by the time of this year's US election, the US had not done so, and had not introduced an SCP. MAP3 cannot come into force until 30 states have ratified it; that is unlikely to happen until the US signs. International air carriers thus face an impasse on liability. The Japanese move to adopt a special liability contract within the Warsaw Convention is an attempt to break the logjam and is likely to be followed by other carriers unless the industry, through the International Air Transport Association (Iata), takes steps to restore the uniformity missing since 1955.</p>

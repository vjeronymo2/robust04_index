			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Recession forecast to end in fourth quarter THE UK economy will begin a weak recovery from its present deep recession in the second half of this year, according to a group of forecasters using the Treasury's computer model of the economy. The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club forecasts that lower interest rates will have given a strong enough boost to business and consumer confidence by the middle of this year to stop the economy contracting. The recovery in the second half will be weak, it says, although slightly stronger than Treasury predictions. However, by the end of 1991 output will only be back to just above its 1990 level, itself barely above 1989's. In the first half of this year, gross domestic product is expected to fall by more than 3 per cent from the same period last year, making the recession nearly as deep as that of 1980-81. Item expects a further 0.2 per cent decline in output in the second half of this year and a 1.7 per cent fall for the year. By the fourth quarter, the economy will be growing by 0.2 per cent on the year. Although lower interest rates will improve corporate cash flow, the sharp fall in inflation will reduce companies' ability to boost margins by raising prices, which will further hold back growth, according to Item. Item expects the corporate sector to cut its financial deficit by Pounds 6bn this year to Pounds 21bn by way of a 12 per cent reduction in investment and by shedding labour. That will allow industry to cut its interest payments from the Pounds 23bn reached in 1990 but 'will mean continuing famine for the capital goods industry and a slow crawl out of recession'. Item expects inflation to fall to 4.1 per cent by the end of this year, while unemployment rises to 2.19m and to 2.57m in 1992. In 1992, output is expected to grow by 2.2 per cent. If oil output is taken out, the economy is expected to grow by 1.3 per cent, compared with the Treasury's estimate of 2.75 per cent.</p>

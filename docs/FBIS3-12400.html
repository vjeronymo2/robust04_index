			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference held by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat with </F> unidentified correspondents in Algiers on 28 February --  recorded]    [Excerpts] ['Arafat] As I said a little earlier, the talks  focused on the situation in our occupied land, particularly  after the abominable crime and vile conspiracy which took place  inside the holy Ibrahim's mosque, as a result of which 65  martyrs fell and 256 people were injured by Israeli armed  gangsters in collaboration with some units of the Israeli army.  [passage omitted]    Naturally, this has left bad and negative effects on the  peace process as a whole, because it proves that the Israelis do  not want peace. They are now retracting everything they have  signed. I would like to recall that Rabin said that there were  no sacred schedules. Now, there are no sacred clauses, and  tomorrow he will say there are no sacred agreements. This  indicates that they are retracting what has been agreed on and  what we signed in Washington last year. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Your Excellency, you presided over an  emergency meeting of the PLO's Executive Committee yesterday to  look into Washington's invitation.    ['Arafat] A meeting of the Palestinian leadership.    [Correspondent] Of course, the Palestinian leadership to  look  into Washington's invitation and the measures which the Israeli  authorities have decided to take in the aftermath of the  massacre of Ibrahim's mosque. What was the final decision about  these two issues?    ['Arafat] I am quickly going back after my meeting with the  president [Zeroual] to continue that meeting. The meeting has  not ended yet. The meeting began yesterday and it will be  continued today.    [Correspondent] Does this mean that you are waiting for the  Security's Council's final resolution?    ['Arafat] One of the things we are looking forward to is a  clear resolution by the Security Council condemning the crime  and setting up an investigating committee. More important than  that is international protection for our people. This was  stated in the agreement which said "temporary international  presence" [last three words spoken in English] which means  temporary international presence, and we insist that that  presence should take place as soon as possible so that we may  rest assured that our people can be protected from those  conspiracies, massacres, and trials.    [Correspondent] Your Excellency the president, what do you  say to the Israeli announcement on the imminent release of about  1,000 Palestinians, and the issue of disarming the Jewish  settlers?    ['Arafat] At the beginning they said "some".    [Correspondent] Eight hundred or 1,000?    ['Arafat] No, no, no. I am talking about the armed settlers.  He said he would disarm some Israeli settlers; some, some, some,  i.e. a few. Have you paid attention? We say the settlers  should be disarmed of all weapons, because carrying weapons  should not be allowed; second, I agreed with Peres in the Cairo  meeting on this number and more. Therefore, he brought nothing  new.    [Correspondent] Your Excellency the President, following the  Ibrahim mosque massacre, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon suspended  their consultations in the peace talks. What is the Palestinian  stance in the light of the recent developments on the  Palestinian, Arab, and international arenas?    ['Arafat] I have recalled all our negotiators not only from  Washington. I have invited our negotiators to yesterday's and  today's meetings, why? To discuss with the brother members and  heads of the delegations in Taba, Cairo, Paris, and Washington.    We enormously thank Algeria, the president, government,  leadership, and people for the fraternal, continued, and  constant stances which it adopts with the Palestinian fighters  at the different levels.

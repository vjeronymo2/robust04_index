			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late rally leaves slight decline in Nikkei Tokyo stocks fell moderately, but a late afternoon rally wiped out much of the losses and left the market in a positive frame of mind for the weekend, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225, after a weak opening, continued Thursday's downward correction. While overseas investors began buying at the opening, domestic institutions took profits by selling on rallies. The market reached an intraday low of 20,802.46 in the afternoon, then rallied in the final half hour of trading to close at the day's high of 20,954.19, down 54.81 points. Foreign purchases, which had powered the market through much of its week-long rise, were not sufficient, traders said, to overcome institutional selling and profit-taking. Volume was estimated at 380m shares, well below the levels maintained through the previous five trading days. The capital weighted 300 index closed at 306.80, down 0.9, while the Topix index of first section stocks closed 10.04 lower at 1,679.62. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.45 to 1,386.37. Mr Keith Donaldson, an equity strategist at Salomon Bros in Tokyo, admitted that 'the week's run-up was more rapid than we expected.' But he was encouraged by yesterday's light volume . Falling prices on high volume could have indicated panic selling over the nuclear stalemate with North Korea. Losers led winners by 691 to 307 with 189 unchanged. Steelmakers attracted profit taking. Kawasaki Steel, the day's volume leader, lost Y11 to Y408 as 11.5m shares changed hands. Hitachi, which had announced plans to sell low cost products outside of its normal channels under different brand names, rose Y10 to close at Y1,090 in heavy volume of 5.6m shares. Oki Electric, which had projected higher profits for the current year, gained Y9 to close at Y690 on a volume of 9.2m shares. In Osaka the OSE average fell 187.94 to 23,200.12 in volume of 34.3m shares. Roundup The region had a better day, in aggregate, after a mostly unprofitable week. BOMBAY jumped 3.3 per cent on a technicality which encouraged speculative buying. Leading companies announced annual book closures for dividend payments, which meant that the delivery period for stock would be extended to a month, giving the speculators time to play the market. The BSE 30-share index closed 129.53 higher at 4,053.23, over the 4,000 mark for the first time since February 28, when India announced its national budget for 1994/95. Depressed since then by the ban on carry-forward trading, equities revived only this week, following reports that the monsoon would be normal and a string of good corporate results. The rise on the week was 7 per cent. TAIPEI rose 1.1 per cent in active trading, the paper, financials and plastics sectors attracting buyers as the weighted index ended 67.07 higher at 6,023.69, 3.7 per cent higher on the week in turnover of TDollars 71.52bn. SINGAPORE saw last minute buying which left the Straits Times Industrial index 16.32 higher at 2,268.70, off a day's low of 2,251.79 but 2.4 per cent down on the week. Investors focused mainly on Malaysian shares after their recent losses. KUALA LUMPUR moved in much the same way, late bargain hunting taking the KLSE composite index up 10.05 to 965.49, down 3.5 per cent on the week but apparently resilient at the 950 level. SEOUL's selective advances in construction, financial and some telecommunications companies offset concerns about the North Korean nuclear problem and the composite index rose 5.00 to 942.43, off 1.2 per cent on the week. HONG KONG ended little changed, wary ahead of this month's government plans to cool residential property prices, and the Hang Seng index finished 11.93 higher at 9,234.27, a week's fall of 2.5 per cent. BANGKOK featured late bargain hunting in banking and finance, gains in both sectors after early losses limiting the decline in the SET index to 0.92 on the day at 1,358.00, down 1.8 per cent on the week.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Moshe Ishon: "The Raid in Hebron"] </F>   [Text] The raid carried out by the police and the security  forces against Jewish settlers in the center of Hebron was both  unjustified and untimely, although it ostensibly stems from the  government's decision to outlaw Kakh and Kahana Hay and to  define these two movements as terrorist groups on par with Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement]. We were astonished when the  raiders appeared at Rabbi Levinger's door with a warrant for his  and his wife's arrest.    The alacrity shown by the police and the security forces is  very surprising. If they had incriminating evidence against the  residents of Jewish Hebron, then why were they silent until now?  The excuse commonly given yesterday, that the government could  not arrest suspects before it outlawed the Jewish terror  organizations, is unacceptable.    This explanation is not only implausible, it is also  fundamentally wrong. The police are entitled to arrest  suspects, even without a warrant issued by the government  against the Kakh and Kahana Hay activists, and if they have not  done so to date, the only reason can be that they apparently did  not have enough evidence to convict anyone.    There is also reason to believe that even today they do not  have incriminating evidence against the suspects. Therefore,  there is no alternative but to view this raid as a deliberate  attempt to mollify certain elements, whether among the left-wing  partners of the Rabin government or elements linked to the PLO  and its associates, who do not conceal their demand to run the  Jews out of Hebron.    It is worth recalling that at the cabinet session two days  ago, Minister Ya'ir Tzaban demanded to apply the orders issued  against Kakh and Kahana Hay on Rabbi Moshe Levinger since he is  suspected of having carried out actions ostensibly bordering on  terrorism. The prime minister, however, objected to this  proposal, noting that it would not hold up before the High Court  of Justice.    This apparently, did not stop the police from raiding Hebron  and arresting Jews, even those who have no direct or indirect  links to the "Jewish terror organizations."    Anyway, it is doubtful that Jewish terrorist organizations  really exist. Nevertheless, even if there are suspicions to  that effect, there is no room to mention them in the same breath  with Hamas and the PLO, as Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Horin  did when he presented the decrees issued by the Rabin government  against Kakh and Kahana Hay.    The raid on the Jewish settlement in Hebron takes us back to  the darkest of times. It recalls the days of the British  Mandate, when British policemen would frequently arrest Jews to  protect, as it were, public law and order, instead of arresting  Arabs who murdered Jews.    If two days ago, when the government decision was issued,  people could be found to justify it, the next day, when the raid  in Hebron to arrest "Jewish suspects" began, it suddenly  transpired that this was a totally new direction in the  government's policy which is meant to hurt Jews without first  checking whether arrests without a court warrant, as is  customary in democratic regimes, are necessary.    Hence, we would not be overstating our case if we said that  the recent steps adopted by the government jeopardize Israeli  democracy. The State of Israel might become a police state.  Perhaps it is only symbolical that it was the police minister  who replied to the no-confidence motions in the Knesset  yesterday instead of the prime minister, who by all logic should  have responded to them rather than send a proxy....    To sum up, the raid in Hebron should give democracy  supporters in the State of Israel cause for concern. The  government should be deprived of the right to carry out  "administrative arrests" of its political rivals.    In a democratic state, decisions are made by the courts,  even  when reference is to supposedly terrorist activities....    It is about time the Rabin government understood this!</p>

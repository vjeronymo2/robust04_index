The settlement calls for IBM  to acquire the patent held by Berkeley Limited, IBM spokeswoman Cynthia Stevens  said. She declined to comment on how much if anything IBM was paying Berkeley.  Berkeley had sought more than $100 million in lost royalties from IBM and an  injunction preventing IBM for making or selling personal computers until the  expiration of its patent on Oct. 31.  </P></p>

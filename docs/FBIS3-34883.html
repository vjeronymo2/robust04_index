			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] The Georgian foreign minister arrived in Tehran  yesterday at the head of a political-economic committee and was  welcomed by our Foreign Minister Dr. Velayati. The objective  behind this visit is said to be the expansion and consolidation  of Iranian-Georgian relations and cooperation in all fields. In  the talks that were held between the officials of Tehran and  Tbilisi, the expansion of the two countries' relations,  important regional problems, the current crises in the Caucasus,  and other topics were discussed.    Iranian-Georgian relations are rooted in the two countries'  history. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, historic  and cultural ties have linked these two countries more than ever  before.    From the political aspect, the Islamic Republic of Iran  supports a peaceful solution of the problems in the Caucasus.  Tehran has always stated its readiness to mediate between the  conflicting sides in the various areas of the Caucasus. From  Tehran's point of view, the continuation of diplomatic efforts  between the conflicting sides and the neighboring countries  which are playing the role of mediators is necessary in order to  end the crises in the Caucasus, especially when the region's  political, geographic, and ethnic fabric makes cooperation among  neighboring countries for the creation of a political balance  necessary.    On the level of economic and cultural relations, eight  agreements in various fields were signed during past visits by  the two countries' officials, and the recent visit by the  Georgian foreign minister to our country is actually a  continuation of earlier bilateral talks and the implementation  of agreements that have been reached.    Currently, Iran and Georgia have started extensive  cooperation in the field of light industries, machine-building,  and mine and metal- ore explorations. Moreover, the Islamic  Republic of Iran has extended humanitarian assistance to Georgia  at the most sensitive junctures, and this shows the extent of  the affection that the Iranian nation and government feel toward  the Georgian people.    Cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Georgia  as well as among other countries in the Caucasus will be better  implemented when regional conflicts are solved and when  tranquility and stability are reestablished. Moreover, the two  countries' joint commissions as well as the joint commissions of  other regional countries should become more active, and  delegations in various fields be exchanged among the countries.    At any rate, with the opening of the Georgian Embassy in the  Islamic Republic of Iran and with the upcoming visit of our  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to Tbilisi, fundamental changes are  expected in the two countries' relations and the way is expected  to be further paved for expanded relations between the two  countries.</p>

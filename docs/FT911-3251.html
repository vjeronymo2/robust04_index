			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Auditor 'urged second opinion on disclosure' AUDITORS preparing the accounts of NatWest Investment Bank expressed 'forceful' concern over possible disclosure obligations relating to the holdings of Blue Arrow shares that the bank's subsidiaries took in the 1987 rights issue, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday. Mr Kevin MacNamara, a partner with Ernst and Whinney, told the court he had advised a second legal opinion. Mr MacNamara, a prosecution witness, said he was asked in November 1987 by Mr James Riddell, then County NatWest finance director, whether a tranche of shares could be transferred from County's corporate advisory division to the parent bank, NatWest, as a long-term investment. He replied that it was not clear that a holding from a failed rights issue could suddenly become a strategic investment. Mr MacNamara was then told of the stakes held by County, its co-subsidiary County NatWest Securities and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. It was the first time he learnt of the 'enormity' of the matter, he told Mr Alun Jones, QC, for Mr Stephen Clark, a County director and one of the defendants. He had been told that after the stock market crash NWIB stood to lose Pounds 50m and, expecting trouble from the Bank of England over its liquidity, it needed a capital injection from the parent. In January 1988 Mr MacNamara recommended NWIB's management to get a second legal opinion on the holdings from lawyers other than Travers Smith Braithwaite, the solicitors who had originally advised the bank on the rights issue. The absence of legal clarification meant that both the company and individuals were at risk, he said. What he thought were forceful points were met with a 'rather bland' reaction.  'At the end of the day, if they did not want to take that advice, they did not want to take it,' he said. Earlier, Mr Brian Winterflood, former head of market-making for CNWS, said his division would not normally have accepted a holding as large as the 31m shares worth Pounds 50m it had taken from County's corporate advisory division. He told Mr Jones such expansion of CNWS's capital commitment would have required approval from a more senior level. Mr Winterflood said he had general discontents about the County organisation at that time. It was not working as an integrated house, its standing was going down and the management was 'hopeless'. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the result of the Pounds 837m rights issue. The trial continues today.</p>

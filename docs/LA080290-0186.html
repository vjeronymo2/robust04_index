			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> B-2 BACKERS URGE WHITE HOUSE TO SAVE EMBATTLED PLANE;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: CRITICS SAY THAT UNLESS BUSH ENTERS THE POLITICAL FRAY SOON, THE  BOMBER WILL NOT SURVIVE THE UPCOMING HOUSE AND SENATE BUDGET DEBATES.  </P> <P> As congressional debate on defense spending has shifted into high gear,  lawmakers who support the embattled B-2 Stealth bomber are complaining that  White House support for the program has lacked resolve.  </P> <P> Although the Bush Administration seems to have been jolted to some degree by a  committee vote Tuesday to terminate production, some supporters warn that it  already may be too late to keep the B-2 from crashing during budget battles on  the House and Senate floors.  </P> <P> Proponents of the $63-billion program have been pressing the Administration for  weeks to push its most powerful advocate -- the President -- into the political  fray in an effort to pluck the program from death at the hands of budget  cutters. To their mounting frustration, they continue to get what they consider  a tepid response.  </P> <P> "The White House and the secretary of defense have been dragging their heels on  explaining the need for the B-2 to the American public," complained Sen. J.  James Exon (D-Neb.), the Senate's leading proponent of the radar-eluding  aircraft. "The President had better spend some political capital on this  aircraft or it could be very, very dead -- and so stealthy that no one will be  able to see it."  </P> <P> There were some signs of action Wednesday, a day after the House Armed Services  Committee dealt the B-2 program its most serious blow yet, adopting a  $283-billion 1991 defense bill that would terminate production of the plane.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security  adviser, began inviting senators to the White House to urge them to support the  B-2. And White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk suggested that the President will  boost the foundering program in a speech today, in which Bush "will address how  he perceives the U.S. defense budget and U.S. force structure in meeting the  changing demands."  </P> <P> That description of Bush's coming speech, however, failed to comfort critics  who complain that the White House is dealing with the plane as part of a larger  package of defense modernization programs. White House sources add that the  Administration believes it is too early for the President to go to the mat for  the plane because Congress is at least two months away from completing its  debate.  </P> <P> In Southern California, as many as 17,000 jobs are at stake. For the Northrop  Corp., the prime contractor of the beleaguered B-2, the termination of the  program could bring serious financial trouble, according to industry and  Pentagon analysts.  </P> <P> With the Senate floor debate due to start as early as today, the House  committee's vote to kill the B-2 was just the first of many challenges the  plane will face.  </P> <P> The Senate Armed Services Committee in mid-July recommended approval of $4.5  billion -- the Administration's full request -- to build and test two of the  bombers. But in a White House meeting last Monday, the bomber's most  influential Senate advocate, Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), warned  that without strong White House intercession, he might not be able to fend off  opponents of the program on the Senate floor.  </P> <P> As debate moves to the floors of the House and Senate, the B-2 program is  expected to be buffeted by criticism, including some from the Administration's  Republican allies.  </P> <P> During that process, one knowledgeable source said that Vice President Dan  Quayle, once a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, might be sent to  Capitol Hill to whip errant Senate Republicans into line on the B-2. So far,  however, Quayle remains on the sidelines.  </P> <P> According to Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), a staunch B-2 supporter, the Bush  Administration decided recently that it must focus its efforts on later stages  of the budget-writing process, including the conference between the House and  Senate Armed Services committees and the drafting of the defense appropriations  bills.  </P> <P> "Those who are already singing at the B-2's funeral are doing so a little too  early," warned Lewis.  </P> <P> But several lawmakers, speaking privately, called the White House effort  faint-hearted, saying that it is likely to be too little, too late.  </P> <P> The Pentagon has reinforced that impression, they said, by being unwilling to  single out the B-2 for special treatment. While Cheney has touted the plane in  speeches and congressional hearings, Pentagon officials said that he has been  careful not to suggest that the B-2 is a non-negotiable priority in the defense  budget.  </P> <P> "You have to resist the urge to cut side deals on special projects," said a  senior defense official. "We're still trying to go for an overall budget," he  added.  </P> <P> If Congress' final version of the 1991 defense budget leaves out the B-2, will  Bush use his most powerful weapon -- the legislative veto -- to get the funds  restored?  </P> <P> Rep. William L. Dickinson (R-Ala.), the ranking Republican on the House Armed  Services Committee, predicted Wednesday that Bush would veto the House bill if  it came to him in its current form. But other proponents of the revolutionary  plane warned that Bush cannot let the situation come to that, because it  probably won't work.  </P> <P> "You can veto offending provisions out of a bill," said one congressional aide  who is key to the fight. "But you really can't veto something into a bill."  </P> <P> Some Democratic supporters of the B-2, including Exon, said they suspected that  behind the White House's muted support lies a more intricate strategy: to let  Congress kill the bomber program that the Bush Administration itself has  concluded is too costly, and then accuse the Democrats in future campaigns of  having abandoned the nation's defenses.  </P> <P> Staff writer David Lauter contributed to this story.  </P></p>

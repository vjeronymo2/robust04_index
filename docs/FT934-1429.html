			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Trapped in a company flat - The Leasehold Act is creating a two-tier property market. Caroline Garnham looks at dangers for some owners The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, was designed to give people the right to buy a 90-year extension of their lease and the right to band together with other tenants to acquire a building's freehold. These rights are available if (1) you qualify under the Act; (2) the property is a flat; (3) the rent is low; and (4) the lease is long. Unfortunately, if you do not qualify under the Act, and your lease obliges you to seek consent from your landlord for a sale or assignment, you could discover that not only are these rights denied you, but also your lease may be less marketable - and consequently less valuable - than you had thought. What happens if the lease is owned by a tenant, such as a company, which does not qualify under the Act, and this company wishes to sell the lease? If the lease requires the landlord's consent on a sale, and the sale is to a tenant who does qualify under the Act, such as an individual, then the landlord can prevent the sale by refusing to give consent. In most leases, landlord's consent cannot be withheld 'unreasonably'. However, court decisions under earlier similar legislation have decided that a landlord who withholds his consent in these circumstances may not be acting unreasonably. For example, the landlord could reasonably argue that giving consent would reduce the value of his interest in the building. According to my colleague, George Littler, 'if landlords are able to withhold consent in this way, the marketability of residential leaseholds owned by corporate tenants will be restricted. This could depress their values significantly in certain areas and could create a two-tier market in residential leasehold property'. But why would anyone wish to buy their flat through a company in the first place? Take Joe, for example. He was born and brought up in South Africa. He is therefore treated as a non-UK domiciled person for tax purposes. This is a particularly advantageous status which Joe was advised to maximise with careful tax planning. Inheritance tax, which is chargeable at 40 per cent on death, is charged only on UK assets for people such as Joe. Although any flat he buys in the UK is a UK asset, it can easily be converted into a non-UK asset if it is bought through a non-UK registered company such as a Jersey company. This is why Joe was advised to buy the 65 year lease of a flat in Chelsea through a Jersey company. When the flat was first bought, Joe's visits to the UK were well under 90 days a year and he had full time employment abroad. He was therefore technically not resident in the UK, and the only tax he was advised to plan to avoid was inheritance tax. His circumstances, however, changed a few years later when he became UK resident. Because of his South African origins, he remained non-UK domiciled and continued to retain a favoured tax status. He was then advised that as a UK resident he could become liable to capital gains tax and income tax, but as a non-UK domiciliary, he could avoid these taxes by putting his Jersey company into an offshore trust, which he did. Joe wants to move. His trustees are happy for him to do so and have instructed the Jersey company to sell. An English woman called Sally wants to buy the flat but the lease requires the landlord's prior consent. The landlord has refused this because, after Sally has occupied the flat for three years, she will be entitled to buy an extended lease, and after she has occupied for 12 months she would be able to participate in the collective acquisition of the freehold. What can they do? The landlord could not normally refuse consent if Sally bought the flat through a company herself. However, if she did that she could create for herself the following tax liabilities: an income tax liability on the benefit of being provided accommodation by a company. This charge is quite onerous especially if the purchase price is more than Pounds 75,000; if the acquiring company is a UK company, she will have created a double capital gains tax charge. Tax will be charged once on the gain made by the company and for a second time, when she liquidates, or sells, the company to recover her funds. The tax would be based on the increase in value of her shares. This could have been avoided if the flat had been bought by her as her main, or her only, residence; if the company is resident offshore, again she could have a double charge to tax, under anti-avoidance legislation, and she will not have improved her inheritance tax position. Given these tax consequences, is there anything Sally could do? Depending on the terms of the lease, it may be possible for Sally to buy Joe's company or to form a company to buy the flat. Immediately thereafter, the company could execute a declaration of trust to hold it on trust for her. The sale to Sally's company should not be refused consent by the landlord because it is to another company, which will not qualify under the Act. The subsequent declaration of trust is probably not an event which requires landlord's consent, although a careful review of the lease will need to be made to be sure. Under this arrangement: there will be no income tax charge under the benefit in kind legislation; if the house is her main or only residence there will be no capital gains tax charge on sale, let alone a double tax charge; if Sally is not keen enough on the Chelsea flat to go to these lengths, she would be well advised to look for another property, either a property owned by a qualifying tenant or where the landlord's consent is not required. In some areas of central London the corporate tenant market may be large enough to ensure that the value of residential leasehold properties, such as Joe's flat, is not greatly depressed. However, it may have an adverse effect on property owned by a corporate tenant which is not in an area popular with foreign buyers. The Act will not, however, stop people like Joe planning to avoid tax since problems created by the Act can quite easily be avoided by buying the flat in your own name, as nominee for your tax efficient offshore company.

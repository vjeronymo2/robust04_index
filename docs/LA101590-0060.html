			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A MODEL COUPLE;  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: AN L.A. HUSBAND-AND-WIFE DESIGN TEAM THINK THEY HAVE THE  BLUEPRINT FOR HAPPINESS.  </P> <P> Richard Katkov and Miriam Mulder, a husband-and-wife architectural team  struggling to establish a practice in a studio behind their modest Mar Vista  house, are a couple of the '90s. But they find the experience of living and  working together "almost medieval."  </P> <P> "One thin door separates home and office," Mulder said, "just as, in the Middle  Ages, families lived behind the workshop. This arrangement, I feel, eliminates  the schizophrenia between home life and work life that most people suffer  today."  </P> <P> The converted garage that serves as their studio is painted white and crammed  with drafting tables, bookshelves, architectural models and plans. It has the  air of an adult playroom. And when the couple's 4-year-old daughter, Amelia,  comes home from nursery school, she loves to tinker with the models before her  mother takes her into the kitchen to make supper.  </P> <P> "Architecture is such a consuming passion, it can swallow up your life," Katkov  said. "Living and working under the same roof allows us to be close to one  another and to Amelia without having to shift emotional gears."  </P> <P> Katkov and Mulder, one of a handful of husband-and-wife architectural teams in  the Los Angeles area, met while studying at the Southern California Institute  of Architecture in Santa Monica. After working in other offices, they decided  to set up their own in late 1986. They began with a few residential remodeling  commissions handed down by Fred Fisher, an established avant-garde Santa Monica  architect for whom Mulder once worked.  </P> <P> "Fred's generosity gave us a kick-start," Mulder said. "At least 50% of the  work we started out with came from his office."  </P> <P> The first major commercial project the couple completed on Venice's Electric  Avenue came from a client Fisher introduced. David Hendler, a garment  manufacturer and developer, liked the way the young designers remodeled his  house, so he gave them the commission to convert a derelict plumbing supply  warehouse into a small office block.  </P> <P> 1611 Electric Avenue is situated on the edge of a workshop district wedged  between Abbott Kinney Boulevard (formerly Washington Boulevard) and the Oakwood  residential area. In recent years, several rundown concrete-block buildings off  Electric Avenue have been converted into cheap but fashionably designed office  space for small TV, film and advertising production agencies.  </P> <P> The unusual shape of the two-story block structure -- a rectangle with one  angled side -- suggested to Mulder the image of an old-fashioned camera  obscura, the most primitive camera form. This image, which graphically suggests  the films and commercials produced by the building's tenants, gave her a simple  design strategy to transform the homely old structure into a handsome and  lively presence.  </P> <P> Following the notion of a camera obscura theme -- essentially a box with a hole  in it -- Mulder cut a vertical "lens" slot into one side of the building. This  slot frames the view of a billboard-style sculpture covered with relics of the  derelict cars and other industrial trash found in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Another "lens" is created by the free-standing, zinc-covered screen in front of  the building's main entry. The metallic surface of the screen plays off the  gray stucco and black-framed steel windows of the main facade.  </P> <P> Within the building, rust-colored steel beams and angles suggest the focusing  rays projected by the metaphoric lenses. These rays focus on the tilted wall of  the main sky-lit stairwell, which in turn mimics a light-sensitive plate upon  which the external images are "projected."  </P> <P> "So much energy and thought have gone into this small act of architecture,"  Mulder said. "Even now I lie awake thinking about all the things that weren't  done the way I wanted, or that I could've done better. It's really painful and  exhausting."  </P> <P> "I'm not as hurt by such things," her husband said. "Miriam is very intense.  She's the main designer in this partnership, and I tend to manage the projects,  or we administer them together. Temperamentally, we complement one another,  which is why it works so well, I guess."  </P> <P> Mulder, 36, has intense green eyes and a pale face that is reddened by a blush  of enthusiasm whenever she talks of architecture. Katkov, 37, is tall, dark and  more relaxed.  </P> <P> "They're a talented couple," said client Hendler, "and they're also easy to  work with -- an unusual combination of virtues among designers."  </P> <P> Hendler, a South African who has completed several small office conversions in  Johannesburg, London and Sydney, speaks from a long history of dealing with  designers.  </P> <P> "Miriam and Richard have very specific aesthetic notions, yet they are flexible  enough to respond to the limitations such small-scale remodeling projects  require," he said. "Some of this flexibility has to do with their sophisticated  appreciation of the crude muscularity of old industrial buildings such as the  one on Electric Avenue, and their willingness to work with this quality rather  than mask it."  </P> <P> Architect Fisher, who first met Mulder when she was his student at the Southern  California Institute of Architecture, described her talent as "poetic and  vigorous," and her personality as "thoroughly enjoyable."  </P> <P> "Miriam was one of my best students, and I was happy to have her in my studio,"  Fisher said. "Clients liked her energy and her commitment. She has a lot of  talent."  </P> <P> Fisher said that Mulder and Katkov are among some younger architects to whom he  refers projects too small for his personal attention. And, like some other  leading designers of his generation, Fisher believes fresh young talents should  be encouraged and supported by their elders.  </P> <P> Talent aside, the struggle young architects face to make a living can be  crushing. Despite critical acclaim and the appreciation of their peers and  mentors, many young designers live on personal incomes as meager as $1,000 a  month while working up to 80 hours a week.  </P> <P> "If I'd wanted to make a decent living after five years of college, I'd have  become an attorney or an MBA," Katkov said. "Architects have to satisfy  themselves with passion, not bread."  </P> <P> "The financial uncertainty can be frightening," Mulder said, "especially for  me. I'm a mom as well as an architect, and as I watch my daughter playing, I  sometimes think all this is a real indulgence. But I simply couldn't see myself  doing anything else."  </P></p>

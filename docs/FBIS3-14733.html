The confrontation has been mainly in  the form of positional fighting. The disputing sides have  refrained from carrying out intensive combat operations.    The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Headquarters has  disclosed that heavy artillery, Grad rocket launchers, and  mortars in the eastern part of Agdamskiy Rayon pounded Armenian  positions around Salakhly, Chengerli, Novruzlu, and Marzili from  0700 to 0800 on 24 February. The NKR artillery units were  forced to open fire. Two enemy fire emplacements were destroyed.    Meanwhile, the NKR intelligence units have established that  Azerbaijan is massing reinforcements and military equipment in  various parts of the eastern front line.    The Azerbaijani military units have fired on the Armenian  defense positions in Mardakertskiy Rayon. However, the  situation at other parts of the confrontation lines between the  NKR and Azerbaijan has been relatively peaceful. Several  observers believe that tension is subsiding at the battlefronts.    Tension continues to exist on the border between Armenia and  Azerbaijan. However, the situation is relatively peaceful.

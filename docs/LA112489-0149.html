			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ERROL FLYNN'S ADOLESCENT ANGST GOES UP FOR SALE AT CHRISTIE'S  </P> <P> Kissing and fisticuffs were part of Errol Flynn's life even when the legendary  Hollywood hero was a schoolboy.  </P> <P> London auction house Christie's plans to offer a rare collection of six signed  love letters next month that the film star penned from his London boarding  school to a friend's sister, Mary White.  </P> <P> "My dear Mary . . . I was jolly angry with your brother yesterday because he  advertised to a lot of the third form that I had arranged to go out with you,  of course I slapped their gobs (mouths)," the 13-year-old future swashbuckler  wrote in 1922.  </P> <P> Three days later he wrote: "My dear Mary . . . You struck the right thing about  those kisses, there is not much in them on paper, but they are all right when  they are real, by Jove, I know, don't you, I should think you would."  </P> <P> Flynn, who died of a heart attack in 1959, wrote about the school in his  autobiography, "My Wicked, Wicked Ways." He said the two years he spent there  were the most dismal of his life.  </P> <P> Carey Wallace of Christie's said today: "I can't imagine there are any earlier  Flynn love letters. They give some fascinating insights into the frustrations  of his youth."  </P> <P> The letters, which are expected to fetch about $1,500, will be auctioned along  with a pair of bowler hats that belonged to Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy and  imitation diamonds owned by actress Mae West.  </P></p>

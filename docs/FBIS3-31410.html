			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 15 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government has  recently annulled the agreement on non-visa contact signed by  Czechoslovakia and the former Yugoslavia, CTK learnt today from  a diplomatic source in Belgrade who did not wish to be named.    The source was not able to say whether the agreement, signed  by two now defunct states, had been rescinded in order to make  way for a replacement document or whether the move represented  the introduction of visa requirement for certain republics of  ex-Yugoslavia, as the Czech Republic has already done. The  usually well-informed source believes the latter possibility  more likely.    It is not clear which republics are concerned or when the  new  visa requirements will come into effect.    The Czech Republic introduced visa requirement for citizens  of the new Yugoslav Republic (Serbia and Montenegro), and  Bosnia-Herzegovina on June 23 last year.</p>

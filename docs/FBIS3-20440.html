Japan's "Keidanren" is  an organization for the Japanese major capitalist class. It is  the behind-the-scenes boss of the ruling Liberal Democratic  Party of Japan and influences the government through the ruling  party.    In 1978, the State Council organized a governmental  delegation to visit Japan. The delegation leader was Vice  Premier Gu Mu, and I was the assistant delegation leader. In  Japan we met with three former and current Prime Ministers and  several major corporation leaders. When we met with Konosuke  Matsushita, who is called the "God of Business," the elderly man  said with pride "We keep the best talent in industry for our own  use; and send only the second best talent to government." This  illustrated the influence of the major capitalist class on  government in Japan.    Liao Chengzhi also told me that Deng Xiaoping shared his  view. This showed that the Central Committee had considered  that: 1) Political power in Hong Kong is primarily influenced by  the capitalist class; and 2) if there is to be a political party  it must consist of an organized capitalist class not of  individuals of the capitalist class. Liao Chengzhi ordered me to  support a certain tycoon in activities to organize a political  party. This indicated that the Central Committee leaders  advocated the organization of a political party. The certain  tycoon wanted at that time to organize a political party and had  even thought of a name similar to that of Britain's Conservative  Party. Later, problems developed and he shifted his support to  another group. In my activities in Hong Kong, I had urged  individuals from the upper and middle classes to "get organized"  and organize a political party. I had discussed this with Yang  Sen, Luo Kang-rui, and Szeto Wah and with Y. K. Pao and Li  Kashing. But enthusiasm was low among the upper class. I thought  of using the Hong Kong Macao International Investment Company as  a fledgling form to organize the major Chinese capitalists,  especially the major capitalists with various types of  influence, but in the end, they had no interest in cooperating  and had to "disband."    Some people critized me for being too conservative and  leaning towards the capitalist class. I felt that the special  circumstances of Hong Kong were: politically, there really was  unequal capitalist political power. Political power at the  moment was still in the hands of the British and the Hong Kong  British government primarily protected the interests of the  capitalist class. But economically, the policies and approaches  it adopted were all relatively suited to providing "fair"  opportunities for development. Thus, in the drafting of the  Basic Law, we wanted to maintain with little change the policies  of the current Hong Kong government which allowed for ample  economic freedom with little or no government interference. The  development of political "fairness," or the course of  democratization, would be on the principle of proceeding in an  orderly fashion, or one step at a time. The development of  political structure in Hong Kong would have to be adapted to  "getting organized," and to the process of the Hong Kong people  gaining an understanding of and experience with democracy. It  could not influence the stability or economic prosperity of Hong  Kong. It would not benefit anyone for the Hong Kong economy to  "collapse."    The debate surrounding the course of democratization in Hong  Kong was exceptionally intense as could be seen in the multitude  of proposals put forth by various circles. The stand-offs among  the different political proposals began when the business  community put forth a 57-person proposal and, in rebuttal, the  extreme democratization faction put forth a 19-person proposal.  Before long, the middle faction put forth a 38-person proposal.  The 57-person proposal evolved into an 89-person proposal. The  19-person proposal developed into the "190" proposal. The  British Government promoted "mutual recognition" and added  "double investigation," "double recruitment" and "4,42." After  "4 June" there were many proposals lined up.    Because the compromise among the different political  proposals and the passage of the Basic Law did not happen until  after "4 June," these events could not avoid the influence of "4  June." For convenience of narration, I will address these issues  in the later chapter "The Storm of 4 June."    (During the drafting phase of the Basic Law, the Hong Kong  people had many opinions on political issues. The points of  dispute mainly surrounded the speed of the development of  democracy in Hong Kong. This referred to the proportion of seats  for different classes of people in the legislative body and the  rate of development towards direct elections. Another area of  debate was the relationship between the legislative body and the  administration and how the head official of the administration  would be chosen. During the early phases of the drafting of the  Basic Law, society divided those with different views into the  "democracy faction," the "business faction" and the "middle  faction." The so-called "190 Proposal" was a political system  proposal jointly suppported by 190 individuals and groups in  society. The views of this faction represented the thinking of  those of the "democratic faction" of the time. Their main demand  was that the political system design, including the election of  legislative representatives and administrative officials,  develop in the direction of universal suffrage with one  person-one vote.)    The "business community's 89-person proposal" was the  political system suggestion supported by the business and  professional members of the Advisory Committee. The final draft  was supported by 89 members of the Advisory Committee and thus  was termed the "89-person proposal." The thrust of the proposal  was the establishment of a "great electoral body" with persons  from various circles. The electoral body would select  administrative officials and part of the legislative  representatives. Representatives from the business and  professional communities would occupy most of the seats in the  electoral body.    The "38-person proposal" was the concept of 38 members of  the  Advisory Committee. They combined the characteristics of the  various factions and found compromise among the views of the  different factions. For example, the nomination of  administrative officials would be done by a nomination body. The  officials would then be elected by one person one vote. They  also took a middle ground approach to the proportion of seats in  the legislative body, a compromise between the positions of the  "democratic faction" and the "business faction."    The content of these proposals changed constantly during the  drafting stage. Later, even more proposals emerged, but  generally speaking, all primarily addressed the issues of the  proportion of seats in the legislature and the extent of direct  elections.

I Discuss the "Political System" With  Youde. </H3>   [Text] The formal signing of the PRC-UK Joint Communique by  the head of both governments marked the beginning of a period of  cooperation and negotiated resolution of Hong Kong issues by  China and Britain.    Cooperation between Britain and Hong Kong during this period  was demonstrated mainly in two areas:    First: During the drafting of the Basic Law, China respected  and made every effort to include Britain's suggestions. Of  course there was debate but there was mainly cooperation and  compromise.    Second: Both sides cooperated on the issue of maintaining  prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.    During this period, I got along very well with both Governer  Youde and Governor Wilson.    On May 1 1985, Youde visited Shanghai and Jiangsu province  at  my invitation. I returned to Nanjing the day before so that I  could greet Youde at the airport with Jiangsu Governor Gu  Xiulian. Youde stayed at Nanjing's Zhongshanling No. 5 Hotel.  This was built during the "Great Leap Forward" to accomodate Mao  Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Building No. 1 was reserved for Mao  Zedong's exclusive use. Building No. 2 was for Liu Shaoqi and  other authorities of the Central Committee. Both are separate  villas with complete suites, built among ancient trees towering  overhead between the tomb of Sun Yatsen and "Ming Xiao Ling,"  the tomb of the Ming Taizu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang. After the 13th  National Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, they  were opened to the public and used to accomodate honored guests  and foreign businessmen. Responsible individuals of the Jiangsu  provincial government accompanied Youde to visit the scenic  areas and factories of Nanjing and to brief him on Jiangsu  province.    Youde was revisiting old haunts. In the late 40's, Youde was  a Counselor in the British Embassy to China. According to our  information, he was a senior intelligence agent of the British  Government. On 1 April 1949, the People's Liberation Army of  China forced its way across the Chang Jiang River, occupied  Nanjing and other large and medium cities, and controlled the  Jiangyin fortress at the passage to the lower reaches of the  Chang Jiang. At that time, the British warship the Amethyst was  on the river near Nanjing to provide assistance to the  Kuomintang. Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping issued an order to  seal off the Chang Jiang and not allow the Amethyst to "escape."  Youde obtained this intelligence. The British Embassy ordered  him to find a way to tell the warship to take the risk of  breaking through the blockade on the night of the 22d. Youde  received honors and an award for this.    At that time, I was a political committee member of the 88th  Division of the 29th Army of the People's Liberation Army. I was  the leader of a vanguard camp. On the night of the 21st, I was  in a wooden boat on the eastern stretch of the river campaign  battleline, and we stormed the shore at Changshan in Jiangyin  County. On the night of the 22nd, we were pressing towards Wuxi  when we suddenly heard artillery fire towards Jiangyin behind  us. A line in the sky several dozen miles long glowed up red  with artillery fire which finally ceased after about one hour.  Only on the next day did we know that the Amethyst had "broken  through the blockade" and "escaped."    In Hong Kong, Youde and I had talked of his desire to visit  the ancient cultural city of Yangzhou. When he was stationed at  Nanjing in the past he had regretted not being able to visit  Yangzhou. On this trip special arrangements were made for him to  visit Yangzhou, including allowing him to enjoy the artistic  treasures of the "Eight Yangzhou Eccentrics," famous painters  from the Ming and Ching dynasties. Afterwards, we crossed the  river at Zhenjiang and went to Wuxi and stayed in the Li Garden  Cottage on the edge of Lake Tai. This was the former home of Fan  Li, a doctor of the Kingdom of Wu during the Warring States  Period.    Youde's visit to Jiangsu happened to occur during the market  season for the Chang Jiang herring. During the season around  Chingming Festival, when the willow cotton flurries from the  trees, the Chang Jiang herring swims upstream from the mouth of  the Chang Jiang to spawn and this is the time when the flesh is  full and tasty. When I invited Youde in Hong Kong to make this  visit, I promised him an opportunity to taste this fish. I went  to Nanjing a day early and asked the head of the tourism bureau,  who was responsible for the visit arrangements, to have some  Chang Jiang herring for the banquet. In the end, however, Youde  did not eat herring in Nanjing because during the previous few  years, the Chang Jiang had been subjected to much industrial  pollution. Overfishing had also helped cause an annual decrease  in production so that the market supply was very low. I  expressed my apologies and promised to make up for it in Wuxi.  Who would have expected that even in Wuxi we could not achieve  our wish.    After we arrived in Shanghai, Mayor Wang Daohan held a  banquet for Youde at the Jinjiang Hotel. At the banquet, herring  unexpectedly appeared on the table, causing me great  embarrassment. I could only try to explain away my awkwardness  by saying to Wang Daohan, "You Shanghainese have money and  means. A Jiangsu product cannot be found in Jiangsu but is found  in Shanghai!" Everyone laughed. Later I asked Wang Daohan and  found out that they had especially sent someone to buy the fish  directly from a fishing boat. [End of Installment No. 58]  <H5>  [2 Jul 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] I Discuss the "Political System" with Youde;  Deep Sorrow at the Sudden Death of Youde  When Youde visited Jiangsu, Britain was already implementing a  parliamentary system in Hong Kong and there were already  conflicts between Britain and China. I exchanged views with  Youde in Wuxi on this issue. With an interpreter for each of us,  we spent about two hours talking.    I initially expressed my appreciation for success of the  Hong  Kong British government's economic policies and advisory system.  After 97, when the new special district government is designed,  these experiences will be worth studying and preserving as much  as possible. Because Hong Kong has not had a democratic  tradition, the implementation of democracy, especially "direct  elections," should not be done too quickly but one step at a  time. The future special district government will have to  protect and balance the interests of different classes. The  major owners of capital in Hong Kong are most concerned that  those involved in democratization will change the Hong Kong  government's current tax system of low taxes and narrowly  applied taxes. We must give the major capitalists time to  organize and participate in elections.    Youde explained in response to my comments that they were  designing an essential political system and would not concern  themselves only with the interests of the capital owners. On the  question of "direct elections," the Hong Kong government had  made detailed calculations and felt it could maintain "control"  and that the Chinese Government could rest at ease. "Our  attitude is very cautious," he said. I did not critique his  essential political system as a colonial dictatorship  representing the British capitalist class but said only "I hope  that Britain will not use the same methods in Hong Kong as those  used in withdrawing from other colonies." Hong Kong's conditions  and qualifications are not the same as those of other colonies.  Particularly on the economic front, both Britain and China share  the same desire to maintain economic prosperity in Hong Kong.  Furthermore, Britain would only withdraw after 12 more years. We  wanted to join with Britain to strive for unity among all  circles in Hong Kong and avoid social divisiveness or the  creation of negative effects. I used terms like "we hope that  Britain will not violate empiricism." Although our views were  diametrically opposed to each other, our purpose was cooperation  and the atmosphere was always friendly.    Later, when I discussed Hong Kong political reform with  newly  appointed Governor Wilson, I also used the expression "don't  violate empiricism."    While Youde was visiting Jiangsu, he casually mentioned that  he and his wife were both very interested in ancient Chinese  culture. I suggested that they visit Xi'an to see the recently  unearthed Qin Dynasty terracotta army. Youde was very pleased  and indicated that he wanted to find an opportunity to make that  visit. After returning to Hong Kong, Youde was very busy with  official duties and did not have time to go, but his wife wished  to go without him. I asked the authorities in Xi'an to issue the  invitation and make the arrangements.    When Youde died, his wife was touring Xi'an, accompanied by  Deng Lianru. When the news arrived, I was in Beijing  participating in a meeting of the Hong Kong Macao Office.  Everyone felt that it was terribly sudden, because on the  previous evening, Youde had attended a banquet with Ji Pengfei  at the Diaoyutai Guest House. I was also present. His health and  mood appeared fine. He even drank several glasses of Maotai  liquor. I heard that he had a heart attack during the night and  was found lying on the floor. Some people guess that he had an  attack and was going to get some medicine, but it was too late  and he collapsed. I felt great sorrow that he died this way. I  attended his funeral after returning to Hong Kong. Having been  adversaries with him for some time, I felt that we had come to  know each other well and he was a person with whom I could  communicate.    [Text] Joint Rescue of the Stock Market; Hong Kong  and Britain Jointly "Rescue the Market" Through Pu Weishi    On October 19, 1987, the United States New York stock market  crashed, and the world stock market crisis hit Hong Kong. The  Hang Seng Index lost about 1,000 points in one day. It was  called "Black Friday." The Hong Kong stock exchange Chairman Li  Fuzhao announced that the market would close four days. All the  stockholders in the market were in a constant state of anxiety,  and it was a miserable scene.    On that day it happened that Beijing's Vice Mayor Zhang  Baifa  was in Hong Kong seeking donations to prepare funding for the  Asian Games. I had invited a group of commercial magnates to a  banquet at the Meilihua Hotel, intending to ask them for  generous donations at the banquet. At that time I knew about the  stock market crisis, and we were discussing it endlessly even  before the meal. Furthermore, I knew that many among the guests  had experienced great losses. Although they attended the event,  they looked as if their thoughts were elsewhere and they were  simply forcing themselves to fulfill their obligations to  attend. I intervened with Zhang Baifa, "Don't bring up the  question of donations at the banquet today. Leave it for another  day." Zhang Baifa indicated that he understood and agreed.    I asked stock expert Xiang Zhiqiu, known as the "Great  Knight  Xiang," for advice. He suggested: "The Hong Kong government  should come out to rescue the stocks." He briefly explained his  reasoning. Although I did not completely comprehend, I grasped  the phrase "the government can come to the rescue."    Two days later, Jiang Wengui, Chairman of the Hong Kong  Macao  Management Office of the Bank of China, called and asked to see  me concerning an urgent issue relating to the stock market. I  asked him to come over immediately. He told me that Hui Feng  Chairman Pu Weishi had asked the Bank of China to work with him  to rescue the stock market. Pu had indicated that this was also  the desire of the Hong Kong British government. A total of two  billion Hong Kong dollars was needed. Three parties would  contribute the funds. The Hong Kong government would provide one  billion, Hui Feng would provide 500 million, and the Bank of  China would give 500 million. Jiang asked for my view. I  immediately convened the economic leadership team of the Working  Committee to discuss this. Everyone agreed that relations  between China and Britain were very friendly, and since this  request had come from the British Government, we could agree to  cooperate in rescuing the market. Hui Feng, however, had a much  larger volume of business in Hong Kong than the Bank of China  and a much larger interest in the stock market. The Bank of  China should not be asked to carry as large a burden. At the  same time, "rescuing the market" would also include a certain  risk which someone would have to carry but not the Bank of China  alone. The Bank of China would not demand interest, regardless  of the amount provided. All at the meeting agreed that "Society  would know that the Bank of China had joined in the `rescue of  the market.' This would indicate the Chinese Government's  support of the Hong Kong stock market with greater political  influence than economic influence." [End of Installment No. 59]</p>

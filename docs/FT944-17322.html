			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Canterbury tales University life is marked by borrowing and scrambling to make ends meet. Most students are familiar with the ritual of requesting an overdraft or wrangling a loan from parents or the government. Now, students at Canterbury University in the south of England are being offered an alternative to the traditional forms of finance. The Canterbury Local Exchange and Trading System (LETS), a community bartering scheme in which members trade goods and services such as house cleaning, gardening and bicycle repair for trade credits, is inviting students to offer their skills in exchange for an opportunity to stretch their budgets. Students will pay Pounds 2 to join and will be assigned an account denominated in the local trading unit - which in Canterbury, appropriately, is called the 'tale'. They will be given a cheque book and a directory of services provided already by the 200 members in the Canterbury pool. Once they add their talents - be it baby-sitting, computer skills or aromatherapy - to the list, they can start trading. A central record-keeper debits or credits each member's account after each transaction. LETS have become increasingly popular in Britain, where there are more than 200 schemes. The first was set up in Canada in the 1970s; since then they have spread to the US, Australia and continental Europe. Joan Culloty, of the Canterbury LETS, says: 'It will stretch students' horizons and make it easier for them to survive.'

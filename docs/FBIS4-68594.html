			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Committee on </F> Economic Policy of the State Duma: "Formula of Accord Under  Crisis Conditions"]    [Text] The movement toward national accord, which began  with the adoption by the State Duma of the Memorandum on Accord  and with the president's initiative for the preparation of an  Agreement on the Achievement of Civic Accord in Russia, which  was later supported by leaders of the constructive opposition,  in the last few weeks has become stuck in bureaucratic measures,  has been emasculated in numerous assessments by unscrupulous  interpreters, and, as a result, has been drowning in waves of  mutual distrust. The draft agreement on the achievement of civic  peace proposed by the working group for discussion does not have  a concrete content in the economic part and threatens to  transform the most important process of achievement of public  accord on the key direction in the domestic and foreign policy  of the state into a regular formal measure capable only of  discrediting the idea of the establishment of civic peace in  Russia achieved by society through suffering.    Unfortunately, the proposals by the plenipotentiary  delegation of the State Duma to conduct negotiations on the  concretization of the draft agreement were ignored. Serious work  was replaced by the initiative of several enthusiasts, who did  not possess the necessary powers to organize the coordination of  the positions of the parties on key directions in socioeconomic  policy. As a result, the text of the agreement could not be  filled with a concrete content. Yet extracting the country from  the growing socioeconomic disaster is the central element in  public accord, for the sake of which the parties agree to  combine efforts, curbing their own ambitions and claims.    The document submitted for public discussion differs in this  fundamentally from the Moncloa Pact widely used as a historical  guideline, which resembles much more a program for concrete  anticrisis actions than a political declaration. It is worth  quoting here the first lines of the preliminary agreements  adopted on 9 October 1977, with which the package of documents  known to us as the Moncloa Pact opens:    "1. In the Moncloa Palace on 8 and 9 October representatives  of various parties, which have their deputies in the parliament,  conducted a meeting with the president and government members  for the purpose of examining the first point on the agenda: the  program for improving and reforming the economy. There was a  wide discussion of the aims, means, and measures envisaged by  this program. At the same time, representatives of political  parties set forth both the differences existing among them and  points of contact.    "2. The assessment of the economic situation, which those  present defined as difficult owing to the time coincidence of  various crises, became the first matter, where mutual  understanding was achieved. In the opinion of the participants  in the conference, the unanimity of views on this matter should  serve as the basis for the adoption of measures, which under  conditions of the market economy are needed to improve and  reform economic activity for the purpose of overcoming the  crisis and lending a new impetus to the economy.    "3. Another matter, on which accord was achieved, consisted  in the need to uniformly distribute the burden of the crisis  among various social groups, as well as in the demand for  efficient democratization of the political and economic system  as the condition necessary for the acceptance of reform by all  of society.    "4. All the political parties that participated in the  conference expressed their agreement with the government about  the need to adopt a number of primarily short-term measures in  the area of monetary circulation, finances, and employment,  which would make it possible to stabilize Spain's economy in  basic indicators within 2 years..."    In Russia's present situation it is also possible to  coordinate the aims of socioeconomic policy and to develop a  program of measures for their realization, which would receive  the support of the most influential political forces--if there  were a desire. There is already the first serious result--basic  directions in domestic and foreign policy proposed by the  president in the message to the Federal Assembly received the  support of the State Duma. Of course, their concretization in  the program of measures requires serious and difficult work.  Therefore, the question is: Who will perform this work?    Two months ago in the recommendations of parliamentary  hearings "On the Economic Situation in the Country and  Legislative Support for Anticrisis Policy and Economic Reform"  it was proposed that within a 3-week period the government  develop a plan of measures to overcome the economic crisis. A  month ago the president's message "On Strengthening the Russian  State" was approved by the decree of the State Duma, which  suggested that in the shortest period the government develop a  plan of measures to overcome the socioeconomic crisis in the  country. Several events, which simplified this task, occurred  simultaneously: the adoption by the State Duma of the Memorandum  on Accord and the president's initiative in the signing of the  Agreement on the Achievement of Civic Accord. The work of "round  tables" on the concretization of basic directions in domestic  and foreign policy began.    However, the program for anticrisis measures did not and  does  not exist. Moreover, the draft of the federal budget was drawn  up as though there were neither elections on 12 December nor the  president's message setting a new course in economic policy. In  particular, in the priorities of structural policy indicated in  the president's message the draft of the 1994 federal budget  provides financing for only two ones--the fuel and energy  complex (which accounts for more than one-half of the  expenditures provided in the budget and in extrabudgetary funds  for the financing of the national economy and attraction of  foreign credits) and, to a much lesser degree, the  agro-industrial complex. State support is hardly provided for  the conversion of the defense industry, which is needed not only  for the retention of work places and production capacities in  science-intensive industry, but is also the condition necessary  for a successful modernization of the country's entire  production apparatus and for the renewal of economic growth.  Budget appropriations are not allocated in a sufficient volume  for the realization of federal goal-oriented programs, which  should ensure the initiation of progressive structural changes  in the economy. Science and education, which determine our  development in the future, are doomed to further degradation.    On the basis of an analysis of draft budget indicators and  according to the results of parliamentary hearings "On  Structural and Scientific-Technical Policy in 1994-1995 and  Until the Year 2000" the Committee on Economic Policy of the  State Duma drew a conclusion on noncorrespondence of the  structure of planned budget expenditures to the priorities of  structural policy formulated in the president's message to the  Federal Assembly.    The same also concerns another key point of the president's  message--inadmissibility of a decline in basic social  indicators. Basic social guarantees are not ensured materially  or organizationally. The draft budget envisages neither an  active policy of assistance for the unemployed, nor an efficient  protection of mother and child, nor the maintenance of an  acceptable level of education and public health services.    For the third year we are moving in the vicious circle of  declining reproduction. The process of destruction of the  country's production potential expanding around the  interconnection--reduction in production--decline in budget  revenues--reduction in budget expenditures, primarily for  purposes of development--further decline in production--and so  forth has gained strength. The policy--pursued at the same  time--of passive adaptation to the economic slump oriented  toward the balancing of the budget deficit and the  accomplishment of the ideological task of destroying the state  sector of the economy only aggravates the situation.    In order to get out of the formed vicious circle of  declining  reproduction and policy of passive adaptation, it is necessary  to change over to active purposeful actions according to  sufficiently obvious directions in overcoming the crisis.    1. Introduction of order in the system of state  finances. It is impossible to implement any intelligent  policy under conditions when the state is the biggest nonpayer  and unreliable economic partner. The practice of an arbitrary  sequestration of state expenditures, which provokes the  deepening of the nonpayment crisis, strengthening of the chaos  in the economy, and destruction of the social sphere, must be  eliminated. Of course, this will demand a sharp rise in the  responsibility and quality of work by the staff of appropriate  state departments and its personnel reinforcement. Measures to  improve the reliability of the revenue part of the budget must  be adopted simultaneously. These measures include not only the  strengthening of tax discipline and the abolition of illegal  privileges concerning taxation and foreign economic activity,  but also an increase in the reliability of the planning of  budget expenditures, improvement in the efficiency of budget  expenditures, regulation of the money and credit sphere, and  activation of nontax sources of state revenues.    Among the latter the most significant reserves are contained  in the use of rent payments from the exploitation of natural  resources, in the attraction of revenues from the use and  privatization of state property, and in the regulation of credit  emission. Revenues from the servicing of credits previously  issued by the state and their repayment are highly substantial  and at present uncontrolled. The vast profit from the 1992-1993  credit emission is spread between privileged bank and trade  structures and stimulates production activity only to a  negligible degree.    2. The introduction of order in the system of  management of state property. The uncontrolled use of state  property, while the state experiences an acute shortage of funds  and is forced to lower expenditures on the financing of urgent  social needs, is a paradoxical fact. Nevertheless, the profit  from an efficient use of state property is not even included in  the sources of federal budget revenues and revenues from the  privatization of state property form a negligibly small amount,  which is hundreds of times smaller than the value of privatized  property.    The need to establish a system of management of state  property, which is generally accepted in all countries with a  market economy, a system providing for responsibility for its  efficient use, can hardly evoke doubts in any sensible person,  irrespective of his political orientation. The mismanagement of  state property and the lack of clear responsibility on the part  of officials managing it are some of the basic sources of  corruption and chaos in the economy. Nevertheless, the extremely  ideologized and absurd policy of a spontaneous, almost free,  distribution of state property continues. It gives rise to  numerous offenses and does not promote an increase in production  efficiency.    3. The most rapid transition from the present  ideologized model of privatization to a pragmatic one.  Privatization should lead to an increase in production  efficiency and bring income to the treasury. For this state  property should be sold to those that are capable of giving the  highest price and are able to ensure an inflow of capital,  long-term profitable development of enterprises, and  preservation and increase of work places. Appropriate methods of  privatization are well known in world practice and are used in  all countries except ours.    4. Combination of bank capital with industrial  one. As a result of the insufficiently considered price  liberalization, chaotic reorganization of the banking system,  and "voucher" privatization, a serious barrier arose between  financial and production sectors of the economy. A paradoxical  situation was created, where with the most acute shortage of  financing of production enterprises and catastrophical reduction  in investments in the economy there is a vast amount of free  money taken abroad, circulating in speculative operations, and  even reserved in the Central Bank.    In order to overcome this barrier, it is necessary to pursue  an active policy of integration of banking and production  capital in the form of various financial and industrial groups  and of stimulation of production investments--both through tax  privileges and through direct state participation in the form of  share crediting and the granting of guarantees for private  investments in priority directions.    5. Reforming of the tax system, which must become  simpler, more reliable, and more efficient. The statement  about the need to lower the tax burden and to exempt income  assigned for purposes of production development from taxation  has become a platitude. The possibility of doing this,  compensating for the reduction in budget revenues by an increase  in proceeds from rent payments and the use of state property, is  also obvious. In reality, however, everything occurs the other  way round--rent income and income from the use of state property  are appropriated by privileged commercial structures and the  relentlessly decreasing tax proceeds are compensated by the  introduction of new quasi-tax payments and intensification of  the tax burden.    6. Active structural, industrial, and scientific and  technical policy of stimulation of the growth of promising  industries and of modernization and reorganization of  enterprises with worn-out and obsolete equipment. Under our  conditions of deep-seated structural disproportions, which are  caused by the technological multistructural nature of the  economy and the orientation of its science-intensive sector  toward the production of military equipment, the adaptation of  enterprises to the requirements of the market economy and  consumer demand is impossible without the attraction of serious  investments and the development of a long-term strategy. Neither  occurs by itself as a result of the action of forces of market  self-organization. Without an appropriate state policy of  support for the adaptation of science-intensive sectors of  industry to the demands of the market economy its rapid  destruction and deindustrialization of the national economy are  inevitable. In fact, this process is already gaining strength--a  sharp reduction in state and consumer demand in the absence of  an active investment policy today has led to a rapid increase in  costs and to a reduction in the competitiveness of  science-intensive industries. The repeated reduction in state  purchases is aggravated by the decline in the production of  civilian products, which, in turn, causes an even bigger rise in  the costs of products and a further intensification of the  decline in production.    Today the decline in production in science-intensive sectors  of industry greatly exceeds 50 percent and continues to grow,  passing into the phase of an irreversible destruction of the  country's scientific and industrial potential. If existing  tendencies remain, by the end of the year it is possible to  expect an irrevocable loss of hundreds of promising, new  technologies, break-up of labor collectives, and physical  destruction of many advanced technologies and production  capacities.    7. Concentration of social expenditures on direct  support for very needy population groups and investments in  "human capital"--training and education of the rising  generation, retraining of dismissed personnel, and settlement of  migrants with a simultaneous reforming of the system of pension  and medical security on the basis of individual and collective  insurance.    The presently implemented economic policy evolves in the  opposite direction: Ever fewer funds are being invested in  "human capital" with a rise in the relative share of  unproductive expenditures on the financing of the current  consumption of the nonworking population. The continuation of  such a policy under conditions of the decreasing revenue base of  the budget and increase in the share of the unemployed  population will signify an increase in taxation on labor  expenditures with the lowering of the quality and productivity  of labor and, ultimately, the most rapid further reduction in  the competitiveness of the domestic economy.    8. Debureaucratization of the state regulation of the  economy. It must be ensured through strict observance of  stable legislation setting the rules of economic relations and  access to resources, not by administrative-distributive methods.  Bureaucratic obstacles to the access of new firms to the market  must be eliminated maximally and favorable conditions for the  establishment and development of new enterprises in various  fields of activity must be created. These conditions must  include an access to sources of capital, to free production  capacities, to sales markets, to the transport and information  infrastructure, and to the necessary natural resources. For now  all this fully depends on the will of state bodies of executive  power, which are more engaged in extortion and the planting of  administrative arbitrariness than in the creation of conditions  for the development of entrepreneurship and competition.    9. Subordination of the regulation of foreign economic  activity to the interests of development of domestic  production. The set of tools is well known here--currency  control, stimulation of the domestic export of goods of a high  degree of processing, protection of the domestic market against  the threats of unscrupulous foreign competition by means of  measures of tariff and nontariff regulation, stimulation of  advanced structures by means of a corresponding differentiation  of customs tariff, and so forth.    Today the steps taken in this area are obviously  insufficient  and not thought through. To this day currency control has not  begun to operate, customs tariff is formulated under the strong  effect of political market factors, and the interests of the  national industry are not reflected in the foreign economic  policy being implemented.    Only some directions in economic policy, the obvious need  for  which does not evoke doubts among the overwhelming part of  political forces, are enumerated above. The purposeful  implementation of these directions can ensure a rapid positive  breakthrough in the development of the economic situation and  receive extensive political support. A corresponding program of  measures could fill the socioeconomic section of the agreement  on the achievement of civil accord in Russia with a concrete  content, also forming the basic subject of the agreement, for  the sake of which the contracting parties would agree to a  voluntary limitation of political activity.    Unfortunately, hardly any active steps in any of the  directions enumerated above are being taken. The economic policy  being realized proceeds from the thesis that the crisis will be  overcome by itself, as soon as inflation is brought down to a  sufficiently low level. In order to bring inflation down, it is  considered sufficient to minimize the budget deficit and credit  emission. And then, perhaps, something will turn up.    The hopelessness of such a policy is clearly demonstrated by  the practical experience of the last 2 years. In fact, it serves  as a justification for the inactivity of the government, which  prefers passive adaptation to the political situation instead of  an active anticrisis policy, finding activities connected with  the endless division of the dwindling budget pie, allocation of  credit emission, and distribution of state property quite  comforting and attractive.    In fact, helplessness, inactivity, and embezzlement of state  property hide behind the pseudoliberal rhetoric. Today it is  quite evident that, without the strengthening of state  responsibility for all directions in economic policy, it will  not be possible to overcome the decline in production or the  galloping inflation. The suppression of the latter is possible  only as a result of the implementation of the directions in  economic policy enumerated above with the observance of obvious  limitations on the growth of credit emission and the amount of  the budget deficit. Conversely, as experience shows, keeping the  latter within acceptable limits is impossible without an active  economic policy in the many directions partially enumerated  above. The suppression of inflation and macroeconomic  stabilization can become only the result of an active  structural, institutional, investment, social, and other  components of economic policy, not the prerequisite, as  advocates of the theory "everything is formed by itself" believe.    Today as never before during the postwar history the country  needs a responsible and competent government capable of pursuing  an active and purposeful policy in national interests and  leaning on the wide support of the public. The coincidence of  the basic directions in domestic and foreign policy with program  propositions of the constructive opposition proclaimed by the  president makes it possible to form a wide coalition of  political forces in the support of a sound economic policy and  of the government realizing it. It is vitally important to  realize this possibility, filling the agreement on civil accord  in Russia, which is being prepared, with a concrete economic  content.</p>

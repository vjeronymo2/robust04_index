			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Wool sales held in the past week presented a mixed picture. Superfine merinos were dearer at Australian sales which included limited offerings of these categories. With future supplies this season negligible and little held in stock competition was intense, even while demand for other merinos tended to ebb a little. The overall Australian market indicator ended the week at 523 cents, 23 cents below its peak earlier this month. Wool sold well in New Zealand and South Africa meanwhile, and special circumstances helped to underline strength in prices paid for British wool, already considered relatively dear internationally. The trade in general is showing reluctance to sell more cheaply or act on the assumption that wool prices may not rise further soon.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POMONA COUNCIL CUTS 3 CITY POSTS FROM BUDGET TO GET FUNDS FOR POLICE  </P> <P> Arguing that the city desperately needs more money for police protection, the  City Council's new majority voted last week to eliminate three top-level staff  positions and cut funding to the Pomona Economic Development Corp.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 1 Wednesday to eliminate the positions of Deputy City  Administrators Sanford Sorenson and Dayle Keller and Executive Assistant Hector  Godinez from the 1989-90 budget. In the same vote, the council moved to  redirect revenue from a 30% surcharge on business licenses from Pomona Economic  Development Corp. to the Police Department.  </P> <P> Council members C.L. (Clay) Bryant, Nell Soto and Tomas Ursua said the cuts  were needed to help provide an additional $3.1 million for public safety  services, including $1.7 million for police. Eliminating the three posts will  save $226,290, and redirecting the business surcharge is expected to net the  city an additional $180,000.  </P> <P> The action could result in the termination of longtime employees, such as  Sorenson, who has been with the city 28 years. Soto said the council will let  interim City Administrator Andrew Lazzaretto decide whether other positions can  be found for the three staff members.  </P> <P> "That's the city administrator's prerogative," she said. "We need to save  money, and we need money for the Police Department. We have to find a way to  get more policemen on the street."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Series of Actions  </P> <P> The budget cuts were the latest in a series of actions by the new council  majority that was created when Ursua took office April 18. And as in the case  of last month's firing of City Administrator A.J. Wilson and hiring of  Lazzaretto, the actions of the majority were opposed by Mayor Donna Smith.  </P> <P> "I find it incredible that they can just wipe out three people, and I hope Mr.  Lazzaretto is not going to be an ax man," Smith said. "The new self-proclaimed  majority is finally starting to unveil their plan for the new direction for the  city that we keep hearing about and I think it stinks."  </P> <P> Councilman Mark Nymeyer, who was absent during the votes on Wilson and  Lazzaretto, was unable to attend Wednesday's meeting. But in an interview last  week, he said he opposed the actions taken by the new majority and what he  perceived as a penchant for suddenness and secrecy among the three.  </P> <P> "This style of decision-making will only embitter the community toward their  leadership," Nymeyer said. "It also creates a great deal of tension and  emotional upheaval among the city employees."  </P> <P> Soto said the council's decision Wednesday night "was not some capricious or  whimsical act."  </P> <P> "This is something that must be done," she said. "For too long, we've been  sitting up there on the council wringing our hands about not having enough  police."  </P> <P> Soto added that the criticism of the new majority's actions is political sour  grapes. "The problem is not Lazzaretto, the problem is not Wilson, the problem  is the loss of power by the people who have run Pomona for the past 100 years,"  she said. "The shoe is on the other foot now and it pinches."  </P></p>

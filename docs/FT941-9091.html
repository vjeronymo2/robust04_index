			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Lower tax bill lifts Westfield Westfield Holdings, the Australian property group and shopping centre operator which this month purchased a 40 per cent interest in Centremark Properties in the US for USDollars 185m, reported a fall in pre-tax operating profits, to ADollars 20m (USDollars 14.2m) from ADollars 24.4m, in the six months to end-December. However, a substantially lower tax charge of ADollars 5.72m, against ADollars 11.2m, and an abnormal surplus of ADollars 3.94m, against ADollars 2.41m, left profits after tax up by almost 16 per cent, at ADollars 18m.</p>

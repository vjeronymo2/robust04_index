			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Market reforms of public services criticised GOVERNMENT reforms to introduce market forces into health, education, housing and social services are struggling to achieve their goals, says a report published today. The study, backed by the government-funded Economic and Social Research Council, found that schools and housing associations had become much more competitive. But the reforms have largely failed to introduce real competition into health and social services. Instead they have created healthcare monopolies in many parts of the country, with most contracts being placed with a few large hospitals. Where competition has been introduced, market reforms could work to the detriment of the most disadvantaged, the report says. In education, schools catering for disadvantaged children and those in poorer inner-city areas are losing their share of funds. The reforms are in danger of widening the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots' in education, says the study. Health, school education, low-cost housing and social services are no longer provided by government agencies, but bought in from trust hospitals, schools, housing associations and care organisations. In each case, government agencies fund the service, but the money goes to those providers which are most successful in winning customers. Quasi-Markets and Social Policy.

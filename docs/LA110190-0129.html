			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MORE FIRMS REFUSE TO CALL IT A NIGHT;  </P> <P> HOURS: COMPANIES RANGING FROM APPLIANCE REPAIR SHOPS TO PHARMACIES ARE CASHING  IN ON A GROWING DEMAND FOR SERVICES IN THE WEE HOURS.  </P> <P> It's 3 a.m. You hear a noise in the attic -- a thwaaang sound that tells you  something big was snatched by traps the pest-control men set last week. But the  commotion has produced sounds of scurrying -- a small river of rodent feet  crisscrosses the floorboards above you. You imagine that they seek some sort of  revenge.  </P> <P> Can't sleep? There's good news for insomniacs beset by rodents, computer  breakdowns, dental aches, thoughts of lost keys, dirty laundry and more. Just  look for the flashing neon sign: "Open 24 Hours."  </P> <P> More businesses are advertising around-the-clock services, partly in response  to increasing demand.  </P> <P> "Nationwide, there are 20 million people still active at midnight," said  Timothy Schneider, founder and publisher of the 24HOURS Emergency Yellow Pages  published in Santa Monica. The numbers were released by the U.S. Bureau of  Labor Statistics. "That number drops to its low point of 10 million at 3 a.m.  -- so there's never less than 10 million active at some point during the night.  More and more businesses are seeking a competitive advantage by extending their  hours."  </P> <P> Rex Beaber, a West Los Angeles psychologist and attorney, said an increase in  two-income families has contributed to the trend. "Lack of a homebound spouse  who is free during the day to run errands means errands need to be run during  off-hours," Beaber said. "But customers pay a premium when they shop a 24-hour  establishment. I call it a convenience tax -- they have to pick up the extra  costs that are needed to stay open late."  </P> <P> Recognizing the consumer demand, Pacific Bell caters to insomniacs by printing  an Extended Hours Guide at the back of its Yellow Pages book.  </P> <P> Need more help?

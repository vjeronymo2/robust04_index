			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: Jefferson Smurfitt US interests in refinancing THE US interests of Jefferson Smurfit, which were the subject of a complex Dollars 2.9bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, are being refinanced via a Dollars 400m equity investment. Jefferson, the large Irish paper and packaging group, combined its main US paper and paperboard interests in a highly leveraged deal three years ago. This deal involved the acquisition of Container Corporation of America (CCA), a paperboard company Jefferson had bought in the mid-1980s, and Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (JSC), its St Louis-based subsidiary, by a leveraged buy-out vehicle called SIBV/MS Holdings. SIBV/MS Holdings, in turn, was - and is - 50 per cent cent-owned by Jefferson Smurfit, and 50 per cent by an investor group led by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. The LBO deal netted Jefferson Smurfit some Dollars 1bn in cash, and transformed its balance sheet. According to yesterday's announcement, 'certain' existing shareholders in JSC and CCA have agreed on the principal terms of new Dollars 400m equity investment in the US operation. The investment will be made partly in cash, and partly via the conversion next year of JSC's outstanding preferred stock. About Dollars 200m of JSC's subordinated debt will be bought back at a premium, and new Dollars 400m bank facility, underwritten by Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust, will be provided. Proceeds of that facility will be used to prepay part of the US operations' present bank facility. JSC confirmed that Jefferson Smurfit will put up its full Dollars 200m share of the equity investment. However, because it owns all the outstanding preferred stock which will convert, its cash commitment will be only approximately Dollars 35m. Completion of the deal is subject to the negotiation of a definitive agreement.</p>

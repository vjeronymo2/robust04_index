They opted to determine  first how a United Nations-sponsored arms register would fare  out.    Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino, who  attended  the recent special ASEAN senior officials meeting in Bangkok,  reported that ASEAN member-states have taken a cautious stand on  the Philippine proposal since it was wider in scope than the  existing UN arms monitoring mechanisms.    "More or less we felt that the UN arms register should be  allowed to see how it works first," Severino said.    The UN arms register is limited to monitoring exports and  imports of major weapons system such as missiles, tanks, and  combat aircraft. The Philippine proposal includes the exchange  of information among ASEAN member-states on the indigenous  production of conventional arms systems and military  expenditures.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Private View: The king's holiday of a lifetime - The exiled monarch of Greece caused uproar by taking his family there this summer. Does King Constantine want his throne back? SO, I said, did you enjoy your holiday? The question was not innocent, especially not on the day the Greek government collapsed. The former king of Greece smiled blandly. 'I did indeed. Absolutely. It was a great holiday - all the family together on this small boat going round our country, which was a wonderful feeling.' Was it not spoilt by the crowds, the television cameras, the warships and aircraft following you? 'The shouting of the crowds was wonderful, the warships I could have done without. There were certain moments of tension, but a lot of relaxation, and swimming and running around with the little children. 'No, we had a good time,' he added. 'It was just some elements in the Greek hierarchy got the wrong impression. I think they assumed a lot and over-reacted on that assumption, and therefore the trouble started.' The man who styles himself His Majesty King Constantine, former King of the Hellenes, but whose enemies call 'Mr. Constantine Glucksburg', enraged republicans by taking his wife Anne-Marie and five children on a tour of his homeland last month, the first since he fled into exile 26 years ago. On his return to London, where he lives, the ex-king conducted a round of interviews arranged by his public relations courtiers. I was ushered into his Mayfair office for an audience which included his elder daughter Alexia and second son Nikolaos. 'I don't understand why they had to over-react,' Constantine innocently continued, though conceding that the nightly display of popular enthusiasm on sympathetic TV channels might have had something to do with it. Wasn't it naive of you not to anticipate the fuss, I asked? It's not as if you went incognito, slipping ashore at night for an ouzo in the local cafe. 'Thank God nobody yet has accused me of being naive.' Did you not foresee how politically sensitive your holiday would be? He paused. 'I anticipated that there would be quite a considerable amount of support, quite an amount of indifference and quite an amount of hostility. 'I didn't actually know how people would react. I really didn't' You guessed that Karamanlis would throw a wobbly, didn't you? (Karamanlis, the 86-year-old Greek president, organised the 1974 referendum which abolished the monarchy and threatened this summer to resign if the royal party were not kept under surveillance). 'It's not a concern of mine because I'm a private citizen and I'm entitled to do what I want. If he wants to have a wobbly . . . well, he can go and wobble. 'Don't forget that for 18 years since the Republic was proclaimed I have deliberately kept away because I didn't want anybody to accuse me of interfering. 'Eighteen years is a long time for the Republic to get on with its act. It should be strong enough to cope with a private citizen going back.' He did not add that until he sorted out his tax dispute with the government last year, a visit could have been risky. 'The other consideration I had was my children. My children are Greeks, educated as Greeks. We speak Greek to each other. They speak Greek to each other. It's their homeland. They want to start going back. I thought the time had come . . . ' Why go back with such a fanfare? 'It wasn't a fanfare. That was created by the authorities at home once I got there. They could have easily, simply, ignored it.' You could have gone on a package holiday to Corfu . . . 'There would be a fanfare. The moment I set foot . . . ' Nobody would know who you were. 'You bet your life they would] The moment I come out into the streets the whole of Corfu would come out.' What conclusion did you draw about the level of your support? (Surveys suggest it has fallen from 30 per cent in 1974 to 10 per cent today.) 'No conclusions at all. I wouldn't even think about that in terms of percentages. I was taken aback quite honestly by the fact that wherever we went we were treated so kindly.' Given the political instability of the Balkans, do you think kings have a part to play? 'It could well be. It's very hard to answer that truthfully. I think there is a very good chance that it could happen. It doesn't necessarily mean that it will.' Was your holiday a test? Or was it just a tease? 'It was neither a test nor a tease. If it was a test there would have to be a hidden agenda. I don't have a hidden agenda.' Constantine lit another cigarette. 'Nobody in my family, and certainly not I, is going to do anything to try to overthrow the republic. 'Quite honestly, and quite legitimately, I want to have the rights of every Greek citizen.' But have you renounced your ambition to sit on the throne of Greece? 'I have said nothing of the sort. I have simply said that the Greek people are sovereign. I will do nothing to prejudice their sovereignty. They can do whatever they like. 'If they were given the opportunity to say 'we want a referendum' and then 'we want the king back', I would do it.' You'd like to be King of Greece again? 'Absolutely, provided the Greek people wanted it. I would not like to be King of Greece just for the sake of it. You can only be a sovereign, and constitutional monarchy can only work, certainly in Europe, if it's by the free will of the people.' What conditions would precipitate such a demand? 'I haven't the faintest idea.' Can you see anything in the present system which leads you to hope? 'I don't see it on the political agenda at the moment at all.' So you've been a king in waiting all this time, I said, like an actor waiting for the producer to call? 'I wouldn't describe it like that. I would do that if I didn't have any other interests in my life. I am a very happy man. I've got a wonderful family. I've got a lot of interests around the world. I'm not sitting around for the telephone to ring, under any circumstances.' When, at the start, I asked him how he liked to be addressed, Constantine affected not to care. His publicity material speaks differently. I asked him why he did not drop his title. 'What name shall I take? I mean, I don't have another name.' Don't you have a family name? 'No, never had one.' What is your name, then? 'King Constantine.' So who is this Mr. Glucksburg? 'It's an invention. A total and absolute invention.' Glucksburg, he said, was merely the German name for the place in Denmark from which his ancestor King Christian IX had come. 'It's as if you were called Mr Kensington or something.' You said you are not just a king in waiting. But what is your job? 'Looking after my family,' Constantine replied. He talked about the association of Kurt Hahn schools he had founded. (They include Anavryta, where Constantine was educated, and Gordonstoun, where his cousin the Duke of Edinburgh was sent). Have you ever had a job as such? 'No, no, no.' Have you ever worked for money? 'No.' There are stories you worked for the Shah of Iran, and that you sold armoured cars. 'I know, I read all those things, too.' How do you live? 'With difficulty. But I have to find my way.' Who pays for this office? 'I find the means of doing it.' Is it John Latsis? I mentioned the Greek shipowner who has given Pounds 2m to the British Conservative Party. 'No.' Or anybody like him? 'I'm not going to get involved in that, I'm sorry. That's my private business.' If it became clear that Greece would never want a monarch again, and your funds ran out, what kind of job would you seek? 'I suspect that I might knock at your door.' Journalism? 'Yeah.' Why do you say that? 'I don't know. Just interests me. I used to be quite interested when I was a kid in the theatre. Used to put up Shakespeare and ancient Greek tragedies. I loved doing that. So I might go on stage or be a journalist.' Would you feel it beneath you to ask for a job, having sat on a European throne? 'No, no, that wouldn't bother me in the least but I'd be amazed if I got the job. Very difficult to employ a 53-year-old guy.' He lit another cigarette. As a former head of state, he said, he could help promote inward investment and tourism. He talked about re-occupying the family palace at Tatoi, and opening his remaining acres for public recreation. 'I want people to understand,' he said, dropping the languid manner and setting his face, 'that I am going to go back now, all the time. There are people who don't like that. Tough luck. They can't have the luxury of their Republic as well as me sitting in exile. I've been polite enough for 18 years. 'I can understand that people think there must be a hidden agenda and other motives. But I tell you that there isn't'</p>

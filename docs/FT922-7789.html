			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A long and dismal haul EVEN FOR those who believe that a recovery is imminent, the economic news in Britain this week must have seemed unremittingly awful. The bits that mattered could best be summarised in telegrammatic form: inflation up, unemployment up, Olympia &amp; York down. The only consolation for the government was that the recent election result has temporarily punctured the old joke about the economist's lag being the politician's nightmare. But that does not make it any less of a nightmare for everyone else. It also begs the question of what is happening to the economy now. It is, of course, possible to put a gloss on the bad news. The jump in the year-on-year headline inflation rate from 4 per cent in March to 4.3 per cent in April was less than expected and reflected a number of price increases specific to April. These included the budget increases in excise duties and the annual rises in the poll tax, rents and water charges. More worrying was the 12-month increase in average earnings, which was back up to 7.5 per cent in March after the February figure had been revised upwards from 7.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent. Here the mitigating factors were the urge by employers in March last year to postpone settlements as inflation came down, while this year they were paying bonuses early to pre-empt Labour's tax plans. Moreover, pay settlements, which are not fully reflected in average earnings until a year has elapsed, have been falling much faster than earnings. Even so, the failure of average earnings to fall below 7 per cent after three years of hard disinflationary grind is a sorry outcome for the government's efforts. With the jobless total at 2.7m and rising, inflation in UK manufacturing earnings is still among the highest in the OECD area, outstripped only by Italy, Greece and Portugal. This curious dichotomy between North European hair shirt and Mediterranean indulgence raises awkward questions about the thrust of policy. A rate of interest that might be appropriate for the purpose of squeezing inflation out of the labour market has the unwelcome by-product of throttling over-indebted property companies and home owners. That is why the path towards economic recovery is proving so long and difficult. The path for the bank creditors of Olympia &amp; York Developments - a name that aptly captures the element of hubris in this Canadian-based group's global expansion - will be longer than most. Olympia &amp; York is about to submit to a bankers' work-out. And with much of its Pounds 6.7bn debt committed to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands it will do so partly under British monetary discipline. That is important; because whereas North America has been seeking to escape from its debt overhang by reducing nominal interest rates and pumping reserves into the system, the British authorities remain, as we have seen, more preoccupied with inflation than debt. So any work-out for sterling debt will be very different from the last one in property during the mid-1970s. Then, inflation was running at over 20 per cent. Real interest rates were negative and the real burden of debt was eroding rapidly. In the meantime, the impact of the property crash on the banks was partly blunted by historic cost accounting and valuers' sleight of hand. This time inflation is lower and it offers less help to asset values. Positive real interest rates mean that the gap between income and debt service is widening painfully and inexorably. As a property entrepreneur aptly quipped, in thanking the outgoing chairman of Barclays this week for a speech, 'we owe you more than we can ever repay'. In the absence of a dramatic shift in monetary policy, which seems unlikely with Britain in the ERM, this means that the problems of over-indebted property companies will continue to worsen. The question about the ability of the British banking system to finance an economic recovery becomes more acute by the day.</p>

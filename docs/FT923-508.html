			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Letter: Misdirected blame for textiles job losses in UK Sir, John Bridge attacks the World Development Movement's campaign to phase out EC quota restrictions on clothes and textiles from poor countries (Letters, September 18) in the name of lifting British workers out of poverty. He is on shaky ground. Only last week the Low Pay Unit reminded us that many British clothing workers are illegally paid less than even the pitiful minimum wage of Pounds 2.63 an hour, putting them in the consumer bracket hit most by the 5 per cent hike in clothing prices caused by the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA). Further, by blaming the third world for job losses he attacks the politically easiest target, not the most economically significant. The lion's share of textile and clothing consumed in Britain is made here or imported from other developed countries. More than 80 per cent of our textiles imports come from other rich countries, mostly other EC countries. To the extent that imports are to blame for job losses (and most studies show technological change and the level of domestic demand to be far more important), we should look across the Channel, not the southern oceans. Under the MFA, British consumers pay Pounds 1bn a year to allow the government to enforce quotas against poor countries but not the rich. The arrangement costs the third world Dollars 50bn annually - nearly as much as all western aid put together. Instead of penalising the third world with trade barriers, would it not be better to redirect the costs of protection into modernising some of the 'antiquated' plant which Italian textiles giant Zucchi says deters it from investing in Britain ('Zucchi keeps its head down on expansion', September 24)?

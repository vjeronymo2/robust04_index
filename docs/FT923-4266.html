			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The challenge to the east THE EUROPEAN Community's introverted agonising over the Maastricht treaty is having a wholly unwelcome side effect. It is drawing western European governments' attention away from an issue which will have a significant bearing on their own political and economic future: relations with the countries to their east. It is preventing them from elaborating a coherent strategy to encourage prosperity and consolidate democracy in central Europe. As Mr John Major reminded his audience at yesterday's UK presidency conference in London, events outside the present borders of the EC over the next 10 years will be just as important to western Europe as what happens within them. Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, put it more graphically. Without real hope of economic improvement in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, he said, scores of ethnic and territorial disputes could proliferate in such a way as to make the Yugoslav conflict seem like a rehearsal. The consequence would be a political, social and economic upheaval from which western Europe could scarcely remain immune. Grudging concessions Post-communist reconstruction in Europe presents an enormous challenge, but it is one to which the EC has not even begun to rise. To a lengthening queue of would-be eastern adherents, the Community has offered the distant prospect of membership and paltry economic aid. To the three countries that are closest by geography and level of development - Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary - it has given association agreements that provide somewhat greater tangible benefits. But even in these cases, the concessions are limited and grudging, with exports to the Community of goods such as chemicals, textiles, coal, steel and farm produce subject to severe restrictions. Far from a flowering of free trade between eastern and western Europe, EC governments - such as that of Mr Attali's native France - are allowing protectionist instincts to prevail. They need to be reminded forcefully that trade is the east's only viable medium-term means of self-improvement. That is why the proposals which Mr Attali put to yesterday's conference  - for a rapid renegotiation of the Community's existing association agreements, and the launch, preferably at the Edinburgh summit this winter, of multilateral free-trade negotiations in Europe - deserve a hearing. Natural markets His implication is that it is not good enough for EC governments simply to respond to the clamour for assistance from eastern European countries by promising eventually to admit them as members or offering half-hearted economic agreements. Negotiations on enlarging the EC will be long and tortuous and, in any case, the countries of the European Free Trade Association are first in line. Even given the political will, no former communist country has the remotest prospect of joining the Community within the next 10 years. More to the point, the eastern European states will only get to that stage by being able to export freely to their natural market, the EC. How best to free intra-European trade? And where should the line be drawn? Mr Attali's proposal - for negotiations to create a North American-style free trade area involving 40 countries - sounds over-ambitious, not least because it would stretch to states scarcely identifiable as European. Inevitably, the EC will have to focus its initial efforts closer to home - probably on the countries of central and eastern Europe proper, with which the west's economies have historic links and for which the west has a heavy political responsibility, rather than the republics of the former Soviet Union. Ideally, it would elaborate a model free-trade agreement on favourable but not exclusive terms with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and suggest that other countries join when they are ready. As Mr Major said yesterday, the EC is based on a simple idea: that by binding the nations of Europe in a common economic framework, war would be rendered impossible. It is time that the Community applied this logic to the nations on its doorstep.</p>

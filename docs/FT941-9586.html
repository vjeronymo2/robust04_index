			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Riding the theme park rollercoaster: Tibigardens hopes to avoid and exploit EuroDisneyland's difficulties As Euro Disney faces meetings with creditor banks, a rival leisure group is putting the final financial touches to a Pta41bn (Pounds 200m) project. It plans to open the biggest theme park in Europe after EuroDisneyland, outside Salou, near Tarragona, on Spain's Mediterranean coast. Grand Peninsula, which owns the theme park site, called Tibigardens, was created in 1988 by Busch Entertainment Corporation, the leisure arm of Annheuser Busch, the US beer and food giant which also operates US theme parks. Since then it has been joined by two large Spanish shareholders. The British Tussauds group - part of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times  - is negotiating to become the largest shareholder as well as the park's manager. A final round of meetings began last week between Grand Peninsula and ICO, Spain's official credit institute, to obtain a Pta15bn borrowing facility. Afterwards, Grand Tibidabo, the Barcelona holding group which has 70 per cent of Grand Peninsula's equity, will sell 30 per cent of the equity to Tussauds, place 20 per cent with a Spanish investor and retain 20 per cent. The theme park's other shareholders are Busch Entertainment, with a 20 per cent stake, and Fecsa, a Barcelona-based electrical utility. Tibigardens is being monitored with interest by leisure industry analysts. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, of Morgan Stanley in London, said: 'Just because Euro Disney has got problems, it doesn't mean that major theme parks in Europe are bound to fail.' Comparisons between Euro Disney and Tibigardens are 'difficult because they are on a different scale', says Mr Ray Barret, a Tussauds director. The Paris park attracts 11m visitors a year, while Tibigardens expects 2.7 million in its first year. Even Tibigardens' highest ambitions are well short of Euro Disney's. It hopes attendance will rise to 3.5m a year, and eventually 5m after expansion. But the chief difference between the two parks should be financial. Mr Ole Bredberg, managing partner of Axel group, the Madrid investment bank which has advised Grand Peninsula, says Tibigardens will be profitable from the beginning. This forecast owes a great deal to what has been learnt from the Paris venture's problems. Mr Bredberg explained: 'We have put together the profitable end of Euro Disney.' The main differences between the two are: Tibigardens is just a theme park. It has avoided high fixed costs by shelving plans to build a large beach side hotel and 2,000 living units. Mr Barret said: 'Euro Disney got its theme park right and what went wrong was its inability to fill its (six) hotels.' Tibigardens is in a resort area, including Benidorm, where it does not need to build hotels. There are some 800,000 hotel beds within 200km. The park is aimed at holidaymakers who will visit the attractions - ranging from Mexican villages to Polynesian islands - for a day trip. EuroDisneyland is open all year, rain or shine. Tibigardens will only open for 156 days between April and October and the climate is warmer and sunnier than Paris. During this period more than 15m foreign tourists are within striking distance of the park. The financial structure differs markedly from Euro Disney's. According to the Axel group's valuations, total fees in royalties and management payable by Euro Disney to Walt Disney stood at 31.5 per cent of operating income when the Paris park opened in 1992 and are supposed to rise. Fees paid to Busch Entertainment for the design of the park and to Tussauds for its management will fall from 12.4 per cent of operating income when the park opens next year to 10.4 per cent in 1998 and will decrease further. With the financing in place, the park should open in April next year, that is as long as the construction of the magic mountain proceeds as planned.</p>

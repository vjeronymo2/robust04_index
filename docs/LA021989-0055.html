			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TASTE TEST;  </P> <P> CAL POLY STUDENTS SAMPLE, RATE FOOD THAT MAY BECOME THEIR SCHOOL CAFETERIA FARE  </P> <P> It was thumbs up for pepperoni and cheese egg rolls, thumbs down for chicken  tenders.  </P> <P> On the Brian Bickhart scale of 1 to 5, the egg rolls clearly deserved the top  ranking.  </P> <P> And the bite-size pieces of fried chicken called tenders? "They tasted gross,"  said the young gourmand with a grimace.  </P> <P> Bickhart, 18, was one of hundreds of Cal Poly Pomona students who served as  food critics Wednesday at the Los Olivos Food Fair. It was an opportunity for  students to try new foods and to help choose what will be on future menus at  the school cafeteria.  </P> <P> For the third year in a row, food suppliers were invited to set up booths at  Los Olivos, the central dining room for 1,200 resident students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Items Will Be Added  </P> <P> The students sampled and rated the various products. Their surveys will be  reviewed by the college's food services department, and some items will be  added to the regular menu.  </P> <P> Previous student favorites added to cafeteria fare include knishes, egg rolls  and praline ice cream. Also picked have been items for the health-conscious,  such as bulgur wheat and sugar peas.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Los Olivos was filled with the aroma of chili mingled with a hint  of stuffed shrimp and pizza. It was lunchtime gridlock as hungry students piled  plates with food from the 30 vendors.  </P> <P> Standing near a display of fruit pies and brownies, Food Services Director  George Way said he got the idea for the food fair after reading about an East  Coast college that held one. Among the 19 campuses in the California State  University system, he said, Cal Poly Pomona is the only one that sponsors such  an event.  </P> <P> For Bickhart, an accounting major, the fair was an opportunity to help change  the "cycle of food" he eats in the cafeteria.  </P> <P> "A lot of times, if (normal cafeteria meals) look bad, we just go for cereal.  That's neutral," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3 Platefuls  </P> <P> "Today is like Thanksgiving," said Mark Lipin, 20. He had devoured three plates  of food, with no signs of slowing down, and gave high marks to the chimichangas  and chili.  </P> <P> Some students carried 2-foot loaves of French bread under their arms. Others  politely asked for strawberries and were given an entire pint container.  </P> <P> Most of the students interviewed preferred spicy ethnic foods, fresh fruit and  pastries. Over the years, Way said, he has seen an increase in requests for  fresh seafood and vegetarian and ethnic entrees as students have grown more  nutritionally conscious.  </P> <P> Student appetites are ferocious, observed Dennis Livingstone of Rudy's Farm, a  food manufacturer. His booth served 360 sausage- and-biscuit sandwiches, many  of them second helpings.  </P> <P> "I went to college here, but they never had anything like this," said Jane De  Bie, a representative from Atlas Horn. She served 600 fruit-juice spritzer  samples and dozens of muffins and bagels.  </P> <P> Crowds of students lined up at the Bentley's Produce display, where wooden  crates brimmed with flowers, fruits and vegetables. The chocolate-covered  strawberries went quickly, Bill Bentley said as he opened another crate of  grapes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Huge Quantities  </P> <P> Starving students are no surprise to Way. "For one lunch, we'll use 1,600  hamburgers and 130 pounds of fries," he said. The dining hall serves an average  of 3,000 meals a day. In a year, he said, students consume 17,000 gallons of  milk, 12,500 hot dogs and 35,000 dozen eggs.  </P> <P> Way, a food industry veteran for 30 years, said he always gets requests for  lobster tails and filet mignon, but those items would break his budget.  Students get three all-you-can-eat meals for about $7.40 per day, he said.  </P> <P> "We're taking some pastries back to our room," said Sherrie Chung, 18, stuffing  her book bag with some extra muffins, pastries and a juice spritzer.  </P> <P> Chung's roommate, Julie Deal, 18, balanced two paper plates covered with  cheesecake slices and muffins in one hand. In her other hand was a half-eaten  ice cream sample. "Thank goodness we have a big refrigerator," she said.  </P></p>

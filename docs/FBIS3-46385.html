			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "China Economic News" column: "Policies for </F> Attracting Foreign Investment To Undergo Comprehensive  Readjustment"]    [Text] Reportedly, China will soon hold a national work  conference to consider the comprehensive readjustment of its  policy for attracting foreign investment.    The basic guiding points for the adjustment of the policy to  attract foreign investment are as follows:    --Maintaining the stability and continuity of existing  policies.    --Gradually making industrial policy and taxation policy for  foreign-funded enterprises converge with those for domestic  enterprises, thus effecting fair competition and equal treatment.    --Adapting relevant regulations to the requirements of GATT  rules and international practice.    Local policies for attracting foreign investment will also  undergo major adjustments. Over the last 10 years and more,  China's opening up to the outside world was mainly effected by  its policy of opening up the coastal areas and offering  favorable policies to coastal areas, special economic zones, and  development zones. Henceforth, the same policies will be applied  to various types of localities. New development zones will no  longer enjoy favorable tax terms, which used to be the main  attractive feature of the development zones. In backward areas,  foreign-funded enterprises will be allowed to engage in simple  processing, but foreign investment in such industries will be  limited in the coastal areas and special economic zones.    On the other hand, the Chinese Government will revoke  special  favorable policies applied to overseas Chinese investors and  investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and will revoke the  policy of cutting taxes in half applied to some neighboring  countries, especially the CIS countries. That is, the same  policies will be applied to foreign investors from all countries  and regions.    In the future, the Chinese Government will open up markets  to  attract new and high technology and to attract investment from  large transnational corporations. The Chinese Government will  continue to encourage three types of foreign-funded enterprises  to export their products, to effect import substitution, and to  maintain the foreign exchange balance in their business  operations. It will also formulate favorable policies to  encourage foreign investment in agriculture, in the  technological transformation of large and medium-sized  enterprises, and in the construction of urban infrastructure.</p>

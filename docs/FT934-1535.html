			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Nissan is offered deal in sports stadium row Sunderland Football Club has written to Nissan asking the Japanese car manufacturer to drop its opposition to the club's plans for a Pounds 70m sports, entertainment and conference centre on land near the company's Pounds 900m car plant. In its letter the club offers Nissan a seat on the board and the chance to buy a 'substantial' shareholding in the club. The letter to Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) also offers the company the chance to become co-promoter of the leisure complex. It offers to incorporate into its scheme, at no cost to Nissan, all additional roads 'reasonably' required by the company. The club says it is prepared to move the site for the leisure development slightly to the west - on condition Nissan makes a public commitment to expand on to the site previously earmarked by the club within a guaranteed period, buys the 120-acre site freehold and makes up any funding shortfall arising from the scheme's move. The football club board has also offered to visit Japan to achieve a satisfactory conclusion. Nissan is opposing the plan because it fears that traffic congestion from the 40,000-seat stadium, 12,000-seat indoor arena and 11,000-space car park would jeopardise just-in-time deliveries to its plant, upsetting production schedules. It has also argued that the choice of site would block its expansion prospects. The club's letter claims to re-confirm its 'aim of accommodation and compromise' and insists it never wanted confrontation. But it also warns: 'Unless Nissan feel they can single-handedly drive the regeneration of the region by themselves, they must accommodate the ambitions and aspirations of others within the north-east who wish to drive the region forward on both a national and European basis.' The club says it has received many letters from people who fail to understand Nissan's objections. 'People consider that your actions have put at risk the enormous number of permanent new jobs, linked to the vast investment the regional centre would bring to the north-east,' the club says. It also questions why, if Nissan might need the land, it has not bought it. Yesterday the company - which employs more than 4,000 people at Sunderland - said that the letter failed to add anything to what it knew already. 'Nissan has no interest in branching out into the leisure industry.' It described the conditions attached to the proposed move of site as 'a nonsense'. The club, which has declined to name its backers for the complex, is heading for a Pounds 1m loss this year. Its planning application will be considered by Sunderland City Council in the new year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Croatian National Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina  at today's meeting again expressed its full support for the  Washington Agreement, the Vienna talks, and the Constitution  passed by the Federal Assembly.    The Croatian National Council does not see the federation as  a transitional phase that threatens to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina  in recognition of the results of the genocide, but as a  departing point for the preservation of territorial integrity  and the sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina within internationally  recognized borders. In this sense, the Croatian National Council  categorically rejects any kind of negotiations about a corridor  through the Bosnian Sava Basin because this fundamentally  undermines the federation and the integrity of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Croatian National Council is also opposed to the  division  of the territory at the ratio of 51 to 49 because in this way  the greater parts of the Bosnian Sava Basin, Bosnian Krajina,  the Jajce region, and others where the Croatian and the Bosniak  majority had existed would be lost to Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Croatian National Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina [word  indistinct] deputies of the Croatian and Bosniak peoples, to --  keeping in mind their political and historic responsibility  before their own people -- deny their voice to the solutions  that would run contrary to the Croatian National Council's  abovementioned stance or the results of the 1990 and 1992  elections, which bind them to the preservation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina on the basis of equality of the three  constituent peoples.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Arts: A half-silly, half-splendid thing - Cinema ALIEN 3 (18) Odeon Leicester Square WATERLAND (15) Curzon West End LOVERS (18) MGM Piccadilly, Odeon Mezzanine JERSEY GIRL (15) Plaza THE curtains part, the spotlights rake the monumental letters, then the 20th Century Fox fanfare turns into a long curdled shriek. Yes, the alien has penetrated that sanctum sanctorum, the Hollywood logo. How long before it spawns all over Tinseltown and grows too large for studio loyalty? Shall we see a full-size alien skeeter atop the Paramount mountain, or growl out from the MGM scroll, or impersonate the Columbia torch lady? In Alien 3, a film half silly and half splendid, the slobbering reptile with the curved black head and Meccano jaws once more demonstrates the terrors of ubiquity. This time it infests a distant planet functioning as an all-male penal colony under the brutal rule of one Superintendant Andrews. In any other film Brian Glover as the bald, bad, barking Andrews (no relation) would be the most charismatically grotesque thing on view. But the alien has landed, unwittingly brought in by Sigourney Weaver's battle-scarred Ripley, who crash-lands here from a previous adventure. By climax time, all is mayhem as before: the sudden glimpse of dripping jaw or oily tentacle, the starting-gun scream. New Zealand film-maker Vincent Ward (Vigil), who wrote the story but was ousted as director by pop video alumnus David Fincher, bequeathed the brilliant conceit of a group of ex-murderers and rapists living in an interstellar monastic foundry. Fumbling with their newfound mysticism - 'some sort of apocalyptic millenarian Christian fundamentalism' vaguely explains Medical Officer Charles Dance - they are like the cast of The Name Of The Rose flung into hyperspace. Weaver's grimy, crop-haired Ripley adds to the film's Rembrandt-goes-to-Hell look and the black comedy is vivid and versatile. The alien's secret birth is cross-cut with the pious words delivered at a prisoner's funeral ('There is always new life. . .'); an oxygen mask falls from a ceiling, its scaly hose momentarily suggesting something far worse; and a defunct robot is described as having 'negative capability.' (Thank you, Mr Keats, we will be in touch about the royalties. . .) But once the chase starts, wit and luminosity are replaced by gimmickry and pyrotechnics. Worse, the script by Alien veterans David Giler and Walter Hill with Larry Ferguson expunges the two most interesting male characters in an early kill, leaving Ripley to orchestrate the also-rans. A film that starts out as a crackpot masterpiece about cabin fever in the cosmos ends up as a monster flick comme tous les autres.                          *       *       * Though I have not read Graham Swift's fenland novel Waterland, I intuited that something was wrong with the film from its opening. What are we doing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania? Short answer: looking for an American audience. Jeremy Irons, sere of face and cicatriced with moustache, regales his college history class with trauma-packed memories of boyhood, sex and East Anglia. 'Sir, sir,' they all but cry, 'why are you telling us this?' 'Well, children,' he all but replies, 'because screenwriter Peter Prince and director Stephen Gyllenhaal (Paris Trout) think we should have a framing device to explain to you transatlantics what fens are and what England was like when everyone who lived in them went 'Ooohh, eeeggh, aaarrhh.' Incest, fishing, nude bathing, abortion, the Great War: it is all here. But what dismays about Waterland is less its off-the-peg pastoral torments - the village idiot brother, the dark hints of inbreeding, the love trysts in the barn, the old crone crowing over her abortion patients - than its lunatic attempt to extract a message for middle America. When not flashbacking to the fens, Irons pads around Pittsburgh explaining that his raunchy tales are as bona fide a part of 'history' as, say, the Battle of Valley Forge. Not surprisingly his fellow teachers disagree and think he should go. And his wife Sinead Cusack, ruing the infertility brought on by that long-ago pregnancy termination, has already gone. One half-admires the film's moments of stark courage: as when it literally tips Irons and his pupils into early-century Norfolk, driving them through the past in a vintage multiseater from which they view the beery natives on the eve of World War I. But even this smacks of Americanisation. The past used to be a foreign country; now it is a theme park. They speak a universal language there, one composed of folksy wisdoms about the child fathering the man and cinegenic proverbs about giving a human, picture-book touch to public or social history.                          *       *       * Victoria Abril, the pouting star of Tie Me Up] Tie Me Down] and High Heels, is quite wonderful in the Spanish film Lovers. The face at once gaunt and pixie-ish, the manner distrait and monomaniacal: she was born to play the beautiful widow who seduces the gullible soldier (Jorge Sanz) in this truth-based tale of love's young dream turning to nightmare and scandal. For the young man is courting his commandant's pretty, virginal maid (Maribel Verdu) when he takes lodgings - ah fatal day] - with Miss Abril. Soon she has him in bed and is doing unmentionable things with a silk handkerchief. Passion and perversity meet in hot embrace and Miss Verdu is left out in the cold. Even when the young girl gives up her virginity for the cause, she is no match for the siren. Miss A was trained, after all, in the Pedro Almodovar School of Absolutely Anything Goes. Sex, jealousy, handkerchiefs, cut-throat razors: it will be fun for a while and then end in tears or murder. Writer-director Vicente Aranda was inspired by a crime of passion in 1950s Spain, which sent its culprits to jail after Franco had commuted the death sentence. But the film is inspired by Miss Abril, who won the Best Actress prize last year at Berlin. With her moue of a mouth, spiky-lashed eyes and honeyed throatiness of voice, she is a junior-team Gloria Swanson presiding over her side-street Sunset Boulevard. What she and the film and its sex scenes will do to most male filmgoers I tremble to think. What they should do for Miss Abril's career is make her an international star.                          *       *       * Finally, Jersey Girl. Just for a moment I thought this might be a Lana Turner bio-pic. Miss Turner, once known as the Sweater Girl, was famous for making woollen garments bulge in all the right places. But no: this movie bulges in all the wrong places and the Jersey invoked is the place not the pullover. Toby (Jami Gertz) is the working-class out-of-towner who falls for Mercedes-owning New York yuppie Sal (Dylan McDermott). But can Cinderella hold on to her Prince Smarmy? Not until her girlfriends have screamed dire warnings, her gift-happy Pop (Joseph Bologna) has embarrassed her with his taste in evening dresses, her snooty Park Avenue rival (Sheryl Fenn) has tried to steal Sal back and - oh enough, you cannot want me to continue. We thought they did not make films like this any more, but it is the silly season and we were, alas, wrong. David Burton Morris directed.</p>

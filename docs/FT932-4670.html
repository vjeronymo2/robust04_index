			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Neotronics falls to Pounds 0.96m NEOTRONICS Technology, a maker of specialist gas and water analysis equipment, yesterday reported a drop in pre - tax profits from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 956,000 for the six months to March 31. Mr Paul Gotley, chairman, said that, as indicated, the current year started poorly. Group sales in the UK rose slightly despite recession and this was helped by the successful development in the UK of Solomat sales. Sales rose 13.2 per cent to Pounds 10.5m. Excluding Solomat for the first three months the increase was 5.5 per cent. For the full year 1991 - 92 pre - tax profits were 16 per cent higher at Pounds 3.03m. Earnings per share were reduced to 2.38p (2.77p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.85p.</p>

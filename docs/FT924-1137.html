			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / International Company News: BHP rises 23% to ADollars 502m BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP), Australia's biggest company, yesterday returned to profits growth with a 23 per cent rise in net operating profit to ADollars 502m (USDollars 346.2m) for the six months to end-November. The result was below market expectations, but the shares closed 28 cents higher at ADollars 12.84, buoyed by the contrast with the year to May, when net profit more than halved to ADollars 589m. The group said it was performing soundly, in spite of subdued economic growth in its main markets. 'It is a measure of BHP's success that most of our businesses are continuing to operate at capacity,' the company said. BHP said demand for most of its mineral products was higher and production of copper, coal and iron ore had increased. The petroleum division was continuing to generate good profits in spite of uncertainty over oil prices. However, the group said the Australian recession had flattened domestic demand for steel and warned that profit growth would depend on cost-cutting and strategic marketing. The recession had forced the group to divert production into less profitable export markets in which it faced escalating competition. At the operating level, the minerals divisions reported a 0.4 per cent increase in profit to ADollars 333m, the steel division increased profit by 7 per cent to ADollars 104m, and petroleum was up 15 per cent to ADollars 257m. BHP said revenue increased by 7 per cent to ADollars 8bn, partly as a result of higher oil and gas prices and the inclusion of New Zealand Steel, which was acquired during the year. The group said export revenues were significantly improved by a decline in the average exchange rate of the Australian dollar to 73 US cents from 78 cents in the comparable period of 1991-92.</p>

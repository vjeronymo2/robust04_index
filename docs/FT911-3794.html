			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE HINT of a weak performance on Wall Street sent UK stock index futures scurrying lower yesterday and dragged the share market down in its wake. A dearth of buyers initially left the London market vulnerable to profit-taking. It then only took suggestions of a decline on Wall Street to send equity futures still lower. Brokers said the lack of buying made it difficult to execute even the small number of institutional sell orders placed with them. Instead, turnover was dominated by market professionals and securities houses. There was also interest in FT-SE 100 index options, with some investors short of futures buying April calls and others buying puts and selling calls, all of which are deals that assume the equity market will weaken further. The June FT-SE futures contract traded for much of the session just 20 points above the spot index, compared with the 30-point premium brokers estimate is necessary to take account of future dividend payments and financing cost. June FT-SE closed at 2,511, down 33 points on the day and 17 points above the spot index. Hanson August 220 and 240 calls were actively traded as investors in the recent Euro- bond issue continued to sell calls as a hedging trade against the bonds. GEC August 200 puts were a busy contract as a large technical trade was executed.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Mitsubishi acts on import quota MITSUBISHI, the Japanese carmaker, is to begin exporting cars to Europe from Australia for the first time, allowing it to circumvent quota limits on direct vehicle imports from Japan. Like Honda and Toyota, it is already exporting cars from its US assembly plant to Europe. The company yesterday displayed its Australian-built Sigma estate car at the British motor show in Birmingham; a competitor for vehicles such as the Ford Granada/Scorpio and Opel Omega/Vauxhall Carlton estate cars. The Japanese carmaker hopes to export 5,000 vehicles from Australia to Europe next year, of which about 10 per cent will come to the UK. Typical of the increasingly complex supply pattern in the world motor industry, the Sigma estate car was developed by Mitsubishi Motors Australia in Adelaide, which will become the sole production plant worldwide. The same vehicle will also be exported by Mitsubishi from Australia to the US with shipment of 6,000 vehicles planned next year. The estate car is sold as the Mitsubishi Magna/Verada in Australia. The export programme to Europe and the US will allow Mitsubishi Motors Australia to increase output from 29,074 vehicles in 1991 to 38,700 this year and 52,000 in 1993, buoyed by a modest recovery in the Australian domestic market. Mitsubishi holds about 12.4 per cent of the total Australian vehicle market, behind Toyota (20.6 per cent), Ford (19.7 per cent) and General Motors (Holden) with 17.3 per cent. The company wants to increase the single-shift capacity at its Adelaide plant from 57,000 to 74,000 by the mid 1990s. The company claims to have a local Australian content of about 85 per cent for its vehicles. Mr Reijiro Kuromizu, a managing director of Mitsubishi Motors, said: 'We have the problem of the quota system in the European Community (for Japanese exports), so if we can source products from Australia or the US, that helps our operations in Europe a great deal. That is the reason we started shipping products from Australia and the US. You must have sufficient local content in each location and we have complied with that.' He said that Mitsubishi would export about 10,000 cars from the US to Europe this year, chiefly to Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Austria. The company was also studying the shipment of light commercial vehicles to Europe from Thailand.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Norway power warning THE Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry (NHO) yesterday warned the government that a dual-pricing system was emerging for domestic and export electricity contracts, threatening to undermine the competitiveness of Norwegian industry. Norway is the most advanced of any European country in liberalising its electricity market, allowing exports on a concession basis, but the NHO yesterday said the government must also allow free access to electricity imports, in order to stop dual pricing. 'What we are seeking to avoid is profits being made from expensive domestic contracts, while cheap export contracts covering surplus power are agreed,' said Mr Karl Glad, an NHO executive. He warned in a letter to Mr Finn Kristensen, industry and energy minister, of electricity price differentiation, price manipulation, dumping and monopolistic tendencies by Norway's big electricity producers. He said costs for new transmission cables between Norway and the rest of the continent were being subsidised by high domestic electricity prices. NHO is particularly sceptical of a recent supply contract agreed by Statkraft, the domestic power company, and Germany's PreussenElektra. The 25-year deal covers the equivalent of twice the annual electricity consumption by Oslo.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Ukraine tells Crimea to end independence bid THE UKRAINIAN parliament yesterday tried to brake Crimea's separatist drive by suspending its declaration of independence and planned referendum. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, warned of 'bloodshed' and 'a tragedy in relations between Ukraine and Russia' if Crimea's separatist bid was not halted. Mr Kravchuk and the Ukraine parliament stopped short of dissolving the Crimean parliament and calling new elections but it set May 20 as a deadline for the Crimean legislature to annul its own declaration of independence and revoke plans to hold a referendum on August 2. The Ukrainian parliament did not specify the measures it would take if Crimea fails to comply, but the parliament did instruct Mr Kravchuk to use 'all necessary means' to restore constitutional order in Crimea.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 31 (AFP)--Northern and Southern  Yemeni troops on Tuesday exchanged sporadic artillery fire  around this southern city, an AFP correspondent reported.    The fighting was mainly at the al-'Anad front, 60 kilometers  (36 miles) north of Aden and Abyan 35 kilometers (21 miles) east  of the city.    Several MiG-21 were spotted taking off from Aden Airport.    The fighting continued as the UN Security Council was due  later in the day to discuss the civil war that erupted on May 5  between northern forces of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and  those of his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    Al-Bid proclaimed a breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic on  May 20, but it has not been recognised internationally.</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULING PROMPTS LIMIT ON TRADING OF 'STOCK BASKETS'  </P> <P> The Philadelphia and American stock exchanges on Monday limited trading in  their new "stock basket" products because of legal uncertainty over which  government agency should regulate them.  </P> <P> The exchanges, which began offering stock baskets to investors three months  ago, also denounced a Chicago federal court ruling that suddenly has thrown the  products' legitimacy into question.  </P> <P> "The real loser in this controversy is the American investor," said Amex  President Kenneth R. Leibler.  </P> <P> Philadelphia Exchange President Nicholas A. Giordano said Friday's decision by  the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was "a major step backward in the  regulation and development of innovative new products."  </P> <P> Stock baskets are financial innovations priced to reflect changes in broad  market indexes such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. Investors  receive quarterly cash payments equal to a proportionate share of any regular  cash dividend declared on the stocks in the index.  </P> <P> The exchanges said trading in stock baskets would be largely restricted to  liquidation, meaning that holders would be able to sell them for cash. Market  makers at the exchanges are obligated to buy them if no other buyers emerge to  ensure an orderly market and prevent panic selling.  </P> <P> The uncertainty over stock baskets was raised Friday by the Chicago court,  which ruled that such products resemble commodity futures, such as those for  pork bellies and grain, and should be monitored by the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission, not the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P></p>

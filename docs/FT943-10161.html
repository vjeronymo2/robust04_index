			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Water After a week of reflection, the new regulatory deal for the water industry is still to the liking of shareholders. Water company share prices have risen by anything up to 6 per cent since immediately before the announcement on Thursday of last week. Yet initial enthusiasm has been tempered by the thought that real dividend growth of 4 per cent - which most water companies should be capable of delivering through to the end of the decade - is not exceptional judged against the prospects elsewhere. With long-term regulatory risks to consider as well, a yield premium to the wider equity market of around 30 per cent looks about right. But the new regime should sort the leaders from the laggards more effectively. Five years after privatisation the equity market barely differentiates. Ignoring South West, which is appealing to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the yield gap between the highest yielding stock (Thames) and the lowest (Wessex) is less than one percentage point. Since companies have had no difficulty so far beating their regulatory targets, this level performance across the sector is not surprising. Companies which can beat the tougher targets over the next five years - by keeping operating expenses and capital spending below budget - are likely to stand out from the crowd. Interim dividend announcements next autumn, the first under the new regime, could be the first indication of which companies are confident of doing more than the regulator has asked. Shareholders will have to ask seriously for the first time whether such confidence is justified.</p>

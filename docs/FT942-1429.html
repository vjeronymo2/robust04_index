			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Law stumps windscreen cleaner The trade in cleaning windscreens of cars caught in slow-moving city traffic led to legal confusion in the High Court in London yesterday. A judge heard that windscreen washer Mr Trevor Nowell was told by police in London's East End that he needed a street trading licence and was threatened with prosecution for obstruction unless he moved on. When he asked the London Borough of Newham for a licence, he was told that they were granted only to designated stallholders for local markets. These markets were all in pedestrian areas. 'That rather defeats the object of your trade,' the judge told Mr Nowell, of south-east London. Mr Nowell replied: 'It does rather. I'm confused.' He denied causing an obstruction, adding: 'I'm trying to keep out of trouble and not break the law.' There were no problems with Metropolitan Police officers in some areas but in others they were clamping down on the windscreen washing trade. Asked by Mr Justice Latham whether the police had charged him with obstruction, he said: 'They have not - that is the annoying part.' If he had been prosecuted the matter could have been sorted out. The judge rejected Mr Nowell's application for judicial review as there was no formal decision made by police or the local authority against which he could appeal. He suggested to Mr Nowell that he apply again to the council for a street trader's licence. If refused, he should give notice that he intended to seek a judicial review. The Metropolitan Police said its policy was to take action against windscreen cleaners if they were causing an obstruction, otherwise they were free to carry on cleaning.</p>

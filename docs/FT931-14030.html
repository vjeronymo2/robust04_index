			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Fiscal changes tax new 'moral' congress: Positive vote is essential to restore national credibility AFTER seven years of discussion and delay, the moment of truth arrives today for Brazil's commitment to fiscal adjustment, when congress votes on higher taxes to plug a Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.5bn) hole in this year's budget. Long mooted as the key hurdle in overcoming the decade-long economic crisis, the vote on fiscal reform is the first test of the parliamentary strength of the new administration of President Itamar Franco. Its outcome will also expose the ability of 503 congressmen to build on their new 'moral' image, achieved through their recent impeachment of President Fernando Collor, by rising above their own parochial interests for once. The measure is far from the full-blooded reform necessary to guarantee sustainable budget balance. However, its approval is essential if the government is to resurrect a lapsed accord with the International Monetary Fund - talks on which are due to resume on February 9 - and thus restore international credibility. The Franco government is not the first to draw up fiscal reforms, but previous efforts have always been stymied by the highly fragmented political system, lack of will, and - since 1988 - an incredibly restrictive constitution. However, Mr Paulo Haddad, the newly-appointed economy minister, says the situation has now reached breaking point. With the government projecting a primary or non-interest deficit of 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product, he says there is no money to pay government employees or pensions or undertake desperately needed investments such as repairs to the country's highways, many of which have degenerated into cart-tracks. The main proposals to raise these funds are a 0.25 per cent tax on cheques, estimated to bring in Dollars 7bn, a tax on selected products such as drinks, fuel, cigarettes and telephone calls, and a tax on company assets. Mr Franco has spent the past week negotiating with the presidents and parliamentary leaders of the 19 parties represented in congress and the governors of the 27 states. His self-effacing style and years of political experience have brought him far closer than his high-handed predecessor to clinching a deal. But despite all the fanfare, Mr Carlos Langoni, economic professor at the highly-regarded Getulio Vargas Institute in Rio de Janeiro, says the project is 'merely a quick-fix solution not touching the structural problems'. What the congress is debating is simply a tax-raising exercise on those already paying, when the real problems are widespread evasion, a bankrupt social security system and a blatantly unfair distribution of revenues between central and local government, he says. According to the tax authorities, only 7m out of an economically active population of 61m people pay income tax, and last year's income tax revenues of Dollars 35bn are thought to be only half those owed. This means that the deficit could be solved just by cracking down on a third of the evasion. But the proposals contain no provision for strengthening the tax collection service other than authorising the Economy Ministry to lift banking secrecy  -and that proposal is not expected to be passed. On the expenditure side, the pivotal problem is the 1988 constitution, which increased the proportion of revenue transferred to local government, without also passing on the responsibilities of tax collection or provision of services. The tax income of states and cities has risen from 8 to 12 per cent of GDP under the new constitution, and Mr Collor frequently complained: 'The problems of this country will never be solved while for every four cruzeiros the centre collects it only keeps one.' As a result, for example, the federal hospital system has all but collapsed. Moreover, while the federal government has cut its payroll expenditures, those of local governments increased 77 per cent between 1985 and 1990. Mr Rogerio Werneck, a fiscal expert, says: 'States and cities have been spending way above their fast-growing revenues and have no incentive not to, as they are always bailed out by the central bank.' With only three states solvent, local governments now owe the federal government Dollars 49bn - more than Brazil's debt to foreign commercial banks. The structural reform to resolve this is not being tackled because congressmen need state and municipal machinery for re-election and will not vote for something that cuts at the root of support. So the easy answer is to increase the taxes of those already paying. But economists like congressman and former planning minister Antonio Delfim Neto are sceptical about the wisdom of this when the economy is still in recession: 'Any increase will result in real reduction of salaries and increase in unemployment.' He says the government should be concentrating on finding a solution for the main cause of the overall deficit - the bonded domestic debt which snowballed last year by a real 178 per cent to Cr12,400bn (Pounds 580m) partly because of high real interest rates averaging 30 per cent. Mr Neto suggests using foreign exchange reserves, which are at record levels of Dollars 24bn, to buy back some of this debt (interest payments on which swell the overall deficit to 6 per cent of GDP) and initiate a road improvement programme. Then, he would wait until a constitutional review due in September for profound structural reform. The government has already obtained some fiscal relief through a new corporate withholding tax on financial gains. Passed on Christmas Eve, partly to encourage investment in productive, rather than speculative, activity, this is expected to bring in Dollars 6bn, though it may be challenged in court. Many analysts yesterday feared congress would decide that this new tax solved half the problem and the country could therefore muddle through without the rest. In fact, by international standards and excluding its growing interest bill, Brazil's primary deficit is not that high. The real problem is confidence, and fiscal reform has been talked about for so long that it has become the sine qua non to restoring government credibility both at home and abroad. Although Mr Haddad warns that 'Itamar can't do miracles', it would be ironic if the president who cares the least about IMF recommendations of any recent Brazilian leader were to come closest to fulfilling them.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / MP slams managers' plans to buy pits British Coal yesterday rejected charges of conflict of interest against managers planning to stage buy-outs of pits they have been preparing for privatisation. Mr Kim Howells, Labour MP for Pontypridd, accused managers of enjoying an unfair advantage because of their involvement in the run-up to privatisation. Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Howells, a former researcher for the National Union of Mineworkers, said: 'There is an appalling conflict of interest here. You cannot run (the industry) down and then offer it to management so they can make profits themselves. A lot of people have suffered and a lot of miners have lost their jobs.' His comments came after Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said he would not be surprised if some managers were interested in buy-outs. 'They know a great deal about the business, its risks and its potential,' he said. British Coal said the managers 'have been steering operations to make sure supply matches demand and to make it competitive in a very harsh marketplace. To conclude that the industry has been shrunk to make it easier for the existing management to buy doesn't seem credible.' A number of issues had still to be resolved before managers would be able to mount buy-out offers, British Coal said. The precise split of assets between the five regions named in the coal privatisation bill had still to be decided. The issue of liability for mining subsidence and for health claims from former miners has also yet to be resolved. Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, said his union would fight privatisation 'in whatever form it takes'.</p>

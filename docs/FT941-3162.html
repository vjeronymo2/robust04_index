			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Observer: Euro-togs The trains might not yet be running on time but at least the uniforms will soon be ready. European Passenger Services, which will run Eurostar trains through the Channel tunnel, has signed up Pierre Balmain to create its new uniforms. The airline-style togs are in the Eurostar colours of blue and yellow and will be worn by everybody from drivers to receptionists. Pierre Balmain is one of the grand old names of French couture but has been living on its past glories in recent years, according to Observer's fashion expert. Will it be any more successful than royal couturier Hardy Amies's mission to smarten up British Rail's porters in the 1980s? Designing the uniforms is the easy bit. Getting the lower ranks to adhere to the correct dress code may be a mite more difficult.</p>

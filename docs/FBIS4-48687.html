			<p>BFN     [Text] The main aim of National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] armed forces in Ebo District is  to defend local residents from the aggression of Eduardo dos  Santos' communist troops in the area. On 23 May clashes took  place in Bela Caiombo, 5 km east of Ebo District, in which the  People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA]  aggressors fled in disarray, leaving at least 25 of their  soldiers dead. Meanwhile, in the Chongoa area, an arms depot  belonging to FAPLA was totally destroyed. Our correspondent  Capalandanda reports that more materiel was abandoned by FAPLA  and captured by the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola,  including a 60-mm mortar with more than 80 shells, an 82-mm  mortar with 14 shells, 23 AKM rifles, one RPK and two PKM  submachine guns, two RPG-7 launchers with 16 grenades, and 25  antipersonnel mines. Capalandanda says that the fleeing  communist forces are being pursued and are leaving behind many  dead soldiers and much war equipment.</p>

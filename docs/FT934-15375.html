			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lloyd's corporate trust scaled down REA BROTHERS, the small merchant bank, and UBS, a subsidiary of Union Bank of Switzerland, yesterday published an investment memorandum for Finsbury Underwriting Investment Trust, one of the first corporate members to be formed at the Lloyd's insurance market. The trust aims to raise Pounds 30m, before expenses, by way of a placing and intermediaries offer. Rea Brothers and UBS originally aimed to raise Pounds 35m when they announced their plans in August, but have subsequently scaled down the size of their offer to 'ensure a high degree of selectivity in placing FUIT's capacity,' according to a statement released yesterday. The group's underwriting will be managed by Wren Underwriting Agencies. FUIT's investment portfolio, comprising predominantly UK equities and interest bearing securities, will be managed by Finsbury Asset Management. The fund is one of a number planned by merchant banks, securities houses and Lloyd's agencies. Overall, Lloyd's hopes it could attract as much as Pounds 1bn in fresh capital from its first ever corporate investors. The market's council announced rules for new corporate investors last month. Final approval, however, is dependent on a vote by the market's Names, the individuals whose assets support the market, at an extraordinary meeting on October 20.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Russia fails to persuade Nato Nato ambassadors yesterday rebuffed Moscow's demand for an alternative to the Partnership for Peace arrangement, in a move that casts a shadow over next week's visit to Brussels by General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister. Gen Grachev has stated that Russia is not prepared simply to join the queue of east European countries which are signing up to PFP, an arrangement that provides for joint exercises and an exchange of military knowhow. At a meeting in Brussels yesterday, the ambassadors said the most they could promise was 'dialogue and co-operation' of a kind that reflected Russia's importance in European security. However, this dialogue would be in addition to Russian adherence to PFP, not a substitute. An alliance spokesman said Nato 'looked forward' to Russia subscribing to the partnership, which already has 18 members. 'We do not like the term special relationship,' said a Nato official, adding that any links between Russia and the alliance must be transparent and stop short of giving Moscow a veto over future decisions by the alliance. The official said that there could be no question of Nato and Russia exercising a condominium over the smaller states of central and eastern Europe. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, is understood to be pressing for some concession to Russian sensitivities. He was impressed by the arguments put forward in Germany last week by President Boris Yeltsin, who said he was under increasing pressure from hardliners. Mr Volker Ruhe, Bonn's defence minister, is believed to be pressing a tougher line, insisting that Russian objections should not be allowed to obstruct the growing relationship between Germany and its neighbours to the east. This week's German-Dutch initiative to upgrade the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe - a move which Moscow will warmly welcome - prompted speculation that Mr Yeltsin had negotiated some sort of trade-off in Bonn. However, the contrast between the stated positions of Nato and Russia remained so wide after yesterday's meeting that considerable effort will be needed to paper over the cracks. It is conceivable that the Russians will present Nato's promise of an upgraded 'dialogue' as a concession to their demands, and that some western countries will save Russia's face by publicly concurring. But the position sketched out by Nato ambassadors yesterday - which did not amount to a formal decision - falls far short of meeting Russia's demand that it become a co-designer of any co-operation efforts. Gen Grachev, a former paratrooper who won prominence in the war in Afghanistan, is thought to be a pragmatist in matters of links with Nato: keen to derive any possible advantage if this can be done without exposing Russia to humiliation. The defence minister would not want to miss any opportunity to receive a western blessing for its 'peace-keeping' forces in the smaller ex-Soviet republics, where Russian influence remains strong. Among the older generation of officers who continue to dominate Russia's general staff, hostility to the Atlantic alliance, which they spent most of their careers confronting, runs much deeper.</p>

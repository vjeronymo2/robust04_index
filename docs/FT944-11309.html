			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Gilts Last week's report from the Bank of England widened the gulf between the Bank's and the market's expectations of inflation. While the Bank cut its medium-term forecast to 2.5 per cent, the market's view - as expressed by the difference between yields on conventional and index-linked gilts - remained nearly twice that. If the Bank is right, the relationship between conventional and index-linked gilts must change. The question is which side will move. Index-linked gilts look cheap compared with equities. In August UK equity yields fell below those on index-linked gilts for the first time since before the 1987 crash. Equities have since slipped back but their yield premium is still under 10 basis points. Although lower than normal, such a narrow spread could persist if the market is willing to accept a lower risk premium for equities than it used to demand or if dividend growth prospects are particularly strong at this stage in the economic cycle. The yield on index-linked gilts, at around 4 per cent, is consistent with the outlook for real interest rates. So if the gap between the market's and Bank's views on inflation is to close, yields on conventional gilts are likely to fall further. Over the last six weeks gilts have outpaced other government bonds. It would not be surprising if there was now a pause. But with UK institutions signalling a clear intention to increase their weighting in recent surveys, there is good reason to expect continued relative outperformance.</p>

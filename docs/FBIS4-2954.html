			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the </F> Hebei Provincial CPC Committee, at the provincial propaganda,  organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work  conference on 31 March]    [Text] 1. The departments under party committees should  work in line with the requirements for the development of the  situation and upgrade their awareness of being submitted to and  serving the work of the party as a whole.    Of all the fronts and departments under the leadership of  the  party, propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and  united front work departments occupy extremely important  positions. Since the implementation of the important talks made  by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his inspection of south China in  1992 and the guidelines of the 14th party congress, the  propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united  front work departments under the provincial party committee have  done a lot of work and made good achievements in comprehensively  implementing the basic line of the party and accelerating the  pace of reform, opening up, and modernization. There is an  extremely important experience. That is, so long as the  departments suit the changes of the situation and are submitted  to and serve the general task of the party will they be able to  ceaselessly enhance vitality, upgrade their work quality, and  make contributions. This has become a basic principle to  arrange the work of all fronts and all departments.    According to the current international and domestic  situations, the party Central Committee defined the overall work  situation as follows: Grasp favorable opportunities, deepen  reform, expand the scale of opening up, promote development, and  maintain stability. Being submitted to, serving, and realizing  this overall situation is high above everything and more  important than any other things. The work in all aspects of the  province, including the propaganda, organizational, discipline  inspection, and united front work, should unconditionally,  highly, and consciously be submitted to and serve the overall  situation of the whole party. Thus, we should strive to make  contributions to promoting and realizing this overall situation.    The key to realizing the overall situation of the party is  to  well handle the relationship between reform, development, and  stability. In the aspect of economic restructuring, our country  has entered a new stage of linking package reform with  breakthroughs in key areas. A series of major reforms as  defined by the central authorities this year can be regarded as  a battle to tackle the most difficult problems. The reforms  that should be carried out this year touch on the readjustment  of the deep-layered contradictions, the interest pattern, and  the interest relations. So, it is considerably difficult to  carry out the reforms. If we dare not tackle or tide over these  difficulties, we will lose historical favorable opportunities.  Under such circumstances, it will be difficult to maintain the  current sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national  economy and the stagnation of reform will possibly bring about a  strained circumstance characterized by slow economic growth rate  and high inflation. There are great difficulties in reform. If  we do not carry out reform, the difficulties will be more  serious. We should rely on deepening reform in order to make  development. Only when we unswervingly deepen reform will we be  able to extricate ourselves from the strained circumstances and  to create new productive forces. Development is our fundamental  purpose. Only through development, will we be able to make the  country strong and the people rich. Therefore, development is  always an essential criterion. By no means does development  have no contradictions. The failure to regulate and control the  macroeconomy or to enliven the microeconomy will affect not only  the sustained and sound development of the economy but also  social stability. There are many contradictions in development.  But, the contradictions are even more serious if we do not make  development. Fundamentally speaking, so long as we conduct  reform we will be able to maintain stability and ensure a  long-term order and stability of the country. However, the  difficulties in reform and the contradictions cropping up  through development will add new unstable factors. Therefore,  we must pay full attention to maintaining stability, do a good  job in maintaining stability and eliminate all unstable factors  in the bud. Otherwise, nothing will be accomplished. In short,  reform, development, and stability are related to and promote  one another. We must organically combine reform with  development and stability, persistently promote development with  reform, promote stability with reform and development, and use  stability to ensure the smooth progress of reform and  development.    The key to enable departments to submit consciously to  their work and to serve the overall situation of the whole  party's work is to cultivate a strong sense of the overall  situation and a firm concept of entirety, rationalize their  relationship with the overall situation and entirety from the  high plane of implementing the party's basic line on one central  task and two basic points, be good at accurately finding out  their own positions in the overall situation, actively and  appropriately give play to their own role in line with their own  functions, and make due contributions to realizing the overall  situation of the whole party's work. It is hoped that all  departments of the party committees at all levels across the  province will enhance common understanding, work together with  one heart in times of difficulty, and raise the work of various  departments to a new height in the course of caring for,  supporting, and participating in deepening reform, expanding  opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability.    2. We should further implement the task of using the theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the  whole party by organizing the people to study focusing on Volume  No. 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping."    Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole party is one of  the most important and fundamental ideologies of the whole party  and an important ideological guarantee for realizing the overall  situation of the whole party's work this year. Since the 14th  party congress, particularly after the publication of Volume  no.3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the issuance  of the central decision on study, party and government top  leaders at all levels have taken the lead in the study,  personally attended to it, and created a study upsurge in the  whole province. The present issue is that we must  conscientiously study how to deeply and continuously carry out  this study, realistically regard the study of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as one of the fundamental tasks of party  committees at all levels and of all departments, and study it  well. It is necessary to continuously integrate the study of  Volume No.3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" with the  study and implementation of the "decision" of the third plenary  session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and at the same time,  study new skills and have a good command of new knowledge. The  study tasks in face of our cadres at all levels are very  arduous. Without study, one cannot become a powerful leader  with a sober mind, and cannot successfully carry out reform and  development under the market economic conditions. Without  study, one will become backward and be eliminated during the  rapidly developed era.    To successfully carry out study on Volume No.3 of the  "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," the theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, the "decision" of the  third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the  socialist market economic knowledge among cadres at all levels,  particularly cadres at and above the county level, chiefly,  first of all, cadres at all levels, particularly the leading  cadres, should enhance their awareness in study, try their best  to reduce social intercourse at their own work posts, and set  aside more time for strengthening study; second, party  committees at all levels and leading party groups of all  departments should resolutely adopt the method of concentrating  some time for grasping the study of their central groups; and  third, adopt the methods of sharing the study tasks to all  levels and strive to rotationally train cadres at and above the  section (township) level across the province during this year  with the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, "theory," and "decision" as the main substance.  We should uphold the principle of combining theory with reality  and exert efforts to apply the study to practical use. It is  necessary to integrate the study with the summing up of  experience of reform and development in one's own locality,  department, and unit, and combine the ideology and concept with  the problems in work in the course of studying how to deepen  the current reform so as to provide a powerful ideological  guarantee for accelerating reform and promoting development. In  seeking unity of thinking, we should, through study,  emphatically resolve the following several issues: First, we  should firmly embrace the idea of dialectical unity among  reform, development, and stability, break with the erroneous  understanding of setting these three things against one another  and separating them from one another, discover and resolve in a  timely manner the new problems emerging in the work concerning  reform, development, and stability, and make these three things  coordinate and promote one another. Second, we should firmly  embrace the new concepts commensurate with new circumstances,  break with the outmoded ideas formed under the planned economic  structure in the past, make great efforts to master the  knowledge concerning the socialist market economic law, and  enhance our ability of promoting the economic structural reform  and accelerate the development of the socialist market economy.  Third, we should firmly embrace the concept that the  development of the socialist market economy is in agreement with  the party's ideals, purpose, and noble moral sentiment, overcome  the influence caused by money worship, hedonism, and extreme  individualism, continuously temper ourselves through party  spirit, and enhance our ability to resist corruption and prevent  evolution. Fourth, we should firmly embrace the pioneering  spirit of improving ourselves through unremitting efforts and  struggling arduously, overcome such erroneous ideas as being  content with small progress, maintaining what has been achieved  by predecessors, fearing difficulties, and blaming everyone and  everything but oneself, enhance the courage to face up with the  challenges of all sorts in the course of reform and development,  and serve as enthusiastic pioneers who share a common fate with  reform and make contributions to reform and development.    3. We should give full play to the party's advantages in  propaganda and ideological work and provide effective support by  media and ideological guarantee for reform, opening up, and  modernization.    With the theory of building a socialism with Chinese  characteristics as the fundamental principle, the party's  propaganda and ideological work should be devoted to arming the  people with scientific theory, to guiding the people with  correct public opinions, to modeling the people with noble  spirit, and to inspiring the people with excellent works. This  is the overall disposition and strategic idea for strengthening  propaganda and ideological work in the process of building the  socialist market economic structure. It is a huge systems  engineering to attain these four goals. The provincial party  committee should make overall planning and work out measures to  attain these four goals step by step. Party committees at all  levels and the propaganda and ideological fronts should exert  positive efforts in arming the people with theory, guiding the  people through mass media, conducting ideological education  among the people, and making culture flourishing in line with  these four goals. In addition, new experiences should be  summarized and created to make contributions to attaining these  four goals.    Now, we are precisely at the key period of building the  socialist market economic structure and carrying out the four  modernizations. Party committees at all levels and all  propaganda and mass media departments should pay special  attention to guiding the public opinion under the guidance of  the overall task of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  expanding reform, promoting development, and maintaining  stability." Mass media departments should comprehensively and  accurately propagate the party's basic line, principles, and  policies, propagate the "decision" of the third plenary session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and propagate the good  methods, good examples, and good experiences concerning reform,  development, and stability. The people should be guided to show  concern for, support, and plunge into reform, correctly handle  the relations between the overall interest and the partial  interest and between the long-term interest and the immediate  interest, and resolutely implement the arrangements of the  central authorities with a view to winning the hardest battle of  reform. We should vividly and specifically propagate the  province's strategy of developing the export-oriented economy to  promote the overall development and the province's principles  and favorable policies concerning opening up in a bid to create  a good environment of media for expanding the opening up of the  province. For such sensitive issues as anticorruption,  commodity prices, and public security, with which the masses are  concerned, press and mass media departments should show positive  concern, check what is evil and advocate what is good, and treat  them prudently in order to help create a good environment of  mass media characterized by political and social stability. We  should pay high attention to strengthening the investigation and  analysis of the public opinions in society and the mental state  of the masses in various fields, and then give correct guidance  to and help the masses enhance understanding, unite ideas, and  resolve contradictions.    The party committees at various  levels and their propaganda departments should further  supervise, manage, and guide the press work. The mass  propaganda should persistently implement the principle that  literary and artistic workers should serve socialism and the  people and the principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom  and a hundred schools of thought contend, carry forward the main  melody, and advocate a variety of styles. We should concentrate  main energy on upgrading quality; make the press and radio and  television programs further conform to the party's line,  principles, and policies; put the central link of economic  construction in a prominent position; loudly play the main  melody of reform; press close to the reality, the masses, and  the livelihood; and make our works loved by the people.    In regard to the aspect of rejuvenating socialist culture,  we  should pay attention to grasping the creation of literary and  artistic works, the mass cultural activities, and the management  of cultural markets. We should take the creation and  improvement of the art of Hebei as a general target; take the  implementation of the "project for ranking first in five  aspects," and the launching of the campaigns of "learning from  Chengde modern drama troupe, creating first-grade works, and  striving for the first class" as motivation; and create a group  of outstanding skilled persons and a number of artistic works  reflecting the main melody of the times. The provincial party  committee and the provincial government will give handsome  awards to the spiritual products that produce great impacts at  home and abroad. The cultural and sports activities for the  masses should be regarded as an important matter and should be  held annually in a well-arranged and well-planned manner so as  to enhance the physical quality of the people and have the  people enjoy a high level of spiritual satisfaction while  resting after tense labor. The confused management of cultural  markets is a prominent problem that the broad masses of the  cadres and the people complain strongly about. We must be  determined and exert great efforts to straighten out the  cultural markets. The propaganda departments under the party  committees should coordinate with the work in this regard. The  cultural, radio, and press and publication departments should  assume responsibilities for the management of the cultural  markets. Simultaneously, the procuratorial, judicial, and  security departments should make concerted and positive efforts  to coordinate with the management of cultural markets. Wiping  out pornography, dealing blows to unlawful activities, and  straightening out cultural markets should be brought into line  with the plan for comprehensively improving social order and be  carried out on a responsibility basis. The party and government  leaders of the localities with serious problems and the leaders  of the departments in charge of the trades should first be  called to account. Those who violate laws should strictly be  punished according to regulations and rules but never be treated  leniently.    4. We should further grasp the improvement of the ideology  and work style of the party and government leading bodies and  set up leading cadres' encouragement and restriction mechanisms.    Through the shift of the terms of office, the readjustment  of  leading bodies, and the amalgamation of prefectures with cities  made last year, the party and government leading bodies at  various levels have effectively been strengthened. The majority  of the leading bodies have a strong enterprising spirit, are  able to work together with one heart, and are full of vitality.  However, we must notice that some comrades lack the sense of  enterprising and the sense of responsibility, are satisfied at  the current situation, and lack lofty aspirations and ideals of  constantly forging ahead, doing undertakings, and creating  achievements. With floating work styles, some comrades are  ideologically lazy and lack the spirit of working hard and  solidly. In line with the actual conditions of the current  leading bodies, we should take the improvement of ideology and  work style as a focal point, continue to strengthen the  construction of the leading bodies at various levels, pay  particular attention to improving the mental outlook and unity  of the leading bodies. The key to improving the mental outlook  of the leading bodies hinges on accurately understanding the  situation; comprehensively treating challenges and favorable  opportunities; resolutely preventing and overcoming the state of  being weak, fearing difficulties, and shrinking back; further  mobilizing the revolutionary spirit of constantly forging ahead;  and further carrying out the practice of making concerted  efforts for undertakings.    The key to solving the lack of  coordination and unity among leading bodies is to establish and  improve all systems and rules of procedure on democratic  centralism, overcome arbitrariness, strictly use systems to  standardize the acts of each and every member of the leading  bodies, and do a good job in resolving the issue on building a  party to serve the interests of the people and relying on party  spirit to hold powers. With these starting and resting points,  we will become selfless, open, and aboveboard, and will support  and understand each other, and live in harmony. Particularly,  party and government top leaders should set examples with their  own conduct, serve as models for safeguarding unity among  leading bodies, resolutely attend to the goal of not speaking  and doing things that are disadvantageous to unity, dare to and  be good at dissolving all contradictions affecting the unity of  leading bodies, and enable the "leading bodies" to realistically  become united leading collectives with militancy.    To strengthen leading bodies and enhance their fighting  capacity, we must enhance their ideology and rely on systems to  guarantee the accomplishment of this work. It is necessary to  establish the mechanisms of incentive and restraints for leading  bodies and leading cadres. In this connection, we must  establish a system and method to scientifically evaluate the  performance of cadres, clarify the substance, tasks, and  priorities of the evaluation work, make the evaluation work  practical, and at the same time, rely on all departments, and  the masses of grass-roots cadres, and make the work procedures  public and democratic. Through one year of efforts, we should  establish an evaluation system and the mechanisms of incentive  and restraints at all levels across the province, instill a  powerful impetus that "it is not realistic not to work, not to  do a good job, and to do shoddy work" among leading bodies and  leading cadres so that those who do well feel proud and elated  and those who do a bad job feel the pressure.    In the recruitment of cadres, under the premise of strictly  upholding the principle on party spirit, we should give priority  to promoting and placing in an important post those cadres whose  achievements are proved outstanding through evaluation, or give  them appropriate political treatment and material awards;  regarding those cadres whose work achievements are not obvious  and the achievements are average, we should give them a  yellow-card warning and urge them to rectify and improve  themselves with a set time limit; regarding those cadres who  fail to fulfill the work targets, accomplish nothing, and have a  very poor work record, we should resolutely make readjustment;  and regarding those who are actually incompetent, we should  demote or dismiss them. Thus, through equal competition, we may  select the superior and eliminate the inferior, stimulate the  broad masses of cadres to the forefront of reform, opening up,  and economic construction to struggle and fight at their own  work posts in the course of practice, and to participate in  competition. On the issue of cadres, if a party committee fails  to work this way, its cadres will not be happy, the common  practice of the ranks of cadres will not be healthy, and their  work will not be able to forge ahead.    At present, the problems on treating cadres with a  factionalist viewpoint and recruiting cadres through personal  relationship and the feeling of gratitude and resentment; the  problems on offering official posts, making lavish promises, and  cultivating personal power; the problems on recommending cadres  to the organizations in name but in fact rigidly demanding money  for promotion or job arrangements for some cadres; and some  unhealthy trends in the selection and recruitment of cadres,  such as establishing ties and getting in by the back door to ask  for an official post, have still existed in some localities and  units at varying degrees. Party committees and the organization  and personnel departments at all levels should resolutely resist  and oppose these unhealthy trends, consciously uphold the  principle of judging cadres by their party spirit and recruiting  cadres according to their actual achievements, be just and  upright, not sticking to one pattern, select the wise and use  the competent, and boldly promote and recruit cadres who have  ability and political integrity. It is necessary to expose and  criticize those who appoint people by favoritism and for the  sake of getting profits, and get by the back door to ask for a  post, and punish in line with party and administrative  discipline those who fail to correct themselves after repeated  education and whose cases are serious. Meanwhile, through  deepening reform of the cadre personnel system, we should  accelerate the establishment of a set of mechanisms and systems  for evaluating and recruiting cadres that fit the socialist  market economic structure and effectively prevent unhealthy  trends in the selection and recruitment of personnel.    5. Guidance should differ according to different cases,  give prominence to priorities, and conscientiously build the  party's grass-roots organizations well.    Implementation of the party's line, principles, policies,  and  tasks, ultimately, depends on the party's grass-roots  organizations which should play their role as political cores  and fighting bastions and depends on the more than 3 million  communist party members in Hebei who should play their leading  and exemplary role so that they can lead the vast number of  cadres and the masses to work indomitably. However, many  grass-roots organizations of the party, especially those in  rural areas, have failed to successfully perform their role,  which has seriously affected the implementation of the party's  principles, policies, and various tasks. Party committees at  all levels should have firm determination and exert great  efforts to realistically improve and strengthen the party's  grass-roots organizations and build them into a good and solid  foundation. Improvement of the party organizations in rural  areas and those in enterprises are two major tasks, and great  efforts should be exerted to make them successful.    In rural areas, we should give different guidance according  to different cases, with the focus on achieving a fairly  comfortable life. First, we should successfully consolidate and  improve advanced party branches and enable them to lead the  masses to achieve a fairly comfortable life ahead of others. We  should also earnestly summarize their experiences and use their  typical cases as examples. Localities where conditions permit  may also adopt the method of mergence, allowing advanced  villages to merge some backward villages. Second, we should do  a good job in transforming backward party branches and make  particular efforts to tackle the problems of those whose work is  stagnant or partly stagnant. In some cases, we may assign  leading cadres to hold the responsibility for guiding some  villages or assign relevant departments or advanced villages to  provide assistance and support to help backward party branches  improve their own quality, develop their collective economy, and  enhance their unity and combat strength. In others, counties  and townships may send work teams to villages to help them  select party branch secretaries, establish party branch leading  bodies, accurately select the roads to affluence, and start the  steps of development. In still others, counties and townships  may directly send cadres to assume posts in villages, who will  organize the leading bodies, select the road of development, and  leave after the villages achieve a fairly comfortable life and  village cadres are selected. Town and township are the  foundation and the county party committee is the key to  conscientiously carrying out rural party building. County and  township party committees should regard the above-mentioned work  as the most important task in party building, work out specific  plans for it, and clarify the targets and measures so that this  big, difficult, and long-standing problem can be solved well.    The establishment of the modern enterprise system and the  rapid development of shareholding enterprises, enterprise  groups, foreign-funded enterprises, private enterprises, and  urban and rural collective enterprises have put forward many new  questions and new demands on improvement of grass-roots party  organizations. We should have the courage to probe into the new  ideas for enterprises' party building to conform to this  situation in line with the criterion of "three advantages" and  with the spirit of reform. Organization departments, together  with other relevant departments, should actively participate in  state-owned enterprises' experiment with the establishment of  the modern enterprise system and explore the position,  functions, role, and styles and methods of activities of  enterprise party organizations under the modern enterprise  system. They should also conduct in-depth investigation and  study and put forward specific opinions on how the various types  of nonstate-owned enterprises establish party organizations,  carry out activities, and play their role. The general demand  is that all economic organizations should strengthen party  building boldly, those without party organizations should  actively create favorable conditions to build party  organizations, and those which have already established party  organizations should standardize their position and functions,  actively carry out the party's work, and give play to the party  organizations' due role. When building new enterprises in the  future, party organizations should be established  simultaneously; when the enterprises' administrative bodies are  established, the bodies for party affairs should also be  established simultaneously; and when production and operation  start, the party's activities should also start simultaneously.    Leading party groups of institutions of higher learning  should fully understand the historical duties they shoulder,  actually strengthen the ideological and political work among  college students and teachers, young teachers in particular,  strengthen the building of party branches of departments of  colleges, and continue to develop and expand the ranks of party  members. The vast numbers of teachers, students, and  administrative staff of colleges should be educated and guided  to foster correct outlook on life and outlook on value and to  combine their personal fates with the destiny and future of the  motherland. These leading party groups should also correctly  approach the current situation and the series of major policy  decisions of the CPC Central Committee in an effort to make  positive contributions to safeguarding social stability,  maintaining the campus stability, and promoting reform and  development.    6. We should profoundly and persistently launch the  anticorruption campaign, closely integrate the building of party  style and the improvement of administrative honesty with reform  and development, and make them promote each other.    In accelerating the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure, party committees and governments at all  levels should all the more attach importance to building party  style and improving administrative honesty and should oppose all  sorts of corrupt phenomena in a sustained, resolute, and  unremitting manner by regarding the opposition as the basic  condition for ensuring the smooth progress of reform and  development and as a basic task on party building and on the  building of political power. Practice has incontrovertibly  proved that the opposition to corruption has not hampered the  development of reform, opening up, and economic development but  has vigorously promoted the constant development of economic  construction and enabled the province to set a record high in  all major economic targets last year. It is wrong to set the  anticorruption campaign against reform, opening up, and economic  development. We should clearly notice, however, that corrupt  phenomena have not yet been resolved and the anticorruption  tasks remain very arduous. Therefore, we should on no account  lower our guard and become careless. In line with the  guidelines of the third plenary session of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission, in close combination with the  realities of Hebei, and based on the already scored  achievements, we should launch the anticorruption campaign in a  profound, sustained, and more effective manner in order to make  new progress continuously. Party committees and governments at  all levels should, like they did in the second half of last  year, make their principal party and government leaders  personally take a hand in anticorruption work, make party and  government organs grasp the work in coordination by proceeding  from their own units. This work should be grasped level by  level, with each assuming responsibility for its own work. All  fields from higher to lower levels should act together in line  with the unified arrangements and dispositions of the CPC  Central Committee, the State Council, the provincial party  committee, and the provincial government in order to win the  general war.    This year's anticorruption campaign should be continuously  focused on the three tasks, as defined by the central  authorities, of making leading cadres honest, clean, and  self-disciplined in performing official duties, investigating  and dealing with major and appalling cases, and correcting  unhealthy trends. To truly achieving success in these three  tasks and to truly and profoundly launching the anticorruption  campaign until results are achieved, the key lies in the  administrative honesty and self-discipline of leading cadres.  "The rain is leaking in the ground of the house, but the  leaking must be plugged in the ceiling." If a leading cadre  fails in maintaining administrative honesty and in being strict  with himself, he will lose the basic condition for organizing  and guiding his locality and unit to oppose corruption. Being  dishonest and even corrupt, a leading cadre will seriously  deviate from the masses, lose the support of the people, lose  the right of leadership, and, finally, ruin himself. Being  honest and self- disciplined, a leading cadre will talk with  perfect assurance and have the cohesive force in opposing  corruption and advocating administrative honesty. Therefore,  party committees at all levels and leading party groups of all  departments should actually pay attention to the administrative  honesty and self-discipline of leading cadres and resolve and  correct problems in a timely manner whenever they are found.  This year, in encouraging leading cadres to maintain  administrative honesty and to be self-disciplined, we should  conduct comparison, examination, and correction in line with the  "five regulations" defined by the third plenary session of the  Central Discipline Inspection Commission and with the problem of  infringing upon the interests of enterprises. In addition, we  should look back on the implementation of the "five regulations"  set forth by the central authorities at the preceding stage and  the "ten forbiddens" set forth by the provincial party  committee, and then make continued efforts to resolve problems.  Leading cadres of enterprises and institutions should also be  honest in performing official duties and being self-disciplined,  abide by disciplines and laws, oppose all sorts of negative and  corrupt phenomena, such as abusing powers to seek personal gain,  embezzling public funds, accepting bribes, and spending without  restraint. Leading bodies at all levels should hold democratic  activity meetings to conduct conscientious self-examination and  self-correction based on sufficient preparations and on a  unified time limit.    Principal responsible comrades of the  party committees at various levels should have the daring to  make strict checks. The discipline inspection and supervisory  departments at various levels should achieve supervision and  examination and avoid doing their work perfunctorily. The  practice and activities that are forbidden in the five new  regulations of the central authorities and those violating the  interests of the enterprises should stop immediately. The  problems with clear lines of demarcation should be corrected in  the course of examinations according to the five new  regulations. We should examine the problems without clear lines  of demarcation before handling them.    The functional departments under the party committees and  governments at various levels should assume dual  responsibilities in the struggle against corruption. On the one  hand, they should be administratively honest and  self-disciplined and consciously correct their dishonest  activities; on the other hand, they should realistically grasp  the correction of the unhealthy practice within their  departments. Most of the problems within trades are connected  with the business activities of the trade departments. All  departments at the provincial level should actually assume  responsibility, guide the improvement of the contingents of the  trades, and improve the work style of the trades. As for the  departments and trades with serious unhealthy practice, that the  people have strong complaints, and with failure to correct their  unhealthy practice, their leaders should first be called to  account. By the end of the year, we should mobilize the cadres  and the masses across the province to make a general assessment  of the work styles of the trades, select the best and the worst  through the assessment, commend those with achievements, and  investigate and affix the responsibility of the worst.    In opposing corruption, we should persistently treat the  problems by looking into both the root causes and symptoms and  pay attention to both penalty and prevention. We should not  only resolutely investigate and handle unlawful and  undisciplined cases but also solve the deep-layered problems  relating to systems and policies. We should attend to both  "opposition" and "construction" so as to gradually set up a  mechanism of ending corruption that is suitable to the market  economic system. All levels and all departments, particularly  law enforcement departments and the personnel at the posts  directly in charge of personnel, financial, and material affairs  should set up a mechanism to effectively restrict and guard  against the activities of abusing power for selfish ends, set up  and perfect a system that the people from higher levels downward  supervise one another, and bring into play the supervisory  functions of the laws, the party discipline, the administrative  procedures, and the masses. We should strengthen the study of  policies; pay attention to discovering the imperfect aspects and  existing problems in the course of implementing specific  policies, management systems, and regulations and methods; sum  up experiences; draw lessons; and set forth opinions on solving  problems. It is necessary to resolutely implement the central  regulations on separating administrative charges from the income  from fines and confiscations. The provincial financial  department should firmly attend to working out methods for  implementing the regulations and strive to thoroughly solve the  problems in this regard by the end of this year.    7. We should realistically strengthen the work of the united  front work department of the party, unite with all the forces  that can be united, and serve the safeguarding of social and  political stability and the promoting of modernization.    Along with the deepening of reform and opening up, the  gradual setup of the socialist market economic system, and the  readjustment and changes of the social economic structure, the  united front work department of the party has expanded its work  from the political sphere to various social spheres, including  the economic, cultural, and scientific and technological  spheres; from large cities to small ones; from higher layers to  the grass roots; and from the province to the places at home and  abroad. This grand united front worker contingent has the  advantages of having intensive knowledge, higher layers, wide  contacts, many domestic and overseas friends. So, it is an  extremely precious force in the province's modernization. In  front of the new situation where the scale of the united front  is ceaselessly expanded, the number of its targets continues to  increase, and its tasks continue to become heavier, the party  committees at various levels should further upgrade their  understanding about the important positions and functions of the  united front in the new age, enhance the ideas about the united  front, grasp and apply this magic weapon, and have it become a  powerful motivation to safeguard and develop the political  situation characterized by stability and unity and to promote  the economic construction and all social undertakings.    The  party committees and governments at various levels should  positively encourage and support members of the organizations of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, members  of the democratic parties, and non-party personages to conduct  activities of investigating and studying the major issues of  reform, opening up, spiritual and material civilizations, and  the people's livelihood to achieve the inspection and motions  work and to have them realistically participate in and discuss  political affairs; should conscientiously and fully consult with  personages of democratic parties and nonparty personages before  the promulgation of major policy decisions; and should  accurately treat their opinions and suggestions to make the  policy decisions more suitable to the objective reality and to  avoid making mistakes. We should pay attention to arranging  jobs, particularly real jobs, for the personages outside the  party, including democratic party personages, and ensure that  they have both jobs and rights. Simultaneously, we should  continue to encourage the personages who have contacts with  democratic parties and the united front to bring into play their  role as a go-between in bringing in foreign capital; to  establish close contacts with overseas large financial groups,  large enterprises, large monetary organizations, and well-known  personages; to do more concrete deeds in the aspect of bringing  in foreign capital; and to make more contributions to  implementing the provincial strategy of promoting the  development of the export- oriented economy and expanding the  scale of opening up. We should strengthen the work toward the  intellectuals, be concerned about and improve the working and  living conditions of the intellectuals, and vigorously encourage  and support a part of intellectuals to work at civilian-run  enterprises, civilian-run educational organizations, and  civilian-run scientific research institutions or to take the  lead in running civilian-run enterprises and institutions so as  to bring into full play their wisdom, intelligence, and  sacrificing spirit.    We should bring into full play the united front's peculiar  functions for coordination and alleviating contradictions and  create a stable and united political environment for reform,  opening up, and economic construction. We should pay attention  to having the personages on the united front to disseminate  reform among the masses whom they are able to contact with, to  help get rid of their doubts about the new contradictions and  new problems cropping up in the course of reform, and to have  the personages of all circles understand and support various  reform measures. Our province has comparatively more minority  nationalities and heavier religious tasks. So, we should guide  and unite with both believers and the masses without beliefs to  develop production and to take the path of seeking common  wealth. We should comprehensively and accurately implement the  party's policies toward religions. We should not only respect  the freedom of religions and beliefs and protect normal  religious activities but also strengthen the management of  religious affairs and ban and deal blows to various activities  of committing crimes in the name of religions so as to mobilize  the broad masses of believers' patriotic enthusiasm and to make  contributions to safeguarding social stability and promoting  economic development.    8. We should realistically strengthen the leadership over  propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united  front work and create a new situation in the work in various  aspects.    Propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and  united  front work are great matters that should be attended to by the  party committees. Strengthening the leadership of the party  committees is the key deciding the fact that whether or not the  work in these aspects can form a new momentum in the new age and  whether or not a new situation can be created. The party  committees at various levels should take the overall situation  into consideration, be sure that the party should administer  party affairs, and persist in the principle of taking a two-hand  approach and be sure that both hands are tough. At the time of  continuously strengthening the leadership over the economic  work, we should realistically grasp the propaganda,  organizational, discipline inspection, and united front work;  and have these fronts accurately and positively bring their  functions into play in the course of implementing the basic line  of the party, realizing the work of the party, and building  Hebei into an economically powerful province.    As they attend to economic work, party committees should  also strictly apply the system of responsibility for management  by objective to these aspects of work. Party committees at all  levels should consider and plan for economic development,  reform, opening up, and propaganda, organizational, discipline  inspection, and united front work in an all-around manner.  After collective study, they should also specify the tasks of  propaganda, organizational, discipline inspection, and united  front work as they do economic tasks, quantify the tasks as much  as possible, and then clarify the responsibilities and assign  tasks for every member of leading bodies and all relevant  departments to fulfill within a definite time. Fulfillment of  these tasks should be included in the annual targets for which  pertinent leaders and departments are responsible and be  appraised at the end of the year. The results of the appraisal  should become an important criterion for judging the performance  of leading cadres and the work level of the entire leading  bodies.    Efforts should be made to improve the work departments and  cadres' contingents of party committees to upgrade their overall  quality. Contingents of cadres who are politically strong,  professionally competent, and honest and upright in work styles  should be established. We should intensify ideological  education. We should educate cadres to correctly treat fame and  gain under the condition of the market economy based on party  spirit and the spirit of respect for work characterized by  selfless devotion and faithfulness to duties so as to enhance  their awareness of the mission and sense of responsibility. We  should make active efforts to create favorable conditions and  adopt various measures, such as selecting cadres to conduct  advanced study and sending cadres to other localities for  observation activities or conduct investigation and study, to  help the contingents of cadres further emancipate their minds,  update their ideas, broaden their field of vision, enrich their  knowledge, correct their thinking and work that are incompatible  with the new situation and new tasks, and increase their skills  for their own work. These contingents should be improved  organizationally. For the leading posts in the departments, we  should select a number of comrades who have both political  integrity and abilities, are in the prime of life, have  undergone the training of grass-roots work, know both politics  and economy, and have pioneering and realistic spirit. Cadres  of propaganda, organization, discipline inspection, and united  front work departments, on the premise that they are kept  relatively stable, may also be exchanged with the cadres in  charge of economic work so that they can learn from each other's  strong points to offset their weaknesses and enhance their vigor.    We should change work styles, go deep into grass-roots  levels, and summarize new experiences and work out new ideas in  the process to continuously understand new conditions and  address new problems. Following the in-depth development of the  reform designed to establish the socialist market economy  system, the party will encounter many new conditions in its own  building and various work and need to step up efforts and devote  time to study, explore, and address them. Party committees at  all levels and leaders of propaganda, organization, discipline  inspection, and united front work departments should organize  personnel, devote time, and go down to grass-roots levels to  conduct investigation and study of the new conditions and new  issued that have cropped up and map out methods to address them.  We should enable the various work of party committees to suit  the needs of reform and development in a more timely and  effective manner and enable party committees to make greater  contributions to the grand cause of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the endeavor of building an  economically strong province.</p>

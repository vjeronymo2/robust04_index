(``TCI''), and Liberty Media Corporation (``Liberty'') (collectively ``Defendants''), alleging that the proposed merger of Defendants violates section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCI is the largest cable multiple systems operator (``MSO'') in the United States in terms of subscribers, and Liberty is one of the largest MSOs. Pursuant to an agreement dated January 27, 1994, TCI and Liberty agreed to merge. Combined, TCI and Liberty would have financial interests in cable systems accounting for more than 13 million subscribers, or approximately one-fourth of the nation's cable subscribers. The combined firms would also have substantial financial interests in a large number of providers of video programming to multichannel subscription television distributors. The Complaint alleges that the effect of such combination may be substantially to lessen competition in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18, by: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Decreasing actual and potential competition among video programming providers, because the combined TCI-Liberty may have the increased ability and incentive to discriminate with respect to access to its cable systems, or the terms and conditions of such access, in favor of its affiliated video programming providers and against unaffiliated video programming providers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Decreasing actual and potential competition among multichannel subscription television distributors, because the combined TCI-Liberty may have the increased ability and incentive to deny to competing multichannel subscription television distributors access to its affiliated video programming services, or to provide such access only on unreasonable terms. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 26, 1994, the United States and Defendants filed a Stipulation by which they consented to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment designed to eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger. The proposed Final Judgment, as explained more fully below, would enjoin Defendants from discriminating against unaffiliated video programmers with respect to access to its cable systems and other multichannel subscription television distributors (``MSTDs''), and from discriminating against other MSTDs with respect to its programming providers, where such discrimination results in an unreasonable restraint on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States and Defendants have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate this action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction to construe, modify and enforce the Final Judgment, and to punish violations of the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Events Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of the parties and the proposed transaction.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> TCI is the largest cable multiple systems operator (``MSO'') in the United States, with financial and management interests in cable systems serving more than 10.2 million subscribers.

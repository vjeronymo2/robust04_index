			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Shandong Province in East  China has pledged to help all its residents shake off poverty  within five years.    In China the poverty line means that people have an annual  income of less than 200 yuan per capita and less than 200 kg of  grain a year.    A provincial official in charge of the aid-the-poor project  said that Shandong has made progress in this field over the past  decade and the number of poor people has dropped to four million  at present.    These people are mainly distributed in remote mountainous,  beach and lake areas with adverse production and living  conditions.    According to the plan, the governor will be in charge of the  overall work, while local officials' promotion will be linked to  the project.    While allocating more funds, the province will speed up the  construction of infrastructure facilities in rural areas to  ensure that every village is linked with roads, and supplied  with electricity and fresh water.    It will also popularize education and science, and launch  publicity about personal hygiene and environmental sanitation in  rural areas.</p>

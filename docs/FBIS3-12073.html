It also guaranteed they will not give preferential  treatment to anyone as they will maintain the same treatment  given to national affiliates.    The committee members, which include specialists from the  Finance Secretariat, Bunco de Mexico, and the national banking,  securities, insurance, and financial commissions, announced that  stock market and foreign stock specialists must present a  program of their participation in intermediary activities and  must specify the market segments they will attend.    Investment and investment management companies, the  committee  stated, must explain their participation in the companies they  are promoting, the sale of shareholders' stock, and the services  they will render.    Insurance and financial companies must report to authorities  the market sectors they will attend, the specific fields they  will cover, and the description of the coverage they will offer.  <H5>  Exact Information </H5>   In the specific case of stock market affiliates, the  Financial Opening Committee explained that the intermediaries  will have to specify their activities in stock, money,  intermediary, collateral, and financial corporation markets to  ensure that their activities are carried out in a diversified  and competitive manner.    Furthermore, the stock market affiliates must prepare an  investment management company program to determine how many  [branches] will be established; in what field; the amount of  initial capital paid; market position; risk diversification  strategy; basis for the implementation of utilities,  organization, and control; computer systems; and a five-year  program for the opening of offices.    In addition to the above, the program must also provide a  yearly individual financial forecast based on macroeconomic  estimates, which must include expected GNP, inflation, interest  rates, exchange rates, expected company entry into stock market  and financial system, as well as payment of foreign exchange,  employment level, infrastructure investment, and expense  increases.    Based on those projections, the commission asserted, the  stock market companies must make a yearly growth forecast as  well as ones on market participation; growth in [stock] custody,  account custody, and employee custody; solvency; liquidity;  leverage; global capital, utility margin; and net utilities at  present values.    The stock specialists must stipulate the type of values they  will promote and the services they will offer, specifying the  amounts and quoted operational margins such as risk  diversification strategies. They must include macroeconomic and  company estimates in their projections.    As for investment companies, the Financial Opening Committee  added, they must detail their objectives; stock purchasing and  selection policies; bases to diversify assets and plans to sell  stock issued; participation in the companies promoted and sale  of stockholders' stock policies; name of its controlling  company; and segments of the market it will attend.  <H5>  Marketing Is Coming </H5>   Companies that manage investment companies must present --  in  addition to the aforementioned requirements -- its program to  promote and distribute stock issued by the investment companies  they manage to the public; types of investment companies they  will service; amount of working capital in case they want to  establish a private company of variable capital; macroeconomic  and company estimates.    For insurance company affiliates, the requirements include  the operations or fields in which they want to operate; type of  insurance to be offered in Mexico; financial budget, which  includes technical and capital reserves; segment of the market  and geographic position of the area they want to cover;  description of the coverage they will offer; retention and  reinsurance policies, as well as policies to attend accidents,  adjustments, and general claims.

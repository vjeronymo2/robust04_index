			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Top job at MGN goes to deputy THE board of Mirror Group Newspapers yesterday announced that Mr Ernest Burrington had stepped down as its chairman. Mr Burrington, a former editor of The People, will stay on as a non-executive director until the company's annual meeting in July. He has been replaced by Sir Robert Clark, who has been deputy chairman since December. At the same time Mr Lawrence Guest, finance director of MGN, has resigned as a director and will be leaving the company. In a formal statement Sir Robert expressed sadness at the resignation of Mr Burrington and paid tribute to Mr Guest as a 'most loyal and committed member of the company'. In fact Sir Robert and Mr Alan Clements, the other deputy chairman, went to Mr Burrington's office yesterday and suggested it would be in the best interests of the company if he resigned. The same happened to Mr Guest, who had worked for the company for 30 years. The decision to seek the two resignations was taken at meetings of the other directors on Tuesday. Mr John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen administrator to the Maxwell private interests, was consulted before the decision was implemented. A group of banks effectively now controls the 54 per cent of MGN that used to be owned by the Maxwell private interests because the share stakes had been pledged in support of loans. No impropriety of any kind was alleged against either Mr Burrington or Mr Guest. Some directors felt that they had not acted decisively enough when the first hints of possible irregularities surfaced last August. Mr Burrington was not available for comment last night but friends pointed out that other directors who are staying on had as much knowledge of the irregularities as either Mr Burrington or Mr Guest. In the past, Mr Burrington has said that although both he and Mr Guest had been worried that money appeared to be missing from the Mirror, there was no evidence that anything illegal was happening, and there was the danger of a libel action from Robert Maxwell. MGN will next week issue accounts detailing officially for the first time the financial state of the company and the pension funds. A relisting of MGN's suspended share price is also being sought. All the signs are that there is likely to be a considerable delay in the sale of the group, which includes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, The People, Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail. All Mr Talbot will say is that there are no plans at present to sell the company but that the issue will be kept under review. However, after the appointment of Department of Trade and Industry inspectors to look at the affairs of MGN and in particular the flotation, it may now be well into next year before there is a sale. Soon after taking over as chairman in December after the death of Maxwell, Mr Burrington expressed disgust at what his former employer had done.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Consumer survey reports little interest in saving Consumers believe this is the worst time for saving than at any period in the past five years, a quarterly consumer survey by Gallup and BSL, the business consultancy, shows. The survey shows that a balance of nearly 50 per cent of people believe this is a bad time to save - the highest figure since the survey started in 1989. Savings intentions have also fallen to their lowest level recorded, with the balance of consumers intending to save now less than 40 per cent. Although this fall may reflect the low level of interest rates, the survey suggests that the main factor is that 'households are to some extent compensating for their weak finances by running down their savings'. The results suggest that households have been surprisingly successful in planning for the impact of April's tax increases, and continue spending at a steady rate. Household finances were expected to deteriorate in the second quarter, at the same rate as in the first quarter, before the tax rises. The survey calculates that spending rose 0.5 per cent in the past quarter compared with the previous quarter, and by 3.4 per cent compared with the same period last year. The confidence of consumers in their own spending intentions remained unchanged between the first and second quarters. Mr David Fell, director of BSL, said: 'It is perhaps surprising that the actual tax rises should have had so little impact.' But, he added: 'It remains to be seen how long consumers will be willing to run down their savings to support spending.' One factor that might scale back spending later this year is that consumers have become more gloomy about economic prospects, he said. Fear of unemployment has fallen in all regions apart from East Anglia and the south-east and is at its lowest since the middle of 1990. July 1994 Gallup/BSL Quarterly Regional Consumer Survey.

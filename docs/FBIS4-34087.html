			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ``special correspondent'' Elia Semeone from </F> Belem, Brazil]    [Text] On 6 June, Chile urged the Inter-American community  to focus on honesty on the grounds that corruption is a threat  to the democratic governments that, for the first time in  history, are installed in most countries of the hemisphere.    Chile also emphasized that economic development and social  well-being must go hand in hand, and that free trade should be  promoted through ever-broadening integration mechanisms.    Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa made these  proposals  on 6 June during his address before the OAS General Assembly.    The issue of honesty and its effects on growth and the  shoring-up of democracy is a new concept within the framework of  the OAS, a concept that Chile decided to include in the  organization's agenda this year.    Figueroa reiterated Chile's commitment to the Americas and  said that from its viewpoint any common effort to strengthen  democracy in the hemisphere is very important.    He expressed Chile's utmost interest in the struggle against  extreme poverty because severe social differences in American  countries pave the way for political instability, which usually  weakens democracy and jeopardizes peace in the hemisphere.    Figueroa said: "We must realize these urgent needs and the  subtle threats against democracy in our countries."    He said it is necessary to modernize the state, which  implies  turning it into an effective and capable manager by staffing it  with trained, honest, and public service-oriented people.    Figueroa emphasized that honesty must be addressed as part  of  this quest for the modernization of the state.    He quoted Chilean President Eduardo Frei's address to  Congress on 21 May: "The lack of public ethics is the result of  an uncontrolled exercise of power, and ambiguous  responsibilities... Public ethics affect private business and  public administration alike."    The foreign minister stated that society's commitment to  democracy will undoubtedly be strengthened if administrations  remain honest, if excessive centralization of power and  decisionmaking is abolished, and if the required oversight  mechanisms are established.    Among the issues Chile considers in need of priority  attention from the OAS, Figueroa mentioned the development of  American people within the framework of free trade, fairness,  and growing integration. He said the recent amendments to the  OAS Charter -- which allow the organization, among other things,  to suspend members for breaches of democratic order -- show once  again that democracy, development, and peace are closely related.    Figueroa stressed: "Our countries must have development  formulas that ensure fairness. Our economic policies must seek  sustained growth as a way to guarantee the well-being of all  social strata."    He added that this means all countries of the region must be  able to freely market their products. He praised the Marrakech  agreements on free trade, and urged all American governments to  seek out agile and effective formulas for economic integration.    Figueroa reaffirmed that Chile will pursue economic  cooperation and free trade agreements with other American  countries, and emphasized his government's decision to seek  rapprochement with the Common Market of the South.    He said: "Regional trade freedom is Chile's topmost priority  and that is what we work hardest for. We would like to see  every country in the continent share our desire to implement a  policy of open regionalism which -- if followed by practical  agreements -- will fuel our economies and allow us to improve  the standards of living of our people."    Figueroa said the region must take concrete steps toward a  realistic integration process that is open to the world economy.    Figueroa mentioned the hemispheric summit that U.S.  President  Bill Clinton has called, saying that Chile warmly supports it.    Chile's foreign minister said: "We are convinced that it is  a  worthwhile opportunity to thoroughly study burning regional  issues such as free trade, economic cooperation, and the  development of our countries. We hope this summit will yield  concrete results and a clear-cut and feasible plan of action."    He conveyed Chile's satisfaction over the OAS  acknowledgement  that social issues must be considered in the search to maintain  peace.    Figueroa recalled that the World Summit on Social  Development  will take place next year in response to Chile's proposal to the  United Nations.    The Chilean foreign minister addressed the significance of  cooperation, protection of the environment, and full respect for  human rights.    He underscored the need to maintain peace and security  within  a more global concept of the latter, by promoting measures to  enhance trust.    Figueroa said conditions for improving regional security  have  improved in recent years. Chile is convinced that among all the  continents, the Americas probably have the best chance of  success.    He emphasized the steps Chile has taken in this direction,  like the signing of the Mendoza Commitment to ban chemical and  biological weapons, which Argentina and Brazil have also signed.  He mentioned Chile's compliance with all obligations of the  Tlatelolco Treaty which bans nuclear weapons from Latin America.    Figueroa outlined Chile's efforts in the quest for a new  system capable of eliminating chemical weapons throughout the  world.    He said: "Chile is convinced that efforts in this direction  must be made prudently, gradually, and realistically by taking  successive steps rather than by embarking on overly broad and  pretentious schemes which turn out to be unfeasible in the long  run."    Figueroa stated that current conditions are favorable for  redesigning hemispheric security. On the one hand this process  should make hemispheric security a more global concept, while at  the same time it should encourage all kinds of measures -- be  they political, diplomatic, military, educational, or cultural  -- to stimulate trust and security.    The foreign minister thanked Joao Clemente Baena Soares for  his contribution to the OAS as its secretary general for 10  years, and conveyed Chile's support for the incoming OAS  secretary general, current Colombian President Cesar Gaviria,  who will assume that position in August.</p>

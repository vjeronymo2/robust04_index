			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tax concern displaces many broader issues - City Watch FINANCIAL markets may go up and down (mostly down, so far) but how will the City of London itself be affected by the election outcome? European economic and monetary union is one key issue. By the end of this year the European Community is due to choose the location of the new European Central Bank (ECB). The UK will hold the EC presidency for six months from July, so the decision could be taken at Edinburgh summit in December. The Labour party is committed to active Emu negotiations; its manifesto says that the ECB's headquarters should be in Britain (though, curiously, not specifically in London). The Liberal Democrats are also positive about Emu. But the Conservative wait-and-see approach is scarcely designed to lure an important community institution. According to Mr Richard Brealey, a London Business School professor: 'Where the central bank is based hardly matters. Where it deals clearly does.' Another significant decision in late 1992 could well concern the choice of a new governor of the Bank of England, to succeed Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton in July 1993. The Liberal Democrats want to give the Bank independent powers; the other manifestos are muted on this. However, the Maastricht Treaty committed any future British government to start in 1994 the process leading to independence for the Bank. Mr David Lomax, economic adviser to National Westminster Bank, thinks the Conservatives could turn out to have a much more positive attitude to the EC in the next parliament, given the departure of many leading hardliners. As for a Labour regime, he argues that it would repudiate the notorious opt-out clause inserted by the Conservative government at Maastricht. 'I see Europe as a struggle for power. The opt-out clause is really quite debilitating in that respect for the UK.' Labour's more positive attitude to Europe counts for little in the City compared with its threatened tough tax regime for high-earners. There are fears that foreign financial executives would move overseas if their income-tax rate jumped from 40 to 59 per cent. It is possible, though, that a Labour chancellor might be willing to make tax concessions to foreigners, as Mr Denis Healey did in the 1970s. Another damaging tax development might be the retention of  1/2 per cent stamp duty on share deals, set for abolition when the Stock Exchange Taurus electronic settlement system is running. The shadow Budget retained stamp duty worth almost Pounds 800m for 1993-94, but suggested it might still be abolished, albeit a further year late. Little is said on investor protection in the manifestos, apart from a somewhat surprising Conservative proposal to shift overall responsibility for financial regulation from the Department of Trade and Industry to the Treasury. In general it is likely that Labour would be more interventionist than the Conservatives have been and might not be so willing for the crises to drag on indefinitely at Lloyd's of London, for example.</p>

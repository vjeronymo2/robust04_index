On the afternoon of 11 January,  six Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion [ACP] senators joined  the senators elected on 18 January to dismiss the president of  the Senate, Senator Firmin Jean-Louis. Grand'Anse Sen. Bernard  Sansaricq said President Jean-Louis' management is at the root  of the threat of dissolution of the Haitian parliament  brandished today by the far Right. [passage omitted]    Furthermore, during this session at the Senate of the  Republic, there was also the issue of setting the quorum at nine  instead of 11 [senators]. After much discussion, the  participants in this session adopted a resolution read by Sen.  Osny Eugene, one of the parliamentarians elected 18 January.    [Begin Sansaricq recording, in Creole] We know that the  Senate of the Republic must remain the champion of democracy and  freedom that it is. As a Haitian, I was saddened to hear that  200 people in Cite Soleil had lost their homes. Their houses  were burned because the Senate was not there to do its job,  because the far Right was able to go into the streets. In this  respect, I personally accuse President Firmin Jean-Louis. If the  Senate had been there to assume its responsibilities beside and  leading the Haitian Army, the Army would not have let that  happen in Cite Soleil. [end recording]    This was Sen. Bernard Sansaricq in his intervention on 11  January at this session of the Senate of the Republic, a session  in which the National Front for Change and Democracy members did  not participate. We spoke of the resolution adopted at the  Senate of Republic on 11 January by the ACP senators and the  parliamentarians elected 18 January. The resolution set the  quorum at nine instead of 11. Let us listen to this resolution  as read by Sen. Osny Eugene.    [Begin Eugene recording] Article 1. In order to have at our  disposal new and sufficient statutory provisions to allow us to  face the serious climate of the times, the provisional quorum of  the Senate is hereby set at nine members.    Article 2. The Senate Office formed by acclamation on  Tuesday, 10 August, 1993 is and remains dismissed as of today.    Article 3. A new Senate Provisional Office called the Office  of the Safeguard of National Sovereignty and Public Safety,  designated by the acronym BSNP, is constituted. The mission of  BSNP is: first, urgently to proceed to elect a final Office;  second, to ensure that the interests of the Senate of the  Republic that is now endangered are safeguarded; third,  expressly to address a copy to all those -- including civilian,  military, parliamentary authorities, or individuals -- concerned  by the present Resolution.

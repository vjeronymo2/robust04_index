			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Herring Baker drops to Pounds 1.36m PRE-TAX profits at Herring Baker Harris, the chartered surveyor, slumped from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 1.36m in the year to January 31. As it forecast in January, the board is proposing a cut in the final dividend to 0.5p (3.75p) giving a total for the year of 3.75p (7p). Earnings per share fell to 3.97p (19.16p). The shares lost 9p on the day to close at 62p. The results included the first full-year contribution from Baker Harris Saunders, the chartered surveyor which merged with the old Herring Son &amp; Daw in early 1992. The 1992 comparative figures are for Herring Son &amp; Daw only. Mr Nicholas Owen, chairman, said: 'The decline reflects some rationalisation following the merger but it was the setback in property values and markets that hit us.' He warned that trading in the current year remained difficult. Turnover rose 44 per cent to Pounds 19.4m (Pounds 13.5m) but fell 9.6 per cent from the 1992 turnover of both companies combined. At the year-end the company had net debt of Pounds 999,000 for gearing of 25 per cent, against cash of Pounds 3.81m. Net interest paid was Pounds 24,000 against net interest received of Pounds 167,000. It had a cash outflow during the year of Pounds 4.8m, of which about Pounds 3.5m was merger-related. Operating costs rose to Pounds 18m (Pounds 10.1m) of which Pounds 10.9m were staff costs, including redundancies. In the UK costs were cut by 7 per cent overall. The group is reaping benefits from the merger with, for example, a shift in the relative contribution of the six divisions. The professional division contributed 18.3 per cent of turnover (31.4 per cent) and the agency division 26.7 per cent (14.5 per cent). CPC Baker Harris, the US property consultancy, suffered a loss and required a cash injection. Most of the Los Angeles office is being sold to Mr Nicholas Costa, the American company's former president.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Fresh disarray in US-Mexico narcotics case: Doctor kidnapped to face trial over murdered agent is cleared by judge A MEXICAN doctor kidnapped and taken across the border to the US to stand trial over a drug agent's murder was found innocent by a judge in Los Angeles yesterday, AP reports from Los Angeles. The decision came as a stunning blow to the prosecution in the case, which has caused political controversy in both Mexico and the US. The judge ruled that the US government never had sufficient evidence to try Dr Humberto Alavarez Machain in connection with the death in 1985 of the US drugs agent Enrique Camarena. 'There has to be stronger evidence than you have offered to find that a man is guilty of kidnapping, murder and torture,' District Judge Edward Rafeedie told the prosecutors. 'This does not rise to the level required to get this case to the jury.' He accused federal prosecutors of presenting 'the wildest speculation'. The prosecutors had argued that when Mr Camarena was kidnapped and tortured to death by Mexico's drug lords, they had Dr Alvarez Machain inject him with drugs to keep him alive for further torture. The doctor was kidnapped by bounty hunters in Guadalajara in April 1990 and was then spirited to the US for trial. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) maintains that his kidnapping was legal and justified. But the Mexican government protested that the doctor's kidnapping violated Mexican sovereignty and it has repeatedly demanded his return. In the latest trial - the third resulting from the drug agent's killing - the defence attorney said there were no puncture marks or drug residue in the agent's body to prove he had been given injections. Nor were there fingerprints to link a syringe found at the torture house to Dr Alvarez Machain, he said. Seven people have been convicted in US courts in the Camarena killing and more than two dozen in Mexico. Judge Rafeedie had already refused to grant a judgment of acquittal for Dr Alvarez Machain's co-defendant, Ruben Zuno Arce, a brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis Echeverria. He also ruled earlier that the doctor's kidnapping violated US-Mexico extradition treaties and that US courts did not have jurisdiction to try him. But on that ruling, the judge eventually was overturned by the US Supreme Court. Damian Fraser adds from Mexico City: Allegations highlighted lately in the case of the murdered drugs agent have come at an inconvenient time for the Mexican government, which is anxious to build ties to the incoming Clinton administration in the US. According to two witnesses called by the US government, high Mexican officials were all in the pay of the Guadalajara drug cartel. The witnesses claimed that these officials were present at meetings in which Mr Camarena's murder was planned and visited the house where Mr Camarena was held on the day he was killed. In the view of the Mexican government the charges are 'based on the testimony of delinquents and criminals who do not merit credibility in light of their personal history'. The accusations, whether true or not, are likely to draw attention to the greatest flaw in the Mexican state: corruption in the legal and political system. In practically all the big drug scandals over the past decade, be it the murder of Mr Camarena, the prison riot between rival drug gangs at Matamoros last year, or the shoot-out between the army and police in Veracruz this year, officials of the police, the army or the government have been implicated in narcotics trafficking. The police are also largely responsible for Mexico's dismal human rights record, another issue likely to be raised by the US Congress when it considers the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Arts: Murder is easy - Theatre Murder may be easy, as several of the characters in Agatha Christie's thriller keep saying; it is much harder to guess whodunnit. It was not until about page 222 of the book - only 30 pages from the end - that I reckoned I knew for certain who was the guilty party. Clive Exton's stage version maintains the suspense just as long; anyone who guesses at the interval will almost certainly be wrong. Guessing is what you are intended to do. Murder is Easy is an old-fashioned thriller without psychological frills. As the adapter of many of the Poirot stories for television, Exton is a master of the craft. I am inclined to say that on stage Christie works better, as here, without either a Poirot or a Miss Marples as the central investigator: just a one off set of people who happen to be involved in murder. Exton has re-arranged, simplified and to some extent modernised the original plot. There is one murder fewer: the figure of Dr Humbleby is missing. This is a pity because it slightly reduces the number of motives and suspects, but perhaps the full text would have been too complex for the stage. Lord Whitfield has become a rather grander press magnate than he seemed in the book. He owns three national titles and 16 magazines. Played by Nigel Davenport, he gives instructions to his Fleet street editors down a megaphone from the village of Wychwood-Under-Ashe. Speaking with a Hampshire accent, he never seems like Lord Beaverbrook nor even Robert Maxwell, but maybe in these matters it is sensible not to be too close to life, and it is part of the technique that nobody is presented as particularly dislikeable: it makes the guessing all the harder. Charlotte Attenborough as Bridget, Lord Whitfield's secretary-cum-fiancee, has become a thoroughly practical modern woman: ready to marry for money because the marital duties will not be much different from the secretarial, but vastly better rewarded. No-one would accuse her of base motives. She looks remarkably attractive and self-confident throughout. The weakness is perhaps the straight male lead played by Peter Capaldi who arrives in the village suspecting that murders have taken place and determined to investigate. Almost inevitably therefore he ceases to be interesting, for not even by the wildest stretch of imagination could he be regarded as a suspect. This is not entirely Capaldi's fault, but he could be a bit more lively. There are compensations in some of the smaller parts: for example, Jo Kendall as the cleaning lady with eight children, two of them dead. Ms Kendall has some wonderful physical movements and plays a splendid scene with Roger Booth as Major Horton, whose wife has just died. Irene Sutcliffe as Honoria Waynflete, a well-born village spinster, knows how to create a frisson when she wants to. There is also some black comedy, notably concerning what happened to her pet canary. The sets, designed by Christopher Morley and Christopher Woods, are ambitious, moving from Lord Whitfield's ostentatiously structured house to more homely surroundings and to the local downs where strange practices occur. Sometimes the scene changes are a little slow, as is the general direction by Wyn Jones. All that can be speeded up. The main thing is to keep guessing. No-one can guarantee that Murder is Easy will run for 40 years or even 40 months, but no-one predicted that about the Mousetrap either. Duke of York's Theatre. (071) 836 5122</p>

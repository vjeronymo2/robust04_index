			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $25 GUIDE: A SONIC BOOM: GROUPS, DUOS  </P> <P> Followers of the $25 Guide will notice that for the first time the Guide  consists solely of groups or duos. So what's Emmylou Harris doing here? Her new  album is a collection of duets. The Guide is a blueprint to keeping up with  what's exciting in pop music on a budget of $25 a month (or $40 for compact  disc buyers).  </P> <P> </P> <P> July  </P> <P> Sonic Youth's "Goo" (DGC Records) -- Have these artsy, guitar-worshipping,  post-punk underground heroes sold their musical soul by moving up to the giant  Geffen Records complex? A record as good-natured yet as relentlessly  independent as "Goo" answers the question with a strong no.  </P> <P> The Sundays' "Reading, Writing and Arithmetic" (DGC) -- This quartet was so  highly touted in the British press after its 1988 debut single (included on the  album) that it's a wonder it was able to maintain its innocent, understated,  Cocteau Twins-influenced style and make an album as level-headed and as  engaging as this.  </P> <P> Tony! Toni! Tone's! "The Revival" (Wing) -- Tony! Toni! Tone! is part of an  Oakland scene (along with the more rap-oriented Digital Underground) that is  combining funk, rap and pop with a sense of celebration and imagination that  recalls Bay Area pioneer Sly Stone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> August  </P> <P> Emmylou Harris' "Duets" (Reprise) -- Most of these tracks have appeared on  sound-track albums or on albums by other artists, but they are gathered  together for the first time, and serve as testimony to the artistry and range  of arguably the most satisfying female singer ever in country music. Among the  memorable pairings: Gram Parsons, Roy Orbison, Neil Young and George Jones.  </P> <P> Jesus Jones' "Liquidizer" (SBK) -- Among the marvelously eclectic influences  cited in the album's liner notes -- if not always heard in the post-punk,  psychedelic sound of this British band: the Byrds, Public Enemy, Sonny Boy  Williamson, the Jungle Brothers and Faith No More.  </P> <P> Was (Not Was)'s "Are You Okay?" (Chrysalis) -- In this album-of-the-year  contender, David and Don Was also mix and match styles (rap, funk, rock and  more) in a sometimes wild and wacky, sometimes purposeful look at American  heroes, institutions and foibles.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Wuerzburg (DPA) -- On Saturday [30 April] the  Christian Social Union [CSU] opened its European election  campaign in Wuerzburg with a commitment to European integration.  Speaking to 2,000 followers at a European Festival, CSU  Chairman and FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel called for a  Europe of stability, federalism, and diversity. Germany must be  willing to accept responsibility in Europe and in the world,  Waigel said. He called for a fair division of the financial  burdens within the European Union. The return of money to  Germany must be improved.    Bavaria's Minister-President Edmund Stoiber said that anyone  who is proclaiming a departure from the Maastricht Treaty puts  Germany's international credibility at stake. However, it must  be understood as a warning signal that the people's approval for  European unification is declining to an alarming extent.  Therefore, the CSU is calling for a reform of the European  Union "at the head and limbs" and wants to establish more  "political transparency." [passage omitted]</p>

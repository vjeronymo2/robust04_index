			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARGENTINES DENY PAPER'S STORY OF PLOT TO KILL BUSH  </P> <P> A newspaper reported today that police uncovered a plot to kill President Bush  during his visit here next week, but government officials said the report was  unfounded.  </P> <P> "There is no confirmation of supposed plans to assassinate President Bush,"  Interior Minister Julio Mera Figueroa said.  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy refused to comment on the report by the sensationalist daily  tabloid, Diario Popular.  </P> <P> Police arrested a Bolivian on suspicion of membership in a terrorist group. But  the judge in charge of the case, Alberto Duran, said, "There is no evidence of  a plan against the life of Mr. Bush."  </P> <P> The Bolivian was identified as Carlos Anibal Monzon Novena, 41.  </P> <P> Diario Popular claimed that Monzon Novena was the leader of a group called the  Union of Revolutionary Workers that planned to attack Bush during his 22-hour  visit in Argentina on Dec. 5-6.  </P> <P> The paper reported that Monzon Novena was imprisoned from 1977 to 1983 during  the military dictatorship for alleged guerrilla activities and that his group  is a spinoff from the Revolutionary Army of the People that tried to overthrow  Argentina's governments.  </P></p>

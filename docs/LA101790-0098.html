			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOOR NOTES;  </P> <P> EVEN DEER HUNTERS FIND BEARS APLENTY  </P> <P> The Department of Fish and Game estimated there were 18,000 black bears in  California when it persuaded the Sacramento Superior Court to reinstate a hunt  this year, despite continued objections from animal-rights groups.  </P> <P> But what that figure really means is becoming clear since the hunting started  last weekend.  </P> <P> "We've got bears coming out of our ears," said Herb Pierce, a DFG wildlife  biologist in Eureka.  </P> <P> Steve Arrison, a biologist in Redding, said: "Talking to deer hunters, they're  seeing more bears than they've ever seen."  </P> <P> That may be partly because there was no hunt last year.  </P> <P> Some hunters are finding bears without even looking for them. A few of the 17  who checked in bears at Redding the last two days were actually hunting for  deer but were carrying bear tags, just in case, when an unlucky bruin wandered  into their sights.  </P> <P> "Even though they're hunting without dogs, they get a pretty good percentage of  the bears," Pierce said.  </P> <P> Normally, 70% of the successful bear hunters use dogs to pursue and tree the  animals. If deer hunters are taking them incidentally, there must be a large  population.  </P> <P> However, Pierce doubts that the quota of 1,250 will be reached before the hunt  ends Dec. 30, even if the limit of 15,000 tags is sold. Historically, the  hunter success rate is only about 10%.  </P> <P> DFG wardens have a message for hunters: Read your tags and the fine print in  the regulations.  </P> <P> Capt. Ed DeGraffenreid said of a spot check of deer hunters one recent weekend,  "Over one-third were cited for tag violations."  </P> <P> Thirty were cited for fish and wildlife violations. Eleven citations were  written for errors explained on the tag, such as a failing to notch the tag  properly or not attaching it to the deer.  </P> <P> Wardens said hunters also need to pay closer attention to zone boundaries and  season dates.  </P> <P> Let it grow, let it grow, let it grow: Anyone catching a king salmon under 20  inches around the Channel Islands is urged to release it.  </P> <P> It's the law, but it's especially important since more than 40,000 juvenile  kings were released in Channel Islands Harbor last month.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Fish and Game Advisory Commission, United Anglers of  California and other volunteers have been distributing posters and warnings to  anglers who might think the salmon are just another variety of ocean fish.  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> OCEAN FISHING -- A 619-pound blue marlin was landed after a 45-minute fight by  Glendale's Ross Douglas aboard Point Loma Sportfishing's American Angler, which  was on an eight-day trip that ended Oct. 12. The marlin had to be cut into  three pieces so it would fit in the fish hold. . . . Seminars on light-tackle  techniques for big-game fishing are scheduled tonight and Oct. 24 at Rio Hondo  College in Whittier. Details: (213) 699-6189.  </P> <P> HUNTING -- The Department of Fish and Game says it has openings for its annual  junior pheasant hunt at Raahauge's Pheasant Club in Norco Nov. 3. Other shoots  for hunters 16 and younger are scheduled at Palo Verde Nov. 17, the Imperial  Valley and San Jacinto Dec. 1 and Lone Pine Dec. 31. Details: (213) 590-5126.  </P> <P> After a limited hunt, the DFG is transferring 70 of the remaining 140 tule elk  from its Grizzly Island Wildlife Area east of the Bay Area to reduce the herd  to the habitat's carrying capacity. Last month's hunt took a quota of 30 elk --  10 bulls and 20 cows -- despite the interference of anti-hunting demonstrators,  38 of whom were arrested. According to the DFG, California now has 21 herds  with 2,700 elk -- the highest number since before the Gold Rush.  </P> <P> FLY-FISHING -- A slide program on "Northern California's Trout and Steelhead  Opportunities" by guide-author Brad Jackson is scheduled at Greg Lilly's store  in Tustin Saturday, Oct. 27, 1 p.m. . . . Dr. Lawrence Jelinek, professor of  history at Loyola Marymount University, will discuss agriculture, water policy  and environmentalism before the South Bay Flyfishers Nov. 7, 7:30 p.m., at the  Westchester Townhouse.  </P> <P> Joe Fisher III, will teach fly casting for children ages 6-12 at Bob Marriott's  Fly Fishing Fair Nov. 17-18. Details: (714) 525-1827. . . . The Long Beach  Casting Club offers beginning fly tying each Tuesday, 7:30 p.m., for 17 weeks  starting Oct. 30.  </P> <P> SETTLEMENT -- In what skippers in Montauk, N.Y., say sets a bad precedent, a  Montauk fisherman recently won a three-year legal fight over a 696-pound  bluefin tuna that was kept by the crew of the Sgeria II. The International Game  Fish Assn. reports that George Conserva was awarded $7,200 in an out-of-court  settlement.  </P> <P> Conserva, on a deep-sea charter with three friends, caught the fish on Aug. 16,  1987. He said he was never told he couldn't keep the fish and he planned to  have it mounted. Capt. Wink Doerzbacher told Conserva he was going to sell it  to the Japanese, where there is a tremendous market for bluefin as sashimi.  Enormous litigation costs led to the settlement in Conserva's favor.  </P> <P> Moral: Check the captain's rules ahead of time.  </P> <P> NUMBERS -- U.S. fishing licenses bought in 1989 totaled 30,302,244. California  sold the most, was the highest at 2,164,120, and Hawaii was the fewest, lowest  at 9,282.  </P> <P> BOATS -- The 22nd annual Long Beach Boat Show opens Friday at the Long Beach  Convention Center, with 475 power and sail boats, 300 booth displays and  seminars featuring fishing and outdoor travel experts. Hours: 3 to 10 p.m.  weekdays, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturdays and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays.  </P></p>

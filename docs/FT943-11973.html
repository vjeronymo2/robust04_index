			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (2): More alert and questioning - John Gapper on the supervisory role Two important anniversaries for the Bank fall this summer, in addition to the tercentenary. One is the 20th anniversary of the formation of a banking supervision department. The other is the third anniversary of the traumatic closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). Banking supervision was born out of crisis - the secondary banking crisis of 1973-74 - and remains an activity prone to scandal and upset. But the three years since the BCCI debacle have been especially testing for the 250 supervisors who oversee the operations of 488 domestic and foreign-owned banks in the UK. This is partly because they have been absorbing a series of reforms intended to meet criticisms of the Bank of England's supervisory style, made by Sir Thomas Bingham in his inquiry into BCCI. But they have also had to operate amid a public debate over whether they should do the job at all. Although the Bingham criticisms were not followed by any visible change in the senior ranks of banking supervisors, there has been a sea change in the past year. The appointment last August of Michael Foot to succeed Roger Barnes as head of banking supervision is the most visible sign. Mr Foot, a 47-year-old career Bank of England man who had not worked in supervision before, emphasises the change that has occurred. He talks of a 'more alert and questioning style' among officials who have traditionally been less adversarial in their relations with banks than in other countries. 'There was an awful lot of good in what we did before, but there was a feeling that we were too willing to take on trust everything that was said,' he says. He argues that Bingham's call for the Bank to be able to switch to a more aggressive style when demanded has been 'tremendously helpful'. The Bank has resisted changing to US-style supervision, under which auditing teams constantly examine banks' books. 'We are still nothing like the armies of OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) investigators who pretty well live in some of the big US banks,' says Mr Foot. But it has placed more emphasis on review teams, which can spend two or three days reviewing systems and controls at an institution. About 120 such visits are made each year, and staff have received fresh training in fraud awareness to be able to pick up signs that something is amiss. This effort has been reinforced by a special investigations unit, established after the Bingham inquiry, composed of 11 accountants with 'forensic' skills in analysing accounts to detect signs of fraud. The unit, headed by Mr Ian Watt, is not based within banking supervision, but supports it. Mr Watt argues that supervisors have been 'glad to have someone to turn to if they suspect fraud'. Some 170 cases have been referred to the unit since it was set up, about half of which have required some action. Mr Watt says that it gets many tip-offs from suspicious bank employees. Yet although the unit has referred a few cases to police, there have been no prosecutions so far. Mr Watt argues that the unit's deterrent effect is valuable in itself. But he admits it is 'important that people are brought to account, and the public sees they are properly punished'. Mr Watt says that senior managements of banks co-operate with the unit's inquiries willingly because they usually suffer from the effects of fraud by employees or customers. 'Most banks are very much with us in our work because they are usually the victims of these things,' he says. At the same time, the Bank faces growing complexity in its core task of supervising honest institutions. This is because of technological innovation, and the growing emphasis in banks on securities, treasury and derivatives trading. These areas require greater sophistication among supervisors. The Bank has a traded markets team which examines models used by banks. Mr Foot says the Bank 'clearly cannot compete on a financial basis' to recruit specialists in derivatives who could earn more outside, but some are keen to have a stint at the Bank on their employment record. These developments in supervision are one of the reasons he advances for retaining the function within the Bank. He says that the Bank's role at the heart of London money markets and the gilts market gives its officials practical experience of financial markets rather than relying on theory. The Bank's critics have two arguments for stripping it of supervision. One is that financial boundaries are blurring, and banks should be regulated by the same supervisor as securities firms and others. The other is that the Bank's monetary role can conflict with its supervisory one. Mr Foot admits that the structure of self-regulation for other bodies under the 1986 Financial Services Act is still new - and 'not as intellectually attractive' as having a single unified regulator. But he argues that the main task is to ensure that regulatory efforts are well co-ordinated. He cites relations with the Building Societies Commission, which he says cause no difficulties of 'things disappearing down the cracks between us'. He argues that other links must be developed similarly. 'We need to ensure that our relations with all regulators are on the same basis,' he says. On the second argument - that a central bank might hold back from deflating an over-heated economy if banks would be bankrupted by asset price deflation  -Mr Foot says the institutional arrangements are irrelevant. Such pressures would 'emerge somewhere' in a monetary crisis. The Bank's supervisors are able to celebrate the various anniversaries that fall this summer without a sense of doom. Despite the difficulties of BCCI, they have adapted their style and methods enough to satisfy most critics without transforming the institution completely. Mr Foot emphasises the Bank's determination not to switch to 'ghastly over-regulation' because of pressures to prevent scandals and collapse. Its role remains primarily to protect depositors. 'A level playing field does not mean that we have to smooth out every bump on the surface,' he says.</p>

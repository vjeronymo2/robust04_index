			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineev] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- Presidents Bill Clinton  and Boris Yeltsin began their discussions in the Kremlin today  in an atmosphere of sincere partnership, according to the  Russian president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov. Both  sides were proceeding from an understanding that nothing is  possible in this world without Russia and the United States, he  said.    Despite the fact that Clinton's Air Force One landed in  Moscow later than scheduled, the official ceremony of greeting  in the Kremlin began a mere 11 minutes behind the schedule on  Thursday morning. Bill Clinton arrived in the Kremlin from  Hotel Radisson- Slavynskaya, where he stayed overnight, at  09.11. The official ceremony of greetings took place, according  to a tradition, in St. George's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace.    President Boris Yeltsin recalled his first meeting with  President Bill Clinton in Vancouver during which they laid the  groundwork for Russian-American partnership as well as for their  personal rapport and friendship. He said the atmosphere of the  hall where they were meeting was conducive to the profundity and  success of discussions.    Bill Clinton responded to Yeltsin's "welcome to Russia,  welcome to Moscow" by stressing that cooperation between Russia  and the United States at the present historical stage aimed to  create a new security structure in Europe on the basis of  democratic values and free economies which will further define  the greatness of Russia.    The two presidents then spent almost 90 minutes together in  the Green Hall of the Kremlin Palace discussing the latest  developments in the two countries in the presence of the  presidential aide Dmitriy Ryurikov, special advisor to the U.S.  secretary of state Strobe Talbott and interpreters.    While the two presidents conferred in the Green Hall, the  leaders of the diplomatic departments of Russia and the United  States Andrey Kozyrev and Warren Christopher were working in the  nearby Yellow Hall brushing up the package of Russo-American  agreements and statements which the presidents were due to sign  later. Three agreements are already fully ready for signing --  on air communications, on cooperation in the field of health  care services and biomedical research, and cooperation in the  study of radiation effects on humans and the environment.    A memorandum of intent to cooperate in export controls has  also been prepared for signing, as well as a joint  Russian-American statement on the Middle East.    The two presidents would also sign the main document -- the  Moscow Declaration and make a statement on human rights and  another on the nuclear non-proliferation.    After a walkabout between buildings of the Kremlin and a  visit to the Assumption Cathedral, Yeltsin and Clinton returned  to the Grand Kremlin Palace where they were joined by other  officials to continue discussions which lasted until 14;00,  longer than scheduled.    Commenting on the second session, Yeltsin's press secretary  Vyacheslav Kostikov said the summit was taking place in a new  political situation - after Russia adopted a new constitution by  a popular vote. "Russia has joined the club of revolutionary  democracies, and this cannot be overlooked in the process of  discussions", Kostikov said.    He also pointed out that "the role played by the great  powers  in the world" will continue to enhance". Kostikov recalled that  hopes for stabilization after the end of the Cold War failed to  materialize in some parts of the world, including Yugoslavia,  transcaucasus, and Latin America, and said that "the world needs  a strong new order, and Russia will play its role of a great  power in it".    Kostikov said Clinton and Yeltsin touched upon relations  between president and legislature. Yeltsin recounted the latest  developments in Russia following the December parliamentary  elections. The two presidents also touched on the Brussels  meeting of the NATO member states. Clinton set forth the key  points of his Partnership for Peace initiative. "Russia does not  yet know much about this initiative, and its full meaning has  yet to be understood, but in any case the formula sounds  attractive and gives food for thought," he said.    Clinton also touched upon the proposed extension of NATO.  Both presidents said they understood the need and had the  desire to work towards eliminating all lines of division in  Europe.    The two presidents also considered ways of implementing the  accords reached at the G-7 meeting in Tokyo.    Clinton-Yeltsin discussions will continue on Friday after  the  early-morning trilateral summit in which Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk will take part.</p>

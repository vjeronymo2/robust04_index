			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated by the Clean Air Act's fleet program, Congress believed it appropriate to place more stringent controls on centrally fueled fleet vehicles due fleet operators' greater control over and flexibility in the fuel used by their vehicles. Likewise, EPA believes it appropriate to propose similar actions here to obtain necessary additional emission reductions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, in addition to meeting the requirements of the enhanced in-use compliance program described above, EPA proposes an enhanced ILEV fleet program. This program would require that a fraction of the post-1998 model year vehicles purchased by fleets in the South Coast area having 10 of more vehicles which currently are, or are capable of, being centrally fueled must also qualify as ILEVs. EPA established a special class of clean fuel vehicles called Inherently Low Emission Vehicles (ILEVs) in regulations concerning exemptions from transportation control measures for clean fuel fleet vehicles (40 CFR 88.311&hyph;93). ILEVs are required to have no significant evaporative emissions even if their evaporative control systems malfunction. ILEVs therefore have an inherent emissions advantage over other clean fuel vehicles since under any realistic enforcement program, some vehicles will be operating with dysfunctional emission controls. Generally, ILEVs are alternative fueled vehicles since gasoline is a very volatile liquid; however, high-technology diesel or low volatility gasoline vehicles might also be able to comply. Enhanced ILEVs would produce all the emission benefits of other enhanced in-use compliance vehicles plus the benefits of no significant evaporative emissions in-use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes that 50 percent of all LDVs, LDTs, and MDVs purchased in 1999 by covered fleet operators for their covered fleet meet this requirement and 70 percent of LDVs, LDTs, and MDVs purchased in each calendar year thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to exempt from the enhanced ILEV fleet program the same types of vehicles which are exempt from the statutory Clean Fuel Fleet program (section 241(5) of the Clean Air Act). The definitions promulgated by EPA for the Clean Fuel Fleet program in 40 CFR 88.302&hyph;94 (i.e., for ``covered fleet operator'', ``centrally fueled'', and ``capable of being centrally fueled'', as well as several others) are proposed to apply to the enhanced ILEV fleet program. In addition, EPA proposes that the procedures laid out in the preamble for that final rule for determining how many vehicles are to be considered capable of being centrally fueled (58 FR 64684) are to be applied by fleet operators in the enhanced ILEV fleet program. EPA requests comment on whether this procedure should be converted to regulatory text and published in the final rule on this FIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, EPA is proposing an enhanced ILEV purchase credit program similar to the Clean Fuel Fleet credit program (40 CFR 88.304&hyph;94). Each ILEV purchased early or in excess of a covered fleet operator's purchase requirement could generate one purchase credit. EPA would issue a qualifying covered fleet operator a credit document which could be held or sold. The original operator or any other covered fleet operator could redeem such credit documents in lieu of enhanced ILEV purchases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes that violations of the enhanced ILEV fleet program be subject to civil penalties of not more than $25,000. This proposed penalty is identical to that applied by the Clean Air Act (section 205(a)) to violations of the Clean Fuel Fleet program required by Part C of Title II. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the enhanced in-use vehicle standards apply to composite NMHC, it is possible that enhanced ILEVs could have higher exhaust NMHC emissions to compensate for their inherently low evaporative emissions. Therefore, EPA requests comments on the likelihood of this occurring and on the option of establishing a numerically lower composite NMHC standard for ILEVs. These more stringent enhanced in-use standards for ILEVs are shown in the table below. EPA is not proposing to change the enhanced in-use NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards for ILEVs from those proposed for all enhanced in-use compliance vehicles in Section A.(2) above.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

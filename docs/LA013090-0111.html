			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> STUDIES FAVOR EARLIER USE OF AIDS DRUG  </P> <P> People who take the AIDS-treatment drug AZT before symptoms of the disease  appear may be less likely to develop resistance to the drug than those who  start AZT when they get sick, researchers from Burroughs Wellcome Co., the  maker of the drug, told the Food and Drug Administration's newly formed  Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee. The researchers said new studies indicate  people who receive AZT before they become ill have far fewer drug-resistant  strains of the AIDS virus than patients who start after signs of acquired  immune deficiency syndrome appear. AZT is the only government-approved drug to  directly attack the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus.  </P></p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Ethanol to escape pollution formula The Clinton administration is poised to overturn its predecessor's decision to include ethanol in a new petrol formula designed to reduce pollution. The US Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce tomorrow that it will return to the formula originally negotiated with oil companies and environmental groups in 1992, cancelling President George Bush's decision to add ethanol. Mr Bush's original decision was widely seen as an electoral concession to maize growers, whose crops can be used to produce ethanol. Ethanol was a sensitive issue in important electoral states such as Illinois. Under the Clean Air Act, reformulated petrol which contains more oxygen, and should therefore burn more cleanly, must be sold from 1995 onwards in nine US cities with high smog levels. The reformulation programme could eventually be extended to many other cities. Ethanol is already incorporated in reformulated fuel sold in the winter in cities with high levels of carbon monoxide, but the EPA has questioned whether its use reduces other smog-forming chemicals. The inclusion of ethanol can make petrol evaporate more rapidly, sending polluting chemicals into the air. The Bush administration's decision, therefore, would have shifted more of the cost of complying with the act on to the shoulders of oil refiners, who would have had to develop a less evaporative formula of petrol to offset the effects of the ethanol. Ethanol has been strongly supported by a potent political coalition. Besides corn-growers in the mid-western states, ethanol is heavily touted by agribusiness companies such as Archer Daniels Midland, one of the most generous contributors to the political campaign funds of both parties.</p>

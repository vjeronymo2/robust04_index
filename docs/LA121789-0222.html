			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CURTAIN RISES: EASTERN EUROPE, 1989;  </P> <P> CHAPTER 1 AUSTRIA;  </P> <P> THE ROAD TO REFORM BEGINS IN VIENNA;  </P> <P> TWO YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS BRING THE FIRST CRACKS IN THE WALLS OF THE EAST BLOC.  </P> <P> In the gray and deliberate world of diplomacy, there are moments when decisions  are made and agreements are reached whose importance is understood only  afterward. It can be a painstaking and finely bargained process, the work of  diplomats, and its significance often lies buried in its very detail.  </P> <P> January 19 was a quiet Sunday morning, bitterly cold in Vienna. Outside the  Austria Center, the flags of 35 nations flapped impressively in the wind. It  was a day of ceremony, yet curiously low key.  </P> <P> Andre Erdos, 46, who headed the Hungarian delegation to the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), had been in Vienna since the  negotiations opened in December, 1986. And, as a career diplomat of ambassador  rank, he was too much of a professional to be overly impressed by the formality  of closing ceremonies.  </P> <P> But as he moved through the lobby exchanging pleasantries with his colleagues,  he was not without a private sense of triumph at the historic proportions of  the documents about to be signed.  </P> <P> Erdos and his government had reason to be pleased: The Vienna negotiations had  taken the course they had hoped. The 26 months of delicate and difficult talks  were a follow-up to the landmark 1975 Helsinki accords, most famous for their  basic declaration on human rights. They advanced the noble generalities set out  at Helsinki and committed governments to specific guarantees of human rights:  Freedom to travel, freedom of religion, the rights of minorities and prisoners.  The Vienna document included a number of measures designed to prevent  governments from delaying or denying a citizen's rights to travel abroad.  </P> <P> "The agreements of the CSCE have no legal force," Erdos said. "But their moral  weight is so strong that it amounts almost to legal weight, and they have had a  direct effect on the behavior of nations. Our instructions from Budapest were  very liberal. We were to make our views known, even if they differed from those  of our allies."  </P> <P> The views were, in many cases, decidedly different. It had been hard going in  the Wednesday afternoon East Bloc caucuses, where the human rights proposals  cut most deeply for Hungary's hard-line neighbors. There, the Hungarians and  the Poles formed a kind of liberal front.  </P> <P> Hungary had a clear national agenda -- it was opening up to the West, most  urgently in economic matters. It wanted friends in the West, the firmer the  better, and it wanted business from the West. Hungary could no longer afford to  hold on to a domestic legal code that came from another age and ran counter to  Western norms -- restrictions on travel, tedious visa procedures -- and that  bogged down the flow of commerce. Budapest wanted an open door, the traffic  flowing unhindered in both directions.  </P> <P> The East Germans and the Romanians had their own uncomfortable hard-line axis.  The Czechoslovaks, Erdos said, had "no taste and no smell." They kept their  mouths shut, stayed to themselves and went with the majority. The East Germans,  at least, were serious diplomats. They found the proposition on freedom of  travel hardest to swallow.  </P> <P> The Soviets had taken a long time to come around, the talks roughly spanning  the period of time during which Mikhail Gorbachev consolidated his power. As  the negotiations proceeded, Erdos and others began to note the periodic  absences of the Soviet ambassador to the talks, presumably to consult with  Moscow.  </P> <P> And so it was finished. The speeches were read. Erdos put his initials on the  document. The Romanians, as expected, said they would sign the document but  would feel free to ignore any of its provisions if they happened to conflict  with Romania's "national interests." And, as expected, the Romanians were  roundly condemned.  </P> <P> But the Romanians could not really stain the triumph. The next morning, Erdos  packed his two years' worth of files, loaded them into his car and set out for  the three-hour drive to Budapest.  </P> <P> As he crossed the border into Hungary, waiting for the immigration guard to  look at his diplomatic passport, it occurred to him, as it often had before,  that the fortifications he saw -- a fence and guardhouse separating Austria and  Hungary -- were silly and senseless now, anachronisms. He expected they would  come down, sooner rather than later. The agreements he had just put his  initials to seemed to assure that.  </P> <P> But Erdos gave no thought to the trouble and excitement he and his compatriots,  and that stretch of border wire, were about to bring down on their neighbors.  He took back his passport and drove on through the tidy farmland and home to  his capital.  </P> <P>  The East German official newspaper, Neues Deutschland, reprinted the full text  of the Vienna document the day it was signed. A week later, an Amnesty  International report accused East Germany of using vaguely written laws and  secret trials against persons whose activities the government regarded as  suspicious. The report said that among penalties imposed on prisoners of  conscience were restrictions on the freedom to emigrate.  </P> <P>  Romania's leader, Nicolae Ceausescu, toured three factories in Bucharest and  praised the workers for their efforts, but he noted that the country still had  a lot to do before it reached "the highest peaks of progress and civilization."  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- An influential business  group on Tuesday [19 April] urged the government to carry out  further deregulation in telecommunications and information  fields, giving the private sector a wider role in constructing  infrastructure.    A report from the Federation of Economic Organizations  (Keidanren) recommended construction of a nationwide optical  fiber communication network as a core project in Japan's future  infrastructure in advanced telecommunications. It should be  built through free-market competition and private-sector  participation, utilizing financial support from the public  sector, it says.    The report also calls for simplification of procedures in  the  radio frequency licensing system to encourage new entries into  mobile phones. The recommendations will be submitted to  ministries and agencies for inclusion in a government  deregulation program scheduled for release this year.</p>

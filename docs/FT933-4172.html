			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Big trade surplus in France FRANCE achieved a record trade surplus of FFr10.88bn (Pounds 1.23bn) in May, as exports rose much more quickly than stagnant imports, according to customs statistics announced yesterday. The surplus was almost double the FFr5.8bn surplus recorded in April, which was revised down from FFr7.6bn, and was ahead of expectations. An official at the economics ministry said that May's trade figures demonstrated the competitiveness of French industry. But private economists cautioned against reading too much into the statistics. They said the sharp downward revision in April's surplus demonstrated the unreliability of trade figures following the introduction of new compilation procedures in the European Community at the beginning of the year. They added that May's surplus largely reflected the weakness of the French economy. Imports in the month at FFr88.41bn were little changed compared with April's figure. 'This reflects depressed spending in the domestic economy,' according to Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, French economist at Salomon Bros. Exports, however, showed a healthy increase, rising by 5.7 per cent to FFr99.29bn. The surplus on trade of industrial and military goods more than doubled to FFr8.27bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The ruling parties urged  House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi on Friday [17 June]  to invalidate the lower house Budget Committee's decision to  summon former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for testimony on  his suspected personal financial deals.    Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's top strategist, and other  ruling coalition officials handed over to Fukumaru Tani,  secretary general of the lower house Secretariat, a letter of  requests addressed to Doi, political sources said.    Tani was quoted as telling the officials that Doi had no  other choice but to regard the committee decision on Thursday as  being properly taken.    The coalition letter criticized lower house Budget Committee  Chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi for overriding coalition members'  objections and declaring that Hosokawa must testify under oath  next Tuesday.    The coalition officials also handed over a letter to  Yamaguchi demanding a re-vote on the issue, the sources said.    The lower house Secretariat, however, has already taken  procedures to summon Hosokawa, officials said.    The law for testimony of witnesses under oath in the Diet  provides penalties of imprisonment up to a year or a fine up to  100,000 yen against those who refuse to testify without adequate  cause.    Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  the coalition's core party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata,  told reporters that Hosokawa does not have to testify, calling  the committee decision "invalid."    For their part, the two largest opposition parties -- the  Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party --  proposed the punishment of former Labor Minister Toshio  Yamaguchi, an independent lower house member, saying he tried to  throw a glass of water over Tsuruo Yamaguchi when the committee  chairman declared that Hosokawa would be summoned.    The opposition parties forced the summoning motion through  the Budget Committee in an apparent bid to use Hosokawa's case  to their advantage and force Hata's minority government to step  down.    Hosokawa's questionable deals were partly responsible for  his  resignation as premier in April.    Hosokawa's former financial secretary told the budget panel  Wednesday that Hosokawa has paid back a 100 million yen 1982  loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm,  denying allegations that Hosokawa may not have repaid the money  and that it was received as a secret political donation.</p>

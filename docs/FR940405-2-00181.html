Each program participant must sign a participation agreement regarding the use of supportive services and payment of supportive service fees, as provided in section (B)(9)(e)(vi) of these Guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (9) Supportive Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The HA may provide the supportive services directly or subcontract with service providers in the community. The HUD supportive services grant and the required matching funds may be used only for frail elderly program participants who occupy the project subsidized under this Multifamily Project Demonstration. However, other supportive services funding may be used to provide services at the project for elderly persons living at or near the project site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Supportive services plan.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) General. HAs applying to carry out the Multifamily Project Demonstration must develop a plan to provide or secure supportive services appropriate to the needs of frail elderly program participants. This plan should be developed in consultation with the Area Agency on Aging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Letter from area agency on aging. The plan shall include a letter from the Area Agency on Aging through which the agency certifies that the costs of the supportive services proposed to be provided are reasonable and consistent with the cost of other supportive service programs in the jurisdiction of the HA. The letter also must describe the degree to which the Area Agency has been involved with the planning and proposed operations of the Multifamily Project Demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Estimate of cost of supportive services during demonstration term. The plan must include an estimate of the total value of services to be provided over the life of the five-year demonstration period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Maintenance of existing supportive services. The plan shall provide for the maintenance of supportive services already being provided to frail elderly persons selected to participate in the Multifamily Project Demonstration. These services will be maintained for the time that the frail elderly person remains in the Multifamily Project Demonstration, unless the PAC or other entity performing the assessment determines that the services are no longer needed. These services do not qualify as matching funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Services minimally necessary to ensure independence.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The supportive services to be provided to frail elderly program participants under the demonstration are those minimally necessary to ensure that program participants retain their independence and avoid unnecessary or premature institutionalization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purchase of additional supportive services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Program participants may purchase additional supportive services from the HA, subject to the agreement of the HA, at the cost at which the HA must obtain these services, and provided that the provision of these additional supportive services do not put an undue burden on the management and administration of the demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Matching funds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) 50 percent match. HUD will provide the selected HA with a supportive service grant that covers 40 percent of the cost of the necessary supportive services. The frail elderly program participant will cover 10 percent of the cost of the supportive services (see paragraph (vi) of this paragraph (e)). The selected HA must provide funding from other sources sufficient to cover the remaining 50 percent of the cost of the supportive services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Certification of committed dollar amounts for first year. The HA must certify that funding for its portion of the cost of the supportive services has been committed by other sources for the first year of the demonstration with reasonable assurance that the funding for supportive services will be available during the five-year term of the contract. The HA will be required to provide such certification annually thereafter for each year of the demonstration, as part of the annual project/budget review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Sources of funds for matching contribution. In determining potential sources of matching funds for the necessary supportive services, the HA may include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Cash (which may include funds from Federal, State and local governments, third party contributions, available payments authorized under Medicaid for program participants, grants or subgrants of funds originating from an Area Agency on Aging under the Older Americans Act and funds from local governments originating from either Community Development Block Grants or Community Services Block Grants).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The dollar value of supportive services provided by other agency or third party, or of staff who will work to provide services to program participants; these services must be justified in the application to assure that they are the services necessary to keep the frail elderly program participants independent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The dollar value of in-kind items (these are limited to 10 percent of the 50 percent matching amount), such as the current market value of donated furniture, material, supplies, equipment and food used in the provision of supportive services. The applicant must provide an explanation for the estimated donated value of any item listed and an explanation of why they are necessary to keep the program participants independent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The value of volunteers to the project at a rate of $5.00 an hour. The value of PAC volunteer time cannot be counted for any time period estimate related to initial assessment of individuals before they are accepted into the Multifamily Project Demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

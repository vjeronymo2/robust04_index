			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Big guns to fire green shells  -Companies meet in Paris on Friday hoping to form an environmental pressure group Business initiatives on the environment are proliferating. The latest - and possibly most ambitious - gets under way this Friday when executives from 90 large companies gather in Paris under the auspices of the World Industry Council for the Environment (WICE). They hope to forge a common position on a series of green issues, from trade and technology to the role of the financial markets in conveying the environmental message. The resulting position papers will then form the basis of a drive to influence the international environmental debate. The 90 companies come from 21 countries and include names such as AT&amp;T, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Texaco, Sony, ICI, Volkswagen and Rhone-Poulenc. 'It's a good list,' says Rodney Chase, the managing director of British Petroleum who is chairman of the group. WICE was formed by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce in the wake of last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro as a way of addressing issues which had an international, rather than just a national, relevance. The positions have been prepared by task forces using the technical expertise of the companies involved, and bear the stamp of their managements. One of the concerns which prompted it was that the global environmental debate launched at Rio would influence national government policies before business had a chance to have its own say. These policies could affect competition, the use of resources and the spread of technology, businessmen thought. Much of WICE's work will be concerned with striking balances, for example between environmental standards and the flow of trade, or between regulation and cost, and even between population growth and living standards. 'We want to ensure that the Rio initiatives are not at the expense of expanding world trade,' says Chase. He cites as an example the recommendations that WICE is proposing to make to governments on the use of incentive regulation to promote environmental standards. Governments should be clear about their objectives, they should estimate the cost and be satisfied that the economy can stand it. They should not try to prescribe the answer, but should set a sensible timetable and then stick to it. 'On all these issues we should have a quality position or we shouldn't say anything,' says Chase, who admits that the danger is that WICE's utterances will be diluted to meet the lowest common denominator of its members. But he adds: 'If it wasn't important for BP, we wouldn't be doing it.' Chase is in broad agreement with the items on the global environmental agenda, and sees WICE's role as trying to establish priorities. 'They (the items) are set by world concern,' he says. His personal priorities centre on the impact of what he calls 'late 20th century consumerism': the problems of short-lived commodities which generate waste which stays around for a long time. 'We are not trying to understand and plan for the consequences of population growth,' he says. 'There is a trade-off between economic growth and its impact on the environment. But the trade-off has not been calculated or managed. 'We should have a business plan. We should establish priorities on where to spend money and brainpower. The debate on climate change will be a good example.' Science has a lot to contribute to ways of curbing pollution, and promoting sustainable development. Chase believes the business community has 'upped its game' on the environment. 'It's patchy, but moving in the right direction. Environmental agendas are more deep-seated in company plans than many people realise. Unfortunately, this is not as well matched by the image. 'Companies which can combine environmental performance with good business should flourish.' But there is also an attitude in the business world which says that environmental regulation is OK, so long as companies can pass the cost on to their customers. One question WICE will doubtless prompt in business minds is: why yet another action group? We already have the Geneva-based Business Council for Sustainable Development which published the widely read book Changing Course describing the environmental experience of its 50 blue-chip company members, and is now working on a number of post-Rio assignments. 'I don't know enough to know why those other initiatives have not satisfied our members,' comments Chase, cautiously.</p>

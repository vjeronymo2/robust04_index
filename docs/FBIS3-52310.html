Ambassador Rabinovich told our correspondent in Washington  Arye Golan, however, that the fact that over the last year the  Syrian regime has permitted some of its citizens to meet  Israelis for the purpose of discussing the peace process is  another sign pointing at a change in Syria's attitude.  Ambassador Rabinovich said that this can be seen as a sign of  the seriousness with which Syria regards the negotiations with  Israel.</p>

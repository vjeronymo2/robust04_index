			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Rajih al-Khuri] </F>   [Excerpts] King Husayn has no need to provoke others; he  needs to protect himself. The conditions for building bridges  with Israel do not include burning the bridges with what remains  of the Arabs, in other words with Syria and Lebanon.    The Jordanian king did not have to hang "hang" Arab linen  from the roof of the White House roof, because this is one of  Israel's jobs; it has never ceased to be so.    Based on what has been said about his sobriety, awareness,  reverence, and seriousness, he should not have fallen into that  unambiguous Israeli trap. Israel laid this trap for him, first  through the words of Shim'on Peres, who asked him to stop  linking his stance with the Syrians, bearing in mind the king's  involvement in the peace process, and, second, through the  tenacious questions he was asked by Jewish journalists or by  journalists filled with Israeli ideas. These journalists meant  to cast doubt on the sincerity of his recent peaceful approach,  perhaps to prompt him to adopt the sudden stance he did adopt.  [passage omitted]    No one knows the reason for this exciting royal emotion,  which reached the point of asserting that Jordan's decision on  peace with Israel was "an issue of sovereignty concerning Jordan  itself, one with no connection or link with any move on any  other track."    Obviously it is an issue concerning Jordan. But throughout  the area from the Ocean to the Gulf not one protest was staged.  And no statement of denunciation was issued except by some of  the "pan-Arab utopians" in Beirut. [passage omitted]    Does Husayn's acquisition of sovereignty and recognition  justify this kind of bitter reproach to the Syrians and  Lebanese? Did the secret bills for obtaining sovereignty and  recognition include slapping the faces of "the brothers" and  receiving "flowers" from the enemies' hands? Have these bills  set out a condition that Arabs be slapped as a prelude to  hugging the Jews?    There is no justification for that stance adopted by the  king  in the form of a free and nervy storm in the face of Damascus  and Beirut claiming that there was someone trying to take him  out of the Israelis' lap or take them out of his lap. In the  era of "confrontation" the king knew how to maintain the royal  lines of communication with the enemy. But now in this time,  which lacks minimal levels of "steadfastness," there is no one  who thinks of preventing Amman from competing against Jericho to  come under the banner of the "Israeli empire." [passage omitted]    Do the nervous royal revelations in Washington constitute a  departure from a "deliberate plan" to perpetuate the spirit of  division in the Arab ranks, even if one day they came under  Israeli command?    The next peaceful "delivery" will be in Washington this fall  when King Husayn will drink from the same glass from which Anwar  al-Sadat and Yasir 'Arafat drank before him. In the interim the  Jordanians will encounter a very hard process and negotiations  that will rebuild every piece of their minds and concepts, not  least because the "sovereignty" they have gained should be in  line with Israeli conditions.    We say in advance: Spare us the dirty linen over the White  House.</p>

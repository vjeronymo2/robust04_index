			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Working Life: Shirt tale - Style You have to be a bit careful with short-sleeved shirts at work during the summer: wearing a collar, a tie and sleeves that end just above the elbow can make you look dangerously like the man who comes round to service the photocopier. Indeed, to some, a formal short-sleeved shirt that you wear with a business suit is a contradiction in terms. On the other hand, a short-sleeved business shirt, with its implications of transatlantic style, can make you look a real go-getter, if a go-getter image is what you're after. The thing is, to chose a shirt with care. At one end of the scale, there is Littlewoods: they will let you have a shirt for only Pounds 8.50, or Pounds 6.99 if you buy two or more - in white, colours and stripes. An Oxford weave with a button collar, comes cost Pounds 9.99 in white or blue and is quite tasteful. The biggest problem is that all are made of polycotton mixture and are completely indestructible. You can never wear them out and throw them away, even if you decide you hate them. At the other end of the price scale, Paul Smith of Covent Garden, will do you something unique and stylish for upwards of Pounds 80. His soft, hand-stitched cotton and linen mixture shirts come with long or short sleeves, and with a variety of collars, buttons, flaps and mysterious Paul Smith details. A white, short-sleeved Paul Smith shirt worn under a jacket will be about as commonplace as a talking oyster, but every bit as desirable to rich exhibitionists. Then there is the middle ground. Simpson's of Piccadilly does its own-label white cotton shirt with front pocket and stiff collar for Pounds 35. Marks and Spencer, on the other hand, has a vast range of short-sleevers including: a plain easy-care cotton, or Oxford weave with a button collar (both at Pounds 19); a cotton-linen mix with button collar at Pounds 22.50 and a soft design in Italian cloth, also at Pounds 22.50. Then again, there is always Hilditch &amp; Key, in Jermyn Street. At Pounds 55, their short-sleeved shirts are more than twice the price of the M and S variety, and with less choice of style. They are, however, extremely satisfying shirts, and not the most expensive from this part of town. Their striped short-sleevers (blue, red and green) are ready-to-wear, but they will tailor you a plain white one from a longer-sleeved shirt at no extra cost. All have robust collars, placket fronts, fine stitching and use the best cotton poplin. In the end, the choice between M&amp;S and H&amp;K is between honest practicality and restrained luxury. Duck the decision: buy two of each.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OVERSIZE JEWELRY IS A BIG HIT WITH DESIGNERS  </P> <P> This spring, the big news in jewelry is, well, big. The bigger the better.  Paris designers Karl Lagerfeld and Yves Saint Laurent, and New Yorkers Oscar de  La Renta and Isaac Mizrahi, were among those who showed how to handle the  oversize effect when they accessorized spring suits or coat and dress ensembles  with weighty examples of bright, bold gold.  </P> <P> Wide cuff bracelets are worn in matched or unmatched pairs. Lapel brooches  expand to 4 inches across, earrings brush the shoulder or sit on the lobe like  massive shields, belt buckles can increase body weight by five pounds.  </P> <P> This look will not pass with summer. Big bold gold pieces were seen in the  Milan fall collections and in some of the Paris shows this week.  </P> <P> All of it is obviously costume jewelry and seems to echo Coco Chanel, an early  champion of fabulous fakes. Most of it harks back to ancient cultures when  real, 24-karat gold was pounded, molded and cast into impressive symbols of  wealth, beauty and mystical power.  </P> <P> "It's the 'I spent a bundle' look without actually doing so," says Los Angeles  jewelry sales representative Kathleen Matson. "Women collect jewelry; it gives  them a lift. I think this new bolder, bigger jewelry means they want a big  lift." BARBARA FOLEY  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SWOON: It's only May, but you can forget about the Angels. . . . At least  that's the view of columnist Mike Penner (C1), who ponders the Halos' awful  start and says "it's over."  </P> <P> .. . Don't blame $16-million pitcher Mark Langston, says Penner, although his  2-3 record hasn't helped. More at fault: General Manager Mike Port, who  "entered the season standing pat and with fingers crossed." . . . Things  deteriorated further last night in Seattle, where the Angels lost 5-2. Jeffrey  A. Perlman and Sonni Efron  </P></p>

The countries are Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Public or private non-profit organizations meeting the provisions described in IRS regulation 501(c)(3) may apply either to enhance/expand existing linkages or to develop new school linkage programs. Both models are described in the guidelines section of this solicitation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Applicants may submit a proposal for only one of the two models <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> . All submissions must contain an Educator (teacher and/or administrator) exchange component AND a Student exchange component. Approximately one third of the grants awarded will be to promote the development of new linkages. Organizations asking for USIA funding for previously established linkages must demonstrate the value of the linkages to the NIS Secondary School Initiative program as well as show evidence that the linkage is designed to outlast USIA funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Overall funding and grant making authority for this program is contained in the Freedom Support Act (Pub.

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KNIFE-WIELDING BLACKS STAB 9 WHITES NEAR S. AFRICA BEACH  </P> <P> A group of blacks stole knives from a store and went on a rampage today,  stabbing nine whites on a busy street near the beachfront of this Indian Ocean  city, witnesses and officials said.  </P> <P> Police said they had no motive for the attack, which seriously injured six of  the victims.  </P> <P> Despite deep racial divisions and widespread violence in South Africa, there  have been few cases of blacks randomly attacking whites.  </P> <P> About 5,000 blacks have been killed in factional fighting since 1986 in Natal  province, which includes Durban. But the violence has been almost exclusively  in black areas.  </P> <P> Patrick Lekota, a spokesman for the African National Congress, said the attack  "was a desperate attempt to discredit the liberation movement as a whole."  </P> <P> "They were in a berserk state and were lashing out with knives at anyone who  was near them," witness Robert Trulock told the independent South African Press  Assn.  </P> <P> Five suspects were arrested, including two who were shot and wounded by police,  the report said.  </P> <P> The gang of between 10 and 20 young men took the knives from a store  specializing in weapons from the Far East, police said. The men then ran down a  street next to the beachfront, assaulting whites at random, witnesses said.  </P> <P> Bleeding victims staggered into the lobby of the Lonsdale Hotel and collapsed  in front of horrified guests.  </P> <P> Nine whites suffered stab wounds and were admitted to nearby Addington  Hospital.  </P></p>

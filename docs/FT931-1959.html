			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hongkong Land rises to Dollars 305m despite rental fall - Hong Kong Results HONGKONG Land, the Jardine Matheson group's property investment arm which dominates Hong Kong's central office market, yesterday announced a 2.3 per cent increase in net profits to USDollars 305m in 1992, up from Dollars 298.1m the year before. The company confirmed it would exercise its option to increase its shareholding in Trafalgar House, the UK construction, engineering and shipping group, to 27 per cent from 20.1 per cent. However, Mr Alisdair Morrison, managing director, said this would represent only 6.5 per cent of shareholders' funds, and the group would continue to focus on its core Hong Kong portfolio. Hongkong Land, chaired by Mr Simon Keswick, will pay a final dividend of 6.5 US cents per share, representing a total 1992 dividend of 9.5 cents, compared with 9 cents in 1991. The company experienced a marginal fall in rental income last year as a result of tenancies being renegotiated at below the property market's 1989 peak. This phase will continue in 1993, with little growth expected. However, the directors emphasised the 18 per cent increase to Dollars 1.95 in the company's net asset value per share, as a result of the turnaround in office property prices in 1992. Hongkong Land sold its Number Nine Queen's Road tower block for USDollars 491m last year, but Mr Morrison said no other of the group's properties were on the market. He was confident that, with limited new supply of office space in the central district, asset values would continue to rise. The increase in last year's profits was due to a Dollars 18.7m reduction in finance charges, as a result of debt reduction through property sales. In 1993, the group will gain a maiden contribution from its Trafalgar House investment, which will be equity accounted from April.</p>

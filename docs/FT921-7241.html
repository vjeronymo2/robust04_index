			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Arts: Pelleas et Melisande - New Theatre, Cardiff Welsh National Opera's new production of Pelleas et Melisande has been eagerly awaited, not only as Peter Stein's third staging for the company, following his memorable Otello and Falstaff, but because it signals Pierre Boulez's return to the opera house 13 years almost to the day after he conducted the premiere of the complete Lulu in Paris. At the first night on Friday every ounce of that accumulated expectation seemed triumphantly justified. This Pelleas is a glorious achievement, one of those rare operatic occasions that truly justifies the description of revelatory, in which theatrical and musical genius seem democratically balanced and concerned with nothing except the most comprehensive realisation of the work itself. It should be no surprise that Stein's and Boulez's contributions appear indivisible: as the director makes clear in an essay in the programme book, he was introduced to the work by Boulez, who 'deciphered the score for me and showed me all the little details'. That freshness, uncluttered by the burden of the opera's performing history, has given Stein the freedom to work outwards from the work itself, to take what the text and music could offer and with his designers Karl-Ernst Hermann (sets) and Moidele Bickel (costumes) to select a coherent set of visual and dramatic references. Their starting point was the pencil drawings of Seurat; for an opera that moves into daylight for only two scenes, they have created a symbolist world of blacks and greys, of glistening surfaces and profound depths, which meanly rations the available light, striking it harshly against hard edges, squeezing it between trees or through doorways. Such parsimony gives implacable force to the few moments en plein air, so that when in the third act Golaud and Pelleas emerge into sunlight from the cellars the audience too is dazzled by its brilliance: we share in their physical exhilaration, touch their awe and relief. For Stein never forgets that this is a piece of theatre, a deliberate artifice; any suspension of disbelief must be earned, never taken for granted. There is no dream-like easing from reality to make-believe, every change of scene is laid bare and each image is uncompromisingly framed, caught within a precise geometric shape. By parcelling up the stage with sliding panels and half curtains, and providing precisely the space needed for each scene, it offers a constantly shifting perspective, at one moment close, intimate, at the next distant and detached. We are watching make-believe: Golaud addresses his opening phrases to the audience, as if the first scene is a preface, a fairy-tale beginning from which everything else unravels. And when she reads her letter in the second scene, Genevieve's gestures are grand and rhetorical, suggesting her audience too is much larger than the blind Arkel. This is a very strange opera, Stein is saying, in which nothing is what it seems, reality and fantasy are enmeshed and nothing can be explained away as a product of dreamy irrationality. There are stylised trees and cardboard cut-out ramparts, yet a fully detailed bedchamber for the final scene, a real sheep for Yniold's encounter with the shepherd, and real doves (a mistake, this) for the tower duet. He presents the tragedy through a series of implacable images, creates his characters as lost figures, caught in a struggle for survival. Pelleas, so wonderfully, passionately sung by Neill Archer, is straight out of Edgar Allan Poe, a Roderick Usher right down to his frock coat and breeches; the Melisande of Alison Hagley is timeless and impermeable, a projection of male images (Arkel's as well as those of her husband and her lover), who is never quite of this world. This Golaud (Donald Maxwell) develops in divergent ways out of his chivalrous stereotype and goes disastrously wrong: jealousy is something eternal, Stein observes, 'whether in fairy forests in the middle ages or in your one-room apartment'. All three roles are sung and acted with absolute commitment and authority; their every word is made to tell, every phrase is perfectly weighted. There is also a sonorous Arkel from Kenneth Cox and upright Genevieve from Penelope Walker. The Yniold of Samuel Burkey sings with affecting assurance, so that the scene in which he is forced by Golaud to spy upon the lovers is as traumatic as Golaud's later attack upon his wife. All are given the most magnificent possible support and musical guidance by Boulez, whose command of this score is absolute. His attention to detail and texture has always paid dividends in this opera, and now it is fused with a flexibility and, yes, sensuousness that make this the most compelling and moving account of the opera I have heard, realised by the WNO orchestra with unfailing vividness. The crux of Boulez's approach is now the interludes, where the music opens out, allows in the vistas and images that the tightly focused action proscribes, and in which the ghost of Wagner's Parsifal emerges from the shadows. Already one feels this to be a landmark in the interpretation of Debussy's masterpiece. The production plays in Cardiff for three more performances, before touring in March and April to Southampton, Birmingham and Bristol. It should not be missed by anyone remotely interested in the history of opera in the 20th century or in the ways in which a great conductor and a great director can remake a work through their own creative powers.</p>

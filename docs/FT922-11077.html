Credit facilities for the lease finance have been arranged by the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank and a group of seven European credit banks under the label Club of European Long Term Credit Institutions. The deal brings the value of Abbey's leasing transactions conducted in the last 18 months to Pounds 1.9bn. Mr Robin Garratt, the head of leasing, said yesterday that the bank's high level of taxable profits and its strong balance sheet made leasing viable.</p>

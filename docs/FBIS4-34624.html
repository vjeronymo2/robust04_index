			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Attorney General's Office, through Prosecutors  Dumer C. Monzon and Josefina Itriago, has asked 21st Penal Court  Judge Cibeliz Duran to investigate alleged illegal activities  that may have prompted the eight banks in which the government  has intervened to go bankrupt. The inquiry will not conflict  with the 26th Penal Court's investigation because it will deal  with the manner in which government financial assistance was  used.    Meanwhile, the Superior Court for the Protection of Public  Property [TSS] has also initiated an investigation into alleged  irregularities at the eight banks. The Superior Council of  Judges must decide whether the case falls under the jurisdiction  of the TSS or whether Judge Duran should hear the case.</p>

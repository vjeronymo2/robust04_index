			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further setback but trading very thin THE HOLIDAY closure of most stock markets in northern Europe deprived London of much of its investment business yesterday. Share prices continued to fall and traders were unhappy to see the FT-SE Index dip through another testing level to close 22.7 down at 2,645.8. Concern over sluggishness in the domestic economy was heightened by disclosure of a very modest increase in consumer credit in April, regarded as a sign that consumers still lack confidence. Nervousness over US credit policy was not helped when a San Francisco Federal Reserve official was quoted as doubting whether a further cut in US interest rates was justified at present. Much of the setback in the stock market was again led from the stock index futures sector, where the June contract on the FT-SE Index traded at a discount to its fair value quotation that allows for dividend flows and financing costs. A further decline in UK government bonds, partly reflecting sterling's weakness in the ERM currency range, also continued to unsettle equities. Share prices closed at the day's low point, rattled afresh by an unimpressive start to the new Wall Street session, where the Dow shed 5 points in UK trading hours. Traders were disinclined to read too much into yesterday's somewhat gloomy picture, however, because of the lack of investment activity. Seaq-recorded business totalled a mere 305.7m shares, compared with 536.4m on Friday. Many stock prices were barely tested yesterday, Cadbury Schweppes, for example, gaining several pence against the market trend with fewer than 1m shares changing hands. The downward trend in the market was emphasised by another heavy fall in Midland Bank shares, putting them at an increasing discount to the value of the largely paper bid from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking; the withdrawal of Lloyds Bank from the fray is seen in London as the probable end of the battle. The arbitrageurs, who built large stakes in Midland Bank last week, have turned highly apprehensive about the outlook for the HK and Shanghai share price with which Midland's shares are now inevitably linked, and also for the Hong Kong stock market itself. Midland shares were again sold heavily in London yesterday. With bid interest now sated for the present, the rest of the banking sector followed Midland lower. US-influenced stocks were in the doldrums and the domestic consumer issues were unsettled by the consumer credit data. Strategists at the leading securities firms continued to express caution over the near term outlook for UK equities, while remaining relatively confident for the medium term. Mr Peter Thorne at Nikko remarked: 'The Danes have introduced an element of uncertainty . . . ' He believes that although the UK market is excellent value, it will continue to languish in the short term. At investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Mr Richard Kersley warned that any early recovery in dividend growth, currently below 2 per cent annualised, is far from likely.</p>

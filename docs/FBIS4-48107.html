			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Cuban President Fidel Castro by </F> correspondent Pieter Theron in Pretoria "yesterday"--recorded,  Theron's questions in English; Castro's responses in Spanish,  with English translation of answers by unidentified female  interpreter and superimposed Afrikaans translation; introduced  by correspondent Max du Preez on the "Agenda" program]    [Text] [Du Preez] One of the many dignitaries at the  presidential inauguration yesterday who received a rousing  welcome was President Fidel Castro of Cuba. After years of  sworn enmity between Cuba and South Africa, President Castro  arrived on his first visit to South Africa, and what a moment it  was. Pieter Theron asked him about impressions of South Africa.    [Begin recording] [Castro] It is wonderful to be in South  Africa. It grabbed my imagination. It is indeed an  extraordinary country in every respect -- the organization,  nature. I have only been here for a short while, but I have  spoken to many people. I was impressed by their hospitality and  the warmth with which I was received. I felt a sense of harmony  and unity, quite the opposite of what a stranger would have  expected. I followed the news every day and was impressed by  the country's people. They are well brought up. I realized  that what has taken place over the past few days was without  doubt an historic event for South Africa, for Africa, and for  the world. It has been a privilege to witness the events. I  was really impressed by what I saw. It is something I will take  with me when I return to Cuba.    [Theron] How do you see future relations between South  Africa  and Cuba?    [Castro] I would like to believe we are more than friends.  We are like family. A family does not discuss formal  relations. The ties which have grown between the people of Cuba  and South Africa are so deep that we feel at home here. My  visit has also provided the opportunity for even better  relations between the two countries in the future. This could  be of mutual benefit.    [Theron] What has South Africa got to offer Cuba, and what  has Cuba got to offer South Africa?    [Castro] Regarding trade, there is a long list of products  which South Africa could offer to Cuba. We do not want gold, as  we have no use for it. Apart from that, we could use almost  anything you could imagine. South Africa has advanced  technology. In many areas such as agriculture, you produce  everything. There are many areas for cooperation between our  two countries. South Africa will play an important role in  Africa and in the Third World. We have been doing it for many  years now, and I believe our experience could be of great value  for South Africa. South Africa is now involved in a great  experiment, and the whole world would like this experiment to  succeed. It is important to mankind, which is involved in  serious conflicts in many places.    [Theron] Cuba was involved in the conflict in Namibia and  Angola. You were engaged in war against South Africa. Do you  think your involvement contributed towards the changes that took  place in South Africa?    [Castro] Our involvement in Angola led to many sacrifices.  But we took the decision on our own, without the Soviet Union's  knowledge. We did it out of sympathy and historical ties. It  was not without risk. One always runs the risk of being  defeated.    [Theron] President Castro, communism collapsed in Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union. Why do you think communism is  still the right system for Cuba?    [Castro] Communism was not imported to Cuba. It was our own  creation, and it developed differently from the way it developed  in other countries. It was the result of our own struggle  against a dictator. No one brought socialism to Cuba. Rather,  it was a case of Cuba finding its own solutions. We achieved a  great deal, but we lost 80 percent of our trade -- many of the  things we imported from the Soviet Union. Nevertheless we  overcame that setback. Not many countries could have achieved  that. But Cuba is a united country, with a spirit all its own.  This is the spirit which emerged in Angola. At one point,  without any assistance, we supported more than 50,000 troops  almost 10,000 kilometers from home. That is proof of a strong  nation driven by certain principles.    [Theron] Will the future system of government still be  communism for Cuba?    [Castro] We see it as socialism. We want to maintain it, but  we have left an economic opening. We lost capital markets and  technology, which we now need in order to develop our country.  So there is room in the economic field. We need investments in  many areas. There is a process of change under way in our  country, to keep us in touch with the present realities of the  world. But we have not given up our principles. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television Monday is Monday; not the jolliest night of the week to come home ready to laugh at two new office sitcoms. Still, you can always try. Men of the World (8.30, BBC1) stars David Threlfall as a travel agent keen to teach an innocent young colleague a thing or two about worldly wisdom. Well . . . we'll see. It is cheering to note that Brenda Bruce - a comic actress for any day of the week - features in the first programme of the series. The 10%ers (9.30 ITV) launches a seven-part comedy sitcom charting the ways and wiles of Eden Management, a West End talent agency. This will make a change from The Laurence Olivier Awards (9.00 BBC2): fun for luvvies but not much cop for serious theatre-goers. Two documentaries for serious Monday viewers: Horizon: After the Flood (8.00 BBC2) wonders whether prevention controls actually make a flood disaster worse - the Mississippi floods last year were the worst in Old Glory's recorded history, after all; and Soweto - A History (10.55 C4) which looks at the huge city that has set political and cultural trends in South Africa.</p>

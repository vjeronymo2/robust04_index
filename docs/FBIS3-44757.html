But the authorities in Beijing, flooded with such  applications, are putting the brake on allowing firms to convert  to limited liability status, as more than one-third of them are  running at a loss.    "To do so, we have to carry out many structural reforms. But  the work is well in progress," said Wang Pei Zhou, president of  the steel giant.    A reform plan, adopted by the Communist Party Central  Committee in November, requires state enterprises like Baoshan  Steel to come up with "corporate systems."    The changes include reassessment of fixed assets, adoption  of  Western-style accounting methods, and separation of welfare  facilities like schools from the parent company. In particular,  such welfare facilities are a great burden on state enterprises.    "The separation is a necessary step to improve our business  performance," Wang said in an interview at a luxury hotel  operated by the steel firm.    The company's "living quarters," including hotels, schools,  hospitals, shopping centers, a big gymnasium and apartment  buildings for 23,200 employees, accounts for about one-fifth of  the 13 square kilometers covered by the complex, which faces the  Chang Jiang River.    Even with these burdens, the 15-year-old steel company  posted  a pretax profit of 570 million yuan on sales of 18 billion yuan  last year, paying a total of 3 billion yuan to state coffers as  of December, 1993.    Under share-listing guidelines, candidate companies must  meet  five conditions, according to Wang Hui Zhong, assistant  researcher at the Shanghai Securities Exchange. These are  registered capital of 50 million yuan or more, public offering  of 25 percent of issued shares, profits for three successive  years, approval by its "board of directors," and recommendations  by two stock exchange members.    The stock exchange saw a total of 20 company listings last  year with 101 "A" shares for Chinese residents and 19 "B" issues  reserved exclusively for overseas investors, Wang said.    This month, 15 companies, including Maanshan Iron and Steel,  are being listed on the local bourse. "Surely, there are no  problems of efficiency and creditworthiness," boasted Wang. "A  public listing, domestic and overseas, depends wholly on the  government's decision."    Baoshan last month started building a plant for 1,580 mm  hot-  rolled band steel, the key element in a third-phase project that  also calls for construction of a blast furnace, two cold-rolled  steel mills and a plant to make silicon steel.    Under the plan, the steelmaker's present output capacity of  6.5 million tons per annum will be raised to eight million tons  by 1997 with a final goal of 11 million tons in 1998, the  president said.    Zho Ya Long, an official with Shanghai Wan Guo Securities  Co., however, said, "listing of Baoshan is unlikely, while that  of the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Iron and Steel Works, which  has applied to the central government for permission for the  fund-raising, will take place in the near future."    "The Shanghai No. 3 works needs capital to raise production  of heavy steel plates for fast-growing domestic shipbuilders.  Shanghai municipal government has already given the green light  to the plan."    Meanwhile, Beijing is curbing listing of big state companies  such as Baoshan for fear that an excess of new issues would  spoil the fledgling stock market, the local securities firm  official says.    "Fund-raising through the stock market has helped us upgrade  technology by using money for active capital spending," said  Rong Jia Xiao, manager of comprehensive management department at  Shanghai Erfangji Co., which floated its first A and B shares in  1992.    China's top spinning machine maker, which became the first  mainland-listed company to obtain American depository receipt  approval in December, had to transform its management mechanism  into a stock company for a tough survival race in the domestic  and world markets, Rong said.    "The management reforms began in mid-1980s, when all the  rights were controlled by the state. Promotion of workers had  been decided on by the local government," he recalls.    The Shanghai-based firm, with 5,500 workers, used money from  issuing a shares for investment in building a  computer-controlled design and production system last year, rong  said.    Shanghai Erfangji raised one-third of the capital and  investment money it needed on the stock markets and borrowed the  remainder from Chinese banks last year.    "Management places a high priority on returns of profits to  shareholders. A dividend of 0.04 yuan is scheduled for the  business year, which ended on December 31," he said.    The government still owns 46 percent of the textile  machinery  firm's outstanding shares, followed by overseas investors' 41  percent and domestic individual investors' 11 percent, according  to a midterm financial report.    Rong said, "domestic investors are very speculative, but  foreign investors into B shares are mature and stable. Removing  a wall between A and B shares is welcome, as it will lead to  further inflows of foreign investors' money to the domestic  stock markets."    In response to a question about insufficient disclosure  systems in China, Rong insists, "bank officials are permanently  stationed at our office to keep a close eye on how much we pay  in salaries to employees, and certified public accountants check  our records."</p>

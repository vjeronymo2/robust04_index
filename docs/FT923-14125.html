			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Sheikh faces Fed penalty THE US Federal Reserve said yesterday it was seeking a civil money penalty of up to Dollars 170m against Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, a Saudi Arabian former banker indicted in the BCCI scandal, agencies report from Washington. Also yesterday, a federal judge in New York ordered his US assets frozen. The Fed said Sheikh Khalid had violated US law by acquiring, without Fed approval, 28.7 per cent of the shares of Credit and Commerce American Holdings NV of the Netherlands Antilles. He was indicted last week by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges that he and an associate had sought to defraud BCCI depositors of Dollars 300m. He resigned on Tuesday as chief operating officer of the national Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, that country's largest bank, saying he will contest the charges.</p>

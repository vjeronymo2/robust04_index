			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Second Report and Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. In this Second Report and Order, we prescribe general rules and procedures to implement the Commission's new authority under Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to use competitive bidding to award licenses for use of the radio spectrum. In the future, in subsequent Reports and Orders, specific rules within the scope of these general rules will be adopted for each service subject to competitive bidding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A voluminous number of comments and reply comments were filed by interested parties in response to the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (58 FR 53489 (October 15, 1993)) in this docket. These comments address the many proposals made in the Notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility of License Applications for Competitive Bidding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The Commission will use competitive bidding to award licenses only when the statutory criteria for auctionability set forth in Section 309(j) of the Communications Act are met. First, there must be mutually exclusive applications for an initial license or construction permit. Second, the service applied for must principally involve the transmission or reception of communications services to subscribers for compensation. Applying these criteria, the Commission determined that mutually exclusive licenses in the Interactive Video Data Service (IVDS), the Personal Communications Services, most of the Public Mobile Services, the Multipoint Distribution Service, the Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service, the Specialized Mobile Radio Service, Marine Public Coast Stations and for exclusive frequencies above 900 MHz in the Private Carrier Paging Service should be awarded through competitive bidding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Because licensees in the Broadcast Radio and Broadcast Television Services, Maritime Operational Fixed Stations, Personal Radio Services (except IVDS), certain Private Land Mobile Radio Services and certain other services do not receive compensation from subscribers, these services are excluded from the competitive bidding process. The following kinds of applications are not subject to competitive bidding: Applications for renewal of licenses, most applications for modification, applications for subsidiary communications services, and applications for frequencies used as intermediate links in the provision of service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Competitive Bidding Design Options <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. We adopt simultaneous multiple round auctions as our primary auction methodology. However, as the record convinces us that there is no single competitive bidding design that is optimal for all auctionable services and because Congress directed us to design and test multiple alternative methodologies, we have provided alternative methods from which to choose under appropriate circumstances. The alternative design options are single round sealed bid auctions (either sequential or simultaneous) and sequential oral auctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The two primary characteristics that will determine the choice of auction design are: (1) The degree to which licenses are interdependent, and (2) whether the expected license values are high or low. Because we expect most licenses to be of high value and interdependent, the simultaneous multiple round auction is our preferred auction design. The Commission will select the competitive bidding design to be used in auctioning particular licenses on a service-specific basis. Combinatorial bidding, which may be used with any type of auction, is also authorized for use as a competitive bidding mechanism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures to Implement the Competitive Bidding Designs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. To efficiently implement the competitive bidding designs, we must specify certain auction procedures. We will choose from these procedures and incorporate them into the service-specific rules that we will adopt in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sequencing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . We will choose the sequence of what is auctioned. The importance of the choice of sequence increases with the degree of interdependence among the items auctioned in sequence. We intend to minimize the importance of the choice of sequence by auctioning licenses sequentially only when there is not a high degree of value interdependence across the licenses or groups that are offered in sequence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Duration of bidding rounds <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In simultaneous multiple round auctions, bids can be submitted continuously with the high bids announced at the end of each round. With discrete rounds, the Commission can more readily control the pace at which the auction proceeds. The duration of bidding rounds and the interval between rounds in simultaneous multiple round auctions may be varied by announcement during the course of an auction. We generally intend to give bidders a single business day to submit bids and intend to conduct a new bidding round each business day, but we may choose other round lengths and intervals between rounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Minimum bid increments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In multiple round auctions, whether they be sequential or simultaneous, the Commission will generally specify minimum bid increments. The bid increment is the amount or percentage by which the bid must be raised above the previous round's high bid in order to be accepted as a valid bid in the current round. Imposing a minimum bid increment speeds the progress of the auction and, along with activity and stopping rules, helps to ensure that the auction comes to closure within a reasonable period of time. We reserve the right to specify minimum bid increments in dollar terms as well as in percentage terms. We also may vary the minimum bid increments with respect to different licenses being awarded in one auction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Stopping rules for multiple round auctions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Prior to each multiple round auction, the Commission will announce by Public Notice a stopping rule for determining when the auction is over. We seek a stopping rule that will (1) terminate the auction in a reasonable period of time, (2) be simple and clearly understood by participating bidders and observers of the auction process, and (3) in the case of simultaneous auctions, close all markets at approximately the same time. In simultaneous auctions, the stopping rules must also specify whether to close markets individually or simultaneously. Hybrid stopping rules are also possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The following stopping rules are preferred: (1) When auctioning licenses one at a time, or simultaneously and closing markets one at a time bidding on a market will close if a single round passes in which no new acceptable bids ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , no bids that meet any applicable bid increment rule) are submitted for that license; (2) when auctioning licenses simultaneously and closing markets simultaneously_bidding on all markets will close if a single round passes in which no new acceptable bids are submitted for any license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

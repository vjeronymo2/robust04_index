			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Arts: The 3 Lives of Lucie Cabrol - Theatre Watching the performers in Theatre de Complicite's current production, The 3 Lives of Lucie Cabrol, you can see what extraordinary performers all seven of them are. The show reveals also how well the company creates theatre in umpteen different ways - by using movement, speech, music, lighting, props, scenery. But what is best is how all this virtuosity and variety are directed simply into telling the story. And, though the story is modern (written by John Berger), you follow this Complicite version as intensely as you read a Grimms' fairytale. Lucie Cabrol, the story's heroine, is a tough, tiny, gnarled daughter of the soil - and an embodiment of whatever is indomitable about the European peasant spirit. Born in 1900, she lives through both world wars, working the land, and living off it. Some village men depart for war, for Paris, for the Americas, and of them a few are killed and injured. Other men stay and work the land, including two of Lucie's brothers, who betray her and finally, when she is in her 40s, turn her out. So ends Lucie's first life. The Complicite production tells this narrative with wonderful seamlessness. We hear of wartime deaths; we see the labourers at work on the land with their scythes; and, of course, the double meaning of 'scythes' strikes home. Lucie herself, is as sharp and strange and aggressive as a figure from myth  -Rumpelstiltskin, or Puck. Lucie's second life is as a loner, living outside the village, selling mushrooms and berries, smuggling cigarettes at a profit, hoarding her profits vindictively. (The way we see her pluck unseen berries, from human 'branches', and store unseen mushrooms in her skirts, is one of the show's brightest details.) Jean, the man who got away without marrying her, returns, and she tells him of her life. She is so tough - and so determined even now to marry him - that we think she will live forever; but no. The third life of Lucie Cabrol is as a ghost, claiming Jean from beyond the grave like some bizarre old goblin Cathy haunting some old minor-league Heathcliff. The 3 Lives of Lucie Cabrol is not a perfect show. A few elements of the story are unclear and the scenery for the finale sets up a stronger parallel to the Crucifixion than the story can sustain. The taped (very cinematic) sound accompaniment by Christopher Shutt is sometimes too intrusive and too crude. Even so, this is one of the most riveting pieces of theatre to be seen in Britain today. Lilo Baur's impersonation of Lucie has a terrific force (if played occasionally too much for effect); and, as Jean, Simon McBurney gives the most remarkable performance amid a remarkable ensemble. (No wonder, for he, with Mark Wheatley, adapted the story; and he has directed the whole staging.) Somehow he manages to be aged before his time, perplexed, sensitive, and huggable, all at the same time. While Lucie, at the climax of her stormy narration, pours out, on her knees beneath the Madonna, her angry frustrations, the most affecting thing of all is how way McBurney, sitting and watching her awkwardly, simply shifts his weight. He becomes the heart of the story and the production. At Riverside Studios, W6, 081-748-3354, until April 9.</p>

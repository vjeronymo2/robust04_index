			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Rich blames health for decision to quit BOC Mr Patrick Rich is to retire early as chairman of BOC, the industrial gases group. He blamed health problems arising from 'the stresses and burdens of office' for his decision, which takes effect in April. The announcement came less than two months after Mr Rich gave up the job of chief executive. BOC said yesterday that Mr Rich's health had been an issue in that decision too. Mr Rich became chief executive of BOC in January 1991 and chairman a year later on the retirement of Mr Dick Giordano, the highest paid businessman in the UK for much of the 1980s. Unlike Mr Giordano, who remains a non-executive director, Mr Rich will be retiring from the board entirely. BOC's board would 'decide soon' on his replacement. Mr Rich, who is 62, had been expected to retire at 64. BOC's annual meeting yesterday also heard that the company would make an Pounds 85m provision for restructuring. Mr Pat Dyer, chief executive since last month said this would 'produce savings of almost Pounds 60m a year' within three years. BOC shares rose 32 1/2 p to 698p. The restructuring is the result of a review of the company's businesses. BOC said Pounds 25m would be allocated to reorganising the gases business, with the balance going to healthcare. The programme would cut 1,700 jobs, about 4 per cent of the workforce. Some plant closures were possible as part of the action, which would be completed by the end of 1995. 'The cost savings in gases will be around Pounds 8m in 1994 rising to Pounds 23m a year by 1996,' Mr Dyer said. 'The programme in health care will produce cost savings of about Pounds 12m in 1994 rising to about Pounds 35m in 1997.' The cash would pay for closures, redundancies and new information technology. Mr Dyer said that some would also go to 'improve the focus of our product pipeline', which could mean stopping the development of some less-promising products. My Dyer told the annual meeting that current trading was 'in line with the company's expectations'. There had been only limited signs of improvement in the economic environment, with some growth in the Pacific region, except Japan. He confirmed that profits in the healthcare division were still being hurt by low-price generic competition for the anaesthetic Forane, whose US patents have expired.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marianela Samper; from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] The first international seminar on industrial  property and business possibilities in Cuba has concluded in  Havana with a positive discussion of experiences by experts and  specialists from the 14 nations that gathered here. The debate  was enhanced by topics as important as Latin American  integration in industrial property [propiedad industrial] and  what the subcontinent could do in light of the new challenges  posed by the revamping of the international legal order, which  is gaining strength.    Regarding the use of the patents cooperation agreement,  which  began (?in May) 1978 under the auspices of the Intellectual  Property World Organization [Organizacion Mundial de Propiedad  Intellectual], the participants discussed some of the advantages  to the countries that adhere to it, including the right to  defend claims on inventions in more than 60 countries and the  extension of the time granted to applicants before entering the  national phase; these advantages allow for further development  of the invention, marketing, and facilitate a better financial  condition in order to meet other expenditures. Here, one needs  access to an extensive technological bibliography. Jesus  Sanchez Lima, from the United States, has commented on the  treaty and the North to South transfer of technology.    [Begin Sanchez recording] I look at it from a perspective  different from other participants in this field, many who  primarily.... [pauses] regarding the lobbying by the (?First  World) against the Third World. Though I believe in the patents  system and think these limited monopolies granted to the  inventors are the most effective way to stimulate inventions, I  believe, nonetheless, there must be a limit to those monopolies.  Those limits in many countries that are forced by economic  reasons to join treaties like GATT and NAFTA may not yield the  expected results. [end recording]    During the international seminar emphasis was also placed on  the overlap between copyright or industrial property, which  provide protection to artistic and literary works, and  inventions and patent rights. There was a consensus to consider  a possible legal system, at both the national and international  levels and to establish the principle of a single right over  goods and materials. In conclusion, here is the opinion of one  of the Cuban experts who attended the meeting.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] It has challenged us  to exercise our intelligence, and by that word I mean the  intelligence of those who live in Cuba. It has made us think  beyond what we are used to thinking and even open ourselves to  the challenges our domestic policy of promoting foreign  investments in certain sectors are posing. Matters we had not  considered, including in our legislation, are discussed here as  the problems other legislations have. They will not be problems  for our laws, because we have been forewarned. In a general  sense, the [word indistinct] is highly positive. [end recording]    This seminar also served to explore the future report that  will contain the steps Cuba has been taking against legal  regulations on industrial property and the expectations it  offers Latin America by adjusting its laws.</p>

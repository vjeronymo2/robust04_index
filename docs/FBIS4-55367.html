			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 11 (CTK) -- The Czech Government has  approved the presentation documents for the Partnership for  Peace project which the Foreign Ministry is to submit to NATO,  Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said at a press conference after  the government session today.    The documents are only in draft form and will probably be  reworked on consultation with NATO, he said.    The documents represent an intensification of the  preparations for Czech membership in the security structures.  They include consultation in the event of a threat to the  security of the Czech Republic on the basis of 16+1, i.e. the  sixteen NATO members plus in such a case the Czech Republic, he  said. In addition they embrace further political consultation,  the support of United Nations (U.N.) forces and work on the  compatibility of the Czech Army with the armies of the alliance.    The Czech Republic is to offer its training bases for U.N.  troop exercises, participate in the organization of study visits  and continue to cooperate in the military actions of U.N.  peace-keeping forces.</p>

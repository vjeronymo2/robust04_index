			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'JAPAN SEEKS WORLD INFLUENCE'  </P> <P> An Arabic proverb warns, "If the camel once gets his nose in the tent, his body  will soon follow." This was brought to mind while reading "Japan Foresees a  Joint Global Role With U.S." (Part I, Feb. 4).  </P> <P> In its foreign affairs and diplomatic efforts, the United States has often  deserved a prize as the boob of the moment but not so poignantly as in the case  of Japan. After sustaining a near-fatal blow on the day of infamy, America  overcame an intransigent enemy in some of the bloodiest battles known to man.  Nevertheless, from that point forward, we progressively restored its  sovereignty and economic well-being.  </P> <P> At the same time, Japan subjected American business to unconscionable  restrictions. The Japanese convinced successive U.S. Administrations to allow  their goods open access to our lucrative markets. However, trade was neither  free, fair nor reciprocal. Unbelievably, U.S. representatives continue to  applaud the arrangement. Using every trick in the book, aided and abetted by  official agencies of the Japanese government, their economy gained advantages  of astounding proportions. Without exaggeration, it has reached the point where  unilateral action by Japan can produce the immediate economic collapse of the  United States. That threat is now being exercised to expand the global  influence of the Rising Sun.  </P> <P> The question is, "Why does Japan need a global role with the United States?"  The answer is obvious: Japan needs America's worldwide military and diplomatic  machinery to serve its selfish purposes. Already, we have been used to protect  Japan's oil interests in the Middle East. In trade talks, America does its best  to convince other trading partners to subscribe to the same stupidity with  Japan as the U.S.  </P> <P> The final indignity is Japan's recent public criticism of a litany of American  problems ranging from narcotics to the huge budget deficit. I submit, the  entire camel now occupies the tent.  </P> <P> TED ROGERS  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> APPEAL UPHELD, CLARK ALLOWED TO PLAY BASKETBALL AT CHRISTIAN;  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOLS: A THREE-MEMBER SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF MANAGERS VOTED TO  WAIVE THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE TRANSFER PENALTY.  </P> <P> Finally, Tony Clark is free to play the game that got him into hot water in the  first place.  </P> <P> The six-month case of the ex-Valhalla athlete who just wanted to play  basketball came to a halt Thursday when Section Commissioner Kendall Webb  announced that a three-member subcommittee of the Board of Managers upheld the  appeal by Clark's parents to waive the public/private transfer penalty.  </P> <P> Clark transferred to Christian this year, but because Valhalla Principal Bob  Avant refused to sign the transfer form, he was banned from competition. The  case then went to Webb, who refused to rule Clark eligible.  </P> <P> "Now I just want to concentrate on basketball, nothing else, just ball," said  Clark, who on Nov. 10 announced that he signed to play at Arizona.  </P> <P> "Coming into this season, I had college and this on my mind," he said. "I can  finally get on with things."  </P> <P> No committee members could be reached for comment, but their decision read in  part:  </P> <P> "Denial of the opportunity to compete would be a penalty placed against Tony  Clark because of possible improper action of persons other than himself. In  view of the foregoing, the committee upholds the appeal of Mr. and Mrs. Clark  and waives the ineligibility at the varsity level."  </P> <P> Webb said he supported the decision by the committee. "The committee did an  excellent job of studying the issues and arriving at a logical conclusion," he  said. "It's important we have a review process."  </P> <P> Although Clark's case has received extensive publicity, there have been similar  cases. In 1981, Ken Johnson, a transfer from Alabama, led La Jolla to the 2-A  section basketball championship. Webb ruled Ken Johnson ineligible on the basis  that he was not a hardship case, but the subcommittee overruled him.  </P> <P> Webb said that while he also based this decision on whether Clark was a  hardship case, the committee had other considerations.  </P> <P> "They didn't base it on hardship," Webb said, "They did it on if Tony Clark was  given the same consideration as other athletes. And they saw he wasn't. They  couldn't find a substantive reason not to support him."  </P> <P> San Diego is one of the only sections in the state that gives principals the  option of signing a transfer waiver for players.  </P> <P> "We may want to look at the possibility of removing the public-to-private form  and going to the state rule that if you want to appeal a transfer waiver, you  go directly to the commissioner," Webb said.  </P> <P> Clark said he was prepared not to play his senior year but that he was relieved  with the decision.  </P> <P> "I more or less prepared myself for 'no'," Clark said. "But when I found out it  was yes, I was all over the place."  </P></p>

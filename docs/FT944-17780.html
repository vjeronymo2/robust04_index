			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Decline to Pounds 1.3m at Novo The poor performance of its film entertainment services division and a loss on the disposal of its French associate were behind a reduction in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.81m to Pounds 1.29m at Novo Group in the year ended March 31. Sales rose 19 per cent to Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 14.3m). The group is involved in litigation concerning Walport International, which was acquired from BET, concerning certain alleged licensing and copyright irregularities. Lower operating profits of Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 2.31m) reflected a Pounds 241,000 charge related to the litigation. In addition, a loss of Pounds 182,000 was incurred on the French disposal. A reduced final dividend of 0.1p (1p) is recommended, making 0.2p (1.3p) for the year. Earnings per share fell to 1.74p (3.82p). The group is also raising Pounds 1.8m net as working capital via a 1-for-6 fully underwritten rights issue of 7.75m ordinary shares at 26p each.</p>

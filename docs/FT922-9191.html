			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Post-petition diesel fuel payments are valid in winding-up DENNEY v JOHN HUDSON &amp; CO LTD Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Fox, Lord Justice Russell and Lord Justice Staughton): April 9 1992 PAYMENTS MADE in good faith by a company in the ordinary course of business after commencement of a compulsory winding-up in respect of supplies delivered before presentation of the winding-up petition, may be validated by the court if there is a possibility that they benefit the company and its unsecured creditors in that they ensure that further deliveries will be made by the supplier thus enabling the company to continue its business. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by Mr L K Denney, liquidator of the company SA &amp; D Wright Ltd, from the decision of Judge Davidson QC that payments made by the company to suppliers of diesel, John Hudson &amp; Co Ltd, after presentation of a creditor's winding up-petition, were not void. Section 522 of the Companies Act 1985 (re-enacted in section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986) provides: 'In a winding-up by the court, any disposition of the company's property . . . made after the commencement of the winding-up, unless the court otherwise orders, is void.' LORD JUSTICE FOX said the company carried on business as a haulier. Hudsons was a supplier of fuel oils. In early spring 1984, Hudsons became concerned about the company's payment record. In May of that year, it put the company on terms that it must pay for previous deliveries before delivery of new supplies. That was applied in practice thereafter. On June 27 1986, a petition for the compulsory winding-up of the company was presented by a creditor. At that time, the company owed Hudsons Pounds 17,132 under three invoices, numbers 437706, 437927 and 438233, dated June 2, 11 and 24 respectively. On July 7, the company paid Hudsons Pounds 12,859, which settled invoices 437706 and 437927. On July 10 the petition came to the notice of a director of the company, but it continued to trade. On July 17, the company paid Hudsons Pounds 4,214 in settlement of invoice 438233. On July 24, the petition was advertised in the Gazette. Between July 27 and October 2, various invoices were delivered by Hudsons and sums paid by the company for fuel oil supplied. On October 15, an order for the compulsory winding-up of the company was made. On December 17, the liquidator was appointed. On May 19 1989, the liquidator applied for a declaration that the payments of Pounds 12,859 and Pounds 4,214 made on July 7 and 17, constituted 'dispositions of the company's property' which were void under section 522 of the Companies Act 1985. Judge Davidson QC made an order that the two payments be not avoided. The liquidator now appealed. In Re Grays Inn Construction (1980) 1 WLR 711 the following propositions were approved: (1) The court's discretion under section 522 was entirely at large, subject to the general principles which applied to any kind of discretion and also to the limitation that it be exercised in the context of the statute's liquidation provisions. (2) The basic principle of law governing liquidation of insolvent estates was that assets would be distributed pari passu (in equal proportion) among unsecured creditors as at date of bankruptcy. (3) There were occasions, however, when it might be beneficial not only for the company but also for unsecured creditors, that it should be able to dispose of some of its property after the petition had been presented, but before the winding-up order was made. Thus, it might sometimes be beneficial to company and creditors that it should be able to continue business in its ordinary course. (4) In considering whether to make a validating order, the court must always do its best to ensure that the interest of unsecured creditors would not be prejudiced. (5) The desirability of the company's being enabled to carry on its business was often speculative. In each case, the court must carry out a balancing exercise. (6) The court should not validate any transaction which might result in pre-liquidation creditors being paid in full at the expense of other creditors, in the absence of special circumstances. If, for example, it were in the interests of the creditors generally that the business should be carried on and that could only be achieved by paying for goods supplied to the company when the petition was presented but not yet paid for, the court might exercise its discretion to validate payment for those goods. (7) A disposition carried out in good faith in the ordinary course of business at a time when the parties were unaware that a petition had been presented would usually be validated unless there was ground for thinking the transaction might involve an attempt to prefer the disponee. (8) Despite the strength of the principle of securing pari passu distribution, it had no application to post-liquidation creditors  - for example, the sale of an asset at full market value after presentation of the petition. That was because such a transaction involved no dissipation of the company's assets for it did not reduce the value of its assets. There was no reason to doubt that Hudsons was acting in good faith and in the ordinary course of business established between it and the company as to payments for and supply of fuel oils. Nor was there any reason to suppose that the company was seeking to prefer Hudsons over the other creditors when it made the payments in question. Hudson's knew nothing of the petition until after the winding-up order. A director of the company did become aware of it on July 10, but the company simply continued to trade. There seemed to be nothing to suggest that the company or its directors were consciously acting in bad faith towards the other unsecured creditors or any of them. The court accepted that the parties acted in good faith. The essential questions were whether the parties were acting in the ordinary course of business; and whether the relevant transactions were likely to be for the benefit of the creditors generally. The parties were acting in accordance with their normal and established course of business. As to whether the transactions were likely to benefit the general body of creditors, although the two payments were in respect of pre-liquidation debts, they were not payments for which the company got no quid pro quo. Under the standing arrangement introduced in 1984, the company received the further benefit that it could then order a further supply of fuel oil  - payment being deferred until the next supply was required. Thus it was not a situation in which one pre-liquidation creditor was preferred to the others. The oil purchased seemed to have been of much the same value as the amount paid. The effect of the payments was that the company ordered a supply of diesel. Without the diesel, the company could not continue in business. It was possible that continuance of the business was not a benefit to the company. But there was no evidence of that. The reality was that the parties acted in good faith in the ordinary course of their established business relations and the company obtained a benefit from the payment, namely the capacity to give a further order which would enable it to continue its business. The benefit in the present case was not the supply of goods purchased pre-liquidation. It was the fact that the payment for those goods would enable the company to order further supplies at once and pay later. The supplies would enable the business to be carried on and earn revenue. What the payments secured were further supplies. The company was continuing to trade and one could only assume that it would necessarily require such supplies for the business. There was no evidence to the contrary. In a situation like the present one, one could reasonably assume that what was for the benefit of the company would be for the benefit of the general body of creditors. The judge was exercising a discretion. It was a wide one. There was no basis for interfering with his decision. The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships concurred.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBERT HUTCHINS AS A DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION;  </P> <P> UNSEASONABLE TRUTHS: THE LIFE OF ROBERT MAYNARD HUTCHINS BY HARRY S. ASHMORE  (LITTLE, BROWN: $27.50; 616 PP.; 0-316-05396-1)  </P> <P> Robert Maynard Hutchins was one of those larger-than-life men of vision about  whom Americans like to boast in retrospect, but who in life receive more than  their share of misunderstanding, criticism and indeed vituperation from their  fellow-citizens. Hutchins, to be sure, gave at least as good as he got. His  long and extraordinarily distinguished career as one of America's great  educators began at age 24 as secretary of the Yale Corp., continued through two  trail-blazing decades as president of the University of Chicago and ended as  president of the ever controversial Center for the Study of Democratic  Institutions in Santa Barbara. Notably reluctant to suffer fools (or opponents)  gladly, Hutchins taught and fought all his life for the idea of a questing but  disciplined liberal-arts education and its by-product -- an informed  intellectual community. Both, he felt, were vital to the health of American  democracy. Many of Hutchins' ideals, from civil rights to the international  rule of the law, ran against the entrenched conventional wisdom of his time, in  the '40s and '50s, but they have been tested and proven since.  </P> <P> The author of "Unseasonable Truths," Harry Ashmore, was himself a friend and  associate of Hutchins, as the long-time executive vice president at the Center  in Santa Barbara. He is understandably impressed by his subject -- although it  would be hard to find a biographer who would not be, faced with this man's  achievements. Ashmore gives Hutchins' many opponents equal time, however  (although sometimes just barely), and tells Hutchins' complex story fluently  and well. This is a badly needed book -- comprising as it does a fascinating  sub-chapter on America's intellectual history. (Its considerable length is  justified by the broad spectrum of Hutchins' interests and involvements, not to  mention the copious quotes from his subject, who on his own could have supplied  the bulk of a second Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.)  </P> <P> Hutchins was born just before the turn of the century. He was graduated from  Yale (Class of '21) with two other Americans of singular mold, William Benton  and Henry Robinson Luce. All three were ministers' sons. All three, although  their interpretations of this were different, maintained a lifelong devotion to  certain values of conscience, integrity and plain speaking that they had  learned in the Puritan parsonage. Benton, after starting a formidable  advertising agency, Benton &amp; Bowles, went on to become the chairman and  guiding genius of Encylopaedia Britannica, where Hutchins ended up as chairman  of the board of editors. Luce, of course, was the proprietor of Time, Inc., and  his magazines' most critical editor. The relationship among them was uneasy,  because it was almost inevitably competitive. While Benton and Luce tended to  look askance at Hutchins as a man who probably couldn't and shouldn't ever meet  a payroll, Hutchins looked archly at them from his academic pedestal as  something better than useful Philistines, although often not much better.  Nonetheless, their friendships remained firm. The story of the three is a  capsule of the American Century as it might have turned out.  </P> <P> At Yale, Hutchins was almost the epitome of the bright and handsome young man  his seniors like to promote. But he was not one to curry favor or compromise,  either with his ideals or his promoters. At age 29, the brand-new dean of the  Yale Law School, he brashly set out to inject some empirical social science  into the stiff legal curriculum.  </P> <P> When he became president of the University of Chicago in 1929, at the ripe age  of 30, he wasted little time in shaking the tree there, as he pointed the  university toward his ideal of a liberal education. He saw this as a prescribed  set of courses in the humanities, the natural sciences, history and philosophy  over a two-year period (preferably preceded by a preparatory two years of  similar courses in high school), after which the student would receive the BA  degree. Then -- but only then -- would students go on to various forms of  specialized education. Scouring the electives of most academic institutions,  students at Hutchins' college were to study from the original texts and  participate in extensive discussions of the ideas involved -- as junior  humanists -- before going on to their various work specialties. Predictably,  Hutchins was opposed fang-and-claw by most of Chicago's turf-guarding faculty.  He managed to import some significant new academic talent to support him. Yet  in 22 years, he never quite got his reforms through. He did succeed in setting  a standard of academic excellence and a liberal-arts tradition at Chicago that  his foes were unable to stifle. Above all, he gave us the abiding example of a  university president who was not afraid to educate and to exercise leadership.  These qualities are in short supply these days, among the cautious committeemen  and women who putter away at university presidencies.  </P> <P> A significant byproduct of Hutchins' principate at Chicago was the acquisition  of Encyclopaedia Britannica by Hutchins' friend Benton, bought after the  University of Chicago's timid trustees refused to accept it as a gift. While  Benton turned E. B. into a puissant money-maker, Hutchins, as chairman of the  board of editors, became its editorial conscience and guide. He presided over  the publication of "Great Books of the Western World" and, ultimately, the  memorable 15th edition of Britannica in 1974.  </P> <P> By 1951, however, Hutchins had headed West from Chicago to California, where he  remained until his death in 1977. He first set up shop in Pasadena as associate  director of the newly formed Ford Foundation. But it took only a few years to  put a great void of distance between Ford's nervous board and Hutchins'  ambitious plans to re-state the premises of American democratic dialogue,  particularly against the right-wing vigilantism of the McCarthy era. In 1959,  Hutchins retreated to Santa Barbara, where he established the hilltop center as  a place for enlightened dialogue on the ideas behind the various political and  social issues facing the country -- a kind of "early warning system" for  democracy, as he often put it. Here he gathered about him a group of prominent  Amerian scholars and thinkers with widely different backgrounds and  specialties. These center fellows would meet several times a week to discuss  specific topics--from Constitutional freedoms to the multinational corporation  -- a kind of intellectual round table. Although some of Hutchins' intellectual  knights were more errant than others, these talks in the center's heyday could  be stimulating and provocative. They were relayed on tape and in print, to a  national audience.  </P> <P> Sometimes the dialogues grew to a wider scale, as with the memorable "Pacem in  Terris" conference in New York in 1965, where the center gathered about 2,000  of the world's prominent and concerned people to ponder the issues of war and  peace and world governance, at the height of the Cold War. Sometimes they  degenerated into trivial academic name-calling, as indeed happened all too  often in the faction-ridden last days of the center. Yet for those of us who  took part in such meetings, the thing we remember best was the magisterial  presiding of Bob Hutchins, always questioning, always searching for new ways to  keep the ideas behind the American debate from getting lost in the invective.  Unlike most idealists, Hutchins was never boring, with his high irony,  self-deprecatory wit and courtly invitation to outrageous thought. The issues  he raised remain more pertinent than ever today -- the goals and shape of  American education not least among them.  </P></p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Japan violates agreements Japanese officials were yesterday dismayed at the US finding that Japan has violated agreements to open up its cellular phone market, Michiyo Nakamoto writes. Mr Takenori Kanzaki, minister of posts and telecommunications, denied the US allegation that Japan had failed to live up to its promise to increase market access for cellular phones and equipment made by Motorola. Mr Kanzaki said Japan was complying with the accord, and called the action by the US 'one-sided'.</p>

The province's task this year is to carry on the reform, keep  up development, and ensure stability, while maintaining a  balance between these three aspects.    Jia Qinglin said: This province has initiated five reforms  this year, specifically: Reform of the financial and taxation  systems; the operation to introduce uniform foreign exchange  rates; reform of the fundraising and financing systems; foreign  trade reform; and reform of the banking system. As shown by the  development over the past two months, smooth progress has been  made in these reforms but more meticulous work must be done in  the future.

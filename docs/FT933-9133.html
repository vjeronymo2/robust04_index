			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Tajik forces win control of pass Government forces in Tajikistan have won control of a key mountain pass from rebels after nine days of intense fighting, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dushanbe. A Tajik defence ministry spokesman said government troops took control of the Hoborabad pass, which links the capital with the defiant region of Gorno-Badakhshan to the south-east, after rebel forces pulled out late on Monday. A foreign diplomat in Dushanbe said the taking of the pass would allow government forces to concentrate on the more serious threats from rebels launching attacks from bases in Afghanistan. Mr Hidayat Amin Arsalla, Afghanistan's foreign minister, arrived in the Tajik capital Dushanbe for the first bilateral talks since fighting along the border intensified a month ago.</p>

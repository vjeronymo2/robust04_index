			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, PLO adviser and head of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the international coordination  committee of donor states, by Salah Salamah in Paris on 11  June--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Salamah] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, we welcome you. As  you know, there are many concerns in the Palestinian arena. The  implementation of the agreement that was signed by Israel and  the PLO faces many obstacles. There is the problem of the  Palestinian detainees, who Israel has set free in accordance  with unfair conditions, including the condition of keeping these  freed detainees in the Jericho area to prevent them from  returning to their homes. What can you tell us about these  obstacles and their dimensions?    [Sha'th] Negotiations for the release of the Palestinian  detainees continued until the last moment, just before the  conclusion of the agreement in Cairo on 4 May. The Palestinian  side insisted -- I reiterate that we concluded an agreement that  gives all the Palestinian detainees now in Israeli prisons the  opportunity to be set free. This is what we want implemented:  First, the immediate release of the 5,000 detainees who,  according to our agreement, should be released from Israeli  jails within a period of five weeks from the date the agreement  was signed. This means this is the last week for the release of  these 5,000 detainees. We agreed to continue negotiations for  the release of the others within the next three months.    There is a clear agreement on what should be done with this  group that has been sent to Jericho. Only those who were  imprisoned for civilian crimes such as those who killed persons  for nonpolitical reasons, drug smugglers, and thieves should be  handed over to the PNA, which in turn will either keep them in  prison or release them. Whatever the category under which they  fall, they remain within the jurisdiction of the PNA in Gaza and  Jericho until this authority starts exercising Palestinian  authority throughout the West Bank. This will take three months  at the most.    As for the other political detainees, they should  immediately  be released in the West bank and Gaza and they should return  home. If the Israeli authorities prevent them from enjoying  their right to return to their homes, this will constitute a  violation of the agreement. We communicated this to the Israeli  delegation which was present at the donor countries conference  here in Paris. General Rotschild promised to solve this problem  within 48 hours. [passage omitted]    [Salamah] Dr. Sha'th, as part of the Israeli attempt to  judaize Jerusalem, the Israeli government says it is determined  to move the Palestinian national institutions from Jerusalem to  the autonomy areas. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  recently said that this has been agreed upon with the PLO and it  is mentioned in the Oslo agreement. What is the truth about  this point?    [Sha'th] The Declaration of Principles [DOP] and the Gaza-  Jericho agreement clearly mention that only the institutions  whose activity is restricted to Jericho and Gaza should be in  Gaza and Jericho. But, all the Palestinian institutions which  serve the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Jerusalem  remain where they are. The Arab institutions in Jerusalem were  there before the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and they will continue  their activities after the PNA extends its jurisdiction beyond  Gaza and Jericho.    The agreement that was signed in Washington says that within  a period of nine months from the date of the conclusion of that  agreement -- that is on 13 July -- the PNA must extend its  authority over all the West Bank. Any postponement of the  discussion of the final status of Jerusalem does not affect the  Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem. I believe that the paper  that was signed by Foreign Minister Peres and sent to late  Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst is very explicit. The  Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem will remain there. These  institutions began their activities during the Likud and  Shamir's rule. They precede the Labor Party's government and  the agreement we signed. These institutions should remain to  serve the Palestinian people in Jerusalem and the other areas of  the Palestinian territories. They have nothing to do with the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    When we discuss the final status of Jerusalem, the explicit  Palestinian stand will emphasize that Jerusalem is a city that  was occupied in 1967 and should be liberated when a definitive  solution is reached so that it may be the Palestinian capital of  the independent Palestinian state. This is very clear and  represents the sound implementation of UN Security Council  resolution 242 and the DOP. [passage omitted]</p>

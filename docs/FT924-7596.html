			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Luanda warns Unita THE Angolan government put Unita on notice yesterday that a new parliament would be convened regardless of whether the opposition movement took part, Reuter reports from Luanda. 'Parliament will function with or without Unita,' said Mr Johnny Pinock Eduardo, deputy foreign minister. 'We cannot continue to be prisoners of a party which lost the elections.' Unita began a military advance after rejecting results of Angola's first multi-party elections in September, which gave the MPLA government a hefty parliamentary majority. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos narrowly failed to win enough votes to avoid a run-off with Unita's Mr Jonas Savimbi, his foe in the civil war that ended in peace accords signed in May 1991. The Luanda government is to convene Angola's parties this week to discuss forming a new parliament and national unity government, and holding another round of presidential elections.</p>

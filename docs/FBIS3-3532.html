So far, Shantou boasts a total of 265 Taiwan-invested  enterprises with 300 million U.S. dollars in capital. Taiwan is  the second largest among all non-state investors in the city,  next only to Hong Kong.    Greater confidence among investors from Taiwan has enabled  them to shift investment from the formerly labor-intensive  shoemaking, leather and food industries to technology-intensive  fields like electronics, petrochemicals, machinery and  industrial crafts.    For example, equipment for receiving TV programs via  satellite, individual computers and color video electronic  keyboards produced by a solely Taiwan-funded technological  company in Shantou are welcome in markets in Europe and the U.S.    Instead of first executing original trial action, many  Taiwan  investors have regarded their investment undertakings in Shantou  as part of long-term development strategies as embodied by the  expansion of fields involved in and the growth of funds to  individual projects.    More than 10 projects backed by Taiwan investors have cost  more than 10 million yuan each.    The city has also made remarkable progress in introducing  Taiwan investment to its key infrastructural projects.    Four Taiwan-based financial groups have decided to contract  for the construction of a bridge across the local bay at a cost  of 1.5 billion yuan.    The foundation of a 16-story "Taiwan mansion" funded by  several Taiwan investors was also laid recently in Shantou.</p>

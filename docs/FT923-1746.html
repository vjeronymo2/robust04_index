			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Plea on statutory audits THE STATUTORY audit of all limited-liability companies should remain compulsory, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants said yesterday in a submission to the Department of Trade and Industry. It says that although reform may be required, abolition of the statutory audit is not the solution and the audit is important for the Inland Revenue, creditors and bankers. The document follows growing pressure from other bodies for abolition of audits for small companies. The DTI said earlier this year that it might consider abolishing the requirement for companies with turnovers below the VAT threshold of Pounds 36,600. Industry and a number of professional bodies have argued that the audit is costly and inefficient.</p>

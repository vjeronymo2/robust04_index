			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / SA right meets on poll participation Right-wing groups in South Africa have summoned their supporters to meet this weekend to decide between peace and resistance to majority rule, with the gatherings expected crucially to affect South Africa's nascent democracy. It was not clear last night whether the white right Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) or the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party could take a final decision on whether to participate in all-race elections in late-April and implicitly to accept a constitution which they believe denies self-determination to the Zulu and Afrikaner peoples. Both may seek to avoid a final decision, rather than pre-empt talks, due to resume on Monday, with the African National Congress and the government on self-determination and regional autonomy. But officials from both groups, which are due to hold large separate meetings, said negotiations had reached the 'end of the road' and resistance campaigns were likely to be launched, at the weekend or later. Negotiators from all three blocs were privately despondent that agreement had proved elusive, despite several extensions of the deadline for agreeing amendments to a new constitution before the April election date is proclaimed. A proclamation is now expected to be made next week. Each group is eager to ensure it is not blamed for the failure of talks, and the weekend meetings could see the right offering publicly to participate in elections, but under conditions they know the ANC and the government would find impossible to accept. Those close to the Afrikaner Volksfront said they had reached agreement with the ANC to set up a homeland for Afrikaners, who would be represented in the national parliament in a third chamber, additional to the national assembly and the senate. However, the government had refused this deal.</p>

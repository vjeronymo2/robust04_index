			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the U.S.-Jordanian tension resulting from  the al-'Aqabah Port blockade, Crown Prince Hasan has decided to  cancel a visit to Washington scheduled 20 April. Jordan had  expected that the United States would decide to lift the  blockade against ships bound for al-'Aqabah Port and allow  inspection of ships at the port instead of accosting them on the  high seas.    Jordan has already conveyed its views to the United States  and the world and the issue has become clear and does not have  to be discussed by the prince in Washington during the visit,  which was scheduled one month before the outbreak of the present  crisis. Talks during the visit were supposed to focus on certain  economic aspects and political issues which cannot be discussed  now before the al-'Aqabah blockade crisis is over.</p>

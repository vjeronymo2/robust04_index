			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / People: Kleinwort's Latin American connections Roger Palmer, the ex-global strategist who is building a Latin American equities team at Kleinwort Benson, has hired four people whom he believes share the relatively rare qualities of technical expertise in the region with an understanding of the UK investment banking scene. His new deputy and head of sales, 28-year-old Andrew Macdonald, has spent nearly five years at Baring Secur-ities, which has established itself as the leading UK house in Latin America, even if it has been hit recently by a wave of defections. Palmer, who has decided to differentiate his service by basing his team in London, as opposed to New York or Mexico, and taking a sector, as well as country, approach to equity analysis, has also gone for two internationally-minded Latin Americans. Argentinian born Andrea Marmolejo, 31, who will head the research team, is a Harvard graduate and has worked at the Argentine central bank, McKinsey and the then UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. She answered an advertisement for her new job after spending a short while at a Spanish-funded venture capital operation. After the bank's success with the last Chilean it picked from the London Business School MBA programme, who is now doing well in the Latin American corporate finance department of KB, Palmer returned to the LBS, and hired the only final year MBA student who came from Chile. He is Sergio Arredondo, who is 29. Janet Krengel, 40, senior Latin American economist from Lloyds Bank, has also just come aboard. In a region where relationships are crucial in winning business, KB is already well-connected. Sir Kenneth Kleinwort, who remains a non-executive director of the group, has an Argentinian wife, and Desmond Cameron, the head of the Latin American corporate finance team which has been successfully collecting Argentinian privatisation mandates, looks back on 30 years experience.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Khabarovsk Kray Statistical Administration: "What </F> We Import and What We Export"]    [Text] Our kray, alas, is an importing territory. That is,  we import the majority of our consumer goods. Foodstuffs  predominate in the structure of these imports: They account for  60 percent of the overall volume of goods received. If  visualized the picture would look as follows:                             Foodstuffs                Nonfoodstuffs   From krays and oblasts   94.2                      87.7  of Russia   From CIS countries       1.8                       1.7   From imports             4                         10.6      Among the foodstuffs imported to the kray during the past  nine months were vegetable oil--1,085 tonnes (incidentally, this  is a 2.6-fold reduction compared to the corresponding period of  last year), and, correspondingly, sugar--7,551 tonnes  (2.3-fold), tea--125 tonnes (4.8-fold), macaroni items--465  tonnes (1.1-fold), confectionery items 115 tonnes (1.7-fold),  and canned fruits and vegetables--14,726 thousands of standard  cans (1.5-fold).    The main suppliers of fruit and vegetable products are  Uzbekistan and Ukraine. They account for 80 percent of the  fruits and vegetables.    The majority of fabrics, clothing, footwear, goods for  cultural and domestic purposes and household use, haberdashery,  and tobacco items are shipped in from krays and oblasts of  Russia. Thus, for example, 99.5 percent of the silk fabrics, all  of the deliveries of linen fabrics, 76 percent of the sewn  items, 98 percent of the knitted items, and 88 percent of the  leather footwear come from Russian these particular krays and  oblasts.    The kray ships in from the CIS countries such goods as light  bulbs from Kyrgyzstan, rugs and carpet items from Belarus,  Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, refrigerators from Azerbaijan, and  cameras and motorcycles from Belarus.    Imports from other countries include mainly industrially  processed food products, light industry goods, tobacco items,  and alcoholic beverages.    But foodstuffs are also shipped out of Khabarovsk Kray to  other regions. These are industrially processed food products.  Food deliveries to Russia constitute 99.6 percent of the overall  volume of exports of foodstuffs out of the kray. They include  macaroni and confectionery items, margarine products, flour,  cereals, fish products, nonalcoholic beverages, beer, and  champagne.    Of the nonfoodstuffs the kray delivers sewn items, knitwear,  leather footwear, furs, furniture, enamel and zinc-plated  dishware, detergents, and also goods for cultural and domestic  purposes and household use as well as haberdashery.    We export confectionery items, goods for cultural and  domestic purposes and household use, and detergents.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "A Variety of Splits"; quotation marks as </F> published]    [Text] EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE, Tiruchi--The past one year  seems to be a year of splits for some major and minor political  parties in Tamil Nadu and the latest one has occurred in the  Pattali Makkal Katchi [PMK]. Panrutti S. Ramachandran, who was  the solitary MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) elected on the  PMK ticket to the assembly in 1991, has been expelled from the  party and he launched a new party on Sunday called `Makkal Nala  Urimai Kazhagam.'    (The `Makkal Nala Urimai Kazhagam' is the second political  party in the state to have the portrait of a person in the  double colour flag and this party has chosen to have the  portrait of saint Thiruvalluvar in the flag. The first political  party, perhaps in the whole country, to have the portrait of a  person in the flag, was AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra  Kazhagam), which had chosen to have the portrait of Anna in the  flag from 1972, when it split from the DMK (Dravida Munnetra  Kazhagam).    There is a wind of change sweeping the political scene in  the  state since October 3 last year. A storm broke out in the DMK in  Oct 1993 in the wake of the party supremo Karunanidhi's  allegation based on unconfirmed IB reports that the LTTE  [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] was plotting against him to  promote the interests of V. Gopalsamy, MP (Member of  Parliament). This triggered off a big controversy culminating in  the split in the party and leading to the formation of a  separate political party `Marumalarchi DMK' last week in Madras.  This is the second major split suffered by the DMK since 1972  when MGR quit and formed his own party.    The Marumalarchi DMK is making its electoral debut in  Mylapore and Perundurai constituencies.    The Pattali Makkal Katchi founded by S. Ramdas, a medical  practitioner, was split into two with the expulsion of Panrutti  Ramachandran. Panrutti and Nellikkuppam Krishnamurthy, a former  MLA, have formed the new party `Makkal Nala Urimai Kazhagam.'    As a result of the split in the Indian Union Muslim League,  the Tamil Nadu unit is also split. The TN unit is now led by AKA  Abdul Samad and the splinter group `Indian National League' by  M.A. Latheef. Both AKA Abdul Samad and MA Latheef have become  the all-Indian general secretaries of their respective parties.    There is a mushroom growth of regional parties in the state  and it is difficult to keep count of them. One could have an  idea of the number of regional parties only when the Doordarshan  and AIR (All India Radio) broadcast the messages of political  leaders on the eve of important festivals like Pongal, Tamil New  Year's Day.    A seasoned political leader with three decades' existence in  public life humorously remarked that he came to know of the  number of political parties in Tamil Nadu only during the Tamil  New Year's Day and Pongal when TV and AIR in its news bulletins  would broadcast the festival messages of leaders of various  political parties.    The Congress in Tamil Nadu is having three factions, one  headed by Vazhappadi Ramamurthy, TNCC (Tamil Nadu (Indira)  Congress Committee) (I) chief, G.K. Moopanar, a senior party  leader and K.V. Thangabalu, Union Minister of State for Welfare.</p>

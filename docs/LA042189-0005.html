			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEIRUT'S BRUTAL ANARCHY  </P> <P> Arab League foreign ministers had planned to convene in emergency session today  to talk about the murderous wave of violence in Lebanon, but the meeting was  postponed when some of the officials discovered they had prior and presumably  more pressing engagements. So much for any sense of urgency over the latest and  possibly most destructive round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.  The ministers may try to meet next week, or maybe they won't. In the end, it  may make little difference. If history is a guide, the fighting that has rocked  Beirut for five weeks will subside only when those behind it -- Iraqi-aided  Christian army and militia forces on one side and Syrian-backed Muslim and  Druse militias on the other -- conclude that for now, nothing more is to be  gained by continuing the killing.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the carnage goes on and the demolition and displacement spread. As  many as 300,000 people have fled the capital to escape the destruction brought  by indiscriminate artillery exchanges. Beirut is now without water and  electricity. Fuel is short, bakers can't make bread and garbage goes  uncollected, adding the risks of epidemic disease to the ruin brought by war.  Except for intervals between shellings, life is lived largely in the bomb  shelters.  </P> <P> There is no such thing as a national government in Lebanon to try to impose  control. Instead, there are two claimants to power, one Christian, one Muslim,  neither with any recognized political legitimacy. The latest fighting erupted  when the Christian, Gen. Michel Aoun, imprudently tried to impose an air and  sea blockade on the Mediterranean ports controlled by the Muslim and Druse  militias. Retaliation was swift. Syria, whose 40,000 "peacekeeping" troops  control about 60% of Lebanese territory, added the power of its artillery to  the guns of its Lebanese allies.  </P> <P> The Christian forces in the meantime found an unexpected backer of their own in  Iraq, Syria's longtime ideological enemy. Iraqi weapons have given Aoun the  means to continue fighting, even as Iraq's involvement has given the battle on  Lebanese soil the added dimension of a power struggle between two outsiders,  compounding the difficulties of trying to restore an armistice.  </P> <P> And so it goes on, a brutal and remorseless conflict that long ago seemed to  have moved beyond the reach of reason or international moral suasion. The fear  that has long haunted the Lebanese is that their country's chronic and  seemingly irreconcilable tribal antagonisms would one day produce formal  political partition. The frightful events of the last five weeks can only have  deepened that fear.  </P></p>

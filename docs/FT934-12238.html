			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading LARGE-SCALE US selling of Footsie futures left the December contract floundering with few friends in the market, writes Christine Buckley. With sentiment knocked by the CBI survey on industrial trends, the flickering hope of an early interest rate cut proved too weak to give much support to the contract. Having been recently driven upwards by the inflow of US money, American selling cut off an important lifeline. The downward drift began after the contract had mustered a climb from its opening at 3,182 to its day's high of 3,218. Then, after publication of the CBI's findings December was at the mercy of the strong selling. Some institutions were buyers though in insufficient numbers to provide a lift as the heavy US off-loading ran in tandem with intensive selling by independent traders. A poor opening on Wall Street consolidated gloomy sentiment in the market although December traded ahead of its fair value premium for most of the session. However, its closing level of 3,180 was just on a par with the fair value premium to the cash market which stands at about 15 points. Action was moderate in traded options and volume reached 30,053 lots with a fairly even balance between index and stock options. The most dealt stock option was British Gas at 2,224 lots with the FT-SE 100 option at 8,090.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Night of the big gamble: The competition implications of today's UK lottery draw The millions who sit down in front of their television screens tonight to watch the first draw in Britain's new national lottery will not be the only ones quivering with tension. Football pools operators, bingo hall proprietors, betting shop owners and managers of other gambling concerns are deeply apprehensive about the damage their businesses could suffer as a result of competition from the lottery. On Monday, they will begin examining their sales figures and assessing the initial impact of a lottery that has sold over 30m tickets in its first week. The gambling industry and leisure analysts are unanimous about which sector will suffer most. Mr Stephen Devany, head of public affairs at Ladbroke, which owns casinos, the Vernons pools operation and 1,950 betting shops, says: 'The pools give us the greatest concern.' Mr Devany says the pools and the lottery are similar attractions: both involve choosing numbers. While the pools are based on the outcome of football results, few entrants think about the results of matches. Mr Devany says that 90 per cent of pools players choose the same numbers every week. There has been some cheer for pools operators in the run-up to the lottery's launch. Legislation affecting the pools has been changed to allow them to compete more effectively: The minimum age for pools players has been lowered from 18 to 16. Pools coupons can now be distributed through betting shops. Coupons can also be distributed through retail outlets (while this went on in the past, the law was unclear on whether it was actually allowed). Under certain circumstances, the pools can roll over their unwon prizes from week to week to build up a bigger jackpot. Mr Devany says: 'We suspect the business will decline, but our job is to make the decline the slowest possible.' Mr Simon Johnson, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, believes that view is optimistic. The decline of the pools 'is likely to be terminal', he says. Pools players tend to be over 45 and are more likely to be men than women, Mr Johnson says. While existing participants might continue to fill in their coupons, younger people will find the lottery more attractive, he says. As older pools players die, they are unlikely to be replaced. Mr Johnson believes, however, that casinos will not be significantly affected by the lottery. A visit to a casino is a social event - and a relatively expensive one. The Pounds 1 required for a lottery ticket is unlikely to deflect a serious gambler from visiting a casino. Mr John Garrett, managing director of the Rank Organisation's recreation division, which includes its casino operations, goes along with this view but has been running some special promotions anyway to try to keep regular customers' loyalty. Members visiting Rank casinos have been asked to put their business cards into a barrel. Tonight, cards will be picked out and winners will receive prizes of up to Pounds 500 worth of national lottery tickets. Of greater concern to Mr Garrett is the effect of the lottery on Rank's bingo halls. Rank's research revealed that about 9 per cent of its bingo players thought they might need to divert some of their spending from bingo to the lottery. Mr Garrett says that, in limiting the damage, his most important task is to maintain the loyalty of his regular customers. In particular, he wants to make sure they turn up at the bingo halls tonight rather than staying home to watch the lottery draw. The winning lottery numbers will be announced in Rank's bingo halls as soon as they are available. Some bingo halls will have television screens showing the draw live. Rank has also been giving customers its own version of the national lottery card, with six numbers chosen for them. If their numbers match those drawn by the national lottery tonight, they will win a prize of Pounds 100,000. The amount seems tiny compared with the forecast lottery jackpot tonight of Pounds 6m, but Mr Garrett says: 'If my punters win Pounds 100,000, they will be over the moon.' Mr Johnson says he expects betting shop businesses to be damaged in the early days of the lottery, but predicts that they will recover. He thinks some industry estimates of a 5 per cent fall in turnover are unduly pessimistic. A relaxation of betting shop restrictions should help to minimise the impact, says Mr Devany. Betting shops are now allowed to remain open on summer evenings. From the beginning of next year, they will be permitted to have clear street-front windows, allowing passers-by to see the inside of the shops. There will also be 12 days of Sunday racing next year. Opinion over the effect of the lottery on amusement machines is divided. While leisure analysts and machine owners say there is likely to be some fall in business, they are putting their faith in a hard core of machine gamblers who, they believe, are unlikely to change their habits. Mr Garrett says Rank has been counting the customers going into its amusement machine centres this week and there does not appear to be any fall in numbers. He will only know next week, however, whether they have been feeding fewer coins into the mach-ines. While gambling businesses remain uncertain over the precise impact of the lottery, they are unanimous on one point: the relaxation of the restrictions on their industry does not go far enough. The philosophy underlying UK gambling legislation is that operators must not stimulate demand. This means, for example, that betting shops cannot be listed in the telephone directory. Bingo companies can advertise, but the advertisement may not carry the address of a bingo hall. Pools companies can advertise in newspapers and magazines, but not on television or radio. Leisure operators argue that the advent of the lottery has made nonsense of the notion that people should not be encouraged to gamble. They say that the government, as sponsor of the national lottery, has become the biggest promoter of gambling, backed by a huge advertising campaign. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, acknowledged the force of some of these grievances last week in a speech to the British Casino Association. He said the ban on casino and betting shop advertising would be reconsidered. The maximum number of jackpot machines would be increased in casinos, bingo halls and members' clubs. As they await tonight's draw, the gambling industries console themselves with one thought: there will be millions more lottery losers tonight than winners. They hope it will not be long before they can begin filling the bingo halls, casinos and amusement arcades with disillusioned lottery punters.</p>

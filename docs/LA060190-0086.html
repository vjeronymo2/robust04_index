			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MURDER BY NATURAL CAUSES' HAS CLEVER PREMISE, BUT TV-LIKE SCRIPT  </P> <P> The good news about the Huntington Beach Playhouse's production of Tim Kelly's  "Murder by Natural Causes" is that it's a sleek show, elegantly mounted and  staged with a sure hand by Geoffrey Gread. The bad news is that it's a TV  script that plays like a TV script; all the action is in the final 20 minutes  after the last commercial break.  </P> <P> The premise is clever but all in the head: A rich and famous mentalist has a  greedy, attractive and much younger wife who wants to do him in. The entire  plot revolves around the question of whether the scheming wife can outwit her  old man, an overworked fake who gets his psychic info from a private detective.  It seems as if he is no match for her -- or is he?  </P> <P> Act I is a plodding exposition that cries out for close-ups and visits to the  refrigerator. If there were any real sexual energy between the schemers --  Nancy Kernick as the wife and Gary Kernick as her lover -- the whole thing  would move more breathlessly. Instead, we get to see Gary Kernick suddenly  stripped to his black bikini undershorts, an event so shocking and out-of-place  that it garnered the most vocal audience reaction of the night, a loud "Well,  well, well!"  </P> <P> The first two-thirds of the play relies heavily upon the charm of the leading  lady, but Nancy Kernick has left charm completely out of her performance. She  plays the would-be murderess and seductress extraordinaire with a flat grin and  a swagger.  </P> <P> The last third picks up partly because of the plot twists piling together, and  partly because of Joshua Kaye's portrayal of the mentalist. He hands in a  comparatively rich performance as a man with plenty of cards still up his  sleeve.  </P> <P> The supporting players are uniformly good and very well cast. Gread is a  director who shows promise. But "Murder by Natural Causes" is a script only for  viewers who are too tired to turn off the boob-tube and read a real murder  mystery.  </P> <P> 'MURDER BY NATURAL CAUSES'  </P> <P> A Huntington Beach Playhouse's production of Tim Kelly's murder mystery.

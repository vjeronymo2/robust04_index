			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Portillo consolidates EU attack Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, yesterday consolidated his attack on the European Union's social chapter provisions, saying that he would resist any directives from Brussels that reduced employment in the UK. As the Labour party launched a new broadside against the government for refusing to direct UK economic development Mr Portillo said that the only way to create jobs was by promoting low inflation and a prosperous economic climate. Answering Commons questions for the first time since he assumed the employment portfolio Mr Portillo told MPs: 'I want to make sure we do not destroy jobs in Britain. I am not prepared to have imposed upon Britain costs on employers which make them less likely to take people on.' Mr Portillo's attack came as the Labour party criticised the Department of Environment's urban regeneration programme, saying that plans to promote local enterprise were turning into a 'smokescreen for cuts' in public spending. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, said the amount of money being allocated for the Single Regeneration Budget amounted to less than a quarter of the size of bids made by local authorities and Training and Enterprise Councils to obtain money under the scheme. He said that the total allocation for the budget, amounting to Pounds 100m, had been dwarfed by the overall cuts in funding for urban regeneration over the next two years, amounting to about Pounds 200m. Mr Straw said that 469 bids - worth more than Pounds 375m - had been made for SRB grants in the next financial year. 'Despite its high profile launch earlier this year it is now clear that the SRB is a gameshow with high entrance fees but very few winners.' He said that millions of pounds had been wasted in the preparation of bids. Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, also joined in the attack on the government's industrial policies, pledging Labour's active promotion of information and communications technologies. He said that Britain had to respond to the revolution in information technology if it was to compete in the global economy. He said: 'The white heat of technology in the 1960s has been replaced by the white light of technology in the 1990s.'</p>

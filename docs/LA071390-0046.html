			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'QUICK CHANGE' MAKES FOR A GIDDY GETAWAY  </P> <P> The light comic wit of "Quick Change" (citywide) has a lovely premise: a trio  of disillusioned New Yorkers, Grimm (Bill Murray), a city planner; his  sweetheart Phyllis (Geena Davis) and Grimm's goofy, longtime friend and  liability, Loomis (Randy Quaid), execute a brilliantly clever bank holdup,  exiting with $1 million. Now all they have to do to be home free is get out of  the city of New York, an urban obstacle course of unmarked streets, wayward  freeway entrances and unfriendly natives.  </P> <P> New Yorkers are chuckling already, the know-it-alls. But you don't need to live  there to spot the pitfalls in the trio's starkly simple plan. The comedy of  "Quick Change" is city-dweller humor, honed to a fine edge and site-specific to  New York because the Big Apple is more or less on its knees, civility-wise. All  it needs is a lethally funny comedy like this to give it the coup de grace.  </P> <P> In love with each other and unable to take Manhattan -- any more in any form --  Grimm and Phyllis are decamping for reasons the movie makes abundantly clear:  New York is a city gone a little bonkers. English-speaking cabbies are a  memory; middle-class, multiple-burglary victims carry handguns the way others  pack Tic-Tacs, and the best way to bum out the crowd swarming toward an  accident scene is to announce that the victim might just live.  </P> <P> With "Quick Change," screenwriter Howard Franklin and co-producer/star Bill  Murray make their joint -- and auspicious -- debuts as directors. They excel at  deadpan vignettes of the city, like the early scene when news of the ongoing  bank robbery almost causes a collision between arriving SWAT units and arriving  hot-dog push-carters, each jockeying for the commanding position. They also get  nearly excruciating suspense from the correct-change-for-the-bus routine or the  dithering frenzy of waiting behind a $100 customer at a mom-and-pop grocery  store. "Quick Change," as well as Jay Cronley's very funny novel on which  Franklin based his script, is full of snapshots like this. (It's eerie how  close Franklin has stuck to Cronley's throw-away timing and sardonic humor  while actually straying far from the novel's story line.) Then, just when we  think we've got the movie's sardonic rhythms down pat, the filmmakers throw a  little curve -- tongue-in-cheek reference to Tennessee Williams or Garcia Lorca  or a surreal episode like the barrio jousters -- which lifts the material up,  up and away beyond the expected.  </P> <P> Actually, "Quick Change," which has been edited to whip by in record time,  could use even more of these singular diversions; they're like the pure comic  side of "After Hours' " semi-sinister Manhattan nightmares. Literate humor is  at a premium and these actors, including Jason Robards' world-weary,  underplayed police chief, are so intoxicatingly expert that it's almost sinful  to have their film over as soon as it is. As their orderly exit plan crumbles  around them, the unflappable Grimm becomes almost fiendishly good at bluffing  their way out of mortal danger. Phyllis, on the other hand, has no stomach for  such cliffhangers; her huge eyes get even bigger as she begins to envision the  man she loves as a born desperado who has simply bloomed late. Ricocheting  between them both is Randy Quaid's Loomis, whose hysteria bloomed early and  surfaces often. However, considering that in the movie's last third Quaid is  one of the walking wounded, dragging himself along like some comic parody of  "The Night of the Living Dead," his panic is understandable.  </P> <P> At any rate, all three are offbeat and wonderful characters in a movie whose  visual and physical gags -- some of them as old as silent movies -- are as  sharp as its dialogue, and whose cumulative effect is as achingly funny as "A  Fish Called Wanda." At the same time, the humor doesn't have a smug or an  inside feel to it, like the overflowing in-jokey references of "Gremlins 2."  </P> <P> Produced by longtime Woody Allen cohort and Manhattan authority Robert  Greenhut, richly photographed by Michael Chapman with succinct editing by Alan  Heim, "Quick Change" (rated R for language) has a slyly understanding  supporting cast, beginning with the garrulous bank guard played by Bob and  Ray's Bob Elliott, Jack Gilpin's hateful yuppie hostage, Philip Bosco's  punctilious bus driver, and Tony Shalhoub's monumentally funny cab driver, who  very nearly turns himself inside out in an effort to make himself understood by  an uncomprehending world.  </P> <P> The film is dedicated to a longtime associate of Francois Truffaut, the late  Helen Scott, who first brought the book to the filmmakers' attention. And so a  cinematic lineage continues, tangibly and with bright results.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'QUICK CHANGE'  </P> <P> A Warner Bros. release of a Devoted production.

According to the official, experts have appraised various  geological structures of 18 blocks in the northern Tarim basin  and 19 geological formations which could be oil-bearing.    He said that since the late 1960s, geologists have been  wondering whether there are oil deposits in China's paleozoic  marine strata. But this question has been resolved with  discovery in the past nine years of 14 oil and natural gas  fields in the Tarim basin.    In the East China Sea, too, high-yield wells began to work,  with a single well yielding a daily output of up to 650 cubic  meters of crude oil and some 227,000 cubic meters of natural gas.    Geologists found six promising geological formations during  a  geophysical investigation in the South China Sea. Well-drilling  will start next year, according to the official.    In Tibet's Yangbajain area abounding in geothermal water  resources, China found its hottest well with a top temperature  of 262.03 degrees centigrade at its deepest point. At present,  the yangbajain geothermal power station provides Lhasa, capital  of Tibet, with 40 percent of its electricity supply.    For mineral prospecting, the official disclosed, 89 key  mineral deposits have been discovered and some 20 minerals'  reserves have proved much greater than expected, including  manganese, copper, bauxite, gold and silver.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Bulls, bombs, Brussels: Patrick de Jacquelot gives an outsider's view on the City of London Is something wrong with the City of London? After successful modernisation at the end of the 1980s, which put it firmly among the world's three leading financial centres, along with New York and Tokyo, London has faced several serious problems in the past few years. Thanks to its strengths, the City does not seem to have been undermined by these difficulties. But various dangers, mostly linked to the role of the UK in Europe, lie ahead. For a French financial journalist being assigned to London in 1990, there was no doubt that here was a remarkable success story: a truly international financial centre with a significant share of the market in cross-border dealings and a record number of foreign banks. London was the obvious model for continental centres such as Paris, wishing to modernise themselves. Technical difficulties, lack of professionalism or even dishonest practices were not thought to be a problem in the financial capital of Europe. And yet, in the past four years, important City institutions have been hit by setbacks. Lloyd's, the insurance market, has seen huge losses; the Stock Exchange's Taurus settlement project collapsed; the pound was forced out of Europe's exchange rate mechanism; the Bank of England was slow to close down BCCI. Financial scandals involving Robert Maxwell and Polly Peck tarnished some banks, auditors and regulators. In addition, the City had to contend with an IRA security problem. After such blows, its reputation is no longer at its highest. London has shown it is as accident prone as everybody else and has suffered to some extent from its own success. Financial scandals happen everywhere but are all the more shocking in a market supposed to be an example for the rest of the world. At its darkest hour, in 1992, it looked as if the future was bleak indeed. But two years later, the role of London as a leading financial centre has not been substantially weakened. A striking factor for the foreign observer is the way the City reacted. Lloyd's is undergoing radical reform, as in a less conspicuous manner is the Bank of England. The Maxwell scandal led to an overhaul of the pensions system and the Square Mile is now ring-fenced against terrorism. According to Robert Amzallag, managing director of Banque Nationale de Paris in London and chairman of the Foreign Bank Association in Britain, those who lead the City 'are watching very closely for any emerging problem. They have no long-term plan, but they react quickly when necessary'. How does the City view itself? Its assets, of course, are still here. The English language makes London the natural home in Europe for American and Japanese institutions. 'London has the labour supply, markets already established with excellent liquidity, and supporting services like law and accounting,' says Professor Richard Brealey, who is leading the City Research Project, a study of London as a financial centre by the London Business School for the Corporation of London. Foreign banks share this view. According to Peter Letley, deputy chairman of HSBC Investment Banking Group which recently moved to London, 'the level of expertise available here is wider and greater than in any other European market'. At the end of the day, says Rupert Pennant-Rea, deputy-governor of the Bank of England, it is the capacity of London to 'accommodate innovation' that was and will be the main factor in its success. While the City is convinced it has overcome the hurdles of the early 1990s, some concerns are acknowledged. 'London only needs a major regulatory mistake for business to move elsewhere,' warns Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of BZW, the investment banking arms of Barclays bank. Many in the City feel that the biggest danger comes from Brussels. 'The drive of the European Commission to harmonise is a danger to us because our dealings are much more complex than on the continent,' says Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman of the investment firm Cragnotti and Partners, who chairs the City Research Project. A European problem the City does not take seriously is the threat to its eminence from Frankfurt or Paris. Michael Lawrence, chief executive of the Stock Exchange, is clear that these two markets have an important role to play at the 'regional' level, but London will remain the only international centre. With such self-confidence in the City, the foreign observer is occasionally irritated by a whiff of complacency. The Lord Mayor of London, Sir Paul Newall, recently spoke disdainfully of 'the political decision to locate 300 bureaucrats and regulators' in Frankfurt, referring to the creation of the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of a European central bank. His stance sits uneasily with the efforts deployed by the corporation and the UK government to bring the EMI to London. The main development which could jeopardise the City would be the creation of a single European currency without the UK. The choice of Frankfurt for the EMI 'is a threat. There are foreign banks here because we are part of Europe,' says Sir Brian Pearse, former chief executive of Midland Bank. 'If Britain is marginalised in Europe, things can change. The American and Japanese banks could not afford not to be in Frankfurt.' Were a single European currency to exclude the UK, there would not be an instant exodus from the City, but the main firms would have to reconsider their position. Whatever efforts were deployed to address the problems, the City might still see its role as Europe's financial capital endangered by a marginalisation of the UK in the European Union. Sooner or later, Britain will have to decide whether it goes along with the building of an 'ever closer union'. Unless it can, the unique achievement of the City in becoming a truly international financial centre could still be the victim of politics.

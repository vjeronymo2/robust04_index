			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Mohamed 'Abd-al-'Aziz by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr.  President, recently you attended the Madrid seminar on peace in  the Western Sahara and you called for an international seminar  on Western Sahara. The question being raised, Mr. President,  is: What are your views on the international support for this  proposal, the holding of an international seminar on Western  Sahara? Do you see this peace seminar as an alternative to or  as an option for the peace plan, or both?    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] I would like to thank Algerian national  radio's Channel 1 for following up the Saharan process to  achieve freedom, self-determination, and national independence  for the Saharan people. [passage omitted]    The past 21 years were characterized by war and escalation,  sometimes with the Spanish and other times with the parties to  the Madrid Agreement, and sometimes with the Moroccan  Government. This period was also characterized by attempts to  achieve a settlement sometimes by direct dialogue and sometimes  by dialogue through international organizations.    Since the latest development in 1988, an agreement was  reached on what has become known as the international UN peace  plan on Western Sahara. This peace plan aims at organizing a  free and democratic referendum for the Saharan people through  which they could express their wishes regarding their destiny.    The referendum will be organized and supervised by the  United  Nations and the Organization of African Unity. It will ask the  Saharan people whether they want independence or whether they  want to join the Moroccan kingdom. The voters were defined  according to the Spanish census of 1974. [passage omitted]    Optimism prevailed in the region and the world. Everybody  believed that everything was moving forward and that the UN plan  would have a happy ending at the beginning of 1992.    However, at that time the Moroccan Government backed down on  its commitments and tried, by all means, to hinder the holding  of a referendum on the Saharan people's self-determination. The  main obstacle erected by the Moroccan Government was an attempt  to impose on the Spanish census figures more than 170,000  Moroccans as additional voters. Thus, the Moroccan Government  tried to rig the referendum by replacing Saharans with Moroccans  in the referendum in order to guarantee that the result would be  in its favor and to impose a de facto situation for the  occupation of the Western Sahara.    Since 1992 the United Nations and we have been trying to  overcome the obstacles placed by the Moroccan Government.  Undoubtedly, everybody knows that without the compromises put  forward by Polisario in order to attain peace and the sacrifices  we endured, the UN peace plan would have not been completed and  the issue would have not advanced.    Everybody knows that for the sake of peace and a peaceful  settlement we have accepted that an occupied people will be  asked whether they want to be independent or to join the  occupying country. It is usual to ask one question: Do you want  independence or not?    Everybody knows that we have accepted that the referendum  will be held with the presence of 65,000 Moroccan soldiers in  the Western Sahara. Everybody knows that the referendum may be  held with the presence of the Moroccan administration, the  Moroccan police, and Moroccan settlers. Everybody also knows  that this war machine, which has been forced by Morocco on the  Western Sahara since 1975, will not be neutral during the  election campaign or during the self-determination referendum.  On the contrary, the entire war machine will be mobilized to  confront and pressure the Saharan people during the referendum.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, you mentioned that the  Saharan  side has made compromises so that the UN peace plan can be  implemented in the Western Sahara. The problem which will arise  when the UN peace plan is implemented is the question of voters.  Has the question of the voters been resolved yet and is it the  only obstacle in the implementation of the peace plan?    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] No, the issue has not been resolved. The  peace plan states that the Spanish census is to be the basis for  vote counting. The Moroccan Government wants to add to the  Spanish census 170,000 Moroccans who have nothing to do with the  Spanish census or with the Western Sahara. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Will there be a compromise between the  Sahara's 1974 census and the Moroccan census?    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The UN secretary-general presented a  so-called compromise, which consists of five criteria, described  as identification criteria. We have no problem with three of  them because they are linked with the Spanish census. But we  have expressed reservations over two of these criteria because  they are the criteria of clan affiliation and of verbal  testimony. If we adopt these criteria we will allow the  Moroccan Government to bring in people as it wishes.  Subsequently, these two criteria would allow the entire Arab  Maghreb population or the entire Arab Maghreb to participate in  this referendum if we adopted these criteria.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, can we go back to the point  mentioned earlier. You attended the Madrid seminar on peace and  called for an international conference on Western Sahara. Do  you have high hopes for this international conference? How do  you view international support for holding such a seminar? How  do you see the the UN peace plan?    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] [passage omitted] In our view, an  international seminar at this time and with those parties could  overcome the obstacles confronting the peace process. The  seminar could be a framework for dialogue to find a solution for  the problems hindering implementation of the peace plan.    Therefore, as far as we are concerned, the seminar is not an  alternative to the peace plan, rather it would facilitate  implementation of the peace plan in an attempt to find a  solution to the problems confronting it.    We have high hopes that the seminar, the initiative, and the  call will be received positively by the various parties  interested in peace in the Western Sahara.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, the United Nations suggested  three options for settling the Saharan issue. Since then,  nothing new has appeared on the implementation of these three  options. What is your position on the three options, and what  do see as an alternative to them?    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The question of the options was not that of  a  Security Council resolution, but that of a report which the [UN]  secretary-general submitted last March to the Security Council  which included these three options. In the end, the Security  Council chose the middle option, and this is the Security  Council's resolution. This option became clear in that the  identification commission should start its fieldwork for  registering and sorting the voters in the field and submit its  findings to the Security Council in the middle of next July.    Some sort of progress has been achieved, and we hope it will  develop. We welcomed the commission and started cooperating  with it in the field. It opened its offices in the refugee  camps; it also opened offices in the occupied territories; it  opened offices in neighboring countries and started the  registration. We shall submit to the identification commission  on 15 May [as heard] the applications on which the voters' names  and their identities are recorded. It is expected that this  will end at the beginning of June when the identification  commission starts its work, that is, the commission, the two  parties to the conflict, the OAU, and the two observer countries  -- Algeria and Mauritania. Delegations will be formed from all  these sides, and will receive the individuals to determine their  identity, starting from the applications which we would have  submitted on 15 May.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, are we to understand that  there is progress in connection with determining the identity of  the voters, and that the time is close for deciding on this  issue?    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Yes, we have encouraged the commission,  which  started its work. This is considered as a new element in the  development of the issue in the field. We shall judge the  commission's work, its impartiality, and its ability to resolve  an existing political problem through technical work between now  and the end of its work. In fact, the information available to  us is that the commission is now facing problems with the  Moroccan Government and that the Moroccan Government is  maneuvering over the commission's work and exercising pressure  on the commission. We hope that progress will be achieved to  bring closer the referendum date through the work which the  commission is now carrying out.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, you said a short while ago  that the Moroccan Government is exerting pressure. There is  another kind of pressure which is even worse and which is  manifested by the fact that Morocco recently redrew the  administrative borders of some Saharan areas and started to  sieze more territory and installed governors in these areas.  How do you view these developments, which will, of course,  hinder the course of peace? Do they mean that Morocco, at least  at this stage, does not want peace?    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] In fact, all the stands and actions taken by  the Moroccan Government since the adoption of the international  peace plan contradict the text and the spirit of the UN peace  plan. In addition to what I mentioned regarding Morocco adding  further lists of Moroccans and its attempts to impose those  lists on the United Nations, there are other acts such as the  organizing [by Morocco] of legislative and local elections in  Western Sahara, the administrative division introduced in  Western Sahara by the Moroccan Government at the beginning of  this year, and the appointment of Moroccan governors in Saharan  regions. This is all happening while the Moroccan Government is  required to facilitate the organizing of the referendum on  self-determination for the Saharan people to decide on the final  destiny of the Western Sahara.    All these acts demonstrate that the Kingdom of Morocco so  far  does not have the political will for a just and permanent  peaceful settlement based on the right of the Saharan people to  self-determination in accordance with international legitimacy  and the UN and OAU resolutions. Furthermore, the Moroccan  Government tries to take advantage of the regional and  international circumstances in order to evade its obligations  and what it agreed to in 1991 in connection with the organizing  of a free and democratic self-determination referendum for the  Saharan people.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, these actions by Morocco and  its lack of political will for a settlement of the Saharan  problem have caused some Saharan officials to waver between  optimism and pessimism, some even went so far as to state that  they expect the war to break out again in the Western Sahara.  How do you view this?    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Of course, as I said, we will do our best  not to lose the chance of peace and to see that the UN peace  plan -- which is, in fact, a gain for the people of this region  including the Moroccan people -- is not destroyed and lost. We  are trying to make the peace plan achieve the goal of organizing  a referendum in Western Sahara.    Of course, we are not on our own; there is the other party,  and if there is a common will to achieve this goal, things will  improve and progress will be made. But if our will for peace  faces a Moroccan will trying to impose the status quo of  occupation on Western Sahara, our will for peace will definitely  fail and we will be forced into another status quo, that is,  going back to war and struggle.    Of course we want peace, a peace needed by the Saharan  people, the Moroccan people, and the people of the region. The  modern world calls for peace and direct dialogue between the  parties to conflicts everywhere in the world, and we are  following this style and this course, but our will for peace and  for a free and democratic dialogue in order to reach a solution  based on respect for our people's desire for freedom and  independence is equal to nothing else apart from our readiness  to defend our legitimate national rights to freedom and  self-determination. If we are forced into war again, we will be  ready to fight it.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, you said a short while ago  that the Saharan officials are working for peace. This is  proved by the actions of the Saharan officials, led by your  excellency, such as the recent visit to Washington where you met  with American officials. We know that the United States is a  member of the Security Council and, as a superpower, has a say  in the Saharan issue. How did you find the American officials?  What do they think and what is their stand regarding the  Saharan issue?    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] It is undoubtedly clear to all that the  Saharan issue was not well-known at international level.  Furthermore, the Americans listened for a long time only to the  Moroccan thesis and argument. However, we noticed that since  ratification of the international peace plan [as heard], the  U.S. stand has become positive on the whole. The United States  will continue (?financing) the international peace plan. The  United States did not hesitate to send its officers, soldiers,  and officials to Western Saharan at the request of the United  Nations.    During our visit to the United States, our interlocutors at  the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Administration,  and all groups with which we had talks showed a considerable  level of understanding, particularly when [they realize that]  the Saharan request consists in holding a free and democratic  referendum through which the Saharan people will say what they  want. We found that the Americans were sensitive to this issue  and that they well understand our ideas and our request. We can  truly say that on the whole the American stand is positive.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, one last question. In light  of the facts, the new developments, and the current  international situation, and according to the information you  have about the peace process in Western Sahara, can we say that  the settlement of the Saharan problem is going to happen soon or  not?    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] My wish is that it will happen soon. As far  as we are concerned, we must start action on the ground to hold  the referendum as soon as possible. I think that this is the  wish of the international community, too. The means appropriate  to carrying out the referendum has been created, but the  Moroccan stand expressed on all occasions and on the ground does  not augur well. So far, any actions and any constructive  initiatives aimed at proceeding forward on the path of  implementing the peace plan and holding the referendum have been  met with the conspiracies of the Moroccan Government and its  attempts to make initiatives fail. It led to the failure of the  Elayoune meeting to settle pending issues, and the New York  meeting. All of these initiatives were thwarted by the Moroccan  Government. Even now, we still doubt the Moroccan Government's  desire for peace and its respect for international law. The  Moroccan position leaves us doubting that the referendum will  take place very soon. Therefore, we are cautious in our  dealings; sometimes we make fresh initiatives and other times we  accept compromises. But we have not seen anything in the  Moroccan position which is encouraging, nor have we felt that  there is a sincere intention on its part.    Therefore, seizing the opportunity offered by this  interviewed with your radio station, I would like to address the  world community with an urgent appeal to all peace- and  freedom-loving people to bring the necessary pressure to bear on  the Moroccan Government to comply with international laws and to  implement its commitment under the peace plan on the Saharan  people's self-determination.</p>

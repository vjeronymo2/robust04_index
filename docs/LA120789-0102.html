			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR MAYOR TODAY  </P> <P> Memorial services will be at 4 p.m. today at Claremont Presbyterian Church for  Mayor Alex Hughes.  </P> <P> Hughes, who had served on the City Council since 1986 and as mayor since last  April, died early Monday, apparently of a heart attack. He was at his home when  he became ill, and was taken to Pomona Valley Community Hospital. He was 52.  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem Nick Presecan will assume mayoral responsibilities. The City  Council must decide whether to appoint someone to serve out Hughes' term or  leave the seat empty until April, city officials said.  </P> <P> "He was an exceptional human being and . . . an outstanding public servant,"  City Manager Glenn D. Southard said.  </P> <P> "Alex had extreme passion for all people. He would listen. He had integrity.  That's what people expect in an elected official. He was really top flight,"  Southard said.  </P> <P> Hughes was associate superintendent of Claremont schools, having served the  district since 1966, when he was appointed assistant principal of Claremont  High School. He was principal in 1968-75, then was appointed assistant  superintendent of the school system. He was promoted to associate  superintendent this year.  </P> <P> Dr. Tom Peeler, Claremont superintendent, said Hughes "was a highly unique  person who was involved with the city and a real leader in the school  district."  </P> <P> Southard said Hughes contributed to the schools by maintaining outstanding  early relationships between the city and the district. As a result, the city  and the district have sponsored several programs together, he said.  </P> <P> "He gave and gave until there wasn't anything left to give," said Councilwoman  Diann Ring, who was elected with Hughes. "He used to play Santa Claus at the  schools and at Christmas parties. I saw him last Saturday in his suit."  </P> <P> During the 23 years he lived in Claremont, Hughes was a member of the Rotary  Club, ruling elder of Claremont Presbyterian Church and was on the board of  directors of the Services Center for Independent Living.  </P> <P> Hughes was born in Cleveland. He attended the University of Southern California  and received bachelor's and master's degrees in education.  </P> <P> Hughes is survived by Anita Gaffron Hughes, his wife of 24 years, and three  children: John, 22, Kelly, 19, and James, 12.  </P> <P> In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the Services Center for  Independent Living, 480 S. Indian Hill Blvd.; Claremont Presbyterian Church,  1111 N. Mountain Ave., or the American Red Cross, Claremont Chapter, 2065 N.  Indian Hill Blvd.  </P></p>

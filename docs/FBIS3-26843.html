			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Macroeconomic Group of the CPPCC Economic </F> Committee: "Judgment and Proposal Regarding Current  Macroeconomics"]    [Text] China has achieved conspicuous achievements in its  reform, opening up, and socialist construction over the past  year, of which the successes in two aspects are especially  appreciated by domestic and foreign media. 1) The marked  progress made in the process of the economic market as a whole,  and a major step has been or will be taken in reforming finance  and taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade, state  enterprises, and other essential fields in light of the  "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Questions  Regarding Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy System,"  which indicates that China's reform has entered the stage of  overall advance; 2) The resolute macroeconomic regulation and  control measures, focused on economic means, adopted by the  central government in late June, which quickly turned out  positive results. If the central government had not adopted  resolute measures at that time, the economy could not have been  so stable, and reform, opening up, and development could not  have turned out such major achievements.    Practice has proved that both giving full play to the role  of  the market mechanism, and strengthening and improving  macroeconomic regulation and control are the essential and  indispensable components of a market economy system. A view of  the market economy system of all countries shows that its basic  framework includes a perfect market system, as well as a  macroeconomic regulation and control system. This also should  be the case of a socialist market economy system.    One of the basic experiences of China's economic reform is  to  constantly promote economic development through gradual reforms,  and to create conditions for further reform so that economic  development and deepened reform will push each other forward.  Practice has proved that the degree of market advance must  correspond with the capacity of macroeconomic regulation and  control. The faster the pace of market advance, the more  effective the macroeconomic braking mechanism will have to be.  The intense reform, rapid economic growth, and readjustment of  the interests structure and economic relations are bound to be  followed by more contradictions and frictions, resulting in all  kinds of unexpected outcomes. The task of macroeconomic  regulation and control is to discover the new contradictions and  problems promptly, and to adopt measures to resolve them. When  such "microscopic regulation" is introduced frequently, it will  avoid further aggravation of the problems and contradictions.  As the extent of "microscopic regulation" is limited, the shock  and loss incurred also will be relatively limited. If the  problems are not discovered and resolved promptly by immediately  adopting the method of "microscopic regulation," but are left  until they pile up and reach an extent that must be resolved,  the scope of regulation and control inevitably will be broad.  We then will be forced to slam on the brakes. Consequently,  the shock and loss incurred will be greater. Therefore, the  prediction of macroeconomic regulation and control is  particularly important. It is necessary to take precautions  against problems that might crop up in every stage of reform and  development, including problems related to stagflation, and to  adopt effective means and measures to prevent and resolve them  promptly. Under the conditions of developing a socialist market  economy, macroeconomic regulation and control should be focused  on economic means, which include interest rates, tax rates, and  other means of indirect control. However, the necessary  administrative means must not be forsaken. At a time when  change is being effected in the economic system, the problems  arising from the administrative behavior of the government  departments at all levels should be resolved by adopting  necessary administrative means. The Decision of the CPC Central  Committee on Economic Structural Reform has defined clearly that  the powers and responsibilities of macroeconomic regulation and  control lie with the center because only the central authorities  can make overall judgments and decisions on such issues as the  nationwide supply of currency. In this regard, the localities  should be subordinate to the center, and the part should be  subordinate to the whole -- not vice versa.    Under the favorable domestic and international environment,  China's economic growth must be rapid and not slow. However, we  should take note of economic stability and coordinated  development. It should be noted that the greatest danger of high  economic growth is inflation. Hence, there should be a limit to  the high growth, which should not lead to serious inflation or  social instability. If there is inflation, it will be impossible  for rapid economic growth to continue. We must be aware that  the danger of aggravated inflation still exists. The 1993  retail price index rose by around 13 percent over that in 1992,  and there is still great pressure on 1994 prices. Curbing  inflation now has become a matter of concern for people at home  and abroad. It is also an important condition for ensuring  social stability and the smooth progress of reform and opening  up. Excessive investment is the main factor triggering  inflation. The great demand for investment, which exceeds the  national strength, must be backed by the excessive issuance of  currency, which will stimulate inflation. Fixed-asset  investment in 1993 rose by around 47 percent over 1992, of which  investment by state units rose 58 percent, the largest scale of  investment in the 1980's. All localities now have great demand  for investment and for developing new projects. Unless  effective measures are adopted to check this trend, the 1994  scale of fixed-asset investment will continue to increase, which  will further aggravate inflation. To curb excessive growth in  fixed-asset investment, it is necessary to adopt correct  monetary policies, have the currency supply under control, issue  currency as little as possible, and strictly approve the loans  granted for fixed-asset investment. We have learned the lesson  of fluctuations on several occasions in the past. To avoid  drastic falls, it is necessary first to guard against great  rises. We must avoid another overheated economy, which may  force us to adopt stern measures. Work in all fields should be  focused on optimizing the structure and increasing efficiency,  rather than on one-sidedly pursuing growth in output value and  blindly expanding the scale of construction. In the new year,  we must pay special attention to agriculture, and under no  circumstances should we develop secondary and tertiary  industries at the expense of agriculture.    Experience tells us that deepened reform requires a spacious  environment. To attain this point, the scale of economic growth  and investment should be appropriate. The economy will continue  to grow at a rapid pace in 1994, and so will the total  investment in construction. This is definite, but  appropriateness is very important. Only by setting the growth  at a practical level and keeping investment growth strictly  under control can we ensure that the entire economic environment  will not be too tight and that all reforms will proceed  profoundly. When a good job is done in reform, the established  stimulative and restraining mechanisms will promote the  optimization of resources, reduce losses, and genuinely attain  the objective of better efficiency and intensive operation.    In the 1990's and in the entire process of attaining the  socialist modernization program, we must handle properly the  relationship between reform, development, and stability. Reform  is the motive force, while development is the target and  stability is the premise. Only by doing a good job in reform  and development can there be a solid foundation for stability.  Without a stable political and social environment, however, it  will be difficult for reform and development to proceed. For  this reason, we should take social bearing capacity and  stability into account, while proceeding with reform and  development. Reform must promote development, while the latter  must meet the needs of the former.    The target for 1994 national economic and social  development,  which is both grand and feasible, has been proposed. In the  1994 and throughout the 1990's, it will be remarkable to attain  the annual average GNP growth of 8 to 9 percent set out by the  14th CPC Congress. The task of macroeconomic regulation and  control is to attain this goal, and to ensure the rapid, steady,  and coordinated [kuai su wen ding xie tiao 1816 6643 4489 1353  0588 6148] development of the national economy. This is what  the people of the whole country are expecting.</p>

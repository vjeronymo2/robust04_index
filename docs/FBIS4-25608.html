			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Rong (2621 2837)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has given  economic priority to the development of village and township  industry.    Speaking at a recent meeting on exchanging experiences in  village and township industry among Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai,  Hangzhou, and four other cities, Jiang Yiren, vice mayor of  Shanghai in charge of village and township industry, said:  Shanghai's industrial development "will be bolstered by two  factors: the development of Pudong and village and township  industry."    According to statistics, increased output value turned out  by  Shanghai's 15,000 village and township enterprises has exceeded  50 percent of the municipality's annual increased output value  of industry since 1988, reaching 53 percent in 1993, while the  increase of their export trade exceeded 40 percent of the  municipality's increased export trade volume last year.    According to well-informed economists, Shanghai's village  and  township industry, as the "huge reservoir" for major urban  industrial readjustment, should gradually eliminate the  condition of "chimneys in every village," set up small  industrial zones, raise investment returns, and coordinate  development with major industries in a systematic manner.    Shanghai's village and township industry will be highlighted  by an "export-oriented" feature in the second half of the  1990's. By inducing foreign capital and technology and  expanding foreign trade, the municipality will gradually combine  its advantage in suburban labor with imported technology and  capital and foreign trade in forming a "joint force" and  striving to make village and township industrial export trade  constitute at least 30 percent of the municipality's total  export volume within two or three years.</p>

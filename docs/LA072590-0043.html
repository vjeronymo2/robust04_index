			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERNSON ASSAILS SIMI VALLEY VOTE TO SUE OVER PORTER RANCH PROJECT  </P> <P> City Councilman Hal Bernson lashed out at the Simi Valley City Council on  Tuesday for voting to sue Los Angeles over the Porter Ranch development, saying  the council acted rashly and probably will fail in its quest to block the  colossal project.  </P> <P> Bernson said Simi Valley officials should welcome Porter Ranch for the jobs it  will provide, rather than file an expensive lawsuit.  </P> <P> "I'm just surprised that they didn't do a little more homework," said Bernson,  whose district includes Porter Ranch in the western San Fernando Valley. "I  think the City Council acted very rashly. I think they have been duped by the  political opponents of Porter Ranch."  </P> <P> But Simi Valley officials defended the action they took Monday.  </P> <P> "Not to take action because you are too timid or because you're afraid of  losing is not the way to go," said Councilman Glen McAdoo. "When you have right  on your side, you have an obligation to go forward."  </P> <P> The council voted in closed session to sue Los Angeles to halt the Porter Ranch  development. The project, which would include 3,395 residences and 6 million  square feet of commercial space, would be built in Chatsworth, about five miles  east of Simi Valley.  </P> <P> The directors of PRIDE, the homeowners group opposed to Porter Ranch, said they  planned to meet privately Tuesday night with San Francisco attorney Mark  Weinberger to discuss legal strategy, which may involve filing an independent  lawsuit, spokesman Don Worsham said.  </P> <P> Worsham said he was heartened by the council's action. "We applaud and respect  them for doing what is necessary to protect their community."  </P> <P> Simi Valley officials said the project, which would rank with Century City as  one of the largest developments in Los Angeles history, would create tremendous  amounts of smog in the region and turn the Simi Valley Freeway into a parking  lot.  </P> <P> They said that their concerns about these issues were not adequately addressed  in the environmental impact report and, therefore, that they have no choice but  to take legal action.  </P> <P> According to the environmental impact report approved by the Los Angeles City  Council, the development would generate an additional 150,602 vehicle trips per  day in the surrounding area.  </P> <P> Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said the report does not adequately answer  questions about how and when Los Angeles and the developer would compensate for  the added traffic congestion and smog. Simi Valley officials want the project  to be built in phases, with approval of each phase contingent on actual  construction of additional freeway lanes.  </P> <P> Bernson blamed Simi Valley for many of the traffic tie-ups on the freeway.  </P> <P> "A great deal of the traffic on the Simi Valley Freeway is generated by Simi  Valley residents who work in Los Angeles," he said. "They've allowed hundreds  of thousands of homes to be built without jobs and other amenities that the  community needs."  </P> <P> Bernson also suggested that, in the future, Los Angeles may impose an  employment tax against non-city residents.  </P> <P> Simi Valley officials said they do not know how much it will cost to fight the  planned development in court, but they believe it will be considerably less  than the $500,000 some suggested it would cost.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John Schwada contributed to this story.  </P></p>

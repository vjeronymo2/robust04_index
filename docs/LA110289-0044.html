			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: MEAT LOAF RECIPES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VERSATILITY OF LEAN  GROUND BEEF  </P> <P> A report released earlier this year explained that ground beef and whole milk  are responsible for most of the fat in the American diet. They account for  about 9% of the total dietary saturates, according to the National Academy of  Sciences.  </P> <P> Still, ground beef is one of the most popular items in the meat case. It has  remained a staple in the American diet, appearing on dinner tables and in  restaurant menus in the form of hamburgers, meat loaves and in casseroles.  </P> <P> But with careful label reading and sensible meal planning, ground beef can have  a place in a healthy diet. Here are some tips:  </P> <P> The ground beef label will provide the amount of fat present in the ground beef  package. The terms regular, lean, and extra lean refer to the fat content of  the meat: regular, 30%; lean, 23%, and extra lean, about 15%. Fat content also  may be stated as "not less than 75% lean," which means that 75% of the meat is  lean ground beef and the remaining 25% is fat.  </P> <P> Since the fat cannot be removed from ground beef before cookingthorough  draining is recommended. During cooking, higher-fat ground beef (regular) will  lose fat and may end up being similar to cooked lean. The leaner ground beef  loses water during cooking. To further reduce fat content, use half ground  poultry and half ground beef in recipes.  </P> <P> Meat labeled as ground beef should contain only beef and no trimmings from  other meat, although beef from various cuts may be mixed in one grinding. When  leaner cuts are used in grinding, additional fat is added for flavor and  tenderness. Strict fat-watchers should consult the butcher. Use garlic, fresh  herbs, celery seeds or hot pepper sauce for seasoning ground beef, and select  vegetables that are strong in flavor such as mushrooms, peppers, onions,  shallots, chives and leeks to enhance the natural flavor of the meat. Other  distinctive flavoring ingredients include brown sugar, cloves, fresh ginger,  lemon juice and wine.  </P> <P> The following meat loaf recipes take advantage of the versatility of lean  ground beef. Ground poultry has been added to cut down on the fat, but equal  amounts of lean ground meat can be substituted.  </P> <P> MEAT LOAF ITALIANO  </P> <P> 3/4 cup water  </P> <P> 1/3 cup tomato paste  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons vinegar  </P> <P> 3/4 pound lean ground beef  </P> <P> 3/4 pound ground turkey or turkey breakfast sausage  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, chopped  </P> <P> 1 green pepper, chopped  </P> <P> 2 slices bread, crumbled  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons dried basil leaves, crumbled  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced  </P> <P> Combine water, tomato paste and vinegar in small bowl.

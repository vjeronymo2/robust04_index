			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL MAY TURN PARKING CLOCK BACK  </P> <P> A decision to extend the hours on some parking meters until 10 p.m. may be  modified this month because merchants have complained that the new policy is  bad for business.  </P> <P> The City Council decided during a study session this week to prepare a  resolution for the March 26 meeting that would limit parking meter hours to  between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., city traffic engineer Richard M. Edmonston said.  </P> <P> If approved, the change would take effect immediately.  </P> <P> In January, the city extended the meter times from 5 p.m. to either 6 p.m. or  10 p.m. to generate revenue for law enforcement and litter control.  </P> <P> Parking meters earned just over $1 million for Newport Beach last year,  according to Edmonston. There was no study on how much money would have been  generated by extending the time on the meters, he said.  </P></p>

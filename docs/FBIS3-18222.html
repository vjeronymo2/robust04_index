			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The European Union [EU] negotiations have been  completed. We are going over direct to our reporter at the  negotiations headquarters in Brussels.    [Reporter] Well, here in what is called the Charlemagne  building at the EU headquarters in Brussels, confirmation has  come from several EU countries that Sweden has reached an  agreement with the EU in the membership negotiations. There has  been no confirmation from the Swedish side. We have not seen  any Swedes since these reports came out about 15-20 minutes ago.  After a near collapse of the negotiations this morning, Sweden  has returned to the talks and solved the last issues concerning  farming and the budget.    So far there are a few details, very few, and they are that,  as far as the milk quotas -- which have been a big issue -- are  concerned, where Sweden has demanded that it be allowed to  continue to produce 3.1 million tonnes and the EU has said that  you are only allowed to produce 3.5 million tonnes [figures as  heard], the nice compromise of 3.3 million tonnes has been  reached.    As regards the budget solution, that is, how much money  Sweden is to be refunded in other forms so that the budget costs  for Sweden are not so tough in the first few years, it appears  to be roughly of the size spoken of a few days ago, perhaps up  to 4 billion [currency not specified], (?something like that),  but it is fairly uncertain so far.    The confirmation comes from the EU side -- Sweden has  accepted an agreement. Norway has in practice gone home and  will hold negotiations on Monday next week, and on Tuesday the  ministers will return (?in order to) solve the Norwegian  problems. As for Finland and Austria, there may still be  confirmation because Austria is with the Council of Ministers  right now and Finland will be soon. What appeared to be a total  collapse or at least a long break in the negotiations for the  four countries this morning is on its way to being solved. It  has been solved in such a way that first Sweden accepted and has  an agreement and it seems very likely that at least one of the  other countries, probably Finland, will say yes. There are not  many details, but Sweden has an agreement.</p>

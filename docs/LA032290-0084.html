			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> QUOTABLE  </P> <P> "Painting, for me, is like playing jazz. I start with very few intentions and  everything is discovered by me and the canvas simultaneously -- much as the  trumpet and I discover rhythms and melodies.  </P> <P> The paint and the canvas represent the composition and I become the  interpreter."  </P> <P>  -- Trumpeter Herb Alpert, in the flier for his first show of paintings at Los  Angeles' Wenger Gallery.  </P></p>

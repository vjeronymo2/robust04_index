			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCK PRICES EDGE LOWER; DOW OFF 4.11;  </P> <P> ANTICIPATION OF JOBLESS DATA KEEPS MARKETS QUIET  </P> <P> The stock market drifted to a small loss Thursday while Wall Street kept a  vigil for today's monthly report on the employment situation.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 4.11 to 2,291.43.  </P> <P> Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New  York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 675 up, 764 down and 541 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 143.16 million shares, down from 167.62 million in the  previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues,  including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the  over-the-counter market, totaled 170.25 million shares.  </P> <P> The market rose Wednesday amid hopes that the employment statistics for  February would show a slowing of economic growth.  </P> <P> Such a development could be read as a positive portent for the inflation  outlook and a possible easing of upward pressure on interest rates.  </P> <P> However, if the figures come in with an unpleasant surprise, analysts said, the  market could suffer a letdown.  </P> <P> Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose 1/2 to 113 1/8, General  Electric gained 1/8 to 45 1/2, International Business Machines dropped 1 to 118  3/8 and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was unchanged at 30 1/2.  </P> <P> Upjohn was the volume leader, down 2 1/4 at 29 3/8. Responding to an analyst's  report, the company said it was too soon to gauge the effect of new  prescription procedures in New York State on sales of two Upjohn tranquilizers.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, share prices closed down, but off lows, in thin, nervous trading. The  Nikkei average fell 181.21, or 0.57%, to close at 31,656.45, adding to  Wednesday's 100.28-point loss.  </P> <P> Shares in London closed down but above the day's lows. The Financial Times  100-share index ended 7.4 points lower at 2,075.9.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> The dollar drifted lower against other major currencies in dull U.S. trading as  dealers marked time before the release of February's unemployment report.  </P> <P> Gold prices rose in domestic dealing after declining overseas. Republic  National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $393.80 an ounce, up $1.90 from  Wednesday's late bid.  </P> <P> "Everybody's waiting for the unemployment report," said Fred Barth, chief  foreign exchange trader for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "Trading was  lackluster at best."  </P> <P> Currency dealers elsewhere around the world reported that activity slackened as  market operators awaited release of the U.S. unemployment report by the Labor  Department in Washington.  </P> <P> The dollar moved moderately higher against several key currencies in some  overseas foreign exchange markets before reversing course in the United States.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.23 Japanese yen, up from 128.73.  </P> <P> Later in London, the dollar traded at 129.10 yen. The decline continued in U.S.  trading, and the dollar was quoted late in New York at 128.80 yen, down from  129.225 late Wednesday.  </P> <P> In London, the British pound fell to $1.7183 late Thursday from Wednesday's  $1.7200. Sterling strengthened in U.S. trading, rising to $1.7220 from $1.7155  on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Gold bullion prices rose in U.S. trading but fell on foreign metal markets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bond prices edged lower in quiet trading, also affected by anticipation of the  release of February employment figures.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/32 point, or more than $1.50 per  $1,000 face amount, while its yield crept up to 9.06% from 9.05% late  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Harold Nathan, senior financial economist with Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in San  Francisco, said the market expected weak job growth last month, with 250,000  new jobs added. A figure above the consensus likely would send bond prices  lower.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  ranged between 1/16 point and 5/32 point lower, intermediate maturities lost  5/32 point and long-term issues fell 1/8 point, according to Telerate Inc., a  financial information service.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, slipped 1.17 to 1,124.14.  </P> <P> Corporate bonds moved higher. Moody's investment grade corporate bond index,  which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five  years or longer, rose 0.18 to 298.92.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 9.8125%, down from 10.50% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Silver futures prices surged in the final minutes of trading on New York's  Commodity Exchange and settled with the spot-delivery price above $6 an ounce  for the first time in nearly six weeks.  </P> <P> On other markets, gold futures also advanced, grains and soybeans rebounded  sharply, livestock and meat futures were lower and energy futures retreated.  </P> <P> Silver settled 14.1 to 15.3 cents higher, with the most actively traded  contract, for delivery in May, at $6.09 an ounce. The spot contract for March  delivery settled at the day's high of $6.008 an ounce.  </P> <P> Gold settled $1.40 to $1.90 higher with April at $397.30 a troy ounce.  </P> <P> Analysts said the rally was technically inspired, meaning the buying was based  on bullish interpretations of chart patterns rather than on any change in  market fundamentals.  </P> <P> But the strength of silver relative to gold also suggests that speculators and  investors are embracing silver and turning away from gold, the traditional  leader of the precious metals group.  </P> <P> "The white knight is finally performing," said Peter Cardillo, commodity  trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co., a New York futures brokerage firm.  "I think we're going to see silver emerge as the leader in the next major  rally."  </P> <P> Gold is often perceived as a safe haven for investment dollars in inflationary  times, but it has responded poorly to recent government reports of sharp rises  in wholesale and consumer prices.  </P> <P> Gold's sluggish reaction to the inflation signals "suggests to some traders  that silver may outperform gold," said analyst Bette Raptopoulos of  Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.  </P> <P> She said the rally also reflected positioning by traders before today's  unemployment report.  </P> <P> Grain and soybean futures advanced strongly on the Chicago Board of Trade,  erasing most of the previous session's losses amid a variety of bullish  factors.  </P> <P> Forecasts for continued dryness in prime winter wheat areas supported the wheat  market, as did talk that the Soviet Union was seeking to buy more U.S. wheat at  subsidized prices.  </P> <P> Corn futures were boosted by higher cash prices and by concerns about a lack of  adequate soil moisture in the Midwest.  </P> <P> Sluggish cash markets pressured livestock and meat futures on the Chicago  Mercantile Exchange. Heavy marketings of hogs also weighed on the pork complex.  </P> <P> Energy futures retreated in technically motivated trading on the New York  Mercantile Exchange, reversing the previous session's sharp gains in heating  oil.  </P> <P> Tables begin on Page 5  </P></p>

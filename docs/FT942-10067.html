			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Growth in mortgage lending helps Royal Bank double to Pounds 201m A rapid growth in mortgage lending and sales of household insurance policies by its subsidiary Direct Line helped Royal Bank of Scotland to double interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 201m, against Pounds 89m. The bank tripled earnings per share to 13.5p, from 4.2p, and raised its interim dividend 33 per cent to 4p. However, its shares closed 12.5p down at 428p after it said that the rise was partly to rebalance interim and final dividends. Mr George Mathewson, chief executive, confirmed that the bank was interested in acquiring a building society. 'If a suitable opportunity were to arise, we would look at it positively, but the price would have to be satisfactory.' Mr Mathewson said that the bank wanted to build on the Pounds 900m rise in its mortgage book to Pounds 4.5bn, which had given it a 4 per cent share of net new mortgage lending in the UK. The rise in mortgage lending was funded by a 21 per cent growth in personal savings to Pounds 840m, as the bank offered new savings products. Mr Mathewson said mortgages had been 'a very profitable business' but margins were likely to narrow. Profits before bad debt provisions rose to Pounds 312m, against Pounds 258m, and provisions fell to Pounds 111m, from Pounds 182m. Net interest income rose 11 per cent to Pounds 469m, against Pounds 270m, and other income rose 24 per cent to Pounds 334m. Costs rose 16 per cent to Pounds 537m, but the underlying increase was only 3 per cent because expansion at Direct Line, and the cost of acquisitions by Citizens, its US subsidiary, increased the overall figure. Mr Mathewson said that its alliance with Banco Santander of Spain was strengthening. A joint purchase of another financial services company by the two banks was 'always a possibility'. The bank's treasury had 'only a moderate level of position-taking' on its own account, and had not made any significant losses as a result of turmoil in financial markets following the tightening of US monetary policy. Citizens increased profits to Pounds 27m, from Pounds 21m, while the UK branch banking division contributed Pounds 66m, against Pounds 6m. The corporate and institutional banking division raised profits to Pounds 82m, against Pounds 58m. Capital ratios were weakened by a 9 per cent rise in risk-weighted assets to Pounds 28.3bn, against Pounds 25.9bn on September 30. The tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets fell to 6.5 per cent (6.9 per cent in September). Lex, Page 22; Direct Line, Page 24</p>

Shahin] </F>   [Excerpts] Amman--Two leftist political parties Wednesday  [19 January] announced their decision to merge after months of  negotiations between party cadres. The Jordan People's  Democratic Party (JPDP) and the Jordanian Democratic Popular  Unity Party (JDPUP) disclosed that their executive committees  had agreed on a merger after a meeting late Tuesday.    In what was an expected move, the JPDP and JDPUP decided to  begin their merger by creating a coordination committee for  their respective executive committees.    "These have been long-standing plans and now we are  beginning  their implementation," said 'Azmi al-Khawajah, the secretary  general of the JDPUP. "No one is quite sure how long it will  take, but we are very serious about the merger.    The announcement follows months of negotiations between the  two parties whose members ran on a joint six-person ticket for  the November legislative elections. Only one of the  joint-ticker candidates, Bassam Haddaddin of the JPDP, was  successful in his bid for a seat in Parliament. Mr. Haddadin is  a al-Karak deputy.    The two parties are Jordanian off-shoots of the Palestinian  parties, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine  (DFLP) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  (PFLP) respectively. [passage omitted]    For now the leadership post will rotate among 'Azmi  al-Khawajah and JPDP Secretary General Taysir al-Zibri. The two  parties hope that a timetable and framework will be worked out  between the two groups by mid-February. [passage omitted]</p>

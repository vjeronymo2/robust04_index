			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS NOW CHALLENGED BY FEDERAL LAWS  </P> <P> Today the Supreme Court takes up a Massachusetts employment case that seems  narrow in scope but is actually part of an important and growing legal battle  that affects millions of people throughout the nation.  </P> <P> The clash involves the burgeoning number of worker protection initiatives being  launched by state and local governments and state prosecutors -- such as  statutes requiring companies to give workers advance notice of plant closings  -- and the attempts of business, sometimes aided by the federal government, to  halt those efforts by asserting that they are preempted by some federal law.  </P> <P> "In virtually any kind of lawsuit that is filed on employment issues today  there is some kind of preemption defense that can be raised," said Glenn  Rothner, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents a number of unions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Case  </P> <P> Rothner is involved in a major preemption case in which Southern California  Edison has asserted that the National Labor Relations Act preempts an  employee's right to assert in state court that the company's drug-testing  program violates the California Constitution's right-to-privacy provision.  </P> <P> Cynthia Jackson, a San Francisco lawyer who represents corporations in labor  matters, agreed that preemption cases have become increasingly important in  recent years and are now at the cutting edge of employment-related litigation.  </P> <P> The legal battles, ranging from a Los Angeles taxi franchise case to a Maine  severance pay provision, are the outgrowth of some profound shifts in American  life, particularly the diminished power of unions and the increased propensity  of many state governments to regulate certain aspects of workplace life.  </P> <P> The potential impact of many of these cases can be seen by the volume of  friend-of-the-court briefs filed in them. Last year, 17 states, the AFL-CIO and  other groups wrote briefs in support of Illinois in a case where a division of  Magic Chef Inc. asserted that the National Labor Relations Act preempted an  Illinois law that prohibits employers from firing workers simply because they  have filed workers' compensation claims.  </P> <P> The case being heard by the Supreme Court today involves a Boston banker,  Richard Morash, who is challenging the constitutionality of a 1985 state law  requiring any employer who discharges a worker in Massachusetts to pay all  unpaid wages, including accrued vacation pay, to the employee on the day of the  discharge.  </P> <P> Morash contends that this rule should be overturned under the Constitution's  supremacy clause because it conflicts with, and is preempted by, federal law, a  contention Massachusetts vigorously disputes.  </P> <P> The Morash case will not be the last word on preemption law, according to legal  scholars. However, if the Supreme Court upholds the Massachusetts law, it could  create a more favorable atmosphere for states to enact similar regulations,  said Clyde Summers, a University of Pennsylvania law professor.  </P> <P> In recent years, preemption issues have also been raised in many other cases in  state and federal courts, including a number that ultimately reached the  Supreme Court. The results of the cases have been mixed, but enough of them  have been resolved in favor of pro-worker state regulations that union lawyers  and strategists believe that new avenues have been opened to them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tremendous Inroads'  </P> <P> "States have been making tremendous inroads in employment law," said Jackson,  the San Francisco attorney.  </P> <P> The reason for all the activity at the state level is a recognition of the fact  that the vast majority of American workers are unorganized and in need of more  legal protection, according to Summers, who has been studying the trend.  </P> <P> He emphasized that workplace governance in the United States has not developed  in the manner anticipated when the National Labor Relations Act, authored by  Sen. Robert Wagner of New York, was enacted in 1935. The law gave formal  protections to people participating in union organizing campaigns and put the  government's stamp of approval on collective bargaining.  </P> <P> "When we passed the Wagner Act . . . we created an image that we were going to  regulate the labor market in this country through collective bargaining" rather  than controlling it through a series of laws governing separate issues  affecting workers, Summers said.  </P> <P> About 20 years ago, "it began to dawn on people that this had not come to  pass," Summers said. "We had not achieved a (broad) system of collective  bargaining; it was only a fraction of the labor market. As that awareness  dawned, people began to ask themselves, 'What are we going to do about all the  people who are not protected by collective bargaining that need to have  protection from some other source?' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Management Unhappy  </P> <P> Initially, he said, the federal government began to fill some of those gaps  through passage of laws such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the  Employees Retirement and Income Security Act, the federal statute at issue in  the Morash case. Then state and local governments began to get in on the act  and management was unhappy.  </P> <P> Companies, particularly national companies, are deeply concerned with having to  comply with a welter of disparate regulations on the same subject, so they file  preemption challenges, said R. Theodore Clark, a senior partner at  Chicago-based Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather &amp; Geraldson, the nation's largest  labor law firm on management's side.  </P> <P> UC Berkeley labor law professor David Feller said the preemption conflict  reflects the ironic convergence of two seemingly contradictory trends that have  emerged in recent years.  </P> <P> "There is now a much larger constituency to provide legislation to protect  individual workers," while there is a smaller constituency to strengthen the  National Labor Relations Act, which offers workers collective protections,  Feller said.  </P> <P> "This is the result of the decline of collective bargaining and the decline of  unionism," said Feller, who once served as general counsel to the United  Steelworkers of America.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan's appointment of conservatives to the federal  bench and the National Labor Relations Board also prompted organized labor to  look for relief in other venues, such as state courts and state legislatures,  said Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco labor lawyer who writes a number of  appellate court briefs for the AFL-CIO. "People are looking for alternatives to  the NLRB," she said.  </P> <P> This represents a marked change from the past, said Washington labor lawyer  Michael Gottesman. Historically, organized labor viewed state courts as  oppressive tribunals that issued picketing injunctions at the drop of a hat and  state legislatures as enemy territory where conservative officeholders  attempted to pass laws restricting organizer activity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Federal Laws  </P> <P> For years after the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, the labor  movement looked to federal laws as protections that were uniform throughout the  country. In the past, it was predominantly unions that raised preemption  challenges, trying to knock out state laws or administrative decisions it  considered unfair.  </P> <P> Then came Reagan. The increasingly difficult climate for labor in Washington  and at the bargaining table has prompted a fundamental re-examination of how  labor can best achieve its goals, including the use of state courts, challenges  to the all-encompassing primacy of federal labor laws and a willingness to  support cases filed by individual employees seeking the establishment of  minimum labor standards in certain areas.  </P> <P> "These are tactical choices," Gottesman said. "In an ideal world, the country  would be better with unified labor law," but he quickly added that the world is  far from ideal and that the labor movement has to adapt to changed  circumstances.  </P> <P> "I think it's unrealistic to think (non-unionized) employees will sit idly by,"  waiting to get collective bargaining to give them greater protection. The  movement to give these workers greater protections "will not go away,"  Gottesman said. "The labor movement's intelligentsia has been philosophically  reluctant to openly advocate that, as a legal proposition, states have open  season. But the pressures are irresistible."  </P> <P> And such pressures create complications for labor, said David Silberman, the  AFL-CIO's associate general counsel. "On the one hand, the notion that a state  could enact a cap on wages or could fix wages certainly takes a lot away from  the collective bargaining process," Silberman said. "On the other hand, there  are all kinds of minimum labor standards that look desirable to us."  </P> <P> Indeed, organized labor has supported raising the minimum wage beyond the $3.35  an hour the federal government set it at in 1981. There is no preemption issue  on minimum wages and 11 states, including California, have a minimum above the  $3.35 level.  </P> <P> But while no one is raising the preemption issue regarding state minimum wage  laws, many other state laws offering greater worker protection are being  challenged on that basis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Toxic Chemicals  </P> <P> One of the most heavily litigated issues are state laws directing employers to  give workers and communities information about the toxic chemicals they are  using. Although President Reagan espoused "states rights," his aides supported  legal challenges by business groups to state "right-to-know" laws compelling  disclosure of information about toxic chemicals that were stronger than those  enacted subsequently by the federal Occupational Safety and Health  Administration, an agency whose political tilt shifted sharply after Reagan  became President.  </P> <P> A protracted court battle on the state disclosure laws has been something of a  draw. In three separate cases in 1985 and 1986, a federal appeals court in  Philadelphia ruled that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act  preempted state "right-to-know" laws as they applied to employees. However, the  court upheld the state laws as they apply to workplaces not covered by the  federal OSHA standard or if the laws are designed to protect the public or the  environment.  </P> <P> In several of the major cases, though, workers, unions and the states have  emerged victorious. For example:  </P> <P> Last June, the court unanimously upheld the Illinois statute on workers'  compensation-related firings in the case of Jonna Lingle vs. Norge Division of  Magic Chef Inc. This was considered a particularly important precedent because  the fired worker, Lingle, was a union member whose contract had a provision  saying that employees could only be discharged for "just cause."  </P> <P> The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the company's assertion that Lingle  should be barred from filing a state court damages suit in which she could be  awarded monetary damages because there was a remedy available to her in the  collective bargaining agreement. The company contended that since an  interpretation of the agreement was required, the matter came under the  National Labor Relations Act and was therefore preempted.  </P> <P> But Justice John Paul Stevens' opinion for the entire court said there was no  need to interpret the collective bargaining agreement because the facts showed  that the company had fired Lingle in clear violation of the Illinois law.  </P> <P> In June, 1987, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld a Maine law  requiring employers to provide a one-time severance payment to employees not  covered by an express contract providing for severance pay. The court held that  Maine's law was not preempted by federal law. Maine's "establishment of a  minimum labor standard does not impermissibly intrude upon the collective  bargaining process," the majority opinion stated.  </P> <P> But the states and their labor allies certainly have not won all the recent  preemption cases. For example:  </P> <P> In February, 1986, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, ruled that a  Wisconsin statute was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. That law  prohibited a state agency from awarding a contract to a company that had  frequently violated the National Labor Relations Act.  </P> <P> In April, 1986, in an 8-1 opinion, the high court ruled that the city of Los  Angeles' denial of a taxi franchise to a company until it settled a strike  "destroyed the balance of power designed by Congress" in the National Labor  Relations Act "and frustrated Congress' decision to leave open the use of  economic weapons."  </P> <P> To be sure, there are still situations in which union lawyers argue in favor of  preemption.  </P> <P> But most of the time now, they are arguing against preemption and in favor of  greater state authority in the workplace. Just a few weeks ago, they were  pleased by a highly awaited decision by the Illinois Supreme Court. In a  unanimous opinion, the Illinois court ruled that the federal Occupational  Safety and Health Act does not preempt local prosecutors from bringing their  own criminal cases against employers who knowingly endanger workers on the job.  </P> <P> "It is totally unreasonable to conclude that Congress intended OSHA's penalties  would be the only sanctions available for wrongful conduct which threatens or  results in serious physical injury or death to workers," the court wrote.  </P> <P> State criminal prosecutions of safety and health violations are considered  important because in 18 years, the federal government has filed only 14  criminal cases against OSHA violators. Although the decision is not binding on  any state other than Illinois, and is likely to be appealed, it is the  highest-level ruling on the issue to date and is considered likely to spur more  criminal prosecutions of workplace safety violations. Local prosecutors from  Boston, New York and Los Angeles, who have filed similar cases, wrote amicus  briefs on behalf of Cook County prosecutors who had charged five executives of  Chicago Magnet Wire Co. with aggravated battery and reckless conduct because of  safety conditions at the company's Elk Grove, Ill., plant.  </P> <P> Jan Chatten Brown, head of the occupational safety unit in the Los Angeles  County district attorney's office, praised the decision, saying that states and  localities had "a deeply rooted interest" in protecting worker safety that  should not be usurped.  </P></p>

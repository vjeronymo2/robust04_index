			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the eve of the Russian leader's visit to  Georgia, our correspondent, Yuriy Dekanosidze, met with Givi  Lominadze, minister for state of the Republic of Georgia,  chairman of the interim extraordinary committee for western  Georgia and a member of parliament. The journalist asked  Lominadze to comment on the Abkhaz issue which, it is supposed,  will be one of the key issues at tomorrow's meeting.    [Begin recording] [Lominadze] My attitude toward and point  of  view on Yeltsin's visit is positive. I shall say more: I am  pinning definite hopes on it. First of all, any visit of such a  high ranking leader, moreover an official one, is in itself an  event. Second, we know how many official visits by Russian  leaders there have been before and whatever the quality of our  relations with Russia may be in future, there will still be a  touch of offense among the Georgian people as -- I do not hold  the Russian official authorities and personally the Russian  president in high esteem. They helped the Abkhaz separatists  with all they could, literally using all available means.    I am sure that our relations will be normal. We have no  other option. We are destined to be not only neighbors but  genuine friends. It is our past, our common faith, community of  culture, and links which have been maintained with Russia for  centuries now. Therefore, although difficult, still a big step  is being taken toward improving these relations and -- I am  looking into the future -- Russia can and must play the most  important role in resolving this [Abkhaz] issue.    [Dekanosidze] Let us hope that tomorrow's official visit by  Boris Yeltsin will give us cause to hope that at least one step  forward will be taken toward resolving the Abkhaz issue.    [Lominadze] Personally, I hope and am sure that this issue  will have a certain backing, undoubtedly will have backing  because when such high ranking leaders meet against the  background of all those events they cannot but discuss and come  to a unanimous decision to resolve the conflict between the  Georgian and Abkhaz population in Abkhazia. I am sure that  Russia's realistic policy will positively influence a solution  to this issue, and personally I am sure that Russia's president  wishes to resolve this issue. Yeltsin's visit is one of the  most essential factors which, in my opinion, can settle the  conflict positively. [end recording]</p>

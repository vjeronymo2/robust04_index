			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" by staff reporter Xia Jun (1115 </F> 8823): "Aquatic Industry: Output Ranks First in the World in  Past Four Consecutive Years"]    [Text] "Have fish in your meal" was once a standard for a  good life for our ancestors. Today, this good life has become a  reality in China. All year round, live fish and all kinds of  prawns, shellfish, and aquatic plants are found everywhere in  city and rural fairs and markets. A dozen years or so ago,  however, aquatic products had to be rationed with food coupons.    In the past 40 years or more since the founding of the PRC,  China's aquatic products industry has developed roughly this  way: The 1950's were a period of recovery and speedy  development; the annual output of aquatic products rose at an  annual rate of 21 percent, from 450,000 tonnes in 1949 to 3.09  million tonnes. In the 1960's, owing to the excessive  extraction of aquatic products, their annual output did not  increase, but decreased to 290,000 tonnes. The 1970's saw a slow  annual average increase of 4 percent, with the annual output  rising to 4.305 million tonnes. The 1980's were a "golden  period" of brave reforms and speedy growth. By adopting a  series of important reform measures, such as "paying  simultaneous attention to the breeding, extraction, and  processing of aquatic products, with the emphasis on breeding  and allowing for the emphasis to shift in light of the  situations of different localities," and removing all  restrictions on the prices of aquatic products, we ushered in a  new prospect of extraordinary development. In the past 15 years,  the China's aquatic products output has seen a 2.8-fold  increase, and total output for 1993 reached 17.86 million  tonnes, representing an average annual increase of 9 percent.  In the eight years since all price restrictions were removed,  there has been an average annual increase of 1.35 million tonnes  or more than 12 percent.    In addition to the increase in total output, the structure  of  the aquatic products industry also has changed in a gratifying  way. First, the output from sea fishery has decreased, while  that from inland fishery has risen. The ratio between the  former and the latter in 1979 was 74:26, but that in 1993 was  60:40. Second, the output from catching has decreased, while  that from breeding has risen. The ratio has proceeded from  72:29 in 1979 to 52:48 at the present time.    In the years since 1990, China has ranked first in the world  in the output of aquatic products and China's proportion in the  world's total aquatic products output has risen from 1/45 to  approximately 1/6.    Despite the fact China is a world leader in the output of  aquatic products, the per-capita possession comes only to 14 kg,  equivalent to only two-thirds of the world's average level. The  many factors restricting the development of China's aquatic  products industry remain, but as long as we make efforts and  struggle unremittingly, China will be a leader, not only in  total output of the aquatic products industry in the future, but  also in the conservation and utilization of resources and in  comprehensive social and economic efficiency.</p>

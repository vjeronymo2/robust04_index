			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [By reporters Luo Guojun (7482 0948 7846) and Liu Siyang  (0491 1835 2254])    [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- The information center of  the Second Session of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, at a press  conference it sponsored at the International Hotel today,  invited six CPPCC National Committee members to answer questions  raised by Chinese and foreign reporters about the establishment  of a modern enterprise system and streamlining large and medium  state enterprises.    These six members were Wan Guoquan, executive vice chairman  of the China Democratic League Central Committee and member of  its standing committee; Li Gang, vice chairman of the Economic  Affairs Committee and member of the Standing Committee of the  CPPCC National Committee; Wang Jue, professor of the economics  department of the Central Party School; Zhang Jusheng, chairman  of the Hefei Meiling Corp. Ltd., (Group); Yan Ruifan, president  of the China Guanglian Industrial Corp. Ltd.; and Zhao Changbai,  vice chairman of the board of directors of the Shoudou Iron and  Steel Company.    A ZHONGGUO ZHENGQUAN BAO [China Securities] reporter asked:  Some people hold that the stock system is the way to improve  large and medium state enterprises, and that listed companies  are modern enterprises. What is your comment?    Li Gang said: Shortage of capital is one problem facing  large and medium state enterprises. So these enterprises can  obtain the capital they need through the sale of stocks.  Fundamentally speaking, however, these enterprises should  become modern enterprises through restructuring and replacing  their operating mechanisms.    Answering a question raised by a REUTER reporter on his  observations about the revitalization of large and medium  enterprises, Wan Guoquan said: The key to revitalizing large  and medium enterprises lies in clearly defining property rights  and responsibilities, separating government from enterprises,  and managing these enterprises scientifically. The replacement  of operating mechanisms will cause some enterprises certain  difficulties, but there should not be any sharp contradictions  among government, enterprises, and workers because their  interests are fundamentally the same. If everybody strives to  surmount difficulties with concerted efforts, certain problems  can be resolved. He stressed that large and medium state  enterprises were, are, and will remain the mainstays dominating  national economic development.    A reporter from XIN MIN WAN PAO [New Nation's Evening News]  asked: "How are workers' unemployment problems being solved  since the Bankruptcy Law was implemented?"    Wang Jue said: The government has adopted measures to deal  with this problem, such as promoting the development of tertiary  industry and speeding up the construction of medium and small  cities. As reforms deepen step by step, there will be more and  more job opportunities for unemployed workers, and avenues of  employment will be broader and broader.    Zhang Jesheng, Yan Ruifan, and Zhao Changbai also answered  reporters' questions on the competitiveness of large and medium  state enterprises after China becomes a GATT member, how  state-owned foreign trade enterprises revitalize their  operations, and how large and medium enterprises manage their  businesses autonomously and accumulate capital.</p>

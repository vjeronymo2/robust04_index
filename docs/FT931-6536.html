			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Observer: Show business Top marks to Britain's life assurance industry for resourcefulness under enemy fire and braving a counter-attack in face of hopeless odds. Under assault from regulators and customers provoked by the sales agents' high-pressure tactics, the industry has mounted the classic defence. It has commissioned a survey showing that six in every seven people think life insurance is valuable if not essential. Among the survey's more astounding findings is that 70 per cent of respondents actually agreed that policy-buyers who cash them in early deserve to lose out financially. The number believing the sales agent should bear the penalty was only 7 per cent. In the meantime, however, Observer hears that the industry has also launched a less conventional undercover operation. Companies ranging from Allied Dunbar to Legal &amp; General have begun rattling people's letter boxes with unsolicited suggestions that they might like to change career and become 'financial consultants'. One recipient is singer-songwriter Dilly Keane, formerly with the Fascinating Aida trio. She reported on radio the other day that she had just had a second such approach, from Allied Dunbar. The company's John Morgan, who wrote the letter, said Keane's name was obtained from a marketing company with a very high success rate. So far, though, the only actual recruit from show business was a certain Dennis Lipton, whose wife used to run a stripper-gram enterprise.</p>

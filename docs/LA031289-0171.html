			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' DIVISION II;  </P> <P> EASTERLY, KATELLA COME BACK FOR 56-50 VICTORY  </P> <P> With 2 minutes 11 seconds left in the third quarter of the Southern California  Regional Division II girls' championship game, Joni Easterly was where she  least wanted to be. She was sitting on the bench with four fouls.  </P> <P> Even worse, Katella High School of Anaheim was behind.  </P> <P> Easterly got back into the game with 7:15 left, but not before asking Coach  Barb Bausch "about five times" to go back in.  </P> <P> When she returned, Easterly led Katella to a 56-50 come-from-behind victory  over Vista.  </P> <P> Katella (29-3) advanced to the state Division II championship game against  Sacramento Grant next Saturday in Oakland.  </P> <P> Easterly, a 5-11 forward who has signed a letter of intent to play at USC next  season, had 24 points. She scored 14 of Katella's 16 points in the fourth  quarter as Katella rallied from a five-point deficit with 6:50 left.  </P> <P> However, Easterly had a rough first half. Her first two shots were blocked by  6-4 center Chris Enger of Vista (28-4). She made only three of 16 shots from  the field and had eight points.  </P> <P> Katella still managed to lead, 28-22, at the half, largely because of the  accurate shooting of point guard Angie Gomez.  </P> <P> Gomez had 12 points at the half and 19 for the game.  </P> <P> Easterly, who averages 22 points a game, found her shooting touch in the second  half, but she got into foul trouble and Vista rallied.  </P> <P> Enger, who had 20 points, led the comeback, scoring six consecutive points late  in the third quarter and Vista led, 44-41, at the end of the quarter. When  Kelli Schott made a jumper to open the fourth quarter, it was 46-41.  </P> <P> But Easterly returned shortly thereafter and assumed command.  </P> <P> Easterly made five of seven shots in the second half. Her two free throws with  5:05 left put Katella ahead for good, 50-48. She added a short jumper, then  drove around Enger for another basket and added two free throws with five  seconds left.  </P> <P> Vista went scoreless in the last three minutes and had just two points in the  final 5:05.  </P></p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Yemeni victors confident The Yemeni government yesterday denied talks held in Geneva last week with its defeated southern rivals had any official status, saying the meeting was only to clarify its own position with the UN. But UN sources said the two sides met in a good atmosphere and agreed to further talks. Yemeni officials on Saturday said their negotiators had gone to the talks to underline earlier demands for the UN to end its efforts at mediation since the country's civil war was over. They insisted any further talks be held in Yemen without outside involvement. Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN mediator, last week said Thursday's meeting ended with both sides agreeing to pursue further dialogue. Yemen's civil war erupted in April. Since their defeat, exiled southern leaders have used the threat of guerrilla warfare to obtain outside mediation in ending their dispute with the north. But the north has resisted external pressure for a negotiated settlement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Forest area in the Lao PDR [Lao People's Democratic  Republic] remains at just 11 million hectares or about 47 per  cent of the country's total area, while the bare area has  increased by 43 per cent or 10.2 million hectares, a report said  at the nationwide meeting on forestation, tree nursery and land  allocation held in Vientiane early last week.    The report indicated that in 1940, the country had a total  forest area of 17 million hectares or 70 per cent of its total  area. This forest area shrank to 12.7 million hectares by 1973  and 11.2 million by 1981 and is 11 million at present. The  reduction in the forest cover was the consequence of various  practices, such as slash and burn cultivation, forest fire, and  wanton tree-felling.    To restore and preserve the forest, the government has  issued  regulations facilitating and ensuring the plantation of trees on  a family and business basis. Timber traders are now compelled  to undertake tree planting. To families engaged in slash and  burn cultivation, the government will allocate cultivation and  production land. Those living in watershed areas will be  allocated new settlements or assigned to rehabilitate the forest  in their particular areas.    The government agencies concerned have in the past years  made  several efforts to protect and develop the forestry resources of  the country with the participation of both the private and  public sectors. This involves reforestation and restricting  slash and burn farming, especially in mountainous areas. At the  same time, measures have been taken against those who illegally  fell trees and who start forest fires.    Sweden has assisted Laos in preserving forestry resources  through the Lao-Swedish cooperation project for the restriction  of slash and burn farming.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Asia-Pacific worries may cloud HSBC - Other Companies Investors will be watching for shocks at HSBC Holdings as it concludes the interim results season for UK banks. Shares have already fallen sharply this year on worries over Asia-Pacific growth, and its exposure to financial markets trading. Today the bank, now the parent of Midland Bank, is expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1.3bn, compared with Pounds 1.17bn. Earnings per share are expected to rise by 5 per cent to about 34p, and the dividend to be increased 14 per cent to 8p.</p>

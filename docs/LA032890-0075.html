			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING AHEAD: WORKSTATION MARKET IS GROWING AT RAPID RATE  </P> <P> The $6-billion market for computer workstations is one of the fastest-growing  segments in the industry, with projections showing a compound annual growth  rate of 30% in five years.  </P> <P> Between personal computers and mini-super computers in terms of power,  workstations are fast becoming the upgrade of choice among PC users. And in the  next few years, as workstations come down in price and PCs increase in  performance, the line between them will become more blurry.  </P> <P> A low-level workstation costs $4,000 and a high-end personal computer $12,000  or more.  </P> <P> Though closing rapidly, the gap between personal computers and workstations  still exists in graphics. High-performance features are to be expected in the  workstation, often making it more attractive than the personal computer to  which many optional features must be added.  </P> <P> But by far the most important differences between personal computers and  workstations are in non-technical areas such as service, distribution and  marketing.  </P> <P> Generally, personal computers are sold through distributors and retailers, and  workstations directly through manufacturers. Workstations are used more often  in a technical setting and therefore have a more prestigious image in technical  uses.  </P> <P> Personal computers have the advantage of being in the buyers' comfort zone.  Buyers are more familiar with personal computers than with workstations.  </P> <P> Personal computers far outnumber workstations, and the idea of upgrading a  familiar personal computer is less threatening than the idea of buying a new  type of machine with an unfamiliar operating system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Potential in Recycling in Chip Cleaners  </P> <P> Given the nod from a small group of engineers, a new technology that recycles  the sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids used to clean silicon wafers has the  potential to grow to a $200-million industry by 1995.  </P> <P> Since 1987, only 20 of the so-called reprocessing systems have been installed  in semiconductor manufacturing plants worldwide. Over the next few years,  engineering staffs at the plants will evaluate the systems and decide to what  extent this technology will be used in their companies' semiconductor  manufacturing operations. Other semiconductor manufacturers are waiting to see  if they should invest in the $600,000 technology.  </P> <P> There are three advantages to acid reprocessing systems. First, they  consistently deliver a very pure acid, which lowers contamination levels. This  means manufacturers can produce more good chips on each silicon wafer.  </P> <P> Second, they reduce acid consumption by 90% or more. Current technology  requires the acid be periodically dumped and replenished.  </P> <P> These new systems continuously recycle and purify the acids. Since the average  selling price of bottled acid used in semiconductor manufacturing is $7 to $10  per gallon and high-purity acids costs $15 to $27 per gallon, companies can  recoup their investment in a reprocessing system in only a few years.  </P> <P> The third advantage is that they produce much smaller amounts of waste than  other systems, which lowers the cost of disposal. Disposal costs now run about  $1.50 per gallon of acid used.  </P> <P> The financial community, attracted by the technology's environmental angle,  continues to fund the only two companies that are developing these reprocessing  systems, Athens Corp. of Oceanside and Alameda Instruments in Pleasanton,  Calif.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demand Is Growing for ASICs in Asia  </P> <P> The "ASICs Age" is dawning for Taiwanese and South Korean electronics companies  as they continue to expand into new technologies and increase their production  of electronic systems for the military, aerospace, telecommunications and data  processing markets. All these systems will use customized semiconductors called  ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), and therefore represent a  prime market for U.S. and Japanese ASICs manufacturers.  </P> <P> While strong in ASICs design, the electronics producers are limited in their  capabilities to produce the specialized chips. They look to the United States  and Japan to fill the bulk of the ASICs orders. Shipment values of ASICs to  Asian countries other than Japan will be $455 million this year and are  expected to reach $1.7 billion by 1994.  </P> <P> Customized semiconductors come in three basic types: gate arrays, cell-based  integrated circuits and programmable logic devices.  </P> <P> Japan surpassed the United States in terms of total ASICs shipments to Asia  last year, due largely to Japan's doubling of gate array shipments to the  region. Japanese companies will continue their surge into Asia because of their  strong gate array performance.  </P> <P> Programmable logic devices and cell-based integrated circuits come primarily  from U.S. companies. If U.S. companies increase gate array market share and  sustain their lead in the other two segments, Japan might lose its position as  the No. 1 ASICs supplier to Asia by 1991.  </P> <P> Responding to increased demand, Asian companies are investing heavily in  research and development and are seeking partnerships with foreign companies to  become ASIC manufacturers themselves. As a consequence, the competition for  ASICs market share will become more intense in the 1990s, pitting the United  States and Japan against other Asian countries.  </P></p>

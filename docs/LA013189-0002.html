Chicago was voted the most polite city in America by business  executives in etiquette expert Marjabelle Young Stewart's fifth annual survey.  "Chicago has such healthiness, such feeling, such spirit," Stewart said from  her Kewanee home in western Illinois. The "little courtesies" shown by service  people from waiters to cab drivers add up, she said. The rest of the Top 10 are  Seattle; New York; Pittsburgh; Indianapolis; Denver; Charleston, S.C.; Boston;  Peoria, Ill., and Dallas.  </P> <P>  -- Barbara Bush is interested in reading more than lips. The First Lady got to  work on her main project -- promoting literacy -- with a meeting in the family  quarters of the White House with Librarian of Congress James H. Billington and  John Cole, director of the Center for the Book. The two men briefed her on the  "Year of the Young Reader," a program initiated by the Library of Congress to  encourage young people to love reading. National Young Reader's Day will be  celebrated Nov. 15 with school and television projects as well as an exchange  of children's books between the United States and the Soviet Union. Mrs. Bush  has been involved in literacy efforts for years. SHIRLEY MARLOW  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LA JOLLA MAN, 2 OTHERS HELD IN 'BOILER ROOM' FRAUD  </P> <P> A La Jolla man is among three telephone salesmen arrested in connection with a  clandestine "boiler room" fraud that swindled at least $250,000 from 20  customers who thought they were investing in silver and platinum futures,  authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> U.S. Postal Service inspectors and Newport Beach police arrested three  suspects, all of whom had worked for Eastern Financial Services, an  unregistered precious-metals telemarketing business that operated out of  several locations in Newport Beach from late 1987 through January, 1989,  according to Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim Newman.  </P> <P> The owner of EFS, Eric M. Dickey, was arrested last January on three counts of  wire fraud. Dickey was convicted and sentenced to four years in federal prison  while the investigation continued.  </P> <P> Newman said investigators arrested Michael J. Mears, 27, outside his La Jolla  home early Thursday morning, then took James D. Murdoch, 26, of Newport Beach  into custody Thursday afternoon at his work in Newport Beach. Robert L. Daigle,  27, of Garden Grove, was arrested Friday morning at the same Newport Beach firm  when he arrived to get his paycheck, Newman said.  </P> <P> All three were booked on suspicion of telemarketing fraud and were being held  in the city jail in lieu of $10,000 bail.  </P> <P> Newman said the three used "classic high-pressure telephone sales" to cheat at  least 20 clients out of a total of $250,000. They face charges of grand theft,  conspiracy, and telemarketing fraud and federal charges of mail fraud and wire  fraud, he said.  </P></p>

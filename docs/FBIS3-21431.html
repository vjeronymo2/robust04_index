			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Berlin, Feb. 5--The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V.  Narasimha Rao, today defended his sweeping economic reforms,  describing it as an idealistic striving tempered by practical  thinking to ameliorate the lot of millions of Indians.    Delivering a lecture at the historic Humboldt University  here, Mr. Rao drew parallel with the renowned indologist, Max  Mueller who encountered hurdles when he set out to translate  vedic hymns as his detractors and Mueller was embarking on a  task for the next century.    Mr. Rao recalled the words of Mueller when he said in  defence  of his task: "No one feels this more strongly than I do. No one  has been more willing to make even a beginning in this arduous  undertaking. Yet a beginning has to be made and we have to  advance step by step to make a breach in that apparently  impregnable fortress. My principle, therefore, has always been,  let us translate what we can, and thus reduce the untranslatable  portion to narrower and narrower limits."    Mr. Rao said in that endeavour, the restriction of the  untranslatable with limits defined more and more sharply, the  politician had no less difficult a task than a writer or scholar.    In all that the politician or statesman did, his efforts  must  be to make the improbable possible, and to persuade his people,  his adversaries and his friends, and above all himself that the  impossible would so remain but need not affect, abridge or  inhibit the immense possibilities that yearn to be realised. Mr.  Rao asserted in an obvious answer to his detractors.    The Prime Minister said currently India was passing through  the most important transition in its economy as the policies of  the last 45 years were being re-oriented and efforts were on to  accomplish a market-led economy.    'Walls of prejudice must go': Mr. Rao described  Berlin as a city "marbled in history and shaped by the ecstasy  of achievement and the anguish of war where walls have been  raised and walls have been razed." He said walls of ideology had  made many intellectual endeavours counter-productive and  asserted that "we have arrived at a time when truly, the walls  of biases, of prejudice, of small identities have to be broken,  to create a new humanism based on the absolute trust and respect  for the other."    Though schools of German studies in India were younger in  comparison, there was nonetheless, a strong and vibrant  tradition of German studies in India, he said. He also lauded  the historic role played by Humboldt University in strengthening  ties between India and Germany.    Mr. Rao said the establishment of the Indian cultural centre  here would promote the larger cause of Indo-German friendship.    Earlier inaugurating the centre by lighting the traditional  lamp, he said its establishment would provide a focal point for  interaction between India and Germany in various aspects of  "Indian art and culture."    Rare honour for PM: Mr. Rao was accorded the rare  honour of being received by federal President, Mr. Richard Von  Weizsacker, in Berlin instead of Bonn when he called on him last  evening.    This is of great significance especially as Mr. Rao is the  first Head of Government since World War II to be received by  the federal President in Berlin. For the people of Berlin too,  it is a confirmation of the fact that the city will soon become  the capital of the reunited Germany as it was agreed upon by a  parliamentary decision immediately following the reunification.    An official spokesman described Mr. Rao's meeting with Mr.  Weizsacker at Bellevue Palace as a courtesy call. Later in the  evening, Mr. Rao walked through the Brandenburg Gate with the  governing Mayor of Berlin, Mr. Ederhard Diepgen.--PTI</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Children's Society project Sir, Your article 'Training cuts 'cause destitution' ' (July 22) highlighted the closure of a Children's Society training project for young people with special needs, funded by Greater Nottingham Training and Enterprise Council. Tec chief executive, T J Potts, claims (Letters, July 30/31) that the Tec withdrew funding because it was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the project. At the time of the closure, the Tec informed the Children's Society it was reducing the number of providers in order to rationalise its training provision. It closed another quality training provider this April. The Children's Society is concerned that the project is just one of a number of special needs training schemes which have recently been closed across the country. As well as training, the project provided intensive pastoral and welfare care for its users, whose needs ranged from disability to homelessness. The value of this care was recognised by a range of local agencies. Integrating special needs training requires a high level of resourcing and planning if it is to benefit young people. The project's recommendations on how to achieve success have already received a positive response from several Tec chief executives. Ted Parsons, East Midlands regional social work manager, The Children's Society, Edward Rudolf House, Margery Street, London WC1</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE'S STANCE ON MEASURE A  </P> <P> There is an old adage that "politics makes strange bedfellows."  </P> <P> Confusion created by the intense media campaigns generated by both sides of the  Measure A issue on the Torrance municipal ballot vividly demonstrates the truth  of this saying.  </P> <P> Measure A is opposed by Mayor Katy Geissert and council members Bill Applegate,  Dee Hardison, George Nakano, Tim Mock and Mark Wirth.  </P> <P> Measure A is supported by only one council member, its author, Dan Walker.  </P> <P> The council majority is not supportive of the continued use of hydrogen  fluoride in the alkylation process at the Mobil Oil refinery.  </P> <P> On the contrary, the city has been deeply involved for the past year in  preparation of a comprehensive public nuisance lawsuit against Mobil. This suit  is aimed at giving the city greater control over the storage and use of  hazardous substances, including hydrogen fluoride, at the refinery. We have  been advised by our attorneys that this legal action is the most effective  means to assure the safety of our residents.  </P> <P> The city has committed $1 million to date in preparation of this suit, and the  suit will soon be ready to go to trial.  </P> <P> Passage of Measure A will not only complicate the city's lawsuit, but might  well delay its going to trial for years to come. In the meantime, a wide array  of safety issues will go unaddressed by the courts.  </P> <P> The confusion arises in the public's mind because Mobil Oil is also opposing  Measure A. Their opposition is for totally different reasons than the  opposition of the City Council majority.  </P> <P> Mobil Oil certainly does not support the city's lawsuit.  </P> <P> We urge you to vote no on Measure A so that the full strength of the city of  Torrance can be put behind court action mandating safe operation of the Mobil  refinery.  </P> <P> KATY GEISSERT,  </P> <P> mayor  </P> <P> BILL APPLEGATE,  </P> <P> councilman  </P> <P> DEE HARDISON,  </P> <P> councilwoman  </P> <P> TIM MOCK,  </P> <P> councilman  </P> <P> GEORGE NAKANO,  </P> <P> councilman  </P> <P> MARK WIRTH,  </P> <P> councilman  </P></p>

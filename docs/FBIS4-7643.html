			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview under the "Leaders" rubric with Polish President </F> Lech Walesa by special correspondents Viktor Loshak and Valeriy  Masterov at the Belweder Palace in Warsaw; date not given:  "Lech Walesa: Neither Russia nor Poland Can Be Moved to  America; We Are Forced To Depend on One Another"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Proposals  are now being voiced in the United States that Poland and  Ukraine should become a kind of "buffer zone" between the giants  of Europe--Russia and Germany. What is your view of that?    [Walesa] People think up different things. I am a practical  politician. The theoreticians have to do something, so they  fantasize. But, as a practical man, I understand that the  exhortations of the new era are different. Such comparisons,  "buffer zones" and so forth, mean that we have still not broken  away from the past. All of this is still a case of thinking in  the category of the "division of the world" into two parts. But  the world does not divide like that, of course. The differences  are beginning to disappear. Of course, the world can be divided  into the more developed and the less developed, the richer and  the less rich. I think that, in this case, it is illogical now  to speak of various zones. Even if everything were fine with  us--that is, with Russia, Ukraine, and Poland--it would still  take us 20 years to catch up with the West. Yes, there are 20  years of development ahead of us. But the West is choking; it is  suffering from overproduction. It needs us to enable it to  develop at all. The West needs us more than we need the West!    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Were your previous hopes of Western  aid  justified?    [Walesa] I have never counted on Western aid. History has  taught us quite well that we cannot seriously count on the West.  We have received no aid from it apart from promises, and they  were late, what is more. But you cannot complain about  that--such is the way of the world. Business is business. What  has sentiment got to do with it? Sentiment gets in the way.  But, if you are talking about my disappointment with the West,  well, of course, that is real. But it exists in completely  different categories: The West does not understand what is  going on here, it does not see us as partners. We and you, we do  not need anything. All that we want is that they should  recognize our equal rights and potential. Just as soon as that  potential is opened up, we will sort things out ourselves. But  the West opens itself up only if it stands to gain, and it does  so using its surplus products, its best goods, which we lack.  But when our goods are competitive and cheap, barriers are set  up. So the West is very nationalistic; it is just that this a  different class of nationalism. No, we do not count on any aid.  We count on equitable and serious partnership. Then we will cope  with the rest by ourselves.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] At the same time, the impression is  being created in Russia that what we are seeing in Poland is  simply some kind of NATO-mania. How do you reconcile this with  your critical attitude toward the West?    [Walesa] Right now, after the disbandment of the Warsaw  Pact, what is left is the NATO alliance--a stable, clear, and  comprehensible alliance. Meanwhile, all that was left from the  Warsaw Pact is unreliable. I have always had a great fear of the  unreliable. I do not like being caught unawares. At such a  moment as this, I would like the West to reduce the zone of  distrust by accepting us and other countries. Then we would all  be on the same side. We would sit down and talk about how things  should be and what NATO should be like. But, because we are  leaving the whole territory in a state of unreliability, there  is no knowing what might arise here: nationalisms and all kinds  of other demons, like in Yugoslavia. Anything could happen, but  we have abandoned it all: We disbanded and we destroyed, but we  did not manage to create anything. This is not directed against  Russia. This is an approach to the creation of a united security.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] So, you do not rule out the  possibility  of postcommunist revanche in some part of Europe?    [Walesa] If we leave this zone of distrust, life will find a  solution, and it might not be one we like. And the West's  attitude is facilitating such a possibility. We are already  seeing its snobbery and arrogance today. And, indeed, something  might happen that would recreate the old order. Why should we  repeat that lesson?    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] In other words, the West must insure  East Europe against possible postcommunist relapses?    [Walesa] I say again: The point is to reduce this zone of  distrust. We have not thought up anything new yet. I am  certainly not saying that the West is so good, that its  solutions are so good. We have no alternative. As Churchill  said: Democracy is the worst of all systems, but no one has  thought up anything better. If, at the moment, we do not have a  security system, if we have no other economic system, we must  affiliate to what there is and then think about it.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] When reading the Polish press, you  realize that Kaliningrad is virtually the most acute question in  relations between your country and Russia.    [Walesa] Kaliningrad, of course, is a relic of a bygone era,  like Britain's colonies. Nothing can be changed because no one  wants to fight or create a dangerous situation. Kaliningrad  could now become a linking bridge, a unique bridge at the  junction between two cultures, the peoples, and economic  concepts, but not a military base because today this is indeed a  colonial base protecting goodness knows whom and goodness knows  why. It is dreadfully costly and absolutely senseless. I know  that there is nowhere for the soldiers to be taken to. I  understand all that. it is just that we must think about how to  live not on a basis of struggle but on a basis of logic.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] But why must this base be regarded as  an attack on Poland?    [Walesa] I am not criticizing. I am simply asking the  question: If we are saying that there are no enemies and that  we do not want to struggle--either NATO against Russia or Poland  against Russia--why do we need this? An army should be  stationed where the land is poor, not in a port where there is  grain to be shipped and trade to be conducted.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Mr. President, what priorities would  you highlight in Poland's eastern policy and in Polish-Russian  relations?    [Walesa] In our era, nothing can be imposed on people. As  politicians, we must encourage, offer incentives, remove  barriers, and open up all ties. Life and the economy,  businessmen and industrialists must do their job. We can only  repeat to them: "Gentlemen, Moscow will always be nearer to  Warsaw than to Washington." And, therefore, cooperation will  always be more reliable and advantageous with Warsaw than with  Washington: nearer, cheaper, and quicker. You cannot move either  Russia or Poland to America. We are forced to depend on one  another, we let everyone profit from this illogicality, from our  squabbles. Let us come to our senses, turn this to our own  advantage, and then invite others to join in.... [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS OBJECT TO HOSPITAL'S PLAN FOR PARKING STRUCTURE  </P> <P> The June 5 Monterey Park City Council meeting will remain sadly in the memories  of the homeowners who live near Garfield Hospital. That night they were  betrayed by Councilwomen Betty Couch, Judy Chu and Pat Reichenberger and Mayor  Barry Hatch, who voted to allow the hospital to build a five-level parking  structure that will affect the quality of the homeowners' lives.  </P> <P> The council members who voted for the garage didn't care because none of them  would be affected by an ugly 40-foot wall, noise, more traffic congestion,  pollution, fear of more crime in their area and devaluation of their property.  The homeowners, concerned about the health and safety of their children and  families, pleaded to the council for help, but their pleas fell on deaf ears.  </P> <P> Something is rotten in this city when huge projects don't require an  environmental impact report. Instead, the city uses a wimpy negative  declaration that conveniently always favors money interests. The council even  refused to request a copy of the hospital's master plan. Why were they in such  a hurry to pamper the hospital and shaft the homeowners?  </P> <P> Everyone sitting on the council promised voters the moon and protection from  overdevelopment. By voting for a conditional-use permit for this project, it  means they all said one thing when they were running for office but turned 180  degrees after they were elected.  </P> <P> PHYLLIS RABINS  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Six-month setback for East Japan Railway East Japan Railway (JR East), the railway network serving eastern Japan whose shares were listed just over a year ago, yesterday reported a decline in profits for the six months to the end of September. The company said the weakness of the economy had cut demand for rail travel from both business and leisure travellers. Recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - fell by 1.9 per cent to Y72.2bn (Dollars 735m), on turnover down by 0.7 per cent at Y988.7bn. Net profits fell by 1 per cent to Y37.8bn. Revenues from sales of commuter season tickets were almost unchanged at Y253.3bn, with an increase in income from passes for the Shinkansen - the 'bullet train' - offsetting a slight fall in sales of other season tickets. Non-season ticket sales fell by 1.2 per cent to Y615bn. Property rental revenues rose 7.1 per cent to Y14.8bn, while train station retail outlet sales were up 0.4 per cent to Y23.5bn. Expenditures were heavily affected again by interest costs. The company reported a slight fall in outstanding debt to Y5,010bn as of March 31 1994. The company's debts are mostly those incurred during a period of heavy losses when it was part of the nationalised Japan National Railways in the 1980s. Even poorer prospects for the second half of the year forced JR East to revise downwards its forecasts for the full year to March 1995. The company now expects pre-tax profits of Y101.5bn, compared with an earlier forecast of Y112bn and last year's actual pre-tax profits of Y114.9bn. Turnover is expected to be around Y1,964.4bn, against an earlier forecast of Y1,968.2bn.</p>

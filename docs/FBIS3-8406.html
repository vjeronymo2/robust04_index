"The first stage  of the new presidential tour" daily LIBERTATEA writes, "was  Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, where, considering that Romania  and Lithuania have had similar political evolution and  principles, Presidents Ion Iliescu and Algirdas Brazauskas  signed the first Treaty of Friendship and Collaboration between  the two countries." The government daily VOCEA ROMANIEI  emphasizes in a commentary entitled "The First Steps Toward  Rewarding Cooperation" the Lithuanian head of state's assessment  made during a dinner according to which "this visit has given  new impetus to the Lithuanian-Romanian relations, materialized  among other things in bilateral agreements, a political  agreement included." Also, the Lithuanian head of state  expressed the confidence that "it is about the first steps on  the path of a cooperation rewarding for either party." In turn,  President Iliescu noted that "the visit is a welcome opportunity  to single out the traditions of the relations between our  countries and peoples, the similarity of certain moments and  stages in their remote history."    "What seems noteworthy to me," writes the CRONICA ROMANA  special envoy, "is the moment at which Romania is signing the  treaty with Lithuania, a country which has not regretted for a  moment its disjoining from the CIS. The contacts between  Romanian and Lithuanian businessmen proved promising for either  party. A fine winter tale has been written in Vilnius, of two  countries that are being united faster and more thoroughly than  we could suspect, by their poverty and problems. And they, the  Lithuanians, are close enough for the relations between the two  countries to follow the growth confirmed through the treaty  signed yesterday".    The DIMINEATA envoy in Vilnius opines in his dispatch that  "the presence of Romania's president in the Lithuanian capital  and especially the political Treaty of Friendship and  Collaboration between the two states have meanings that cannot  be missed by analysts. Above all, both states were among the  first (Romania was the very first) to sign the Partnership for  Peace with the NATO and that was not prompted by the wish to  remake the 'sanitary belt' through which the west seemed to  isolate the Soviet empire in the inter-bellum period, but in  order to build a system of relations meant to secure their quiet  which they need so much in order to build a market economy and a  state of law, in the lastingness of which they are equally  interested".</p>

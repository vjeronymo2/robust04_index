			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Iri plans L600bn sale of property interests Iri, the Italian state holding company, is planning to sell off its surplus property interests over the next few months in a gradual privatisation which could raise more than L600bn (Dollars 380m). The sale is a small part of the Italian government's privatisation programme, which should move into a new phase after the autumn when plans to sell Enel, the electricity generator, and Stet, the telecommunications holding company, are finalised. Iri's approach to the property sale makes it clear that it is concerned not to neglect its smaller interests. A new subsidiary, Sofinpar-IGP, has been set up to conduct the sale, and full-page advertisements have been placed in the Italian press. The advertisements underline that this is not a liquidation, and that the property will be sold according to 'clear acquisition procedures, precise market rules and in the light of a programme of property valuation'. Some 80 per cent of the property on sale is industrial, but Iri is also putting on the market certain residential and tourist properties, including a seaside park near Genoa and a sporting and leisure complex further down the coast in Liguria. The Italian press has also made much of the fact that 250,000 square metres of former industrial land is on sale close to the villa of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, at Arcore, near Milan. Apart from the overall figure of 'more than L600bn', Iri has not specified individual prices for the land and property, but it has already established minimum prices internally. The items will be sold to the highest bidder, but if the offers are inadequate, or no buyers appear, the company reserves the right to withdraw the property from the sale, or begin a new procedure.</p>

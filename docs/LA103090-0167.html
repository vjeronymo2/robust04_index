			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHITTIER CHRISTIAN RELOADS;  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL: HERALDS REPLACE THEIR POWERHOUSE BACKFIELD WITH DEFENSIVE END  RON RECTOR AND LINEBACKER REX PRITCHARD.  </P> <P> When running backs Ron Papazian and Scott Jordan graduated from Whittier  Christian High School last June, they took nearly 85% of the Heralds' scoring  offense with them.  </P> <P> Papazian, a fullback-linebacker, set the Orange County single-season scoring  record last year with 35 touchdowns and 1,475 yards rushing. Jordan, a  tailback, scored 12 touchdowns and ran for 1,360 yards.  </P> <P> But Whittier Christian Coach Phil Bravo didn't panic when practice started this  fall.  </P> <P> He knew the Heralds' running backs of the future were standing on the other  side of the line of scrimmage.  </P> <P> Bravo looked no further than defensive end and inside linebacker to find his  new starting backfield.  </P> <P> Filling Papazian's fullback position was defensive end Ron Rector, an  aggressive, 5-foot-10, 170-pound senior with a Brian Bosworth 'do.  </P> <P> Taking over at tailback was Rex Pritchard, a clean-cut, 5-9, 160-pound senior  who was an all-Olympic League selection at linebacker last season.  </P> <P> The newcomers have worked out nicely so far this year, rushing for a combined  1,617 yards and 22 touchdowns while keeping the Heralds (7-0, 2-0) in the chase  for their sixth league title in 10 years. They'll be in the backfield Saturday  when Whittier Christian plays host to Orange Lutheran.  </P> <P> "We never rebuild," Bravo said. "We just reload.  </P> <P> "Everyone always says, 'This is the year, this time they're done because they  don't have anyone coming back.' But we always have somebody step in."  </P> <P> This year it's Rector, who has 817 yards and 15 touchdowns, and Pritchard, who  has 800 yards and eight touchdowns. Rector averages 7.2 yards per carry and  Pritchard averages 6.7 yards.  </P> <P> "I always said we would miss Papazian more defensively than we did  offensively," Bravo said.  </P> <P> Still, Pritchard and Rector were expected to deliver this season. Big things  are always expected from players at a small school (enrollment 700) with a  winning football tradition.  </P> <P> "We're not as strong a running force as Ron and Scott were," Rector said.  "There has been a ton of pressure on me to fill Ron's shoes. It's pretty hard."  </P> <P> Said Pritchard: "There's not a lot of pressure, but I do think about what Scott  did. I watched films of him during the summer. I really didn't expect to start  this season."  </P> <P> Rector had limited experience at fullback, rushing for 68 yards last year while  backing up Papazian.  </P> <P> But Pritchard had to learn his new position from scratch. As a junior, he had  all but begged the coaches to let him play tailback, but they told him he was  too slow.  </P> <P> "I ran a 4.99-second 40-yard dash last year," Pritchard said. "I wanted to play  offense pretty bad, so I worked in the weight room during the summer and worked  on my speed."  </P> <P> Pritchard ran the 40 in 4.68 seconds this fall. Bravo gave him the starting  job.  </P> <P> "I really want to get 1,000 yards this season," Pritchard said.  </P> <P> Both players have found plenty of running room behind an offensive line that is  considered one of the best in the league.  </P> <P> "Even an average running back could come in and run well behind our line," said  Tom Caffrey, the offensive line coach.  </P> <P> Pritchard agreed.  </P> <P> "You could drive a truck through some of the holes our line opens up," he said.  "Our line just runs people over. All I have to do is get the ball."  </P> <P> Pritchard and Rector have been getting the ball a lot this season. Pritchard  averages 17 carries per game and Rector 16.  </P> <P> And they have been getting the ball in important situations too. Three weeks  ago, Whittier Christian was trailing Valley Christian, 28-7, early in the third  quarter when the duo started grinding out the yards on four drives.  </P> <P> The Heralds' second-half scoring:  </P> <P>  -- Pritchard, 24-yard run.  </P> <P>  -- Pritchard, five-yard run.  </P> <P>  -- David Whitby, four-yard pass from Nick Sanchez.  </P> <P>  -- Rector, three-yard run.  </P> <P> Final score: Whittier Christian 33, Valley Christian 28.  </P> <P> Rector's touchdown came with the Heralds trailing, 28-27, with 3 minutes 24  seconds left in the game.  </P> <P> The Heralds have a knack for playing catch-up this season. They've come back in  the second half to win three of their seven games.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it takes a little slapping around to get us (ticked) off," Rector  said. "That way we don't get all cocky."  </P> <P> Pritchard and Rector have seen plenty of Whittier Christian comebacks in the  last 10 years. They grew up watching their older brothers play for the Heralds.  </P> <P> Pritchard's brother, Mike, played for the Heralds' Southern Section  championship teams in 1984 and '85. Rector's brother, Randy, played for  Whittier Christian's 9-3 team in 1988.  </P> <P> Rector lives in La Habra and could have gone to La Habra High School. Pritchard  lives in Fullerton and could have gone to Sonora.  </P> <P> "I used to play ball in the back of the end zone while my brother was  practicing," Pritchard said. "Then, after practice, he would throw me the ball  and tackle me. I always wanted to come here because of the football program."  </P> <P> This will be Pritchard's last year of organized football. Rector is undecided  about his future.  </P> <P> But both have one goal in mind -- another league title and trip to the  playoffs.  </P> <P> "We just have to keep ourselves psyched," Rector said. "We know that if we  screw up once, we'll lose it."  </P></p>

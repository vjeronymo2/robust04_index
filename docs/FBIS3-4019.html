Construction of the six-sq-km Changshan new area has been  started. The officials said they plan to complete land  leveling, roads, water and power supply projects within one year.    According to the plan, the new area will be a complex of  banking, office, shopping, entertainment and residential  buildings.    Administrating three urban districts and a suburban county,  with a combined population of 700,000, the one-year-old city has  been working hard to improve its infrastructures.    In the past year, the city invested 523 million yuan in  fixed  assets construction projects, including five mid-sized berths  for its port, a 6.7-sq-km landfill project, a 49-km highway, and  telecommunications networks.    In a few years, the city will have a new center on a piece  of  seaside wilderness stretching 30 sq km, the officials said.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Government cancels Pounds 75m relocation of prisons HQ THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced the cancellation of a Pounds 75m project to relocate the headquarters of the Prison Service to Derby because of public spending pressures. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said that, faced with important demands on resources to finance and equip the police and expand and refurbish prisons, he would 'not be justified in spending large sums of money on a new headquarters building'. The government had intended to locate up to 2,000 civil servants in a new 450,000 sq ft building at St Mary's Wharf, Derby. About 60 per cent would have moved from central London, Croydon, Birmingham and Corby, with the remainder new staff recruited locally. Contracts were awarded in the spring, and site work on what would have been Derby's biggest office development had already begun. Mr Clarke said yesterday 'tens of millions of pounds' would be saved by cancellation of the project. However, the home office could not say what cancellation charges the government may face by withdrawing at this late stage. Hyperion Properties, the main developer, said yesterday it was 'commercially covered' against the cancellation. Directors of AMEC, awarded the Pounds 57m building contract by Hyperion, will meet to consider the position next week. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said he would demand a full explanation from Mr Clarke. 'He must tell us whether it is true that over Pounds 11m has already been spent on the project and he must publish full details of any penalty clause.' Mr Nick Brown, leader of Derby City Council, is due to meet Mr Clarke next Wednesday and will urge him to regard the project as postponed rather than cancelled. 'If the government decides to go ahead with the relocation in the future, we should not have to go through the process of bidding for it all over again.' However, Mr Clarke's decision raises doubts over whether the project will ever be revived, certainly on its current scale.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORMIE JONES AILING AFTER LIVER SURGERY  </P> <P> Doctors for 12-year-old Stormie Jones, the world's first recipient of a  heart-liver transplant, spent much of Wednesday trying to stop internal  bleeding that began shortly after her second liver transplant.  </P> <P> Doctors at Children's Hospital suspected internal bleeding when the girl's  blood pressure began dropping Tuesday night, seven hours after her transplant  surgery ended. She had regained consciousness and was listed in critical  condition.  </P> <P> Doctors decided Feb. 13 that Stormie, who lives in the Ft. Worth suburb of  White Settlement, needed a new liver. The liver she received in 1984 had been  damaged by hepatitis.  </P></p>

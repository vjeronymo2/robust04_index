			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Gradual fall in shekel planned ISRAEL'S financial community has given a mixed response to measures to reduce inflation and reform foreign currency controls, announced by the Bank of Israel and the Treasury. From today a 2 per cent import surcharge and a 2 per cent export subsidy are to be scrapped. There will also be a gradual 2 per cent shift in the central rate of the shekel, in effect a gradual devaluation. Announcing the measures on Saturday, Mr Jacob Frenkel, central bank governor, and Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, stated their intention to let the currency depreciate at an annual rate of 6 per cent. The changes, said Mr Frenkel, were intended to move Israel closer to eliminating all foreign exchange controls, creating a unified exchange rate for the shekel, as well as to stimulate the economy. He expressed the hope that they would allow a significant reduction in interest rates. Mr Shochat said he hoped the moves would lower inflation next year to 8 per cent, from a predicted 10 per cent for 1993. 'They will also fuel growth in the economy, stability and a gradual reduction in unemployment,' he said. Israeli financial analysts hailed the package as a step forward in the fight against inflation, but leading industrialists said it did not go far enough. Mr Dan Propper, president of the Manufacturers' Association, called for an immediate 3 percentage point cut in interest rates, and protested that the scrapping of the import levy and the exports surcharge would undermine Israeli competitiveness. Several leading industrialists are known to have been pressing for an immediate 6 per cent devaluation of the shekel.</p>

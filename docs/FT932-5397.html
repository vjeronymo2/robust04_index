			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Invesco MIM fined Pounds 750,000: Fund manager admits to 55 charges, including three over Mirror Group assets INVESCO MIM, the fund management group, has admitted 55 charges of breaching City rules and is paying a record fine of Pounds 750,000 plus Pounds 1.6m in costs associated with the disciplinary action. The charges, which were brought by Imro, the self-regulating organisation which polices the fund management industry, severely criticise Invesco's internal controls and its compliance procedures up to December 1992. However, Imro and the Securities and Investments Board, which is the City's senior regulator, agree that the fund management group has taken steps to change its management and compliance procedures which should prevent repetition of such rule breaches. The charges are a litany of misconduct by Invesco. They say it breached rules on the handling of client money, issued a misleading advertisement, supplied unsatisfactory regulatory information to Imro, carried out business outside of permitted areas, kept defective records, failed to provide investors with accurate and timely information and made unsuitable investments on behalf of customers. Three of the charges relate to the conduct of one of the group's companies, Invesco MIM Management, concerning assets belonging to the Mirror Group Pension Scheme, which was plundered by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. They say the company failed to keep Imro properly informed of its concerns about the way in which the pension fund assets under its management were being used. They also say the company failed to disclose to the pension fund trustees on periodic statements that it no longer had custody of investments it was managing on their behalf. The SIB said yesterday: 'We are very interested in seeking proper redress for Maxwell pension funds.' The Imro judgment may help SIB's campaign to persuade Invesco and other firms to make contributions to the Maxwell Pensions Unit, which has been set up to raise funds for pensioners of Mr Maxwell's companies. SIB is keeping in reserve its powers under the Financial Services Act to force restitution to Maxwell pensioners. Mr Charles Brady, executive chairman of Invesco, said: 'Invesco has participated fully and openly in this investigation. But this is a historic overhang. My message to shareholders is watch us now.' He said Invesco had restructured with three separate boards who would be more accountable to 'local clients and regulators'. He disclosed that 22 senior executives had left the group and up to 30 more at junior levels. Those who have gone in the last few months include several board members and the former chairman, Lord Stevens, who stopped working at Invesco last September but who will be paid until September, receiving more than Pounds 200,000 this financial year. Lord Stevens is chairman of United Newspapers, owner of Express Newspapers. Mr Brady said he had also held 'very serious conversations' with Invesco's auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick. 'Any professional adviser I find has been deficient will be removed,' he said. The Imro judgment, which imposed the maximum fines available under Imro's 'summary' process, was delivered on May 28 by a three-person disciplinary committee drawn from its board, and based on a two-year investigation. Mr John Morgan, chief executive of Imro, said: 'This is a good day for regulation. It is quite an indictment.' But, he said, he 'acknowledged the work the management has done'. Invesco has made a Pounds 4.5m provision in its accounts to cover the costs of the investigation and restructuring as a result. In addition to the fines and costs, it said its own legal bills are about Pounds 250,000. Litany of charges, Page 10 Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Deficit trimmed at Bond Corporation to ADollars 435m BOND Corporation, the former quoted flagship of Mr Alan Bond, yesterday announced net losses of ADollars 435m (USDollars 311m)for the year to June, increasing its accumulated losses to ADollars 2.5bn. However, the result was an improvement on Bond Corp's ADollars 642m in the previous year, and its losses of ADollars 2.24bn in 1989-90. Sales fell by 54 per cent to ADollars 155m, reflecting the continuing sale of the group's assets. Bond Corp has been operating under a scheme of arrangement administered by Ferrier Hodgson, an accounting firm, since August 1991, 11 months after Mr Bond was forced to resign as chairman. Mr Ian Ferrier and Mr Garry Trevor, the joint administrators, said the latest loss was attributable mainly to ADollars 198m in interest expenses and unrealised foreign exchange losses of ADollars 187m. The company also revealed it had total assets of ADollars 334.64m on June 30 and liabilities of ADollars 2.67bn.</p>

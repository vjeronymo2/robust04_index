			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Efim defence transfer agreed THE reorganisation of the companies in Italy's troubled defence sector was brought a step closer yesterday. The government has allowed the defence companies in the portfolio of Efim, the state industrial holding placed in liquidation a year ago, to be taken over without payment by Finmeccanica, the main industrial and high-technology arm of IRI, the state holding company. Efim possesses seven main defence groups employing 11,400 people with turnover of L2,269bn (Dollars 1.4bn). The principal problem has been to find a formula which guaranteed the survival of these companies, at least those with recognised leadership in technology, and keep sufficient control within Italian hands. Since January, Finmeccanica has been managing the Efim defence interests on a temporary six-month contract. Finmeccanica stated that it was only willing to take over the Efim defence companies if their balance sheets were thoroughly examined and the government agreed to outline a clear programme of defence needs and procurement plans. Only on this basis, Finmeccanica argued, could the companies be absorbed and rationalised, fitting into its own defence interests grouped around Alenia, the aerospace group. Otherwise, Finmeccanica said it could only undertake to run the companies as an operator without financial responsibility - at least so long as they were loss-making. The government failed to come up with a defence procurement programme by June 30, and a decision was delayed for a further 15 days. Yesterday's move appeared a hurried attempt to put in place the outlines for what will be a more timely process of guaranteeing work in the defence procurement programme. In a separate development, representatives of foreign banks, owed L4,400bn as a result of Efim being put into liquidation and payments being frozen, yesterday met Treasury officials in Rome. They are understood to have pressed the Treasury to urge Brussels to lift its veto, imposed more than three months ago, on about L7,000bn of funds earmarked by the Italian government for Efim creditors and suppliers. Of the L9,000bn so far agreed by the government to fund the liquidation and cover outstanding Efim debts, only L2,000bn has been given the green light by Brussels.</p>

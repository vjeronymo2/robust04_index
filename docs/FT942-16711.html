			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Laidlaw earnings tumble 40% Laidlaw, the Ontario-based waste and passenger services group, blamed the Los Angeles earthquake, harsh winter weather and regulatory problems at its flagship hazardous waste dump for a 40 per cent drop in earnings in its second quarter. Net income fell to USDollars 17m, or 6 cents a share, in the three months to February 28, from Dollars 28.1m, or 10 cents, a year earlier. Revenues climbed to Dollars 520.4m from Dollars 469m. Laidlaw's results no longer include any contribution from its 24 per cent stake in ADT, the international security and vehicle auction group. The Canadian company began distancing itself from ADT last January through an issue of debentures which it can redeem with its ADT shares. Income from Attwoods, the UK-based waste management company in which Laidlaw has a 35 per cent stake, fell to less than Dollars 1m from Dollars 4.3m, due to a previously-announced special charge. Mr Jim Bullock, chief executive, predicted an improvement for the rest of the year, due to the strengthening US economy and to a flurry of acquisitions of US ambulance operators. The move into ambulance services is expected to contribute Dollars 125m to fiscal 1994 revenues.</p>

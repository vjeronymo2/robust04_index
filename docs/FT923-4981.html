			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Toshiba to form battery link with Asahi TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics company, and Asahi Chemical Industry, the leading synthetic fibre maker, yesterday agreed to establish a joint venture company to develop, manufacture and market rechargeable batteries for portable electronic equipment, writes Steven Butler. The companies are to manufacture lithium ion rechargeable batteries, which, they claim, are light, small and environmentally friendly. Power supply for electronic devices is becoming the bottleneck that limits portability or use time for items such as notebook computers or cellular telephones. The companies say lithium ion batteries provide twice the capacity of nickel cadmium batteries. The venture is to be called A&amp;T Battery. Sample shipment and marketing will begin next month, while mass production will start in October next year with a monthly production volume of 500,000 batteries. Sales of Y30bn (Dollars 244m) are targeted for 1997.</p>

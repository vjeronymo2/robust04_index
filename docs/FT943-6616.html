			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Sport: The hardest test - Tennis / John Barrett explains why the US Open takes such a toll For US tennis this is the best of times, the worst of times. With record prize money of Dollars 9,360,100, the US Open which begins on Monday in New York is the richest tournament of the year. Furthermore, the defending champion and No 1 men's seed Pete Sampras is American. So is the man he displaced from that position, Jim Courier. However, both are competing under a cloud. Sampras has still not recovered from the ankle injury he sustained in retaining his Wimbledon crown in July and Courier, down now to No 11 in the rankings, may retire from the game for an indefinite period because he no longer enjoys it. Nor is there any comfort for USTA President 'Bumpy' Frazer in the women's game, which a few years ago was dominated by Americans. Neither Martina Navratilova (a naturalised American) nor the disgraced Jennifer Capriati is playing and of the five American names that appear among the list of 16 seeds, the highest is the promising but inexperienced teenager Lindsay Davenport at No 6. Then there is the problem of injuries. Apart from Sampras, so many of the game's leading players are affected that this year's championships are in danger of resembling an episode of Casualty. The walking wounded include defending women's champion Steffi Graf (back) and two of the men's seeds - No 2 Goran Ivanisevic (hip) and No 9 Todd Martin (groin)  - as well as the Swiss No 1 and Olympic champion, Marc Rosset (shoulder). In addition, trainers Bill Norris and Todd Snyder report dozens of minor ailments among the lesser names. The unyielding hard courts at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadow always subject competitors to a searching test of fitness and stamina in the often oppressive, sultry heat. Coming at the end of a six-week build-up circuit on similar surfaces, more and more players enter carrying some niggling injury so that upsets abound. This year will be no exception. But who will the victims be? Thursday's draw was kind to world No 1 Sampras. Already the winner in Australia and at Wimbledon, he is attempting to emulate Jimmy Connors (1974) and Mats Wilander (1988), the last men to win three Grand Slam titles in the same year. Even though short of match play, Sampras should limp past Korda and either Medvedev or Berasategui to reach the quarter-finals where either Stich or one of the two former champions, Courier and Edberg, should be in wait. Stich has had a miserable year. He lost in the first rounds in Australia and at Wimbledon. In Paris he went out in the second round. Courier is in a slump. After reaching the semi-finals in Australia and Paris he lost in the second round at Wimbledon and, as mentioned, has lost the zest upon which his whole game depends. Edberg is another fading star. No longer can we expect to see him produce the sort of electrifying performance that won him the title in 1991. That day he played the best tennis of his life to destroy Courier. The popular favourite will the Andre Agassi. Down to No 20 in the rankings, this flamboyant showman is unseeded and is due to play either Guy Forget or former champion Mats Wilander who clash in the best of the first round matches. Ahead in this section lie Wayne Ferreira and Michael Chang, an American who in 1994 has seen the best of times and has a seeding (No 6) to prove it. Perhaps the best outsider, if one can so describe a former champion, is Boris Becker. Suddenly rejuvenated, suddenly refocused with the help of coach Nick Bollettieri, Boris comes to New York with two recent tournament successes in Los Angeles and New Haven. He also arrives with his wife Barbara and baby son Noah. It is wonderful what fatherhood can do for you . . . The only two direct British entries, Jeremy Bates and Mark Petchey, have both been drawn against opponents whom they are capable of beating. Bates, at 72, is ranked 39 places ahead of Venezuela's Maurice Ruah who is at his best on clay. Petchey, ranked 84, is 11 places higher than Karol Kucera, a 20-year-old Slovak, another who grew up on clay. However, after the trauma of the losing Davis Cup tie against Romania in Manchester I have ceased making predictions about British players. I am prepared to predict that Steffi Graf will not lose in the first round here like she did at Wimbledon. In fact, in spite of her recent loss to the No 2 seed, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, in Montreal, I can see no reason why Graf and Sampras will not claim the equal first prizes of Dollars 550,000. Yes, for the best of players it should once again be the best of times.</p>

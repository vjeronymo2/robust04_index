			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: What the case has cost SFO fraud investigation and prosecution. No official figures are available but at its height, the two-year inquiry involved a large team of police and considerable foreign travel. Comparisons with similar investigations would suggest a figure approaching Pounds 2m Mr Nadir's legal costs. Fees to date including defence work from Mr Anthony Scrivener, QC and two solicitors' firms, Vizards and Pannone &amp; Partners - which have been largely met from legal aid - are believed to have exceeded Pounds 1m Trustee in bankruptcy. Fees from Neil Cooper and staff at accountants Robson Rhodes since Mr Nadir was driven into bankruptcy by a writ from Polly Peck's administrators are believed to exceed Pounds 100,000 Polly Peck administration. Professional fees and costs from accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Touche Ross and from legal advisers were last reported in October 1992 at Pounds 15.6m Money out of pocket to Polly Peck creditors. Proportion of assets in the company likely to be repaid to banks and other creditors are estimated to be up to just 10p in the pound</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Stretching the dollar The conspicuous failure of the G7 leaders to mention the currency markets in their summit communique suggests they are back to a policy of benign neglect of the dollar. That need not surprise, since the main players had little incentive to tackle the dollar's decline in the first place. As the Bush administration frets about November's election, it must be groping for any means of reviving the US economy. A weak dollar should give at least some encouragement to exports. That is bad news for French and British exporters. But Japan cannot complain because of its own large payments surplus, while low import prices benefit Germany's anti-inflation drive. Just the same, confirmation of official indifference is the latest in a growing list of reasons for expecting further dollar weakness. Exchange markets are also increasingly sceptical of President Bush's chances of re-election. The D-Mark is being driven up by devaluation talk swirling round the lira and perhaps even sterling. All in all, the chances are that the dollar would be under pressure even without a differential of more than six percentage points between short rates in New York and Frankfurt. Less certain is quite how much further the dollar has to fall. On a purchasing power basis, it is now significantly undervalued, while US inflation at both the retail and wholesale level is lower than in Germany. The Federal Reserve may cut rates one more time, which would widen the differential still further. But the latest car sales figures show the outlook is not entirely bleak. Even if there is another cut, exchange dealers must sooner or later start discounting a narrowing of the interest rate gap. When that happens, the dollar could bounce back sharply. It may be expensive to hold the currency now, but the point must be approaching where it is risky to sell it short.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' PICKS: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JUDGE 'ROY BEAN  </P> <P> KCOP, Friday at 8 p.m. John Huston and John Milius joined forces as director  and writer, respectively, of this whimsical, highly sophisticated mock-heroic  Western starring Paul Newman in the title role as the tough hoobre who brought  law and order to the Texas Badlands and became part of the folklore of the Old  West. Like Arthur Penn's "Little Big Man," this fine and undeservedly  overlooked 1972 film plays upon our traditional love of the tall tale to  confront us witt what the cherished myths of the frontier reveal about our-  selves and our heritage.  </P> <P> TIN MEN  </P> <P> KNBC, Monday at 9 p.m. Barry Levinson's 1987 comedy takes its title from a  group of wheeling-dealing aluminum-siding salesmen in Baltimore in 1963.  Hilarious, original and gritty, it stars Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito as  fierce rivals. Not surprisingly, DeVito's wife, Barbara Hershey, proves to be  the pivotal character.  </P> <P> WORKING GIRL  </P> <P> TMC, Sunday at 7 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m. and 2 a.m.; HBO, Sunday at 8 p.m.,  Wednesday at midnight, Saturday at 10:30 p.m.; Showtime, Monday at 8 p.m.,  Friday at 11 p.m. Melanie Griffith emerged as a star in this 1988 film, which  ranks as onn of the key comedies of the T80s. Griffith is irresistible as the  sexy, ambitious blue-collar secretary to the deliciously arrogant Sigourney  Weaver, and Harrison Ford is the man in the middle. A terrific blend of satire,  fantasy and romance directed by Mike Nichols and written by Kevin Wade.  </P> <P> RASHOMON  </P> <P> TNT, Sunday at 7 p.m. The 1951 Akira Kurosawa classic opened up the Japanese  cinema to the West and contributed an expression to our language. It's the  dazzling period story of an alleged rape told from conflicting points of view,  suggesting the relativity of truth. Kevin Thomas  </P></p>

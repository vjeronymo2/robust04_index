"It is not right that our industry should find itself back  in  the doldrums, that a large part of our wholesale and retail  industry has fallen into the hands of foreigners and that our  farm exports are still subject to a trading system that bears an  irritating resemblance to the aberrations of the colonial era,"  he said in a year end address to the nation.    Konan Bedie, who succeeded to the presidency after  Houphouet-Boigny's death on December 7, said the country needed  quick solutions that could put the country back on the rails.    He added that the country was on the road to recovery when  it  came to balancing the budget and trade deficit.</p>

For fairness' sake, it must be said that cases in which this  disease has been discovered in Russian territory have been been  noted before. They were all, however, attributed to the disease  being carried in from abroad. The biggest cholera outbreak  occurred in 1990 at one of the tourist hotels in the Stavropolsk  kray, where 49 persons took ill and were immediately  hospitalized as a result of contact with infected arrivals from  Siberia. In the past 2 years, the infection was brought in to  our country from Indochina: In 1991, two such cases occurred,  and in 1992 there were already five. The situation has continued  to worsen this year. In July-August alone, 17 patients and  carriers of the vibrio linked to cholera being carried in from  India, Pakistan, and Turkey have been recorded in Makhachkala,  Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar, and Naberezhnyye Chelny.    Although physicians have somehow become accustomed to  cholera  imported from abroad, the occurrence of ``local'' foci of  cholera on Russian territory has not been seen since the end of  the 1970s and has become an unpleasant novelty for them.  Nevertheless, the absence of patients did not, in the  specialists' opinion, mean that cholera was completely over  within the country. Vibrios have been isolated from open water  reservoirs in many regions, including in Moscow, even in the  best years.    The storm finally hit this summer. A fishermen who drank  untreated water from the local canal became ill and died in  Kaspiysk (Dagestan). The disease was also discovered in his  wife. At the republic hospital in Makhachkala, a 4-month-old  child has been found who contracted the disease elsewhere.    A second case of cholera caused by local sources has already  occurred in Moscow. Here on 8 August, a vagrant suffering from  cholera was brought to the No. 2 Clinical Infection Hospital.  Yet another person from those with whom he socialized turned out  to be a carrier of the disease's causative agent. If one  considers that there are generally 10 carriers of the cholera  vibrio for one patient, it is entirely possible that he may not  be the last. Physicians continue to actively seek all those who  had been in contact with the patient.</p>

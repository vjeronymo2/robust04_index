			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CS FULLERTON TO PLAY HOST TO UC IRVINE IN BATTLE FOR 7TH IN BIG WEST CONFERENCE  </P> <P> The Cal State Fullerton-UC Irvine rivalry may not have lost its meaning for the  players, but it certainly doesn't have the kind of impact on the Big West  Conference race it once did.  </P> <P> Fullerton, 8-9 overall and 3-5 in the Big West, will play host to the Anteaters  (6-11, 3-5) at 7:30 tonight in Titan Gym with the winner taking over seventh  place in the Big West standings.  </P> <P> The Titans are coming off a 65-44 defeat at Fresno State Monday night that  Coach John Sneed labeled a "total embarrassment." The loss snapped a 3-game  winning streak.  </P> <P> Irvine, 1-8 on the road, committed 23 turnovers in Saturday night's 75-70 loss  at Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan has been unhappy with his guards' shooting, so the  Anteaters will try to get the ball to center Mike Doktorczyk, who is second in  the nation in 3-point field goal percentage at 58.7%, and power forward Ricky  Butler, who had a career-high 17 points and 8 rebounds against Long Beach.  </P> <P> Fullerton is led by Cedric Ceballos, who is averaging 21 points and 9 rebounds  a game. JOHN WEYLER  </P></p>

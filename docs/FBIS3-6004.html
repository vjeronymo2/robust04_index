General Doan  Khue, member of the party Central Committee Political Bureau,  deputy secretary of the Military Commission of the party Central  Committee, and minister of National Defense, attended the  conference.    During the three-day meeting, the conference reviewed and  appraised tasks during the past two years. The conference noted  that the party organization has provided valuable guidance and  supervision to the Navy, thereby firmly strengthening its  political position and resolving numerous difficulties. The  Navy has made great progress in building strong and pure  grass-roots party chapters while comprehensively building strong  and firm units and fulfilling other assigned tasks.    In the days ahead, the Navy party organization will  integrate  its efforts to strengthen the party building task, while helping  the Navy to strengthen its political position. Efforts must be  made to enhance its combat readiness to build the Navy into a  standard, modern, and seasoned force, thereby effectively  defending the fatherland's sovereignty and territorial integrity.    Addressing the conference, Gen. Doan Khue stressed that the  duty of defending the territorial integrity and the fatherland's  coastal region and offshore islands is one of the two strategic  tasks of our entire party, people, and armed forces. The Navy  party organization must attach importance to helping the Navy to  enhance its political background and develop its spirit of  self-reliance in maintaining and utilizing military equipment,  thereby meeting requirements of our armed forces in the current  stage.</p>

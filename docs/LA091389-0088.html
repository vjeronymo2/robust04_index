			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW EFFORT TO REVIVE IRA TAX BREAKS;  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS OFFER PLAN AS OPTION TO ADMINISTRATION'S CALL FOR CAPITAL GAINS CUTS  </P> <P> Key Senate Democrats, in a surprise move that could pose a political challenge  for President Bush, Tuesday proposed restoring tax breaks for all persons who  save money in individual retirement accounts. The proposal was offered as an  alternative to the Bush plan for cutting taxes on capital gains.  </P> <P> In principle, encouraging personal savings and lowering capital gains taxes  would both tend to increase the nation's long-term economic strength and  competitiveness by encouraging investment in future productivity. And, at least  initially, Bush hopes that the lower capital gains taxes he wants would produce  a surge in government revenue to help with the deficit.  </P> <P> But the Democrats' proposal has the political advantage of reinstating a form  of tax shelter that was enormously popular among middle-income voters before it  was curtailed in the 1986 tax changes. As a further sweetener, the proposal  would sanction early withdrawal of IRA funds for buying a house or paying  college tuition -- expenses that hang heavy over the heads of many Americans.  </P> <P> The proposal suggests that a number of congressional Democratic leaders, rather  than seeking a compromise on capital gains taxes, now may try to fight the  President with an alternative designed to appeal to precisely the kinds of  voters who have been the core of his political strength.  </P> <P> Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), flanked by a handful  of Democrats on his panel, announced the plan to allow all taxpayers to receive  at least a partial writeoff on IRA contributions and to permit early withdrawal  of IRA funds for home buying or college.  </P> <P> "Because of huge, continuing federal deficits, we cannot enact both the Bentsen  IRA legislation and the capital gains tax cut proposed by President Bush,"  Bentsen said. "We must make a choice and . . . with the IRA we'd have the  participation of a broad spectrum of middle America."  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Maine) told reporters that he  fully supports Bentsen's proposal as an alternative to cutting capital gains  taxes. The White House capital gains tax plan only provides a "large cut for a  small group of Americans -- those at the very top of the income scale,"  Mitchell said, adding:  </P> <P> "The Senate and the American people now have a clear choice between competing  plans to advance our economy."  </P> <P> Under Bentsen's proposal, taxpayers who are now ineligible for a tax break on  IRAs could claim a $1 tax deduction for each $2 saved in an IRA, up to a  maximum contribution of $2,000. That would provide a maximum writeoff of $1,000  for each taxpayer. Those who are currently allowed to take a full writeoff --  taxpayers who are not covered by a pension plan or whose income falls below  certain limits -- would not be affected by the change.  </P> <P> The plan would also allow all taxpayers with IRAs to withdraw money from their  accounts before reaching age 59 1/2 without paying the current 10% penalty as  long as the money was used to buy a home or to pay college education expenses  of a family member.  </P> <P> Bentsen's proposal represents a sharp change in position and clouds the widely  expected prospect that Congress would approve a capital gains tax reduction  this year. And even if Bush gets his way, the Bentsen plan at least gives  Democrats ammunition to criticize the White House for tax giveaways to the  wealthy, who would be the prime beneficiaries of a capital gains tax cut.  </P> <P> Only two weeks ago, Bentsen said that he was exploring ways to reduce capital  gains taxes, which are imposed on profits from the sale of stocks, real estate  and other assets.  </P> <P> The Senate proposal comes as the House Ways and Means Committee, which has been  torn over capital gains for months, struggles this week to forge an agreement  between its chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), and a dissident faction  that currently enjoys a slim majority on the House tax-writing committee.  </P> <P> Bentsen's announcement also upstaged the kickoff of a campaign by Treasury  Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to promote higher U.S. savings and investment. In a  speech Tuesday evening to the American Business Conference, a group  representing fast-growing business firms, Brady announced that the  Administration would like to offer new incentives for savings and work toward  the elimination of the double taxation of corporate dividends.  </P> <P> But Brady offered no specifics on what incentives the Administration might  propose to spur savings, opening the way for the Democrats to take the lead on  the issue.  </P> <P> "A reduction in capital gains tax rates remains our top priority," a Treasury  spokesman said. "After we move forward on that issue, we will be looking at  incentives for improving personal savings rate."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called a Mistake  </P> <P> Treasury officials, worried that corporate America is becoming too burdened  with debt, said the Administration's initial goal is to win approval of a  capital gains tax cut and then to look at possible tax changes aimed at  discouraging a heavy reliance on borrowing. Those tax changes are aimed more at  encouraging wealthy taxpayers and corporations to make long-run investments  than at benefits for average taxpayers.  </P> <P> By reducing the current practice of taxing both individual investors and  corporations for the same dividend payments, Brady said the Administration  could help "end the bias of the tax system toward debt financing."  </P> <P> A senior Treasury official, however, acknowledged that the budget deficit  limits the government's ability to provide much tax relief for dividends.  </P> <P> Brady said the Administration continues to oppose proposals to limit the  deductibility of corporate interest payments. "This would be a mistake," he  said. "We ought not to make capital more expensive for American companies and  hurt their ability to compete."  </P> <P> The Treasury official, who spoke only on the condition that he not be  identified, also made it clear that proposals to introduce a broad consumption  tax and revive the investment tax credit are unlikely to go far in  Administration circles.  </P> <P> Bentsen's plan to revive tax breaks for IRAs caught Senate Republicans by  surprise, but it was immediately embraced by some longtime supporters of  savings incentives. "I'm happy to see Sen. Bentsen joining the fight for IRAs,"  said Sen. William Roth (R-Del.). Roth said he believes that expanding  incentives for IRAs is not incompatible with reducing capital gains taxes. "I  would hope this would be an opportunity to gain both targets," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Setback  </P> <P> Bentsen's move appeared to be a blow to Rostenkowski, who had been seeking to  work out a compromise with the Bush Administration on capital gains to avoid a  defeat on the issue in the House.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Rostenkowski met with top Administration officials to discuss  modifications to his plan to allow taxes on capital gains to be adjusted for  inflation and to add further tax breaks for assets held for long periods of  time. He appeared to be making little headway, however, in winning over  Republicans or dissident Democrats, who support a competing proposal to cut the  top tax rate on capital gains by 30% for the next two years.  </P> <P> Rostenkowski suffered another setback Tuesday as well, announcing that he has  agreed to go along with efforts to repeal the controversial Section 89 of the  1986 tax revision law, which was aimed at requiring business to provide health  insurance benefits to all employees on an equal basis. Rostenkowski had been  seeking to modify the law in hopes of defusing the repeal movement.  </P> <P> Aides to Rostenkowski said that Bentsen's plan, if approved by the Senate,  could set the stage for competing tax packages to be presented to a  House-Senate conference committee, but they argued that it comes too late to  prevent some kind of capital gains cut from emerging from the Ways and Means  Committee.  </P></p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Telephone tariffs compared Sir, Your report of Mercury One-2-One's new business tariff ('Lord Young left with a face to match his bright red bow tie', September 9) compared the quarterly access charge for our Inside Option (Pounds 64.47) with the quarterly charge for a fixed BT business line (Pounds 32.66). A more relevant comparison would have been against the combined cost of subscribing to both a BT business line and a cellular phone - typically Pounds 107.66 per quarter. By offering daytime 'fixed' calls from an office/workshop location that are cheaper than BT and 'mobile' calls that are substantially cheaper than on the conventional cellular networks, Mercury One-2-One has created a very competitively priced and self-contained communications package with great appeal to the self-employed business community. Our market trials of Inside Option demonstrated that the self-employed entrepreneurs who form the bedrock of the economy are less fixed in their thinking about innovations in telecommunications than many commentators.

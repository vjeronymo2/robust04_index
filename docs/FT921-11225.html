			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Books: De Beauvoir, still a centre of industry SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR: THE WOMAN AND HER WORK by Margaret Crosland Heinemann Pounds 20, 463 pages IN THE last years of her life Simone de Beauvoir was the centre of an industry. Admirers flocked to her rue Schoelcher studio in Montparnasse to pay court, among them journalists and academics intent on writing about her thoughts, her life, or both. She had become, qua subject of study, highly marketable in publishing terms. Much of the interest was undoubtedly prompted by her relationship to Sartre. After his death she became keeper of the keys to his memory; no-one came to him but by her. But some of the interest was legitimately her own, partly because a later generation of feminists wished to applaud her contribution to their cause, and partly because her literary merits were coming to be properly appreciated: for, by any standards, de Beauvoir has to count among the outstanding writers of 20th-century France. Among the products of this industry are three large biographies. In addition to the third and latest by Margaret Crosland, under review here, are those by Claude Francis and Fernande Gontier, published in 1985, and Deirdre Bair published in 1991. No doubt Bair and Crosland are dismayed to find themselves flooding the market, a sentiment which will deepen when critical opinion comes to agree, as it will, that the earliest of the three biographies - the Francis and Gontier - is anyway best. But controversy promises to come to the rescue; Sartre and de Beauvoir are news again both in France and among interested parties abroad, as a result of the publication last year of Une si douce occupation by the historian Gilbert Joseph. In it the couple's claim to active roles in the Resistance are devastatingly challenged. The Paris literary papers have divided over the issue, and few are content to dismiss the matter, as one new year reveller in a Boul' Mich' cafe did, with a Gallic shrug: 'After the war everyone claimed to be in the Resistance; perhaps one should believe them and leave it at that.' Controversy breeds interest, or revives it when it has flagged; either way, it sells books. On the back of Joseph's nerve-touching attack, the French translation of Bair's biography is selling briskly in Paris. Any biographer of de Beauvoir has, in one way, an easy task because of the copiousness of the materials available, for one of the chief aims of de Beauvoir's intellectual efforts seems to have been the construction, with a eye to posterity, of a carefully managed self-portrait. All her work is autobiographical in the richest sense. Her five volumes of memoirs and several more of letters, her novels and most of her other non-fiction works, all in one way or another elaborate her preferred vision of her life. It is a commonplace that writers plunder themselves for materials, but de Beauvoir did much more: she indulged in self-justifying self-recreation, motivated by a powerful vanity. In the late 1970s de Beauvoir arranged to be the subject of a television documentary, saying that she wished to 'present the truth' about herself. Francis and Gontier show how avidly de Beauvoir sought to massage that truth; to their credit they resist temptations to abet her. Margaret Crosland is less critical, more often content to accept de Beauvoir's version. One example concerns de Beauvoir's Parisian childhood. The de Beauvoirs were impoverished bourgeois, obliged to make do in a small apartment above an unfashionable street. From a rear window could be seen a boulevard inhabited by rich people. In her autobiography de Beauvoir so paints matters that one would think her family lived there. Francis and Gontier expose the manoeuvre and its many implications for de Beauvoir's account of her early life. Crosland simply repeats de Beauvoir's words. Nor does Crosland give the nasty side of Sartre and de Beauvoir its due emphasis. Their recently published wartime correspondence reveals devouring egos in which third parties were first swallowed up and then spat out in sexually exploitative tangles of Byzantine complexity. But if Crosland is insufficiently challenging, her account has the virtue of this vice: with little distraction from analysis or criticism the reader is taken through a story which, however plainly told, cannot fail to fascinate, for it is woven into important aspects of literature and politics in the central decades of France's 20th-century history, above all with the often tumultuous post-war resettlement of French society. People might wish to read about de Beauvoir's life for this reason, or because they are interested in the light it throws on Sartre. Or they might recognise that this vain, unlikeable, highly gifted woman could prove to be a more important literary figure, in the long view of history, than Sartre himself; and for that reason alone she merits our attention.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY ATTY. CALLS STAFF ADEQUATE;  </P> <P> LAWYERS: HAHN ORDERS REVIEW OF CASELOADS AFTER EMPLOYEES CLAIM THAT CIVIL  LIABILITY UNIT IS UNDERSTAFFED. HE MAKES NO PROMISES.  </P> <P> City Atty. James K. Hahn declared Wednesday that the city is receiving adequate  representation in civil liability cases, despite claims to the contrary this  week by a majority of his lawyers handling such cases. They say their unit is  intolerably understaffed and underequipped.  </P> <P> In a letter addressed to Mayor Tom Bradley, Hahn wrote that he would undertake  an immediate review of the caseloads of his liability lawyers, 28 of whom  issued a statement this week saying that "we can no longer competently and  adequately represent the best interests" of the city.  </P> <P> Hahn said that the review would determine whether a redistribution of the  workload or a reorganization of the staff is warranted. "The categorical  assertion by these 28 attorneys that they are unable to represent the city  competently is a serious admission," he wrote.  </P> <P> But, citing the city's budget crunch, Hahn made no promise to follow up the  attorneys' demands for additional secretaries, paralegals and computers.  </P> <P> In interviews Wednesday, eight of the lawyers who signed the statement said  that conditions have deteriorated to the point that they cannot keep up with  their workload of about 100 cases each. The result, they said, is higher costs  to the city.  </P> <P> "I had seven cases set for trial between April 30 and June 4," said Assistant  City Atty. Victoria G. Chaney. "I tried three of the seven and we had to settle  the other ones. . . . One of the considerations for settlement in those cases  was the fact there wasn't a body to try them."  </P> <P> "Some of those cases, had they been prepared earlier, or the attorney been  better able to prepare them, some of them may have been disposed of in other  ways."  </P> <P> The liability lawyers, who defend the city in cases ranging from automobile  accidents to wrongful deaths, released their petition at a time when the city  is facing a major increase in costly legal settlements. After holding steady at  about $15 million annually through the 1980s, settlements skyrocketed to $34  million in fiscal 1989-90 and are increasing at an even quicker rate this year.  </P></p>

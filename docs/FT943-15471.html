			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Clinton rules out summit accord to support dollar: Murayama calls for stable exchange rates as US currency falls sharply against D-Mark President Bill Clinton effectively ruled out the possibility yesterday that any significant agreement to support the dollar would emerge from this weekend's summit meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Naples. Speaking after his first meeting with the new Japanese prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Mr Clinton said it would be a mistake for the G7 nations to change the direction of their macroeconomic policy in an effort to halt the fall of the dollar. 'We want the dollar to be properly valued, not undervalued,' Mr Clinton said. 'But I think on the other hand it would be a mistake for us to change the fundamental objective that we all ought to have: the one we agreed to at the G7 last year, which is to pursue global growth.' Mr Clinton's observations unnerved foreign exchange markets, and the dollar fell to its lowest level since April 1993 against the D-Mark. Traders interpreted his comments as showing he was unconcerned about the level of the dollar. Meanwhile, the publication of stronger-than-expected US employment figures put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. Unemployment held steady at 6.0 per cent in June, against expectations it would rise to 6.2 per cent. The Clinton-Murayama meeting was one of a series of bilateral talks among leaders before the formal G7 summit, which began last night. Heads of government of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, with the president of the European Commission, will confer today on how to reduce the 35m unemployed in the industrialised world and debate plans to make former Soviet nuclear power stations safer. Tomorrow, they will be joined by President Boris Yeltsin for discussions on international issues. Yesterday's Clinton-Murayama meeting dispelled some of US administration fears about the policies and stability of the new Japanese socialist-led coalition, and about Mr Murayama's political leanings. But a fundamental difference remains between the US and Japan over the dollar, which, after closing in London at DM1.5741 and Y98.575, fell over a pfennig to end in New York at DM1.561. Against the yen in New York it closed at Y98.055. Commenting on recent foreign exchange market turbulence, Mr Murayama said countries around the world, 'and especially Japan and the US, should make policy that is conducive to more stable exchange rates in co-operation with each other'.

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: NPT side helps Barcom to Pounds 2m Barcom, the plant hire group which supplies the civil engineering and coal mining industries, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 562,000 to Pounds 2.06m during the 12 months to September 30. The company was aided by new acquisitions with NPT, in for its first full year, contributing Pounds 1.3m and Hawkins, in for four months, generating Pounds 500,000. These two businesses have now been rationalised under the Hawkins Plant Services banner. Group turnover rose from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 31.8m, which included Pounds 6.27m from the acquisitions. Earnings per share rose from 7.4p to 10.9p. A proposed final dividend of 1.75p brings the year's total to 3p (1.25p). The company remains highly geared with net debt of Pounds 19.8m, compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 12m. Two thirds of borrowings, however, represent finance leases on plant and equipment. Barcom said that it intends to reduce net debt substantially in the current year.</p>

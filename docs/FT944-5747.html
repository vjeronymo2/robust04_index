			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / West Bank takes on tax powers Israel completed the transfer of power in the West Bank to Palestinians yesterday, handing over direct taxation and health following previous transfers of education, tourism and welfare. Economists said transfer of taxation, excluding customs duties, was vital to Palestinian public finances and to achieving the targets of an agreement this week between international aid donors and Palestinian officials to plug a Dollars 125m (Pounds 80m) budget deficit until March 31. Israel collected an estimated Dollars 90m in income and value added taxes from the West Bank's 1.1m Palestinian population last yea,r although Israeli officials estimated this represented only 20 per cent of taxes owed. Donors have warned they expect the Palestinian self-rule authority to balance its budget by the end of next March and say they will not fund recurrent expenses beyond that date. Mr Atef Alawneh, Palestinian finance director-general, urged Palestinians to end their practice of tax avoidance, which had been seen as a legitimate resistance to Israeli occupation. 'Taxes are the bride-price of independence and the key to democracy and participation. . . Now delay in paying means a delay in building the Palestinian state.' Israel is assisting Palestinians with tax collection in the West Bank and has trained several tax officials and translated tax records into Arabic. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank are also providing technical assistance. Both Israel and Palestinians say the transfer of West Bank power has been considerably smoother that the transition earlier in the year in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile Norway yesterday signed a Dollars 22m grant to upgrade electricity networks in Gaza and said it was immediately handing over Dollars 2m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Alliance of the Palestinian Forces [APF] held a  news conference at noon today at al-Khalisah Compound of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command  at al-Yarmuk Camp south of Damascus. The APF released a  statement detailing the alliance's political goals and  structure. Following is the statement's full text:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The key  goals of the APF: The political goals include proceeding from  the necessity to keep the struggle going in order to topple the  Gaza-Jericho accord and realize our people's and the Arab and  Islamic nation's objectives, the alliance obligates itself to  the following:    First, on the Palestinian front:    1. The Palestinian National Charter.    2. Our people's inalienable rights to their homeland,  Palestine, liberation, return, self-determination, and full  national independence.    3. The Palestinian issue is an Arab and Islamic one. The  responsibility for the deliverance of Palestine must be borne by  the Arab and Islamic nation, most of all the Palestinian people.    4. Our people's and territory's unity and that of their  cause and objectives and their national destiny and adherence to  all their national and historic rights. No one has the right to  cede any part of these rights.    5. Adherence to the option of armed struggle and jihad as  a principal tool to attain liberation.    6. Adherence to the unity of the Palestinian people  inside and outside the occupied homeland as well as the  integrity of their land.    7. The alliance deems the PLO a national achievement  whose gains must be safeguarded and institutions rebuilt on  democratic foundations.    8. The alliance deems the present PLO leadership  unrepresentative of the Palestinian people or their hopes and  aspirations.    9. The alliance deems the recognition document and the  'Arafat- Rabin agreement national treason that all possible  means must be used to topple. Neither the document nor the  agreement are binding on the Palestinian people.    10. Adherence to Palestine as a historic homeland that  has no alternative for the Palestinian people, and resistance to  all projects of a substitute homeland or resettlement, transfer,  compensation, or attempts to suppress the Palestinian people's  national identity.    11. Boycotting the political, administrative institutions  responsible for implementing the self-administration and the  Gaza-Jericho accord and the holding of elections for the self-  administration council, and organizing the widest possible  popular campaign to isolate, ostracize, and topple these  institutions.    12. Severing links with all the institutions that 'Arafat  or his team lead or are involved in under the name of the PLO.    13. A determination to pursue and step up armed struggle  and all forms of political and mass struggle, particularly  inside the occupied territory to keep the popular intifadah  going as the main arena of conflict with the Zionist enemy to  promote the inalienable, historic and national rights of the  Palestinian people.    Second, on the Arab and Islamic fronts:    1. A reaffirmation that the Palestinian cause is the core  of the Arab-Zionist conflict.    2. Taking into consideration that the dangers attendant  to the 'Arafat-Rabin accord are not limited to the Palestinian  people and Palestine but constitute a threat to the Arab and  Islamic nation, the APF would like to make it clear that facing  this liquidatory conspiracy and its repercussions is a  responsibility for the Palestinian people and Arab and Muslim  masses.    3. A bolstering of joint Palestinian-Arab-Muslim militant  ties to counter Zionist and expansionist hegemonic blueprints  and political, cultural, and economic normalization.    4. A reaffirmation of the right of the Palestinian people  in the diaspora to exercise their militant responsibilities  alongside the nationalist, Islamic, and Arab forces to promote  liberation, return, self-determination, and full national  independence.    Third, on the global front:    1. The role being played by the United States supporting  the Zionist entity and advocating its plans against our  Palestinian people and their struggle and the Arab liberation  movement is deemed by the alliance a brazen aggression on our  people and our national cause.    2. The APF underscores the importance of stepping up  cooperation with the Islamic, Asian, and African states, as well  as with all the friendly nations standing by the struggle of our  Palestinian people and supporting their inalienable national  rights.    3. We stress the importance of forging an alliance with  all the forces for liberation and progress around the world --  the forces that reject imperialist domination and Zionist  invasion and support our struggle and our national rights.    4. To work to disseminate all that relates to the  Palestinian cause and the national struggle to win the widest  possible public opinion over to the cause of our struggle and  our rights and to make the case that the 'Arafat-Rabin agreement  neither amounts to a solution nor brings peace.    The alliance's structure:    Inspired by its political goals, the APF is to form a  Central  Command, which will be responsible for formulating its  decisions, policies, and political goals:    A -- The numerical composition: Each faction will have two  representatives on the APF's Central Command.    B -- The meetings: The Central Command is to convene  sessions at least once a month. This is in addition to  extraordinary meetings that may be convened at the request of at  least four factions. Decisions are to be adopted by agreement  [bittawafuq], and the meetings are to be chaired on a rotating  basis.    C -- A Secretariat is to be set up for the APF and each  faction will have one representative there. It will convene at  least once a week, or whenever the need arises. Its task will  be to follow and see to the implementation of the Central  Command's resolutions. The Secretariat will have permanent  headquarters.

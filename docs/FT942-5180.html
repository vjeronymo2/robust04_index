The report shows that Smith New Court has managed to nudge ahead of James Capel and Warburg Securities. The three investment houses tied in first place last year. The report is compiled by Greenwich Associates staff. One of the key tables shows how 53 institutions paying more than Pounds 1m of commission view the research service provided by the firms. The institutions are asked which brokers they rank as a 'top 15 firm'. This year it shows that UBS has slipped from joint fourth to joint seventh with Hoare Govett. Behind the top three of Smith New Court, James Capel and Warburg comes Nat West Securities which has moved up three places after finishing seventh last year. BZW ranks joint fifth with Kleinwort Benson, Cazenove comes in ninth and Credit Lyonnais tenth. The five others making up the top 15 firms are: Charterhouse Tilney, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Panmure Gordon and Henderson Crosthwaite. Another key table shows how all 135 investment institutions rank broking research. Here both James Capel and Warburg are seen as providing the joint best service followed closely by Smith New Court.</p>

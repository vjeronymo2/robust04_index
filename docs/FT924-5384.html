			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / World Trade News: France's business chiefs in warning FRENCH employers yesterday warned that a veto of the proposed US-EC trade accord would 'greatly damage' companies' interests, their first official contribution to the heated debate. A veto could provoke 'a very serious' European crisis, 'with very important consequences for the future of Europe', said Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, chairman of the economics commission of the Patronat employers' group. Mr Seilliere, a former senior diplomat and member of the French negotiating team in the Kennedy round of Gatt, declined to give an opinion on whether the government should veto the deal, but said: 'The threat to block the process is not credible.' Mr Seilliere stressed that industrial employers felt 'strong friendship and solidarity' with farmers, but pointed out at the same time that France's general interests in an overall Gatt deal far outweighed farmers' perceived losses, both in terms of economic activity and jobs. 'Nothing opposes us,' he argued. 'We are struck by the fact that the reality of agriculture must be put into perspective with the whole of France's economic interests,' Mr Seilliere added. Farming generates 3 per cent of French gross domestic product, as against the 20 per cent produced by exports from all sectors, the Patronat said. The French farm industry's FFr350bn (Pounds 42.5bn) annual turnover is less than than the FFr385bn combined overseas turnover of five leading industrial groups, Alcatel Alsthom, Usinor Sacilor, Thomson, Peugeot and Renault, the Patronat calculated. French farm sales are also dwarfed by the FFr500bn per year of sales lost by all countries through counterfeiting of goods, a practice which harms France more than most, and which would be curbed by a general Gatt accord, said the Patronat. It estimated that 70 per cent of counterfeited goods are copies of French brands.</p>

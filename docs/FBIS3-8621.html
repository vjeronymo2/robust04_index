			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 12 Mar (TANJUG)--The commander of the army  of the Srpska republic, Gen. Ratko Mladic, this evening warned  the head of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mission for  former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, that problematic actions by  members of the French UN battalion deployed in the region of  Bihac could lead to undesirable incidents.    In a letter to Akashi, Gen. Mladic stresses that the French  UN battalion has deployed its reconaissance groups in front of  the Muslim forces along the lines of separation facing the Serb  units.    "Thus deployed UNPROFOR reconaissance groups have been used  by the Muslim forces as a safe position from where they can open  fire against positions held by the army of the Srpska republic.  At the same time, they wish to trigger our retaliation against  the UNPROFOR members, by which they would cause a conflict  between the Serb forces and UNPROFOR," says Gen. Mladic's letter  which was forwarded to TANJUG.    The commander of the army of the Srpska republic assesses  that this deployment of the reconnaissance groups by the French  battalion is "objectively speaking benefiting the protection of  the Muslim forces and tolerating combat activities from thier  positions and adjacent to them; this could force a reaction by  our forces in terms of self-defense and cause more serious  consequences."    Gen. Mladic recalls in his letter to Akashi that "hitherto  not one member of the UNPROFOR forces has been killed by our  forces, and other unpleasant situations are extremely rare," and  he requests that the head of the UNPROFOR mission personally  take it upon himself to see to it that the French reconnaissance  groups are removed.</p>

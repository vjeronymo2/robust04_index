			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Brazil finance minister chosen Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president-elect, has chosen central bank governor Mr Pedro Malan to become finance minister when he takes office on January 1. The choice of Mr Malan suggests the economic team which oversaw this year's launch of Brazil's new currency, the Real, will remain largely intact, although in different posts, following the change of government. Before taking over the central bank, Mr Malan was Brazil's foreign debt negotiator and oversaw much of the detailed discussion for this year's Dollars 49bn foreign debt restructuring. A cautious man who weighs every word, Mr Malan is a strong advocate of the Real and is known to favour a more independent role for the central bank. Mr Cardoso is thought to want Mr Persio Arida, one of the main economists who planned the Real, to take over at the central bank.</p>

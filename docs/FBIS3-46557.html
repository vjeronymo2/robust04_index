The message reads:    To dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, the sagacious leader  [yongmyonghan chidoja] of the nation:    Under the brilliant sun of guidance, an age-shaking year of  excitement ended and the hopeful new year 1994 has broken. On  this breaking morning of the new year, the SKNDF Central  Committee respectfully sends the first greeting of longevity to  Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is the sagacious leader of the nation,  the great leader [yongsu] of the chuche cause, and a talented  military strategist whom the fellow countrymen and all human  beings admire, with the consistent wishes of hearty  congratulations by all the vanguard fighters and masses of  various strata in the South.    The past year of 1993 was a meaningful year when the  sagacious leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was elected chairman of  the DPRK National Defense Commission and when the 40th  anniversary of the 27 July war victory was brilliantly decorated  with a grand festival of victors. It was also an honorable year  when the world was shocked by mankind's admiration and epochal  hymns for the immortal achievements registered by the dear  leader in 1993.    With his insightful and farseeing wisdom, the sagacious  comrade leader, an outstanding leader [yongsu], presented the  chuche Korea's policy to overcome piled difficulties and trials.  He also consolidated the entire party, all the people, and the  entire Army as a pure social and political living body filled  with loyalty and filial piety, thus demonstrating the  invincibility of the masses-oriented, unique socialism.    The sagacious comrade leader, an outstanding military  genius,  defeated and smashed the enemy's isolating, suffocating, and  crushing maneuver [chokturui korip chilsik apsal chaektongul  kyokpa punswaehasigo] and registered the outstanding feat of  brilliantly protecting the national dignity and the country's  interests by using his peerless talented wisdom, matchless  braveness, and iron-strong will last year when the strong  anti-Republic and antisocialist wind created by the allied  imperialist forces blew unprecedentedly harshly.    The more unscrupulous was the revilement of the imperialists  and their puppets, who had been pushed into a pitfall of  successive defeats, the more the northern half of the fatherland  increased the speed of the general onward march of socialism of  our own style, upholding the banner of self-relience and  fortitude, thus victoriously accomplishing the Third Seven-Year  Plan. The North's farmlands, where the chuche farming method  advanced, won a victory of achieving bumper crops. All this was  possible thanks to the sagacious comrade leader and his seasoned  leadership.    At the end of last year, when the North's nuclear issue was  mentioned again in Washington and Seoul was frantically  attempting to crushing fellow countrymen while adhering to the  international cooperation system, Pyongyang, unlike Seoul,  presented revolutionary economic strategies based on the result  of summing up the fulfillment of the Third Seven-Year Plan and  discussed and decided upon the issue of correctly inheriting the  nation's cultural legacies, which had been presented as an  important state affair, thus striking the people of the world  with admiration.    From the very composed and peace-oriented attitude of the  northern half of the fatherland, we could see an overwhelming  victory of the denuclearization policy over the U.S. nuclear war  policy [haekchonjaeng chongchaek] as well as the infinite vigor  of the chuche economic and cultural policies, and could realize  again the valuable truth that the masses under the seasoned  leadership of the outstanding leader can vigorously advance  toward the prosperous future no matter how harsh are the trials  they are repeatedly faced with.    The sagacious comrade leader, who is pioneering mankind's  cause of independence at the forefront while stoutly grasping  the rudder of the times, struck a deadly blow to the  imperialists and betrayers of socialism who try to void and  distort the true superiority of socialism and enabled the masses  who are making efforts to rehabilitate socialism to have firm  faith and will, thus making a great contribution to the  development of the socialist movement.    History tells numerous legends about heroes, however we  have not witnessed a leader like our sagacious leader who is an  unequalled iron-willed brilliant commander and excelled  politician. He has both literary and military accomplishments  that are not shared by any leader of all times and places, has  embroidered the history of the nation and mankind with his  legendary strategies and has blocked raging storms with his own  body during the period of most stern trials.    The sagacious leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great  incarnation of the chuche politics and peerless great commander  who has turned an unprecedented steep path and trials into  favorable conditions overflowing with optimism, thus creating  new history by turning a misfortune into a blessing. Under the  wise and tested leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il, the  sagacious leader of the nation, a remarkable progress was made  in the movement to reunify the fatherland in the last year.    The sagacious comrade leader opened a broad alliance road  for  the people wandering about in a quagmire of confrontation and  mistrust by administering politics of love and trust and  broad-based politics which embody the idea of believing in the  people as in heaven, and aroused 70 million countrymen in the  North, South, and overseas into the plaza of great unity and  national reconciliation under the great banner of the 10-point  program of the great national unity for the reunification of the  fatherland.    Even though aggressors and traitorous cliques viciously  staged anti-peace, antireunification maneuvers in the last year,  our masses advanced along the road for independent and peaceful  reunification of the fatherland by kicking out brutal  suppression of the fascists and girding up themselves with hope  and grit against disappointment and frustration because the  sagacious comrade leader, who supports the whole nation's  immortal will and aspiration for the end of the tragedy of the  fatherland division and the establishment of a confederal state  in the nineties', stands firm at the head of our nation.    We are convinced of a brilliant tomorrow since we have the  sagacious comrade leader as the nation's leading spirit  [yongsu]. Thus, our SKNDF and other patriotic masses kindled the  flame of anti-U.S.and antifascist patriotic struggle by firmly  holding the chuche sword without the slightest vacillation  despite the development of a grave situation in which the  military dictatorship turned into civilian fascism, strangled  democracy, and maximized pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese subordination  and North-South confrontation.    The struggle by peasants and masses of various strata  opposing the rice market opening that erupted from various parts  of Pyongyang [as heard] liquidated the traitorous cliques and  completely unveiled the cloak of the civilian regime worn by the  current regime as the struggle developed into a nationwide  movement opposing the U.S. imperialists' shameless acts of  looting. As a result, the colonial fascist rule now faces a  serious crisis.    Our masses, under the banner of the chuche idea, acquired  deep in their hearts precious experiences during the stern  course of struggle waged in the last year that, without  fundamentally reforming the colonial domination system, the  disgrace and misfortune of subordination and national division  can never be eliminated.    In the new year, we, upholding the banner of the chuche  idea,  will accelerate the work to make the masses have consciousness  and to organize them, and will firmly guarantee the uniformity  of the leadership and idea among SKNDF ranks so that they would  be firmly prepared as the main forces of reform.    We will ignite the flame of struggle against the current  fascist regime and wage successive patriotic struggles to make  the masses have consciousness, become independent, have  democracy, and realize the 10-point program for the great  national unity.    At this meaningful moment of ushering in the first morning  of  the new year, the SKNDF Central Committee respectfully wishes  Comrade Kim Chong-il, the lodestar of the fatherland's  reunification and benefactor of the nation's destiny, long life  with the unanimous expression of wishes by all the vanguard  fighters and patriotic masses of various classes and strata.    [Signed] The SKNDF Central Committee    [Issued] 1 January 1994, Seoul</p>

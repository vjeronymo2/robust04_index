			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Defence industry study points to collaboration TRANSATLANTIC and transpacific collaboration is going to be increasingly important for aerospace and defence companies to survive as industry leaders in the post Cold War world, according to a study of global defence industry opinion published yesterday. The survey, by consultants Ernst &amp; Young, summarises the opinions of senior executives at defence and aerospace companies around the world. It says the principal strategies for survival being pursued are alliances with other companies, either domestic or foreign, and diversification into commercial products. Nearly all survey respondents, and particularly those in Europe and Japan, said forming collaborative ventures with foreign companies would be very important to success. An overwhelming number of Japanese executives and a majority of west Europeans felt their governments should encourage the pursuit of such ventures, while most Americans felt this should be left to market forces. The survey notes that when the defence industry first began to face long-term shrinkage, the theory developed that existing technology and plant would be converted to alternative use, principally in the commercial sector. However, there have been very few 'defence conversion' successes and the report says North American and West European industrialists do not see this as a particularly important strategy. In Japan, however, it is regarded as important. Ernst &amp; Young notes Japan also plans to expand its presence in commercial aerospace and adds: 'It appears clear from this study that Japan will continue to play an ever-increasing role in the aerospace and defence industry. 'Its social policies, culture and modern manufacturing methods seem to encourage aerospace growth while affording the flexibility to adapt to the rapid pace of change.' Most executives also felt the defence industry would see more consolidation, although this view was much more common in the US than in Europe and Japan. More than 50 per cent of US respondents and one third in Europe expected a significant number of sub-contractors to quit the industry. The study also found many defence industry leaders were still waiting for clearer guidance from their governments over defence priorities in the post Cold War world. 'Particularly in North America and Western Europe, industrialists sense that their governments' adaption to the resized defence needs are . . . occuring incrementally when, in fact, a fundamental change in their governments' thinking about the conduct of defence procurement is necessary.'</p>

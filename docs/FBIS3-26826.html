The report points out that  special interest groups among the armed forces and bureaucrats  have been formed within the CPC. The specialists warn in their  report: The factor that has the greatest possibility of  breaking off the process of reform and modernization in China  comes from corruption within the CPC; therefore, development is  the last word and anticorruption is also the last word [fa zhan  shi ying dao li, fan fu bai ye shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2508  4289 6670 3810 0646 5201 2408 0048 2508 4289 6670 3810]. Since  corruption has become a kind of malignant cancer on the  mainland, it cannot be rooted out by depending on "party  discipline and state laws" alone. The only way out is "the  establishment of a new system."    Dr. Hu Angang and Dr. Wang Shao-kuang, of the Political  Faculty of Yale University in the United States, jointly  completed "A Report on the State's Ability in China" last year  and first put forward the replacement of the "overall contract  system" with the "tax-sharing system" in order to strengthen the  ability of the central administration. This has attracted much  attention at home and abroad.    Kang Xiaoguang is 31 years old. He graduated from the  Applied Mathematics Faculty of the Dalian Engineering College  and later was awarded a master's degree in Theoretical Ecology  by the Ecological and Environmental Research Center of the  Chinese Academy of Sciences. In recent years, he has engaged  himself in the study of China's national situation and his  representative work is "Agriculture and Development -- A Study  of Several Questions Concerning China's Agriculture," published  by the Beijing University Press in 1993.    Beginning today, MING PAO will carry by installments an  interview with Hu and Kang by our staff reporter, Mr. Liu Lu, in  order to give a detailed account of their starting point in  writing the report, as well as the report's main contents.  [end foreword]    On the Chinese mainland today, the two major issues that  have  attracted the greatest attention of the people are inflation and  corruption. If we say that the former occurs intermittently,  then the latter has become more serious with each passing day.  Therefore, the publication of the "report on the national  situation" entitled "Opposing Corruption Through the  Establishment of a New System" immediately attracted extremely  great attention among political and academic circles. It is  said that even before the report was published it had been  submitted to the high-level CPC leadership as "reference  material."    During a special interview with Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang  a few days ago, this reporter asked them why they carried out a  study on anticorruption as part of the national situation, they  replied: Deng Xiaoping said after the 4 June incident: "If  corruption, especially corruption at a high level within the  party, is not punished, there is indeed a danger of failure."  However, to date, the practice of corruption throughout the  party, the Army, and the country has become more and more  serious, instead of being brought under control. It has become  an extremely common social phenomenon. It is not at all  exaggerating to say that the degree of corruption on the Chinese  mainland has become a kind of malignant cancer, which has spread  rapidly to society as a whole. Corruption has become the  greatest social pollution in China today. We are worried that  in the future, the factor that will have the greatest  possibility of breaking off the process of reform and  modernization in China comes from the serious corruption within  the CPC.    Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said frankly: "The common  people call some cadres `corrupt officials' and `local tyrants  and evil gentry' without mincing words." Corruption within the  CPC makes the CPC and its political power lose its foundation of  legitimacy, meaning that the support of the common people for  the party and the government is decreasing. This is one of the  expressions of the universally declining state ability in China,  that is, the ability for legitimation is decreasing.    "Water holds up ships, but also can drown them. [no closing  quotation mark as published] If corruption is allowed to spread  and if it is impossible to thoroughly solve the problem of  corruption, particularly corruption at a high level within the  party, it is not impossible that the Communist Party may fall  from power because of corruption caused by the system. As a  matter of fact, CPC leaders have been aware of this possibility.  Jiang Zemin pointed out on the CPC's 70th founding anniversary  that party style has a bearing on the party's existence and  survival. If the corruption phenomenon is allowed to developed,  the party will be on its way to self-destruction. In this  sense, development is the last word and anticorruption is also  the last word.    Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: Deng Xiaoping repeatedly  admonished: "The third-generation leadership should win the  confidence of the people," and it is necessary to win the  confidence of the people through punishing corruption.  Apparently, whether or not the CPC's third-generation  leadership can have legitimacy depends on whether or not it has  the courage and determination to oppose corruption, whether or  not it is able to oppose corruption in an effective way, and  whether or not it can carry out its promise to the more than 1  billion people. This is the fundamental reason why we have  carried out this research. In the report on the national  situation, we have proceeded from the worst possibility to  forecast the worst possible ending as a warning. However, as  scientists of China, we hope we are not successful prophets.</p>

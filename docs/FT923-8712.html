			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Leading Article: County Hall IT IS difficult to conceive that the government could have worse handled the disposal of London's County Hall. Through its quango, the London Residuary Body, it needlessly rushed into a pre-election deal with the Shirayama Corporation to convert the prime-site building into a luxury hotel. Then it spent more than three months dithering as to whether or not to allow the London School of Economics, which had been campaigning for the site for over a year, to submit a rival bid. Finally, at the end of July, it gave the LSE six working days to submit a fully-costed, unconditional bid for the site. The government apparently intimated to the LSE that its bid should be a fair commercial proposition. Hence the LSE, which five months ago proposed to pay Pounds 20m, with a partner, for the hall and surrounding site, is now offering Pounds 65m on its own. Hitherto the FT has supported the LSE's designs. County Hall is London's foremost vacant public building: it should be used to house one of its foremost public institutions, and none seemed - or seem - more appropriate than the LSE, Britain's leading social science university. However, it is not merely ridiculous, but positively dangerous, to require the LSE to behave like a commercial property developer. To raise the Pounds 130m-odd it now needs to buy and refurbish County Hall, the LSE is banking on an early, highly optimistic return from its current site, plus a huge overdraft and a doubling of postgraduate numbers in four years. Even if all goes according to plan - a big 'if' - such rapid transformation could undermine the very reputation which justifies the move. If the government believes the national interest is best served by relocating the LSE to County Hall, it ought to forget about a commercial return. If it continues to demand one, the LSE should think hard before gambling its future on a building.</p>

The league  didn't sanction women's sports until 1982.  </P> <P> Said Texas coach Jody Conradt: "It hurts, and it's going to hurt more in the  morning. We have taken pride in the streak.  </P> <P> "If it had to happen, I am glad it happened at home and not on the road where  we would have felt alone," Conradt said.  </P></p>

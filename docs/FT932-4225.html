			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Arts: The Stuttgart Ballet The Stuttgart Ballet meant a great deal to Sir Kenneth MacMillan. His friend and contemporary, John Cranko, directed the troupe. Cranko it was who invited MacMillan to stage The Song of the Earth when, in 1965, Covent Garden had thrown its hands up in horror at the idea of a ballet using Mahler's symphony. Subsequently, Macmillan was to create other major works on the Stuttgart dancers, responding to such artists as Marcia Haydee, Birgit Keil, Richard Cragun - My Brother, My Sisters, one of his finest portraits of the ensemble - and his Requiem was made for Stuttgart in 1977 as a memorial to John Cranko. It is fitting, then, that Peter Wright should have invited the Stuttgart Ballet to give two commemorative performances in Birmingham this week, in tribute to MacMillan. And very properly the repertory comprised Song of the Earth and Requiem. On Tuesday night I found Song of the Earth an inevitable and heart-searching journey, as ever in the Stuttgart interpretation. The central figure of The Woman is safe with Annie Mayet. Her dancing had the dignity in grief, and the integrity of utterance, which are central facts of the ballet itself, and her reading was beautiful because without affectation: movement as essence of experience. I thought Benito Marcelino a powerful Messenger; Wolfgang Stollwitzer rose to the great moments of the Man's role, though it is a part which can benefit from a denser physical presence. Musically, the performance by the Royal Ballet Sinfonietta under Davor Krnjak was distinguished - texture clear; sonorities pungent - and Peter Jeffes' tenor blazed grandly in his three songs. About Requiem I had reservations. From the first, the ensemble showed that directness of response to MacMillan's daring imagery - fists raised to Heaven; mouths agape - which is essential if the piece is to convince us. Both Richard Cragun and Birgit Keil, in the roles they created, maintain that purity of intention (no mannerisms; not one beatific or mock-anguished spasm) which is vital the the sense of the choreography. But Susanne Hanke performed the Sanctus as if opening a charity bazaar, and Marcia Haydee - paying her own tribute to MacMillan by returning to the Pie Jesu that he made for her - seemed all too consciously innocent. (The choreography was inspired by MacMillan's very young daughter dancing to this same music, and Haydee's original performance was transparent.) And though we are taught that diamonds are forever, this is not part of the text of the Mass, and I find the glitter of ear-studs worn by the leading women less than convincing as theology or emotion. The lighting of the set was far from happy. In the first production, the action seemed bathed in a luminosity which filled translucent columns and spilled over the stage and was absorbed into the dance itself. On Tuesday night, the light was misty, dull, and the set glum. The ballet suffered.</p>

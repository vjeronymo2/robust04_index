			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: CARL FURILLO ALMOST PITCHED A NO-HITTER FROM THE OUTFIELD  </P> <P> Fernando Valenzuela and Stan Javier will attest that an outfielder can keep a  no-hitter alive with a quick jump and a running catch. But Dodger folklore  includes a moment when an outfielder kept one going with his arm.  </P> <P> In a story on the great throwing arms of outfielders in baseball history and  those of today, Steve Marcus of Newsday writes:  </P> <P> "Aug. 27, 1951. Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca allowed what should have  been his first hit of the game -- a one-hop liner to right by Pittsburgh  Pirates pitcher Mel Queen. But right fielder Carl Furillo charged the ball and  gunned it to first in time to nail Queen. The no-hitter lasted until the ninth  when Branca gave up two hits.  </P> <P> "In the next morning's newspaper, Dick Young wrote, 'The two fine Italian arms  of Branca and Furillo had a no-hitter running for eight innings.' "  </P> <P> Add no-hitters: The Times of London, noting that Friday was the first time  pitchers in both the American and National Leagues had thrown no-hitters on the  same day, made a game attempt at explaining the event's significance: "Strictly  speaking, a no-hitter does not mean that no opponents have hit the ball. It  means that no batter has reached first base, except, of course, those who walk.  If you feel a little confused, please join the club. Neverthless, a no-hitter  is a considerable achievement."  </P> <P> Trivia time: In the last five years, what university has produced the most  choices in the first three rounds of the NFL draft?  </P> <P> Mismatched M's: According to Larry LaRue of the Tacoma Morning News-Tribune, in  the midst of Friday night's 22-minute brawl between the Milwaukee Brewers and  the Seattle Mariners, Pete O'Brien of the Mariners said to Dave Parker of the  Brewers, "Oh, hell, how did I get matched up with you?"  </P> <P> Down time: FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, is concerned that delays  for fouls, placing the ball for free kicks and various other time-killing  tactics are substantially reducing the actual playing time of World Cup  matches.  </P> <P> FIFA's study of matches played before Saturday showed that the 1-1 draw between  England and Ireland was the shortest, just 49 minutes of real playing time out  of the regulation 90 minutes.  </P> <P> After England-Ireland came Austria-Czechoslovakia and Brazil-Argentina, both  with 51 minutes of action. Romania's 2-0 victory over the Soviet Union had the  most action, 67 minutes.  </P> <P> Prepare for takeoff: Each time Bruce Coslet, the new coach of the New York  Jets, has a career record with the team above the .500 level, he'll be able to  say he's at least one up on every other coach in Jet history.  </P> <P> Since the franchise began in 1960, none of its previous nine coaches has left  with a winning record. The first, Sammy Baugh, came the closest. He was 14-14  in 1960-61.  </P> <P> And despite Weeb Ewbank's seasons with Joe Namath, which included a victory in  Super Bowl III, his record with the Jets (1963-73) was 73-78-6.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Miami, with 22.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Washington Bullet Coach Wes Unseld, on whether he would put  second-round draft pick Greg Foster in the same category as Manute Bol when Bol  was a rookie: "No. He can play basketball."

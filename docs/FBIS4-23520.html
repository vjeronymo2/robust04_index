			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 7 SAPA -- Chief Justice Michael  Corbett has agreed to continue in office for a further two  years, Justice Minister Dullah Omar said on Tuesday. Mr Omar was  speaking at a Cape Town press conference where he announced the  appointment of advocate and academic Arthur Chaskalson as  president of the Constitutional Court.    Mr Omar said Mr Justice Corbett's term of office was due to  expire at the end of September, but he had accepted an  invitation from President Nelson Mandela to stay on until  December 31, 1996.    The chief justice will chair the newly-appointed Judicial  Services Commission [JSC], which will nominate six of the 10  judges of the Constitutional Court.    The JSC will also make recommendations on the appointment,  tenure, term of office and removal from office of all judges and  will advise the national and provincial governments on all  matters relating to the judiciary and the administration of  justice.    Other members of the JSC are: Mr Chaskalson; Natal  Judge-President Mr Justice Alan Howard, representing the  judges-president; Mr Omar or his nominee; Prof Etienne Mureinik  of Wits [University of the Witwatersrand], representing the  deans of law faculties at South African universities; Senators  Isabella Direko, Ernest Mchunu, Bulelani Ngcuka and Ray Radue;  Advocates David Gordon, George Bizos, Kgomotso Moroka and trade  unionist John Erentzen.    Mr Omar said he was unable to announce the names of two  practising advocates and two practising attorneys to serve on  the JSC because different nominations had been forwarded by the  Association of Law Societies and the General Council of the Bar  on the one hand, and the Black Lawyers Association and National  Association of Democratic Lawyers on the other.    However, negotiations were underway to resolve the matter so  that Mr Justice Corbett could convene the first meeting of the  JSC.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Wall-to-wall challenges: Skiing As I puffed and panted my way down the lower section of Gentianes, one of Verbier's longest and least relenting runs, I was aware of another skier having a similar battle not far away. We both paused, using our chance encounter as an excuse for a breather. 'Wow]' he said. An American. 'Quite a run]' 'Certainly is,' I said. 'How does this compare with the Rockies?' I asked, knowing perfectly well that America had nothing to touch Verbier for long, tough, uncompromising skiing. 'Never skied there,' he said. 'I'm from Alabama.' No wonder he was tired. The only ski resort in Alabama is Cloudmont (50 miles from Chattanooga) where the vertical drop is just 150 feet. Gentianes alone has a vertical drop more than 20 times as much. There is a large amount of challenging skiing in the Swiss resort of Verbier. In other places you might screw up the courage to ski the difficult runs, and then once you have done so a couple of times you can relax knowing that you have done your brave deed for the day. But Verbier has wall-to-wall challenges. Mont Gele and even Mont Fort are occasionally closed because of blizzards and avalanche danger. In 1950, when Verbier's first proper chairlift to the Croix-des-Ruinettes was erected, the installations were delayed by bad weather in spite of Verbier's reputation as a sun trap. (The first lift - the 1946 'Funiluge' - was a giant sledge powered by a combustion engine accommodating 12 skiers.) British skier Konrad Bartelski had told me that the back of Mont Fort was spectacular but not a good place to fall. I had always been petrified that one day I would find it open and have to ski it. This year that moment arrived. There are no two ways about it, I was frightened: as much for the skiers perched perilously above me in the severe opening couloirs, as for my own skin. However the elation at getting down safely was unforgettable. After skiing the back of Mont Fort, the front - steep as it may look - will never seem as threatening. Mont Gele in good, fresh snow is also spectacular - with the opportunity of plenty of good turns in powder before you need to put the brakes on - but nowhere near so intimidating as the back of Mont Fort unless you attempt the steeper side which is fraught with danger. Verbier, of course, is not just for strong skiers, although they probably get more out of it than beginners and intermediates, who also have to cope with busier pistes and longer queues caused by Verbier's somewhat inadequate lift system. One of the advantages of skiing the back of Mont Fort is that it takes half a day and does not attract crowds. Even more conventional runs like Gentiane - too tough for inexperienced skiers - will keep most skiers busy for long spells in between lifts. Trying to evaluate Verbier is an exasperating affair. In many ways it has some of the most exhilarating skiing in the world. But a modern French lift system of multi-person gondolas replacing its more antiquated, ponderous cable-cars would take away some of the angst involved in trying to reach the slopes more quickly. This day-time undercurrent of frustration dissolves by night into irritation with the resort's Hooray Henries. Rather like Verbier's lift system they are irritating rather than infuriating. Surely the original Hoorays must have grown up by now - or have they? Anyway, fresh supplies seem to arrive each year. Even the Farm Club, considered an upmarket nightspot, suffered during my visit. After two chalet girls danced topless, five young Englishmen took to the dance floor and stripped off their clothes. No-one seemed to object, but it was not my idea of a fun night out. The following evening, on our chalet girl's night off, we and our Flexiski host Neal Manuel enjoyed a much more entertaining - and cheaper (Manuel paid ) - evening in a local bistro. Like quite a few small tour operators, Manuel started out working for someone else. He was a ski guide with Don Kremer's Snowtime operation, based in Meribel. Flexiski (049084-446) operates in just two resorts: Courchevel and Verbier. It offers a chalet in each resort, chalet apartments in Courchevel's central Forum complex and the rest of its accommodation is in three- and four-star hotels: four in Courchevel, including the four-star Annapurna, Bellecote and Hotel des Trois Vallees, and one in Verbier, the Hotel Vanessa.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: S&amp;P fund offers 4% SAVE &amp; Prosper is launching a monthly income personal equity plan designed to offer investors a tax-free yield of 4 per cent a year. It will invest in four of S&amp;P's unit trusts: Scotyields (30 per cent), Income (25 per cent), High Return (20 per cent), and Smaller Companies Income (20 per cent). The remaining 5 per cent of investors' money will be kept in a cash fund, which will earn interest. Distributions from the unit trusts will be fed into this fund, which will then pay out income in a series of 12 level payments. Each year, the amount of income will be reviewed. Obviously, the maximum tax-free income investors can earn through this plan is limited by the Pep regulations, which allow only Pounds 6,000 to be invested in a plan in any tax year. A 4 per cent yield on an investment of Pounds 6,000 implies a monthly income of just Pounds 20. But since the plan is an equity investment, savers should expect the level of income (and indeed the value of their capital) to grow over time. How much growth the plan can produce is open to question, given the less than impressive performance record of the four trusts concerned. Both High Return and Scotyields had a below-average performance in the UK equity income sector over the one, three five and 10 year periods to October 1. (Indeed, High Return was next to last in the sector over the three and five year periods.) Smaller Companies Income has an above-average record in its sector over 10 years (10th out of 25 funds) but is below average over one, three and five. The Income fund has done well in its sector (UK Balanced) over the past year, finishing third out of 36 funds. But over the three, five and 10 year periods, it is close to the bottom of the sector. So, investors need to take on trust that S&amp;P can improve the performance of the funds. Julian Tregoning, S&amp;P's investment division director, points out that he appointed a new head of the UK equity desk, Michael Ashbridge, last October with the target of ensuring that 50 per cent of the group's UK equity funds were above the median. Tregoning says Ashbridge has met the target, and all but one of the group's UK funds have outperformed the All Share over the period. The minimum investment in the plan is Pounds 3,000. The initial charge on each fund is 5.5 per cent (there is a 1 per cent discount until November 5) and a 1.25 per cent annual charge. The plan is also available in non-Pep form, allowing investors to put in more than Pounds 6,000. For amounts above that level, a 2 per cent discount applies until November 5.</p>

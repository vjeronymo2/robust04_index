			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: AZUSA;  </P> <P> TORRES OPPOSES EXPANSION  </P> <P> Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) has joined San Gabriel Valley water  agencies in urging the state Water Resources Control Board to reject a permit  for expansion of the Azusa Land Reclamation Co.'s landfill in Azusa.  </P> <P> "The proposed site is not suited for a landfill since ground-water sources are  located directly under the area and are used for the drinking needs of the  residents," Torres said.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board approved a permit last  year for disposal in new areas of the landfill under conditions that would  require the use of clay soil and a plastic liner to keep contaminants from  seeping into ground water. But the San Gabriel Valley Watermaster, an  organization that allocates the use of ground water in the Main San Gabriel  Basin, appealed the decision to the state board. The board's staff has  recommended that the regional decision be overturned.  </P></p>

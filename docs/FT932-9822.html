			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Price war is not just skin deep: A clash between two competing retailing strategies for the 1990s For British holidaymakers, safe summer tans will be a lot cheaper this year, thanks to the recent outbreak of price discounts on suncare products. But for some of Britain's biggest retailers, the competitive pressures which have led to the price battle threaten to keep turning up the heat long after summer ends. Though other retailers such as Tesco, the supermarket group, have joined in, the real battle is between two protagonists: Boots, the country's largest chemists chain, and Superdrug, the fast-growing discount drugstore company which triggered hostilities by cutting branded suncare prices by 25 per cent two weeks ago. This is Superdrug's second headline-grabbing price offensive in 18 months and follows its decision to discount fragrances by up to 30 per cent at 42 of its 680 stores. Heavy lobbying by Superdrug has also prompted a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the distribution practices of perfume manufacturers, which refuse to supply the company directly. Though Boots has matched the perfume price cuts, it has done so gradually and only in outlets near Superdrug stores which sell fragrances. Its response in suncare products has been much more decisive. Days after Superdrug acted, Boots announced 30 per cent price cuts in all its 1,100 stores. The speed and scale of its reaction were deliberate. 'One reason we have taken a high profile this time is to send a clear signal that we care about our market share,' says Mr Gordon Hourston, managing director of Boots The Chemists (BTC), the division of the Nottingham-based group which operates the high-street stores. At stake are much more than Boots' 47 per cent of the Pounds 110m UK suncare market and Superdrug's goal of doubling its share to 16 per cent this year. BTC points out in any case that suncare provides less than 2 per cent of its turnover and says it is confident of offsetting lower margins through higher sales volumes. Far more worrying for Boots is the risk that if price battles of this kind proliferate, they will reinforce the impression among consumers - already detected by the company's market research - that its prices are too high and its profit margins too fat. Superdrug is adept at exploiting that impression. Not only has it won valuable free publicity by skilfully posing as a consumer champion; it misses no opportunity to portray its larger rival as greedy. 'In markets such as vitamins, photographic film or cosmetics, where Boots' share is 30 per cent or more, its margins are sky-high,' says Mr Geoff Brady, Superdrug's marketing director. Behind the knock-about rhetoric and PR stunts, though, lies a genuine clash between two business philosophies based on sharply different beliefs about what retailers need to do to prosper in the 1990s. Boots is widely admired for its professionalism and, in particular, its effective use of sophisticated electronic information systems to manage the supply chain, keep tight control of stocks and analyse the sales and profit performance of each of its product lines. The company is proud of its record in using the resulting efficiency gains to deliver improved results to shareholders in the form of higher profit margins. Despite recession, BTC has raised profits from 8 per cent of sales to 10 per cent since 1990 - though other parts of the group have performed less well. Superdrug comes from a very different stable. Part of the Kingfisher group - which also owns Woolworths, the B&amp;Q do-it-yourself chain and the Comet electrical stores - it is guided by the 'value retailing' principles of Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman. Sir Geoffrey believes consumers have become more discerning not just because of recession but because they face ever wider choice. He has repeatedly argued that retailers must respond by emphasising value and accepting lower margins in return for volume growth. His radical views - partly inspired by the success of discount chains such as Wal-Mart in the US - have won supporters in the City. Some regard him as a prophet of a new wave of retailing, which will eventually sweep through the rest of the UK sector. Though Sir Geoffrey stresses that value retailing does not mean neglecting customer service, pricing is at the heart of the approach. It is exemplified by B&amp;Q's recent decision to offer permanent discounts on 500 popular product lines, and by similar, more limited, offers at Woolworths and Comet. Industry observers think Boots' margins on many items make further selective deep-discount raids by Superdrug inevitable - a view the latter company has not sought to dispel. 'I don't think there is an end to this process,' says Mr Paul Deacon of Goldman Sachs. 'Superdrug will move from product to product and keep pushing.' Apart from the favourable publicity it has generated, Superdrug's biggest advantage is a low cost base. Though it is smartening up some of its stores, they are less lavishly equipped and often occupy less desirable sites than its larger rival's. However, Superdrug faces several challenges. It has few in-store pharmacies, which account for a fifth of BTC's sales and are believed to be its most profitable business. Superdrug must also persuade Boots' main suppliers to sell it products, which some have been reluctant to do. Mr Brady says that, to be sure of supplies of suncare products, he has bought in advance and stocked enough to meet all this year's expected demand. He also doubts that he can continue to expand perfume sales unless the MMC orders manufacturers to supply Superdrug direct, instead of forcing it to buy on the unauthorised 'grey' market. Mr Deacon doubts that if an all-out price war developed, Superdrug would emerge the winner, though he thinks it could damage Boots' margins. Mr Hourston says price cuts on only two product ranges do not even amount to a battle. But he says BTC is preparing to defend itself against the threat of further onslaughts by Superdrug and is considering a range of possible responses. Though he will not give details, he says: 'If they do this again, it would be wrong to assume we will retaliate in precisely the same way.' He argues that while Boots aims to offer competitive prices, its strength also depends heavily on its commitment to high product quality, well-equipped stores and customer service. However, he admits this may be a two-edged weapon. 'The impression can be created that, because of these investments, Boots is an expensive place to shop,' he says - quickly insisting that this view is mistaken. With 35,000 product lines, Boots can afford to subsidise price cuts on some from profits on others. However, Mr Hourston stresses that the company's financial goals make this only a temporary solution: if profits on individual products are inadequate, prices must be raised or the lines dropped. Clearly, the extent to which Boots is obliged to adjust its marketing strategy depends heavily on when and how Superdrug steps up its offensive - and how long it lasts. Unlike Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, Mr Hourston believes the current pricing pressures are transient and will recede once sustained economic growth resumes. Which view is right may not become clear until much later this decade. But meanwhile, Boots may need to pay unusually close attention to what Mr Hourston calls 'the lovely balance' between delivering the high margins which delight the City and the competitive prices need to keep customers loyal.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          BATTLING FOR BUSINESS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Profit and loss account Kingfisher (Pounds m)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Year ending          Jan 89     Feb 90    Feb 91    Feb 92     Jan 93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Turnover              2,660      2,910     3,235   3,338.8    3,547.9 Operating profit      225.6      245.8     245.4     218.9      208.7 Margin (Percent)        8.5        8.4       7.6       6.5        5.9  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Profit and loss account Boots The Chemists (Pounds m)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Year ending March        88         90        90        91         92  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Turnover              1,928      2,084     2,268     2,360      2,471 Trading profit          101        151       190       228        246 Margin (Percent)        5.3        7.2       8.4       9.7        9.9  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Boots PLC division (Pounds m)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Pharmaceuticals                          88         90        90        91         92  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Turnover              519.2      524.6     583.8     628.8      699.2 Profit                101.8       95.3     111.1     115.1      120.8 Retail Turnover              277.2      221.1     539.3     681.2      624.6 Profit                 -6.9       -1.4      24.0      27.3       -5.3 Property Turnover                  -          -         -         -          - Profit                   53         46        54        60         69  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company Reports  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

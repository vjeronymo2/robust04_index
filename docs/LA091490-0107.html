			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KEY PROJECT IN WORKS FOR OCEANSIDE;  </P> <P> BUILDING: THE $325-MILLION DEAL WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT REDEVELOPMENT  PROJECT IN THE CITY'S HISTORY.  </P> <P> Oceanside is nearing an agreement with developers to build a $325-million  commercial-hotel-residential project on 10 empty acres by the Oceanside Pier,  the most important project in city redevelopment history.  </P> <P> When the project on vacant land that once held sex arcades, adult theaters and  bars is finished in 1992, it is expected to rejuvenate Oceanside's lackluster  downtown with attractions for both tourists and local residents -- sort of a  North County Seaport Village.  </P> <P> "This project is what we've been working for over the last 17 years," city  Redevelopment Director Patricia Hightman said Thursday. "This is the heart of  our downtown."  </P> <P> City officials are negotiating with Keenan Associates, owner of three blocks on  Pacific Street directly across from the pier, and the Santa Fe Railroad's real  estate division, Catellus Corp., which has five blocks just east of the Keenan  property. The city owns two blocks in the project area.  </P> <P> Landowner James Keenan and developer James Watkins propose a $250-million  project consisting of a 250-room hotel, 150 condominiums, 350 time-share units,  150,000 square feet of retail space and a 70,000-square-foot office building.  </P> <P> The office building would be on a city-owned block at Hill Street and Mission  Avenue that is separated from most of the project area.  </P> <P> In a $75-million companion development, Catellus wants to build 15,000 square  feet of restaurants, 64,000 square feet of shops, a 20,000-square-foot office  building and 318 condominiums.  </P> <P> Although Keenan and Catellus have had differences -- and one significant issue  remains in dispute -- Hightman said she is confident the two coordinated  projects are "extremely compatible."  </P> <P> "We are very optimistic that, with one or two more meetings, we will bring the  projects into complete compatibility and it will be a unified project," she  said.  </P> <P> According to the developers, the project will yield $4 million a year for the  city through property, sales and bed taxes.  </P> <P> Although city officials hope an agreement will be announced within two weeks,  Mike Ogden, project manager for Keenan, predicted the deal probably will take  until mid October.  </P> <P> Ogden said a key outstanding issue is the height and density of the adjacent  railroad project. Also, the amount and longevity of a city redevelopment  subsidy to provide streets and other infrastructure for the development must be  worked out, he said.  </P> <P> "We're real close" to a deal, said Ogden, adding, "We think this project will  have a profound effect on the downtown of Oceanside."  </P> <P> A representative of Catellus Corp. could not be reached for comment Thursday.  </P> <P> The project is a milestone in Oceanside's often frustrating struggle to return  its coastal downtown to a safe, scenic and economically thriving area.  </P> <P> During the '60s and '70s, much of the area slid into blight, worsened by social  problems as drug dealers, gambling interests and prostitutes catered to young  Marines during the Vietnam War era.  </P> <P> Especially in the '80s, the redevelopment program has cleaned up the  beachfront, called The Strand, enticed attractive seaside condominiums, and  encouraged some housing and commercial building rehabilitation.  </P> <P> The city pier was rebuilt a few years ago, and, in a bold commitment to  reviving the downtown, the city invested $30 million in a new Spanish-style  Civic Center that opened in June. It is three blocks away from the pier area  project.  </P> <P> The city's strategy in erecting the Civic Center downtown was to generate  confidence by private developers and local residents, many of whom long ago  stopped shopping downtown.  </P> <P> "This is a pioneering area," said Ogden. "Nobody has done any sizable  commercial projects in the area."  </P> <P> He believes the Keenan job, which "is going to be a Seaport Village type of  project" will have a "domino effect" by encouraging others to invest in  downtown.  </P> <P> Stebbins Dean, chief administrative officer of the Oceanside Chamber of  Commerce, said he believes the pier-area project has taken the redevelopment  effort "near its peak."  </P> <P> "There's no doubt it is the most significant redevelopment project you can  expect," he said.  </P> <P> But he cautioned that, despite the project, "it's not like you take a deep  breath and say Oceanside is complete now." He said the city still sorely needs  more downtown retail, more businesses to serve tourists, building renovation  and street beautification.  </P></p>

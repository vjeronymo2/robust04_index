			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio with </F> unidentified reporters on 7 June; place not given; from the  "Telepress" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] How is the Jorge Carpio Nicolle case  coming along?    [De Leon] This investigation has proven very difficult for  the executive branch, and it has had a high cost. We have  located a weapon, at least one weapon, which is essential  evidence that can lead us to the perpetrators of this damnable  crime. Ballistic tests were carried out, and it was proven that  this weapon was at the scene of the crime, and, therefore, this  is an unquestionable lead. This lead might take us to criminals  here or in any part of the world.    These investigations have shown that the evidence we have  against these people is such that, in my opinion, their arrests  were warranted, and indeed this was the case. We contributed  and even requested the Army's assistance in arresting these  people.    Today, however, we see that the judge inexplicably has  ordered the provisional release of these three people. I cannot  interfere in a different branch of government, and I respect its  independence. Nevertheless, one really cannot explain how these  three people can be released today because of a lack of  evidence, according to the judge. I repeat, the weapon that was  fired at the crime scene has been identified, and this has been  proven through ballistics.    These are the kinds of things that disappoint the people of  Guatemala, because justice is neither swift nor adequate. These  disappointments are what can cause increased violence and  sometimes cause people to take the law into their own hands. It  is very sad.    Again, I do not want to interfere, and I do not want this to  be misinterpreted. I am not a judge, and I do not have the case  file in my hands. This is the judge's responsibility. He  issued this ruling under his own authority, but for the  Guatemalan people, this is a slap in the face -- something that  takes away hope and prompts the people to ask whether justice is  fair.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] what hope do the people have  if  the judicial system fails them in cases as important as this one?    [De Leon] This is the question one has to ask. If this  happens in such a highly publicized case because of the stature  of the individual killed, someone like Jorge Carpio -- a  political leader, a media director -- and in a case supported by  such a detailed investigation, as well as a case backed by  pressure from every sector, and then the justice system goes  ahead and rules as it did, then we must ask ourselves what can  ordinary citizens expect. What can Indians expect from the  justice system? It is truly disappointing.    I learned of the ruling through the press. If this is  disappointing and exasperating for the president of the  Republic, how must the Guatemalan people receive the news?    [Reporter] The human rights ombudsman has requested an end  to  military conscription because of violations even to minors  [words indistinct]. What decision will be reached?    [De Leon] This is an issue that has been under discussion  for  a long time. There is a draft bill aimed at resolving certain  anomalies that the defense minister himself mentioned a few days  ago. Regrettably, once more we fall into the hands of Congress.  Look how long ago this draft bill was presented. It has been  sidetracked, and we have no hope that this law will be debated  during this term of Congress. We will have to wait.    Nevertheless, we are going to meet with the defense minister  and review the evidence the human rights ombudsman says he has  in connection with certain cases. We agree that there have been  anomalies. Nevertheless, the influx of volunteers to the  military service over the past few months is incredible. You  cannot imagine the number of young people who have signed up.  In most departments, forceful conscription is unnecessary, and  therefore we are surprised by these reports. We must accept,  however, that these anomalies still take place, which is  something the defense minister has accepted. We are going to  meet with the High Command to analyze this situation and to take  appropriate steps.    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [De Leon] No. No. Nothing of the sort. That is something  that must be ruled out since we are still confronting a  situation of armed internal conflict. Anyone who suggests  eliminating the Army or refraining from upgrading or modernizing  it is naive, because they are looking for us to remain without  an Army at a time when subversive groups are still operating in  the country. It is impossible to do that at this time. The  Army is an issue that is included in the Constitution; in  addition, the armed internal conflict is a reality. Acts of  sabotage are still taking place. Yesterday they blew up an  electricity tower in Esquintla and Taxisco. That proposal can  be taken care of.    [Reporter] [word indistinct]    [De Leon] Keep in mind that military service is incorporated  in Guatemala's political Constitution, and it is also every  citizen's right and duty. The Constitution does not ask whether  it should be done. It is a patriotic duty according to the  constitutional norm that establishes it. When that is modified,  then we can proceed to disband it. However, as long as it is  not modified, it is the patriotic duty of every youth who has  reached 18 years of age.    [Reporter] What programs were you referring to during your  address in....    [De Leon, interrupting] In the United States?    [Reporter] Yes, that is correct.    [De Leon] That was a television program in the United  States. Exactly what program, I can't recall.    [Reporter] What did you....    [De Leon, interrupting] By the way, I would like to say  that, in this respect and despite the numerous problems the  government has had, at this time it has been able to coordinate  activities with representatives from the religious and the  economic sectors. It was precisely the business sector that  called my attention to this struggle against the television  stations, or against the unjustified attacks that are being  fabricated against Guatemala. In order words, efforts are  currently being coordinated among the religious, military, and  economic sectors. In this new phase we have had excellent  relations with the business and workers sectors, always seeking  common ground and avoiding confrontations. We are only awaiting  the new Congress and the new Supreme Court in order to also  begin a new relationship with the political sector. We are  looking forward to a new National Congress, which will only be  responsible to the Guatemalan people. We continue to abstain  from interfering, because that is not my administration's  policy. However, we do expect to maintain a relationship with  the Legislative Branch in order to legislate -- even if it is in  that congress' last year -- for the benefit of the Guatemalan  people.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] in the conflict with Belize.  Who are the ones causing it, and what is expected of it?    [De Leon] I do not know exactly.... [pauses] I just signed  the agreement not long ago, but at this time I don't have the  specific details at hand, or all the names. Rather than mislead  you, I would rather give you the information afterwards. At any  rate, the agreement has already been signed.    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [De Leon] During the next few days. We are only awaiting  the return of Foreign Minister [Gladys Maritza Ruiz de] Vielman.  She should be arriving at any time.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] you said that there are my  sectors....    [De Leon, interrupting] No, I said that there are  individuals  who have proceeded to gather and form radical groups.  Unfortunately these radical groups still exist. I have even  mentioned, at one time or another, that the political will of  some subversive groups within the URNG [Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity] are not interested in peace. We do not  know if they are prepared for it. We believe that they  themselves may feel that they are not prepared and would  possibly prefer to postpone the signing of a peace agreement.  Even though these are radical groups, fortunately they are  becoming a minority.    [Reporter] When will the peace agreement resume?    [De Leon] I understand that sometime at the end of this week  both sides will again meet. The talks are scheduled to begin  with discussions related to the issue of displaced people.  After that they will travel to Oslo where talks will continue.    [Reporter] Thank you very much, Mr. President.    [De Leon] Thank you.</p>

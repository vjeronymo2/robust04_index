			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Fiat executive answers charges MR Riccardo Ruggeri, chief executive of New Holland, Fiat's London-based agricultural machinery and earth-moving equipment venture with Ford, yesterday presented himself to Milan magistrates to answer charges of alleged corruption, Robert Graham reports from Rome. Milan magistrates had issued an arrest warrant for Mr Ruggeri on March 24 and are understood to be questioning him about the period when he was working in Iveco, Fiat's commercial vehicules subsidiary. Iveco's Milan concessionaire is alleged to have paid 4 per cent of a 15 per cent discount on a bus sale to the Milan municipality into a Swiss bank account, for use by Italian political parties. On Thursday, an arrest warrant was issued for Mr Mauro Bertini, managing director of Fiat Avio, the Turin auto group's turbines subsidiary, concerning some L6bn (Pounds 2.5m) alleged to have been paid to the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties so as to secure a turbine contract in a power station. This followed the arrest of an intermediary and Avio consultant, Mr Roberto Araldi, on Wednesday. Mr Bertini is believed to be abroad. Mr Mario Artali, managing director of the state food group SME, was arrested in Rome on a charge of illegal party financing, according to the Italian news service Ansa. SME, part of Italy's Iri holding company, is one of the first companies slated for privatisation under a plan by Italy to sell off much of its state sector.</p>

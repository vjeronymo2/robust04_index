			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Eurocamp forecasts 'significant' progress Eurocamp, the tour operator specialising in self-drive camping holidays, yesterday reported an increased interim loss, but forecast 'a significantly improved' result for the full year. In the half-year to April the pre-tax loss rose from Pounds 5.12m to Pounds 5.88m. Turnover fell from Pounds 368,000 to Pounds 316,000, reflecting a fall in demand for Easter breaks to Euro Disney. An interim loss is normal for the group, which relies heavily on the second half for the bulk of its revenues. Sales for the last full-year were Pounds 56.7m, and pre-tax profits were Pounds 6.25m. The shares closed 8p ahead at 265p. Mr Gordon Harman, finance director, said yesterday that overall bookings had increased by 20 per cent for the coming season. Only part of the gains reflected an element of recovery in both the camping market and the market for French holidays. Camp site occupancy rates, which fell 6 per cent last year, were improving, and there had been 'substantial growth' in mobile home, or caravan, bookings, which now represented 21 per cent of total bookings, up from a previous 17 per cent. Margins declined last year from 15 per cent to 11 per cent. A small improvement is seen this year, but Mr Harman did not expect them to regain 15 per cent for some time. Nevertheless, margins were good by tourist industry standards. Germany and the Netherlands were now responsible for 50 per cent of total bookings, and were showing good demand for mobile homes. Mr Harman believed the mobile homes sector of the business and the sale of holidays through travel agencies were potential areas for further growth. Losses per share were 15.2p, up from 13.2p. Theinterim dividend is increased from 3.45p to 3.6p.</p>

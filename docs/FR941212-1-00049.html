			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Creation of the Electronic Data Base <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Data Capturing Operation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A data capturing operation will enable the creation of a data base containing image and text equivalent to the content of a paper application file. It is currently contemplated that those application materials not submitted in machine readable format will be image and/or optical character recognition (OCR) scanned by the PTO for entry into this electronic data base. The PTO currently contemplates that the content of the application as originally deposited in the PTO will be captured after the application is serialized, and application-related materials subsequently submitted will be captured after identification as directed to an existing application. Currently, the PTO accepts, either by hand-carried delivery or facsimile transmission, application related materials (e.g., amendments, petitions) in locations other than the central mailroom (e.g., the various Examining Groups). Unless the PTO requires that all official application-related materials be submitted at a central location (e.g., the mailroom), the PTO will have to either (1) forward such application-related materials to a central data capturing facility, or (2) provide data capturing facilities at every location at which application materials may be filed in the PTO. Notwithstanding the cost of either providing and operating numerous data capturing facilities, or routing all application-related materials to a central data capturing facility, the PTO is concerned that a decentralized operation will cause some application-related materials to elude capture onto this data base. See Question  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Standard Application Format <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The creation of an electronic data base which mirrors the content of the paper application file will be facilitated if paper filed in the PTO are either (1) submitted in machine readable format or (2) specifically arranged for image and/or OCR scanning by the PTO for entry into this electronic data base. To facilitate the scanning of papers not submitted in machine readable format, the PTO is considering requiring some type of standard application format to increase scanning accuracy and significantly reduce data capture costs. The PTO requests comments on the advisability of a standard format and on the type or extent of a standard format. This standard format could take the form of (1) requiring only bibliographic data (e.g., title, inventor(s) name(s), address(es), etc.), representative, correspondence address, priority claims, be arranged in a standard format, (2) requiring bibliographic data and portions of the technical content of the application such as the abstract, claims, and drawings be arranged in a standard format, or (3) requiring that the entire application be arranged in a standard format. In addition, the standard format could include requiring standard paper sizes (81/2 by 11 inches and/or A4 only) for all application papers and/or requiring (1) that claims be located on a separate page from the specification, (2) special numbering for and/or spacing between each claim, or (3) that each claim be located on a separate page. See Question  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Publication <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Publication Content <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PTO has considered a number of options regarding what the pre-grant publication might contain. These options included publishing the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Only the title and certain limited bibliographical data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Something similar to what the Official Gazette provides for an issued patent: a drawing figure, representative claim and certain bibliographical data, perhaps also including the abstract or the abstract rather than a representative claim (a Gazette Entry). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. The entire application as filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iv. The entire application file as it exists at a fixed time before publication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Options (i) and (ii) contemplate that, subsequent to publication, access will be made available on demand to the content of the application (specification, claims and drawings), hereinafter ``application content,'' as of the filing date or some fixed time before publication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option (iii) would require printing the entire application as filed (specification, claims, and drawings), costing substantially the same as the printing of the patent, and taking up considerable space in the search files. The costs and space requirements of option (iv) would be greater than those of option (iii), but option (iv) would provide the greatest amount of published information. At present, it is believed that implementation of option (ii), with access to the application content, will best serve the interests of both the PTO and the public. Costs will be minimized by keeping the published information to a single page and the impact on the public and examiners' search files will be minimal, as compared to options (iii) and (iv). Furthermore, the information provided by option (ii) should be sufficient to enable the reader to make an educated decision as to whether ``detailed access'' to the application itself is necessary. Option (i), although somewhat lower in cost, would most likely cause unnecessary requests for review of the application file since the published information would be limited to a title, which may not be reasonably indicative of the technical disclosure of the application, much less what is actually being claimed. Present thinking is to publish a Gazette Entry in a separate Gazette of Patent Application Notices, provide access to the application content, and create a Patent Application Notice containing similar information for placement in the search files. See Question  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PTO also requests comments as to whether separate delivery of a copy of the published application information, i.e., the Gazette Entry or the Patent Application Notice, to the applicant is desirable. As the published information will be available in the Gazette of Patent Application Notices, and applicants will know from their own files what is published, it is unclear that the additional delivery of a copy of such information to the applicant justifies the additional costs, and thus fees, for providing such information.

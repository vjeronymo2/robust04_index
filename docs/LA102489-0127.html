			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPRESSION IN ELDERLY, NON-HEALTH ISSUES  LINKED  </P> <P> Depression in older people with chronic diseases seems to be linked more to  unrelated problems such as lack of friends, unemployment or unfaithful spouses  than to the illness itself, according to a USC study recently released in Los  Angeles. The study suggests that elderly people afflicted with chronic diseases  seek more information about a problem -- such as the loss of a loved one -- and  take positive steps to surmount it. Patients also should try to throw  themselves into other activities to keep their mind off troubles, the study  said.  </P> <P> "The findings help us understand why some older persons get depressed when  faced with major health problems and others do not," says Bryan Kemp, clinical  associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the USC School of  Medicine.  </P> <P> The study was based on physical and psychological assessments of 73 patients,  whose average age was 72. They had an average of four chronic illnesses each,  including heart disease, arthritis and diabetes. Twenty-three of the patients  were found to have significant symptoms of depression.  </P></p>

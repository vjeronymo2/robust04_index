			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Northern Electric lifts interim payout 30% on strong growth The strong financial performance of the regional electricity sector was highlighted yesterday when Northern Electric lifted its interim dividend by 30 per cent and Eastern Group by 25 per cent. Northern's increase, by 2.2p to 9.6p, is the second highest in this year's electricity results season. All six England and Wales regional companies which have reported so far this year have lifted dividends by more than 20 per cent. Eastern's dividend rose from 6.6p to 8.25p. The payouts, which have come on top of healthy profit increases of 20 per cent or more, will increase the political controversy surrounding the companies. The Labour party has called for a 'windfall profits' tax on utilities, arguing that the power companies were sold off at too low a a price four years ago and have not been regulated rigorously enough since then. Political debate is likely to become more heated before the likely flotation of the National Grid next May or June. The government is opposed to a windfall tax, but is under pressure to act on what many see as the power companies' excessive profits. Northern, based in Newcastle Upon Tyne, said its profits for the six months to September 30 were Pounds 63.4m, a 20.5 per cent increase. Eastern Group, based in Ipswich, reported a 27 increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 98.1m. Both companies said the high dividend increases were made possible by recent buy-backs of their shares. Northern has bought 10 per cent of its shares and Eastern 5 per cent. Buy-backs allow companies to lift dividends because there are fewer shares in issue. Northern said its underlying dividend increase was 16 per cent while Eastern said total dividend payments would rise 19 per cent. Analysts expect Northern's full-year dividend increase to be around 30 per cent. Some say its willingness to increase dividends is influenced by speculation that it will be the first regional power company to be subject to a takeover bid. The government's 'golden share' in each of the regional companies ends in March, making takeovers more likely. Scottish Power is often rumoured to be interested in taking over Northern. Mr David Morris, Northern's chairman, said there had been no noticeable changes in the company's shareholders recently. Details, Page 24; Lex, Page 20</p>

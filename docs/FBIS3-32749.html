			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>   [Text] The confrontation between President Cesar Gaviria  and the State Council is the main news story today. The State  Council members will hold a special meeting today at 0900 in  Santa Fe de Bogota to discuss in detail the speech delivered by  President Gaviria yesterday at noon and rebroadcast by  television at 2000 last night. Caracol interviewed State  Council President Amado Gutierrez during the past few hours.  Here is his statement:    [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] The president obviously has  his  own criteria, which we respect, but the State Council does not  share his views. After thoroughly reviewing the situation--not  only yesterday during an eight-hour meeting but for the past 20  days--we reached a different conclusion. We believe our opinion  is as respectable as the one the president has just expressed.    [Unidentified reporter] President Gaviria has said the State  Council's position is political and very vague, which apparently  was the reason why he was so upset.    [Gutierrez] Regarding our opinion as being political, I must  say this subject concerns our national sovereignty and the  constitutional system we have had since 1991. From that  viewpoint, we could say the matter is political, based on the  old concept that politics is the art of governing people the  best way possible. It is political in that sense, not in the  sense the word politics is usually meant; in other words, it is  a political opinion, because it regards the Constitution.    Regarding our opinion as being vague, we believe a lengthy  report is not necessarily more precise. I believe if we clearly  present in two pages a situation actually occurring in the  country, it should be enough.    [Reporter] How does the State Council view President  Gaviria's position on this case, considering the situation of  international cooperation in the antidrug-trafficking struggle?    [Gutierrez] I do not see why we should associate a statement  from the State Council with the antidrug-trafficking struggle.  First, the public in general was informed about a community  assistance project and the construction of a school and a health  center; after that, military exercises were mentioned, and  recently the topic is being linked to drug-trafficking problems.  Within that line of thought, we do not know where this is going  to end.    We are respectful of the government functions and policy in  dealing with crime in general; we respect that. Nevertheless,  we do not see why this matter should be linked to that subject,  as it was only mentioned superficially in the document we  received from the president.    In our opinion, this is basically a legal problem. According  to the Constitution, approval by the Senate, which was in  session on 29 October 1993 when the agreement was signed, was  necessary. During the time the Senate was not in session, the  State Council's previous authorization was necessary. It is  strictly a legal problem. Any other incidental considerations  concerning the policy against crime is totally irrelevant to the  subject. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Carlos Fazio] </F>   [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Reports indicate or you  can conclude from these reports that in his accidental and  unproductive visit to Chiapas, U.S. Legislator Robert Torricelli  showed his true self -- a modern-age conquistador.    Arrogant and an interventionist, the Democratic Party  representative from New Jersey, chairman of the Western  Hemisphere Affairs subcommittee in the U.S. House of  Representatives, menacingly waves the banners of democracy and  human rights. His true objective is to make gains to further  his career in the U.S. Congress by profiting -- via lobbies that  amount to millions -- from other people's misfortunes.    The distinguished visitor has a unique history. He has  obtained notoriety in the past years from the so-called  Torricelli Law that bears his name and which was signed by then  President George Bush on 23 October 1992.    The amendment prohibits U.S. based firms to conduct business  with Cuba through their business subsidiaries in third  countries. It also considers penalties for countries that have  economic ties with Havana with the illegal extraterritorial  implementation of U.S. laws.    According to the WALL STREET JOURNAL, Torricelli's old  activities were unknown until the funds of Jorge Mas Canosa's  National Cuban-American Foundation started to augment  Torricelli's bank account. In those days, a publication of the  Cuban Studies Center reported: "Everybody in Miami knows that  Mas Canosa is the moral author of the Torricelli bill."    There is no doubt that Torricelli is clever. His amendment,  also known as the "Democracy in Cuba Act," was approved with  bipartisan consensus and Bill Clinton, then the Democratic Party  presidential candidate, gave it his endorsement.    Among his other initiatives, this modern redeemer, who now  attempts to supervise the elections in Mexico and to tell the  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) what it must do,  promotes destabilization actions of "individuals and  organizations" against Cuba. He favors an armed strife of the  negative kind -- the kind used by the death squads financed by  the Pentagon and the CIA and groups organized by the United  States, such as the anti-Sandinists in Nicaragua.    Two years ago, Wayne Smith, former chief of the U.S.  Interest  Section in Havana and a man who cannot be accused of being  pro-Cuban, wrote in the LOS ANGELES TIMES that the Torricelli  Law was "one of the most despicable and injurious legislative  proposals" forged in 1992.    In the Cuban case, Torricelli took advantage of the  circumstances of an electoral year in the United States. Many  legislators wanted to be reelected and were afraid they would be  accused of being "soft" on communism. In reality, the law shows  Washington's double standards: Bush proclaims his Initiative of  the Americas and free trade (later ratified by President  Clinton) with great fanfare but, due to ideological reasons,  Cuba is cut off by Adam Smith's "invisible hand."    Robert Torricelli does not play alone. On 20 February 1990,  Connie Mack, the Republican Party senator from Florida,  announced in Washington the formation of a caucus in both houses  of Congress to reinforce hostilities against the island. The  so-called "Caucus for Cuba's Freedom" was formed by eight  legislators with known anti-Cuban positions, six of the  legislators were from Florida, as well as the Heritage  Foundation, the National Cuban-American Foundation of Jorge Mas  Canosa, and other conservative organizations. Obviously,  Torricelli was a part of this monster.    When President Bush signed the Torricelli Law in a campaign  act in Miami on 23 October 1992, he sanctioned the United  States' contempt for the international community, including its  main NATO allies and its two NAFTA [North American Free Trade  Agreement] partners: Canada and Mexico.    The bipartisan consensus showed that it was a strategic bill  with covert military objectives and could constitute the  preamble to a direct aggression against the island, including an  armed intervention "for humanitarian purposes."    The international community repudiated the initiative. It  meant the United States could illegally exercise its economic  power to mar other nations with political objectives, which is  explicitly condemned by the United Nations. The initiative also  was an attempt to implement U.S. laws and extraterritorially, on  third countries.</p>

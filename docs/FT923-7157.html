			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Housing starts in US fall again US HOUSING starts fell unexpectedly for a second month in a row in July, the Commerce Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The annual rate of starts declined by 2.8 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted 1.12m units. Wall Street economists had expected a slight rise in construction activity. The Commerce Department, which previously said housing starts in June had fallen by 3.2 per cent, also issued a revised figure of 3.8 per cent. June and July were exceptionally rainy months in the US, which hurt construction activity. But interest rates for home mortgages are at their lowest levels since the early 1970s, and that may benefit builders in coming months. The fall-off in July was widespread, with only the south reporting a slight rise in starts on homes. Activity weakened in the northeast, the midwest and the west. But overall, the July starts level was 10.2 per cent higher than the seasonally adjusted annual rate of 971,000 units in July 1991. The US economy has been recovering so weakly that consumers remain reluctant to spend. In July the Federal Reserve slashed its trend-setting discount rate to 3 per cent, the lowest since 1963.</p>

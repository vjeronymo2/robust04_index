			<p>CSO     [Text] Estimates of changes achievable with the possible  introduction of a summer time system which makes effective use  of daylight hours during the summer were released on the 27th  and included figures such as a 1.2 trillion yen increase in  domestic demand, an increase of 0.3 percent in the gross  national product and energy conservation equal to 550,000  kiloliters of petroleum or 0.15 percent of the final consumption  recorded for 1992. These figures will be included in a report  recommending adoption of the summer time system to be submitted  by June by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's  Natural Resources and Energy Agency director's private-sector  advisory organ, the Summer Time System Forum (chaired by  professor Hiroaki Fukami of Keio University).    At the request of the forum, the nonprofit organization,  "Leisure Time Development Center," compiled a report based on a  questionnaire survey covering changes in lifestyles. The survey  was premised on the assumption that clocks would be advanced for  one hour during the April through September summer period.    As a result, the effect on domestic demand would be an  increase of 10 percent over fiscal year 1992 to include 330  million yen spent on the use of sports facilities such as golf  shooting ranges and 64 million yen spent on sporting goods.  Spending on movies, theaters, and concerts would reach a level  of 145 million yen, reflecting a 30-percent increase, while  spending on recreational travel would reach 344 million yen.    On the other hand, the effect on annual energy conservation  converted into petroleum equivalents would be 310,000 kiloliters  for domestic use and 240,000 kiloliters for commercial use.    The agency plans to use these estimates as a basis for  appealing for implementation of the system as being beneficial  in promoting changes to lifestyles that emphasize leisure  pursuits.</p>

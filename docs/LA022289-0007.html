			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT AID  </P> <P> I enjoyed reading Alvin L. Schorr's column "Banks Don't Have to Beg; Why Should  the Poor?" (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 2). Former President Reagan continually harangued  us with his declaration that we should get government off our backs. "Less  government is good government." Yet, how quickly do corporate interests flock  to Washington with their lobbyists for government contracts and bailouts when  the going gets tough. Yet, when labor and the poor plead their case, they're  told to "pick themselves up by their bootstraps." In other words, do it without  the help of government. Do not do as we do, but do as we say.  </P> <P> In the same issue of Schorr's column was a news item about Pasadena's welfare  queen convicted in 1983 of perpetrating $377,000 in welfare fraud, the largest  in U.S. history. Compared to the billions of dollars which have been lost in  the savings and loan scams, mergers and takeovers, defense procurement scams,  billions of dollars lost to Third World countries in imprudent bank loans, the  queen of welfare fraud seems like small potatoes indeed. Welfare fraud compared  to corporate fraud can be compared to an anthill standing alongside Mount  Vesuvius. But a needle can take on the appearance of the Washington Monument if  it is held close to the eye.  </P> <P> S.M. ROSEN  </P> <P> Newberry Park  </P></p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hazlewood deals part of refocusing Hazlewood Foods yesterday announced it had acquired Welten Snacks, the Holland-based frozen snack manufacturer. The purchase price was not disclosed. The group said Welten's product range of frozen, crumbed convenience/snack products would further strengthen the convenience food range of Advang, into which the company is to be integrated. Welten had net sales of Pounds 3.2m in 1992. The announcement follows Hazlewood's sale last Friday of Luijckx Beheer for Pounds 14.2m cash. Luijckx makes chocolate decorations and bakery items and is not considered a part of Hazlewood's current core business. In the year ended March 31 1993 it produced net profits of Pounds 1.4m on turnover of Pounds 9.4m. The deals are part of Hazlewood's strategy to focus on its core businesses.</p>

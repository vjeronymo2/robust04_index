			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Observer: Clean fight Guess who is thumping the morality tub in the fight for a US senate seat in Virginia? Why, none other than Oliver North, the retired marine lieutenant colonel who lied to the US Congress over the Iran-Contra affair. North - who says 'character always counts in a campaign' - accuses his main rival in November's election, Senator Charles Robb, of having a 'seriously flawed' character and lacking the 'moral force' to hold public office. The attack is based on Robb's admission of 'socialising in situations not appropriate for a married man', while serving the state as governor in the mid-1980s.</p>

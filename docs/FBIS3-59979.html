When police searched an apartment in the Pratu Nam area,  they  were shocked when they opened the door. Inside the apartment,  they found 5-6 blacks in each room. The police searched almost  10 rooms and found 40-50 people. Thus, it's not surprising why  so many of these people can be seen walking around the Pratu Nam  area in the day.    From examining their passports, it was found that all had  entered the country legally as tourists and businessmen. Thus,  the police had to release them. Police Colonel Khongdet Chusi,  the deputy commander of the Northern Bangkok Metropolitan Police  and a former police superintendent known for suppressing  godfathers, said that ``we are very suspicious about what they  are doing here.''    Police files show that many blacks from African countries  work as heroin couriers. They use Thailand as a transit point  for smuggling heroin to a third country, including the United  States and countries in Europe. In those countries, heroin is  worth 10 times as much as it is here, that is, it increases from  200,000 baht per kg to 2 million baht per kg.    The data matches that of narcotics control units. It was  also  discovered that traffickers were using the parking lot of a  well-known shop in the Pratu Nam area as a narcotics delivery  point. ``Those who are caught red-handed usually ask if they  will be sentenced to death. After they are told that they won't  be, they feel better. They have said that there is much poverty  in their native country and so they have to take this risk. If  they can get away with this, their lives will improve greatly.  And even if they are caught, their families won't suffer,  because the agents who hired them will take care of their  families as agreed on beforehand,'' said Police Colonel Khongdet.    During the past 2-3 years, many blacks have been arrested on  charges of trying to smuggle narcotics out of the country. Most  have been arrested while waiting to board an airplane to a third  country. They use a variety of techniques for smuggling drugs.  In the past, they used to pack heroin in condoms and ingest the  packets. One person could smuggle out only about 1 kg this way,  which meant that many people had to be used each trip. This  brought them to the attention of narcotics units. Also, this was  very dangerous. Some of the couriers died because the  heroin-filled packets burst in their stomachs.    Thus, traffickers changed their method by concealing the  heroin in bottles of sauce, cans of flour, cosmetic bottles, and  secret compartments in their suitcases. This made it difficult  for officials to find the narcotics because the containers had  to be torn apart to find the drugs. It is thought that the  amount of heroin seized is much less than the amount that slips  by Thai officials.    Statistics on heroin seizures nationwide show that in 1992,  officials seized a total of 1,062 kg. During the first six  months of 1993, officials seized 988.6 kg with a domestic value  of more than 197 million baht, or 1,970 million baht in Europe  or the United States.    The statistics show that seizures have increased this year.  Considering the amount of heroin successfully smuggled out of  the country, the amount of money involved is staggering and  seems worth the risk. In particular, officials have not been  able to get at the chief culprits behind the heroin smuggling.  This is because the heroin smuggling routes are divided into  sections.    In 1992, officials arrested 536 suspected couriers in 169  cases. Most, 242, were Burmese, who were caught smuggling 43 kg  of heroin. Twelve blacks from Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana were  arrested with 19 kg of heroin. Altogether, officials seized 239  kg. During the first six months of 1993, officials arrested 489  suspects and seized 418 kg of heroin. Most were Burmese, who  were caught with 32 kg of heroin. Also arrested were two  Taiwanese with 114 kg, 10 blacks with 25 kg, and six Hong Kong  Chinese with 15 kg.    Even though the number of arrests has increased, a large  number have managed to avoid being arrested and smuggle the  heroin out of the country. The methods used to smuggle heroin,  including both methods of concealment and the selection of  couriers, have improved.    When the heroin traffickers learned that narcotics units  were  keeping close watch on blacks, they started to hire others to  work as couriers, particularly people from poor Asian countries.  Today, officials have been told to keep a close watch on Burmese.</p>

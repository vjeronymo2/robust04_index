			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Norway - Other markets A busy week is in store with eight-month results. Bergesen, Norway's largest shipowner, which reported a steep fall in pre-tax profits for the first four months, reports on Wednesday. Thursday brings figures from Norsk Skog, the forestry group, and Friday sees details from Kvaerner, Europe's biggest shipbuilder and Norway's second largest stock market listed company, which increased pre-tax profits by 36 per cent in the first four months of 1994 against the same period a year earlier. Mr Thomas Wold at Enskilda Corporate points out that the Norwegian market's sluggish performance this year has left it down about 3.5 per cent, although it has outperformed Europe, excluding the UK, by close to 7.7 per cent. He expects the market to continue weak for another couple of months but thinks it has the potential to resume a positive trend towards the end of the year and into 1995. The substantial uncertainty about the outcome of the EU referendum on November 28 is holding back investment in the stock market and has added a political risk premium to interest rates, he says. However resolution of the issue, with Sweden and Finland also voting in favour, would have a positive effect on interest rates and the stock market.</p>

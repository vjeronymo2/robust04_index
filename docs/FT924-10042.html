			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Vietnam looks for gains from US election: Economic hopes for the lifting of Washington's aid embargo TODAY'S US election will be closely watched from Hanoi. It could determine the pace at which Washington, which has ostracised Vietnam since the end of the war in Indochina in 1975, allows it to resume international business. Assistance from multilateral institutions and - except for small amounts - from western governments has been prevented by a US embargo. Finance is desperately needed to help rebuild the country's infrastructure and support attempts to introduce free-market reforms. The Bush administration has been under intense pressure both to maintain and to lift the ban. US companies, barred by the embargo from doing business, feel they are losing out to foreign competitors on a potential bonanza. Businessmen from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as from Europe and Australia, have been swarming to Vietnam, which is seen as offering a cheap, enthusiastic and well-educated labour force as well as a large domestic market. They have developed important contacts, but as yet only limited actual business. Vocal conservative and veterans' groups in the US are implacably opposed to rehabilitating Vietnam while Americans lost in the war remain unaccounted for. The depth of feeling still aroused by Vietnam is evident at any Independence Day parade or similar event across America. President Bush has made progress in winning co-operation from the communist Hanoi government in the attempt to trace 2,265 servicemen listed as unaccounted for in Indochina. He has involved senators who are outspoken on the issue in the search - some have even knocked unannounced on the doors of Vietnamese prisons. Last year he set out a four-stage 'road map' to normalisation, under which progress in accounting for missing servicemen and towards peace and elections in neighbouring Cambodia - which had a government installed by Vietnam - would lead to a phased lifting of the embargo. US businessmen are allowed to visit Vietnam but not to sign contracts, and telecommunications links have been restored so that American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) has been able to enter the market - though not yet to pocket the revenue. The (unpublished) road map foresaw lifting the trade embargo six months after the September 1991 signing of the Cambodia peace agreement, but this has not occurred. There are signs that Mr Bush could lift it later this year or in January, whether or not he wins the election. The effort to trace missing servicemen has been bipartisan. But for Mr Bill Clinton - if he wins - lifting of the embargo might not be a priority early in his presidency, since Vietnam is such an emotive issue. It seems unlikely in the longer run that Mr Clinton's approach would differ markedly from that of Mr Bush. Pressure on either a Bush or Clinton administration would increase if, as seems increasingly likely, Japan loses patience with Washington and, in effect, lifts the embargo, which it has maintained out of deference to the US. There are increasing indications that Japan will proceed with a Dollars 200m official aid programme in which Japanese companies would participate. The Hanoi government's economic policies would almost certainly already satisfy the International Monetary Fund. However the IMF cannot lend to Vietnam until the US removes its veto from a French-led plan which would enable Vietnam to repay its arrears to the Fund. IMF lending, in turn, would trigger substantial loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank as well as much larger bilateral aid from governments and the granting of full insurance cover by official export credit agencies. Despite the degree of preparation and the sense of exciting potential, a slower acceleration is more likely than a rapid take-off, for several reasons. First, Vietnam remains a very poor country with extremely inadequate infrastructure: it needs new power stations, roads, bridges, railways, aircraft, hotels, communications, and industrial and agricultural machinery. The United Nations and the Vietnam government have identified projects worth nearly Dollars 7bn. The need for technical expertise and management skills is just as great. Second, despite the government's open policy, there remain bureaucratic and practical hurdles to setting up in Vietnam. Once permission is obtained, office space is limited and staff must be obtained through the government at considerable expense. Corruption and smuggling remain problems. Third, foreign companies, including those that have already established a presence, are likely to be cautious about signing contracts, especially if a proposed joint venture is with one of the many inefficient, loss-making state corporations. Mr Martin Adams, managing director of the Vietnam Fund Management, who manages from Hong Kong a Dollars 10m fund investing in Vietnamese joint ventures, believes the first result of lifting the embargo will be a surge in Vietnam's international trade. Its rice surplus is currently exported, but not to the best markets, because of poor quality, lack of milling facilities, and absence of credit insurance. Textile exports could also rise sharply. The European Community is discussing including Vietnam in its quota arrangements. The broader potential is substantial. Companies such as Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Citicorp, Bank of America, AT&amp;T, and Boeing are expected to try to tap large markets in their respective businesses. So will the oil industry - Mobil had an important presence in Vietnam - and construction equipment companies. But competition will be intense. Korean conglomerates have been actively wooing the Vietnamese, and Japanese companies have made considerable investment in building their position. The path to normalisation is not a straight one. The US could, for example, continue its gradual lifting of restrictions: allowing US airlines to fly to Vietnam, removing curbs on use of the dollar in transactions with Vietnam, allowing US companies to open offices. Even after the trade embargo is lifted, Hanoi and Washington will need to agree on a means to resolve pre-1975 financial claims on each other. The amount of US claims on Vietnam is unknown - a register remains open in Washington. Vietnam has some Dollars 300m of deposits frozen in the US. Since Washington would want to give US companies a chance to compete, the ending of the block on multilateral lending is generally expected to be one of the final steps of the process. It will only be then that Vietnam can really begin to rebuild its economy.</p>

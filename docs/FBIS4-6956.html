			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kohei Murayama] </F>   [Text] Washington, April 24 KYODO -- Japanese officials are  voicing optimism over policy pressures while stressing aid to  Russia as the main focus ahead of the Group of Seven (G-7)  ministerial meeting opening in Washington on Sunday [24 April)  afternoon.    Finance ministers and central bankers from the world's  richest nations are set to begin a five-hour meeting at 12 P.M.  at the historic landmark Dumbarton house to kick off a spate of  international financial meetings that will continue through  Tuesday.    The officials said macroeconomic issues will cover only  about  the first hour and half of the meeting and the rest will be on  aid to Russia. Three Russian representatives led by Deputy  Prime Minister and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin will  join in the final hour, they said.    "Coordination on macroeconomic coordination has become  easier  with G-7 nations showing improvements in their economies," said  a top Japanese official close to the closed-door meeting.    But many analysts feel differently, citing the recent gap in  credit stance stemming from the diverse state of the economy.    The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,  Japan and the United States.    Another Japanese official, accompanying Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii, said the G-7 session is to "review the  macroeconomic developments" after the February meeting in  Germany.    He said the recent rise in long-term rates among G-7 nations  will certainly be discussed as one such development, but he  noted that Fujii recognizes the recent U.S. credit tightening as  "preemptive" measures to curb inflation.    On currency rates, Fujii told reporters that he intends to  stress again his concerns over the yen's sharp rise that may put  a damper on the economy that is starting to improve.    But he said, "Exchange levels are not for us (G-7 ministers)  to decide."    Otherwise, the G-7 financial leaders will concentrate on new  commitments to Russia, possibly agreeing on new loans and debt  rescheduling, to start implementing the 43 billion dollar  package agreed to last April.    He said such new commitments gathered attention after the  recent decision by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to  disburse the remaining 1.5 billion dollars of the 3 billion  dollar loans to promote systemic transformation.    A statement is unlikely to be issued, they said, confirming  earlier remarks by U.S. Treasury [Secretary] Lloyd Bentsen, who  chairs the meeting.    Fujii and Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno will hold a  joint news conference after the meeting.    Before the G-7 session, Fujii will meet with Bentsen at 9:30  A.M., Japanese officials said.    Fujii said he will explain to Bentsen the state of the  Japanese with "things progressed" since the previous Frankfurt  G-7 meeting in February.    "We have moved one step forward," he said, citing a policy  accord newly reached Friday by the ruling coalition parties  before choosing Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata as their candidate to succeed outgoing Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The accord endorsed a full-fledged tax reform, including  permanent tax cuts and offsetting indirect tax hikes, to be  decided in June and enacted by the end of the year.    Meanwhile, a Japanese source said Fujii will again decline  to  predict the scale or any other details of the tax reform that is  to be decided by the Diet.    The source also said the finance minister will ask Bentsen  to  see from a longer run Japan's current account surplus already  "clearly falling in terms of the yen and volume."    Fujii is scheduled to leave for home Sunday after the  meeting, failing to join the twice-yearly gatherings of the IMF  and the World Bank due to a tight domestic schedule involving  formation of a new cabinet.</p>

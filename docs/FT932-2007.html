			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Ferruzzis surrender control THE FERRUZZI family surrendered financial and managerial control of its troubled agro-industrial and chemicals empire over the weekend, paving the way for a radical shake-up of the group. The latest twist in the saga came as Milan magistrates announced they were opening a file on the Ferruzzi debacle. The move appeared primarily intended to protect minority shareholders following the revelation two weeks ago that the group had consolidated debts of L31,000bn (Dollars 21bn). The new management of both Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the family's financial holding company, and Montedison, the main industrial company, is to be chaired by Mr Guido Rossi, a company law expert and former head of Consob, the Milan stock exchange watchdog. The chief executive will be Mr Enrico Bondi, who comes from Gilardini, Fiat's aerospace/defence group, but who has spent many years in the chemicals industry including a period with Montedison. Mr Rossi appears to be the choice of Mr Enrico Cuccia, the head of Mediobanca which is organising the rescue through a pool of the five main creditor banks. Both Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, the chairman, and Mr Carlo Sama, the current chief executive, will be relegated to honorary roles. On Friday the Ferruzzi family agreed to pledge its entire holding of 560m shares in Ferfin to the consortium of five banks. This stake has been pledged to cover outstanding Ferfin debts of L15,123bn.

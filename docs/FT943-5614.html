			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: SWEB active The electricity sector fell sharply under the weight of a flurry of profit-taking but there were suggestions late in the day that one company, South Western Electricity (SWEB), had instructed its broker, BZW, to move into the market to buy in stock. Turnover of 2.2m in SWEB was the third highest on record and indicated that it could have bought just short of 1 per cent of its own shares. SWEB closed only a penny off at 822p. The rest of the Recs were hit by profit-taking. Some dealers felt, however, that the steep declines yesterday could have been an attempt by marketmakers at the big integrated securities houses to flush out stock ahead of attempted share buy backs. Buy backs have been on the agenda for many months and analysts expect many of the companies to to buy in their own stock before the companies enter their closed seasons starting from the middle of the month. It was pointed out that Northern has only six trading days to buy in stock, while Midland has seven and Seeboard, which moved last week to buy its own shares, has nine days. Yorkshire Electricity held up well as the market responded to talk that the shares had responded to the expiry of an OTC, or specially constructed option in the stock. At the close, Yorkshire were only 4 off at 790p. The biggest fallers in the sector included East Midlands, 18 off at 764p, Eastern 29 lower at 813p and Midlands which fell 24 to 814p. South West Water edged up 3 to 578p after stories that the company will not seek a reference to the MMC.</p>

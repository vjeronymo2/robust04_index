			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Management: The shareholder as customer - Daniel Green on St Jude's diversification strategy When Ronald Matricaria arrived as president and chief executive of Minnesota heart valve maker St Jude Medical he found a company in rude financial health. The business had sales of more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 122m) a year and net profit margins, after tax, of 43 per cent. Its one product, a heart valve, enjoyed an 85 per cent US market share and was either first or second in almost every other large market for medical devices. There was a cash pile of Dollars 350m. Yet nobody seemed to want the company's shares. The historic price earnings ratio had sunk to just 11, at the bottom of the pile in the US healthcare sector. 'We had spent four years in paralysis. We couldn't diversify without hurting profitability,' says Matricaria. 'There were several external (non-executive) directors, all senior executives from large healthcare companies. They all had strong views and there was never agreement on strategy. There was no plan,' he says. At the first board meeting after Matricaria joined  - from Eli Lilly, the US drug company, where he had been head of the medical devices division  - a director asked him: 'What are we going to buy?' Matricaria's response was to say that first he had to find out what investors wanted him to do. A shareholder survey showed that greater risk-taking and a spread of that risk were the main priorities. No one mentioned profitability as an area of concern. The replies may have been obvious, but Matricaria had another reason for consulting shareholders. 'Two-thirds of US companies that diversify get hit by shareholder suits,' says Matricaria. 'And over the months that followed consultation there was a big turnover in our shareholder lists. Some bought and others sold.' The next stage was to bring in external advisers  - PA Consultants  - to identify which of St Jude's 'core competencies' could be applied to other businesses and hence form the basis for an acquisitions stra-tegy. PA started off by identifying 191 processes that St Jude used in heart valve manufacture. Forty eight were labelled as 'critical', of which 15 were considered 'world class'. This group was narrowed down to just eight which would be useful in other business areas. The consultants and the company then compared these eight with the 16 therapeutic areas in which medical device companies work. They wanted to label potential takeover targets according to whether they could benefit from St Jude's technologies. 'Six or seven companies were then identified, and we then had to find out which was for sale,' says Matricaria. Given that Matricaria had just come from Eli Lilly, there were perhaps inevitable rumours that St Jude wanted to buy Lilly's heart pacemaker business. That speculation came to nothing. The Siemens heart pacemaker business was also on St Jude's list and luckily for Matricaria the German electronics giant had just conducted a review of its businesses and concluded that it was no longer interested in that activity. Talks between St Jude and Siemens began in early 1994 and a Dollars 500m deal was announced in June. The irony is that St Jude's profitability has fallen sharply: at the company's January first quarter results following the acquisition, net profit margin after tax will have fallen to 17 per cent, according to Kurt Kruger, medical devices analyst at Hambrecht and Quist. But the shareholders are happy. The price earnings ratio is at 17, corresponding to a share price that has risen from Dollars 29 to Dollars 40. Looking back, Matricaria gives a telling, if subconscious, twist to the maxim about putting the customer first. 'We had to become more customer-oriented and find out what our shareholders really wanted from us,' he says.</p>

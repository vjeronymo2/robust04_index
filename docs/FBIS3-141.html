			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A source close to the FAM/FPLM [Mozambique Armed  Forces/Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique]  representation in the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] confided to  DOMINGO that "it does not make sense to try to dissociate the  preelectoral campaign in South Africa from the ongoing events in  Mozambique. Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] has been  instructed to dismantle its units in the neighboring country.  It is not too difficult to conclude that units of the political  and military organization in South Africa and Kenya could be  transferred from their training camps to Mozambique."    Last week, DOMINGO interviewed a senior government army  officer in an attempt to confirm reports that some 5,000 Renamo  men were being trained at a military base in Kenya. DOMINGO  also asked the FAM/FPLM member to comment on the Renamo  leadership's refusal to allow its withdrawal from the Salamanga  state farm to be monitored.    [Unidentified FAM/FPLM officer] I have substantial and  reliable information that confirms this: Renamo is training  people in Kenya. Yet, I would like to stress that even in South  Africa Renamo members in Phalaborwa and Sukuza could be crossing  the Mozambican border. You should note, for instance, that from  Salamanga to the border is about two hours on foot. That means  Renamo units in South Africa can be moved in the dead of the  night.    [DOMINGO] Do you confirm that?    [Officer] Like any other army, our intelligence services  have  confirmed it. Whoever wants to get the facts can do so. What  we do not wish to accept is that Renamo should transfer its  elements to Mozambique, regardless of their origin. After all,  that is a violation of the General Peace Accord.    [DOMINGO] Pardon me, but the government has the details. Why  has it not submitted them to the CCF, the body responsible for  ensuring the end of hostilities?    [Officer] Look, very recently, General Ngonhamo burned  himself with the story about Nampula, "Rex," and Nihia. It  seems to me that there is a power struggle within Renamo. I am  not concerned about that, but it could somehow influence the  course of negotiations. You should note that Ngonhamo's  appointment to the Joint Commission for the Formation of the  Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [CCFADM] was a violation. It  seems that the CCFADM is nonpartisan. So, I cannot see how Gen.  Ngonhamo could have been appointed to the Supreme Command of a  Mozambicann professional army. Moreover, this overlapping of  tasks has been deferred by the Supervision and Control  Commission!    [DOMINGO] What has that to do with Salamanga?    [Officer] It is very simple! But the answer is somewhat  delicate! You should be aware that Ngonhamo belongs to the  young generation of soldiers who fought FPLM. You should also  note that I do not resent Renamo in any way. Yet, I would like  to say that Renamo lacks cadres at all levels. Imagine what  would have happened if Renamo had taken over Salamanga: What  administrative apparatus would it have been able to put in place?    [DOMINGO] My question had to do with Salamanga alone, but  what area in dispute?...    [Officer] Well, I have tried to explain all this philosophy  -- the strategic and tactical aims behind the idea that  Salamanga is an area of chronic and cyclical dispute. From what  I have heard, Salamanga has nothing special in geophysical  terms. What it has is military and strategic importance. Ask  Renamo itself why it is so bent on staying in Salamanga. That  means that only Renamo can explain its behavior.    [DOMINGO] But, as an FAM officer, what objectives do you  think Renamo has in mind for Salamanga?    [Officer] I am no bureaucrat. I am a soldier and I deal with  military operations. I see life in professional terms or, in  other words, in terms of military strategy and tactics. I know  that Renamo must withdraw from Salamanga. What I do not know is  whether they will really settle in Chinhanguanine, an assembly  area that was approved last year. In view of that, and not  taking into account what I said earlier, I fail to see why they  cannot move from Salamanga to Chinhanguanine. It is worth  noting that those two areas are not even that far apart, so one  cannot even mention transportation problems by way of excuse!    [DOMINGO] Does that mean that there are confidential  reasons?    [Officer] I am not saying anything! I see things as they  are. Renamo is afraid of what will happen in South Africa in  the wake of the April elections, so it is trying to deactivate  its forces in that neighboring country. It is a normal  reaction. It does not know yet who is going to win, but a  post-apartheid leader, from the African National Congress/South  African Communist Party, for instance, will likely contest the  presence of Renamo guerrillas in South Africa.    [DOMINGO] How?    [Officer] Just like this: Renamo needs Salamanga to house  its  forces currently in Sukuza and Phalaborwa. It is said that  those training camps are now being used by Buthelezi's men in  the Inkatha Freedom Party's armed wing. It is also said that  the strongmen in Inkatha are Renamo people, or people who were  trained by Renamo at the same time and in the same camps. The  men involved in protection work, even in the Zulu "hostels"  [preceding word in English] are Mozambicans connected with the  Inkatha Freedom Party.    [DOMINGO] Are you not going a bit too far?    [Officer] I might have been, if we were not sure that  Salamanga is just a farm owned by the state. Just imagine that  the peace process grinds down to a halt here. What major  offensive capabilities can you expect from Renamo assembly areas  near the capital? What is more, Renamo rejected Salamanga as an  area where the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] teams might be able  to do dignified work. I can just imagine the headaches of  Colonel Segala, of the CCF! [sentence as published]    [DOMINGO] And what about the government's headaches?    [Officer] It is true that the government has its own  headaches, too. What I am going to say is an aside: We had to  salute the Renamo guys in the military leadership course! From  one day to the next, there was wholesale promotion of people to  army officers! To give the course, they even needed an  interpreter to translate the national languages into Portuguese!  It is really too much! Yet, because of military discipline, we  are forced to salute them left, right, and center!    [DOMINGO] So it should be on merit.    [Officer] That is how we would have liked it done. Look, now  there are some diplomats who say that Lieutenant General Lagos  does not have a conciliatory approach. Why? Is that not  interference? For a start, it was Lagos who prevented Renamo  dividing the country in the mid-1980's. Renamo's General  Ngonhamo was Southern Region commander for several years. He  worked with the late General Gomes. Naturally, you must know  about the story of Nalazi and Changanine. Today, what matters  is not what a certain officer did or was during the war.  Rather, what matters is what that officer can mean to the  national reconciliation effort.    [DOMINGO] Let us go back to the Salamanga issue: Why did we  not come across a representative of the government, or of the  government army?    [Officer] For a start, the Joint Administration Commission  is  in operation. There is only a short time to go before  elections, and I fail to see the need for a new dispute. By  that I mean that we -- on the government's side, obviously --  will be resettling there sooner or later.    [DOMINGO] What does Salamanga mean to you?    [Officer] It means nothing. It is a position, like any other  position. Like Dunda, in Manica Province, or Savane, in Sofala  Province, for example. It means absolutely nothing!</p>

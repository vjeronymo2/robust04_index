			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: JAPANESE ARE EMERGING AS IMPORTANT CONSUMERS OF U.S.-PRODUCED BEEF  </P> <P> The National Beef Cook-Off was held in Portland, Ore., this year. It was quite  an event.  </P> <P> The cook-off has changed a lot since the first time I attended back in 1978 in  Oklahoma City. That was only the fifth annual event and a small affair compared  to this year's 16th with more than 600 people in attendance.  </P> <P> There is something, however, about those early cook-offs that I miss. They  weren't quite so well organized, for sure. They didn't provide the media with a  dozen pages of National Beef Cook-Off facts and trivia the way the public  relations firm does these days, and we didn't get the prepared text of the  guest experts' speeches on such subjects as emerging food trends, latest  nutrition findings and the changing consumer -- impact of new and overlapping  consumer segments.  </P> <P> What we did get in the early days of the cook-off was a chance to meet and talk  with the real people who make up the beef industry: cattlemen and cattle women.  They kind of got lost in the crowd this year, what with all the public  relations people, the press, the experts and the Japanese. There were probably  more people in attendance this year from Japan than the total in attendance in  Oklahoma City in '78.  </P> <P> Japan is becoming an important customer for the American Beef Industry and the  U.S. Meat Export Federation. Why else would Chiemi Akahori, Japan's leading  cooking expert, be in attendance, doing a cooking demonstration as part of the  program?  </P> <P> Sukiyaki is traditionally cooked at the table, so first arrange meat and  vegetables attractively on a large platter or tray. The Japanese are very  particular about how food is presented since, according to them, "food is first  eaten with the eyes." Have small containers of sugar, soy sauce and beef stock  handy.  </P> <P> When eating rice from a bowl with chopsticks, it is proper to hold the rice  bowl under the chin. Use the large square ends of the chopsticks for retrieving  food from the pot and the smaller round ends for eating.  </P> <P> SUKIYAKI  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons peanut oil or some small pieces of beef suet  </P> <P> 1 pound well-marbled beef rib eye, sliced paper thin  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup soy sauce  </P> <P> 1/2 cup beef stock  </P> <P> 1 bunch green onions, cut on diagonal into 2-inch lengths  </P> <P> 1 cup celery, cut on diagonal into 2-inch slices  </P> <P> 1 cup sliced mushrooms  </P> <P> 1 (5-ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and sliced thin  </P> <P> 1 (5-ounce) can bamboo shoots, drained and slivered or diced  </P> <P> 2 bunches fresh spinach leaves, stems removed  </P> <P> 1 cup fresh bean sprouts  </P> <P> 12 to 16 ounces tofu, cubed  </P> <P> 2 to 4 ounces Shirataki (dry bean threads) soaked in hot water and drained  </P> <P> Hot cooked rice  </P> <P> Preheat 12-inch electric skillet. Add oil or suet. If using suet, rub over  bottom and sides of pan until 2 tablespoons fat has melted, then remove.  </P> <P> Add beef 1 slice at time until bottom of pan is covered. Cook, turning each  slice over and over, 1 or 2 minutes until just brown. Push first slices aside  to add any remaining.  </P> <P> Sprinkle meat with sugar. Pour over soy sauce and beef stock. Push meat to one  side. Let soy sauce mixture bubble.  </P> <P> Keeping in separate groups, add onions, celery and mushrooms, in that order,  one at time. Continue cooking and toss-stirring each group over high heat for  about 3 minutes, then push to one side.  </P> <P> Again keeping in separate groups, add chestnuts, bamboo shoots, spinach and  bean sprouts in order given. Then add tofu and bean threads. Cook and toss-stir  each food just until heated through.  </P> <P> Serve each guest piece of meat and little from each group of food on bowl of  hot rice. Or, more traditionally, serve each guest bowl of rice and let each  retrieve meat and vegetables from common pan. Makes 4 servings.  </P></p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Markets: Crunch time for rubber pact - Commodities Co-operation between producers and consumers on stabilising natural rubber prices has been under strain for some time as the two sides have clashed over what price range should be defended by the buffer stock manager of the International Rubber Organisation. A decision on the future of the international market pact operated by Inro must be taken at a meeting in Geneva on October 3-14, but members hope that by then the deadlock may have been broken. To that end representatives from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, the European Union and the US, among others, begin a three-day meeting tomorrow in Kuala Lumpur. The dispute centres on the International Natural Rubber Agreement's reference price, which guides market interventions by the buffer stock manager - last week he made an unspecified amount of sales because world prices, already in the 'may buy' range, were pushing up towards the 'must buy' level. Producers argue that the reference level should be raised to accommodate further market strength, while consumers insist that it should stay at or near the present level. Hopes for a successful outcome have been encouraged by the buffer stock manager's selling last week. 'A failure to do so could have a negative impact on the present discussions,' an EU official had warned before the sales were announced. Other points of interest this week include today's publication of the International Primary Aluminium Institute's May stocks figures, which traders hope will show a quickening decline, reflecting recent internationally-agreed output cuts. Today also sees the opening in Sydney of the two-day 'Mining Summit' of the Association of South-east Asian Nations. Tomorrow grain traders in particular will be watching for the publication of US Department of Agriculture crop production and world supply/demand reports.</p>

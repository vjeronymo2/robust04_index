			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Severe cuts at Westinghouse Westinghouse, the stricken US conglomerate, announced wide-ranging charges and lay-offs in an attempt to put behind it a disastrous foray into financial services during the 1980s. The company surprised the stock market with the severity of its measures, which include pre-tax charges totalling Dollars 750m (Pounds 504m), a planned cut of 6,000 in its workforce over the next two years and halving its dividend. It also announced plans to issue Dollars 500m of new capital in the first half to bolster its flagging balance sheet. The charges have pushed the company's capitalisation base down to Dollars 1bn compared to Dollars 2.2bn before. Yesterday's news was the first sign of the drastic surgery promised by Mr Michael Jordan, the former senior PepsiCo director who was brought in six months ago to revive the ailing group. Westinghouse, whose biggest businesses span power generation, broadcasting and defence, suffered losses put at more than Dollars 5bn after ploughing money into building junk bond and commercial property operations in the late-1980s. Contributing to the charges announced yesterday was Dollars 350m to cover restructuring costs and the lay-off of 3,400 staff. The world-wide headcount will come down to around 48,000 by attrition, Westinghouse said. Also, restructuring and writedowns of businesses which the company plans to sell will cost Dollars 215m, and it has put aside Dollars 185m to cover the settlement of legal disputes and environmental clean-up costs. Westinghouse also adopted a more conservative approach to accounting for pension liabilities, wiping a further Dollars 255m off its shrunken capital base. This has prompted the company to plan an issue of Dollars 500m of preference shares, which will be converted into ordinary shares at some time in the future. Referring to the headway Westinghouse has made in disposing of loans and other assets over the past year, Mr Jordan said: 'We are essentially out of the financial services business.' He added that the group's debt had fallen by Dollars 3.2bn during 1993, to an estimated Dollars 5.2bn at the end of the year. Mr Jordan's actions were cautiously welcomed by analysts, who said Mr Jones had yet to set out his plans for the future.</p>

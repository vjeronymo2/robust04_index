			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER SUES L.A. OVER MINI-MALL REPORT;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: IRA SMEDRA SAYS THAT THE CITY'S DEMAND FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW  OF HIS STUDIO CITY CARWASH PROPERTY IS ILLEGAL, UNWARRANTED AND UNJUST.  </P> <P> The developer of a proposed mini-mall that is slated to replace Studio City's  "cultural monument" carwash filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles on  Friday, claiming that the City Council illegally ordered him to draft a  detailed environmental impact report on his project.  </P> <P> Developer Ira Smedra said that the council's action was "unwarranted and  unjust," and that the shopping center met zoning standards. In addition to  delaying his project for between nine months and a year, the report would be  "extremely costly and serves no legitimate purpose," he said. The report would  cost him between $750,000 and $1 million, he said.  </P> <P> The council voted 10 to 3 Aug. 1 to require the report on the project at  Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards after Councilman Joel Wachs, who  represents the area, argued that the $15-million, 53,000-square-foot mall could  "dramatically change the character of the neighborhood by causing a serious  negative impact. . . ."  </P> <P> The suit, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, asks that the  council's order be withdrawn and that the city Department of Building and  Safety be required to issue all demolition and building permits for the  project. The suit also asked for unspecified damages.  </P> <P> Smedra, who had given the carwash and adjoining gasoline station until  Wednesday to vacate the property, also said Friday that he had granted the  businesses a 30-day extension as an expression of good will.  </P> <P> However, Pat Galati, who operates the carwash and gas station for Unocal, said  he still planned to shut down the car wash at the end of business today. He  said the gas station would close at the end of business Sunday.  </P> <P> "I don't know anything about this," Galati said. "It sounds like last-minute  baloney to me. I don't have the staff to keep this open. Who does he think is  going to operate this place?"  </P> <P> A group of Studio City residents staged a spirited campaign to save the  carwash, gas station and adjoining Tiny Naylor's coffee shop, which closed two  weeks ago.  </P> <P> They unsuccessfully lobbied the city to preserve the businesses as cultural  landmarks. They argued that the carwash, which they called the "Gateway to  Studio City," should be preserved for its architectural value because it is  topped by a 55-foot-tall tower, a 1950s-style decoration shaped like three  boomerangs.  </P></p>

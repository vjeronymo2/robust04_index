			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> DOUBT CAST ON ALZHEIMER'S DRUG  </P> <P> A drug once hailed as helping to restore the memory of Alzheimer's disease  patients has failed to improve symptoms of the debilitating disorder to a  significant extent, according to a new study released today.  </P> <P> The study by a group in Montreal assessed the effects of a drug called THA on  52 patients with the disease, which is characterized by progressive memory loss  and senility.  </P> <P> The study is published in the current issue of the New England Journal of  Medicine.  </P> <P> "The drug still could be used experimentally to explore how it works and how it  affects Alzheimer's, but I really can't see it as being marketable," said Dr.  Serge Gauthier, director of the McGill Center for Studies in Aging, who led the  study.  </P> <P> "It has not proven effective in large-scale studies and it is known to be  toxic," he said.  </P></p>

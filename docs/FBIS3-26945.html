The  session called on party organizations at various levels,  Communist Party members, and the people of various nationalities  across the region, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and led by the  party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, to  bestir themselves, work hard for the prosperity of the country,  advance in a pioneering spirit, and strive to accomplish the  strategic objectives set by the 14th party congress and the  Third Plenary Session of the party's 14th Central Committee and  to carry out the tasks of reform and development set by the  regional party committee for this year.    Abulaiti Amudurexiti, deputy secretary of the regional party  committee and acting chairman of the region, presided over  yesterday afternoon's meeting. Song Hanliang, secretary of the  regional party committee, made a concluding speech. [passage  omitted]    In his speech, Song Hanliang stressed: To further promote  Xinjiang's reform and development, the most crucial thing is to  emancipate our minds and seek truth from facts. In recent  years, Xinjiang's economy has developed rather fast. But  compared with other parts of the country, especially some  coastal and inland provinces and regions, our growth rate is far  behind theirs, and the gap between our region and those  provinces and regions continues to widen. Objectively speaking,  Xinjiang had a poor foundation to start with, and another  important reason is that it is far away from economic centers  and developed areas. However, the most crucial matter remaining  is that we have not sufficiently emancipated our minds. So the  biggest gap is a gap in conception [guan nian shang de cha ju  6034 1819 0006 4104 1567 6415]. First, some of our comrades  have yet to ideologically solve the question of whether a move  is "socialist" or "capitalist." It can be said that they still  have "doubts and misgivings in mind." When they are faced with  a matter, they still ask themselves first "which course to  take." Some other comrades have seemed to free themselves from  the trammels of whether a move is "socialist" or "capitalist,"  but they have a "lingering fear" -- glancing about, they are  afraid of "taking risks" and of "changes." They just cannot  stride forward. Second, our region has been deeply fettered and  influenced by the traditional structure of planned economy for a  long time, and some of our comrades are still ideologically  shackled by the old concept of planned economy. Third, the  traditional, self-sufficient oasis economy has given rise to an  ingrained sense of isolation, complacency, and conservatism  among people. As a result, they lack the idea of opening to the  outside world and the spirit of forging ahead. Fourth, as an  autonomous region inhabited by minority nationalities, Xinjiang  must consider its own characteristics in carrying out reform and  development, which is undoubtedly correct. This is also a matter  we must always pay close attention to. But "the theory of a  minority region being special" is incorrect. When touching on  reform, some comrades always stress the "special conditions" in  the region and warn against taking big strides. They want to do  things slowly and hope to receive more special consideration.  When touching on changing ideas, they stress objectivity and  history; they dare not to boldly break away from old or outworn  ideas. [passage omitted]    Song Hanliang emphasized: The party's basic line means "one  central task and two basic points." The key to implementing the  party's basic line in an all-round way lies in unswervingly  carrying out economic construction as the central task. Because  our region has been deeply fettered and influenced by the  traditional structure of planned economy for a long time, some  of our comrades are still ideologically shackled by the old  concept of planned economy. Although given a good opportunity to  carry out reforms and open to the outside world, some comrades  have failed to seize the opportunity and to boldly try things  out and develop themselves; they are still keen on seeking ways  to get help and let slip a golden opportunity. Putting fear  before everything else, some cadres are just used to being an  official in a tranquil environment and living a peaceful life.  They not only do not do but even dare not think about what is  not said in a book or official document or by a leader, or what  is not done by others. In a word, they are afraid of touching  on "capitalism." Still some other comrades always complain  about the macroenvironment and the macroclimate although they  have yet to clean out the silt (yu ji 3226 4480] in the depths  of their hearts. As a matter of fact, to boldly carry out  reforms and open to the outside world, it is very important for  us to untie, surpass, and liberate ourselves. For what we  regard as correct, we should not wait, delay, or depend on  others but resolutely do it. When we are not sure for the time  being whether we can succeed in doing something, we also should  not wait, delay, or depend on others but explore and try it  boldly. The basic criterion for judging whether a move is  "socialist" or "capitalist" is whether or not it is conducive to  developing the productive forces of socialist society,  increasing the overall strength of the socialist country, and  improving the people's living standards. Only by honestly  admitting that we are ideologically behind, only by further  emancipating our minds, and only by breaking ideological  shackles will we be able to strike forward in carrying out  reform and opening to the outside world. Only by so doing will  we be able to make rapid economic developments with high  efficiency.    To implement the "decision" [adopted by the plenary  session],  it is crucial to have a good mentality, to improve our work  style and efficiency, and to create a fast-paced, highly  efficient work environment for reform, opening-up, and economic  development. Conditions in Xinjiang are different from those in  developed coastal areas, and conditions vary from prefecture to  prefecture even in the autonomous region. So we should not  indiscriminately copy instructions from higher levels [bu neng  zhao ban zhao chao shang ji zhi shi 0008 5174 3564 2239 3564  2113 0006 4787 2172 4355] and experiences from other areas. We  must grasp what the instructions from higher levels really mean  as well as the conditions at lower levels, and do our work  creatively according to actual conditions. We should not stress  conditions only, nor should we disregard such conditions. We  should suit measures to local conditions and give specific  guidance. Doing away with the practice of idle talk, we should  concentrate our energies on our work; we should make more time  for study and engage in as little socializing as possible. We  should do more research and investigation and refrain from  subjectivism; we should do more practical work and less empty  talk. The masses have a potentially inexhaustible enthusiasm for  socialism and potentially inexhaustible creativity, which are  waiting for us to guide and develop. Leaders at various levels  should go deep into the realities of life and immerse themselves  among the masses to acquaint themselves with new conditions and  problems arising in reform and construction; they should sum up  and popularize new creations and experiences made by the masses;  and they should unite and lead the masses of various  nationalities in carrying out reforms, building enterprises  through arduous effort, and implementing the guidelines and the  "decision" adopted by the sixth (enlarged) plenary session of  the fourth regional party committee.</p>

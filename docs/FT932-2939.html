			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan shaken by more Ferruzzi shock waves SENIOR markets were weaker yesterday as Wall Street opened easier, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN continued to be affected by shock waves from Ferruzzi group companies, while the end of the June account today also exerted a negative influence as the Comit index lost 14.07 to 513.37. An additional burden was placed on the Ferruzzi group following Monday's post-bourse announcement of a L1,058bn, two-for-one rights issue from Fondiaria, the country's third largest private-sector insurer. Fondiaria is controlled jointly through the Gaic holding company by Ferruzzi and the family of Mr Camillo De Benedetti, who died earlier this year. It closed L2,742, or 10 per cent lower at L24,101 while Gaic was suspended to the end of the session after it, too, fell by some 10 per cent. Some analysts noted that since neither Gaic, nor the debt-laden Ferruzzi are in a position to subscribe, the underwriting banks - Mediobanca, BCI, Banca de Roma, Credito Italiano and San Paolo - would be left with effective control of the insurer. Ferruzzi closed yesterday down L68.80 at L593.50 while Montedison, which is reported to be about to dispose of its Himont and Ausimont subsidiaries, settled at L779, down L196. FRANKFURT eased back, wary of the Bundesbank meeting tomorrow and the 'triple-witching' closure of DTB options contracts on Friday. The DAX index fell 7.88 to 1,684.10 in turnover reported to be lower than Monday's DM5.9bn. The DTB effect was suspected in the performance of Commerzbank, which rose by DM4 to DM303.50 against the market and against the sector - Deutsche Bank fell DM4 to DM695.50 - and traded in 400,000 shares, four times its usual volume on Ibis, the German screen-based dealing system. In retailing, Karstadt and Kaufhof underperformed the market. Mr Roland Wren, a dealer with James Capel in Frankfurt, said that both had climbed recently on surprisingly good results, but that this was now old news and investors were coming back to the study of cyclicals in the hope that German recovery prospects will be a talking point after the summer. PARIS eased back in technical trading and light turnover as the CAC-40 index finished down 18.98 at 1,897.86. Turnover was some FFr1.9bn. The oil sector was weak, in line with falling crude prices, with Elf down FFr5.80 to FFr377.80 and Total losing FFr2.20 to FFr263.00. Michelin slipped FFr3.50 to FFr144.00 on profit-taking after a recent strong performance, while Peugeot was off FFr17 to FFr510 as investors began to anticipate bad news at next week's annual meeting. MADRID advanced, mostly late in the day, to its fourth consecutive gain following its losses on the Socialist election victory. The general index closed 1.40 higher at 259.89 in turnover of Pta16.5bn. Mr Peter McGahan of Schroder Securities said that a major Spanish bank executed some fairly large UK orders for banks, and Repsol. BBV rose Pta50 to Pta3,115 and Repsol Pta65 to Pta3,290. ZURICH extended its period of profit-taking, the SMI index falling another 20.2 to 2,274.0. Nestle lost SFr9 to SFr1,092, SBC SFr7 to SFr383 in a weak banking sector and, elsewhere in financials, Swiss Re dropped SFr100 to SFr3,050. AMSTERDAM rose modestly, helped by DSM's Fl 2.00 gain to Fl 88.20 on recent positive comment for cyclical stocks. However, Hoogovens, which has a done well over the last few days, lost Fl 1.30 to Fl 32.40 as some investors decided that it was time to take profits. The CBS Tendency index advanced 0.3 to 108.7. Another strong performer was Fokker, up Fl 1.10 to Fl 15.90, after announcing orders for new aircraft. STOCKHOLM rose on US buying with the financial sector gaining 4.8 per cent and the Affarsvarlden general index 5.50 to 1,075.70. TEL AVIV reversed a sharp two-day decline after the Israeli prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, quashed rumours that the government would soon impose a capital gains tax. The Mishtanim blue chip shares index jumped 5.77, or 2.9 per cent to 202.43 in turnover of Shk195m. ISTANBUL failed to break through the 10,000 level as the index closed 43.69 higher at 9,804.36 with investors continuing to react positively to the appointment of Mrs Tansu Ciller as prime minister.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- June 15                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1175.56    1174.74    1174.13    1173.21 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1232.30    1231.46    1230.69    1229.57  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly channges             13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1173.97    1173.59    1173.69    1173.17 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1229.93    1229.86    1230.27    1229.86  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jun 14    Jun 11   June 10    June 9    June 8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1181.59   1181.85   1181.45   1181.59   1168.70 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1234.83   1232.37   1230.25   1230.01   1218.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1175.76; 200 - 1232.81 Low/day: 100 - 1171.80 200 - 1228.24.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (17): No guarantee of success - Business process re-engineering Everybody is doing it. . . well, almost everybody. In the two years since Mr Michael Hammer popularised the notion of business process re-engineering in the Harvard Business Review, it has been embraced by many of the world's largest organisations, writes Alan Cane. Separate studies carried out earlier this year by the Cranfield School of Management and Price Waterhouse suggest that up to 70 per cent of large companies in the UK have undertaken or are about to undertake BPR. It would be a surprisingly high figure for any management technique, even one currently as fashionable. But BPR can be risky, involves comprehensive planning and carries no guarantee of success. On the other hand, the economic climate of the past few years has favoured measures which promote efficiency, effectiveness and cost-cutting. Most of the companies questioned by Cranfield said they were primarily interested in potential savings. BPR, as defined by Mr Hammer, involves a fundamental reassessment of the way a company does its business, identifying and simplifying the basic processes to achieve maximum operational efficiencies. BPR cuts across traditional functions; layers of management are frequently found to be redundant during the analysis. This reassessment is driven by the needs of the business, not information technology. But once the basic processes have been defined, IT can be used to find greater efficiencies through automation. It is not an entirely new concept. Mr Geoff Elliott and Mr Robin Holland, senior consultants at Computer Management Group, note: 'BPR is clearly an attention-grabbing headline but we believe, at the fundamental level, that there is no difference between BPR, total quality management, change management and organisational development. The real difference is the extent and speed of the change that firms are being forced to address by the markets'. Elliott and Holland's conclusion has the benefit of rendering redundant sematic arguments about BPR. The technique itself has a reputation for a high failure rate, prompting one executive to sniff: 'For my taste, BPR is too dramatic a technique'. This attitude is attacked by Mr Hammer and his colleague Steven Stanton in a recent paper: 'Re-engineering failure is not caused by bad luck, cosmic rays or other factors beyond a company's control. On the contrary, success or failure at re-engineering is determined by a company's understanding of re-engineering, its ability at executing it and the commitment of its executives to do it.' Hammer and Stanton suggest there are two reasons companies fail at re-engineering. First, because they do not know what they are doing and therefore commit classic errors such as wasting time on the analysis of existing processes. ('Virtually, everything learned in such an exercise is destined for the rubbish heap,' they warn.) Second, there is inadequate commitment and leadership from the top. 'No one need fail at re-engineering' they write. 'Indeed, we are hard pressed to cite a re-engineering failure among organisations who have gone about it in a sound fashion.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Meijuan (3769 5019 1227), affiliated with </F> the School of Law at Shanghai University: "Revision and  Improvement of China's Trademark Law"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]    As China's reform and opening intensified steadily, with  market economy policies taking effect, the substance provided by  our trademark law that had been in force for a decade was no  longer fully suited to the needs of China's market economy  development and international dealings and cooperation. So it  was imperative that our current trademark law be revised. The  NPC Standing Committee approved in February 1993 the "Resolution  on Revising the PRC Trademark Law" and the "Additional  Regulations on Punishing the Criminal Counterfeiting of  Registered Trademarks." Their practicality and necessity are  seen mainly as follows:  <H5>  1. They Expand the Scope of Trademark Protection </H5>   Article Four of our Trademark Law drawn up in 1982 provided  that: "For enterprises, institutions, and individual  industrial and commercial operators, as to their produced,  manufactured, processed, selected, or sold commodities, they  must obtain exclusive trademark rights, and should apply for  registration to the Trademark Bureau." It is thus obvious that  this protected only commodity trademarks, not service  trademarks. This was because China's commodity economy was  still undeveloped at the time, with service trades, or tertiary  industries, such as banking, insurance, transportation, post and  telecommunications, commerce, commodity supply and marketing,  real estate, tourism, restaurants, hotels, and other consumer  service trades, not yet having broken free from the  planned-economy mold, and being in a backward state, leaving  service trademark protection still not on the agenda. But after  a dozen years or so of reform and opening, China's commodity  eonomy had made great progress, with tertiary industries playing  an increasingly important role in our national economy and  people's lives, and receiving ever more attention. WEN HUI BAO  reported on 18 February 1993 that the proportion of China's GNP  accounted for by tertiary industries is up from 1992's 31.8  percent to 33.1 percent. And Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju stated in  a government work report in February 1993 that by the year 2000,  the proportion of our GNP made up by tertiary industries will be  over 45 percent. With the prosperity of tertiary industries,  as improper competitive behavior in service trades had appeared,  it was necessary to make clear provisions in law for service  trademark registration and protection. So-called service  trademarks refer to the marks used by service enterprises, to  distinguish the services provided by various enterprises.  Service trademarks are one of the targets of industrial  property rights protection. Article 1 Section 2 of the "Paris  Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property" provides  that: "Industrial property protection targets are patents,  functional new models, industrial exterior designs, trademarks,  service trademarks, business establishments, product origin  marks, or country of origin names, to curb improper  competition." And Article 6 Section 6 also provides that, "all  member nations of this union should protect service trademarks,  ...." It is reported that nearly 90 countries (regions) in the  world today legally protect registered service trademarks.  The U.S. began to take service trademark registration  applications in 1949, and Japan began to in 1992. As a member  nation of the Paris Convention, China is committed to abide by  the Paris Convention provisions, by protecting exclusive  service-trademark rights. Meanwhile, as international trade  developed, the number of applications in China for service  trademarks by all member nations of the Madrid Agreement had  grown yearly. But as China had not provided in law for  protection of service trademarks, we were unable to process  these applications. So when we revised our trademark law in  1993, we added Sections 2 and 3 to Article 4 of the Trademark  Law, providing that "for enterprises, institutions, and  individual industrial and commercial operators, as to the  services they provide, they must obtain exclusive trademark  rights, and should apply to the Trade Mark Bureau for service  trademark registration." These sections also provide that "the  provisions in this law on commodity trademarks are applicable to  service trademarks," bringing service trademarks into the scope  of protection.  <H5>  2. They Provide That Place Names of Administrative Regions </H5> Above the County Level May Not Be Used as Trademarks    Our 1982 Trademark Law did not make prohibitive provisions  on  whether place names of administrative divisions could be used as  trademarks. But practice proved that the major flaw in using  place names as trademarks was their lack of prominence, not  helping consumers to distinguish them from other similar  commodities. Meanwhile, this did not conform to international  practice. So Article 8 of our revised Trademark Law includes  an additional section, that: "While place names of  administrative divisions above the county level or publicly  recognized foreign place names may not be used as trademarks,  place names do have other implication exceptions; already  registered and in-use place-name trademarks will remain valid."  It can be seen from the provisions of this section that while  place names of administrative divisions may not be made  registered trademarks in principle, some place names have other  implication exceptions. This clearly indicates that a much-used  place name can be made a registered trademark. For instance, the  "Changshou" in the well-known Changshou County refers generally  to long life; and the "Fenghuang" in Fenghuang County is a kind  of bird [phoenix], symbolizing good luck, riches, and honor,  which are examples of much-used words. Our legislators also  considered the reputation in both China and abroad of place  names used in the past as registrerd trademarks for certain  commodities, such as Guizhou Maotai [liquor], Qingdao Beer, and  Jinhua Ham, so to stabilize protection of already registered  trademarks, provided that "already registered and in-use  place-name trademarks will remain valid." This provision  reflects the high degree of unity of principle and practicality  in the spirit of Chinese legislation.  <H5>  3. They Improve Trademark Registration and Revocation </H5> Procedures    Trademark registration refers to trademark users, in order  to  obtain exclusive trademark rights, applying according to legal  procedures to trademark registration organs for trademark  examination and approval, to be granted the statutory fact of  exclusive trademark rights. China's registration principle is  that only registered trademarks have legal protection, but  unregistered ones do not. Article 12 of our 1982 Trademark Law  provided that: "When the same applicants use the same  trademark for commodities in different categories, they should  submit [separate] registration applications based on commodity  classification form." This shows that China's trademark  registration application followed the principle of "one form,  one category," in which application for the same trademark was  limited to one category of commodity and, when the same  applicants used the same trademark for different categories of  commodities, they should submit separate applications based on  commodity classification form. But practice proved that for  enterprises that produced many classifications of products, this  registration application procedure was tedious and more  expensive. The trademark registration applications of the  "Madrid Agreement for International Registration of Trade Marks"  and developed Western countries all used the principle of "one  form, multiple categories," or that the same applicants could in  one application apply for the same trademark for different  categories of commodities. This principle streamlined the  procedure, helping to protect the trademark ownership of  production plants, while promoting the development of  diversified products by a single factory. So we drew on this  more scientific application procedure, deleting the word  "separate" from Article 12, showing that China's trademark  registration applications are more internationalized.    Article 27 of our revised Trademark Law adds a section, that  "already registered trademarks, which violate the provisions of  Article 8 of this law, or obtained registration by fraudulent or  other improper means, will be revoked by the Trade Mark Bureau,  and that other units or individuals can ask the Trademark  Examination Commission to rule on revocation of so registered  trademarks." The addition of this section on the revocation of  registered trademarks was very timely and necessary. The grounds  for this revision were: 1. Part 1 of Section 2 of Article 6 of  the "Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property"  provides that, for notorious trademark duplication, copying, or  dubbing, Convention member countries can, based on their own  laws or at the request of concerned litigants, refuse or revoke  registration credentials, and prohibit their use. And Part 3 of  Section 2 of Article 6 provides that, for trademarks registered  or used through dishonest means, requests for cancellation of  registration or prohibition of use may not be subject to time  limitations. 2. As to China's judicial practice, the phenomenon  of obtaining registration through fraudulent or other improper  means is common, with falsified documents and hiding of the  facts being employed for trademark registration; the public is  well familiar with trademark registration through means, such as  duplication, copying, or dubbing.    This article provides that registered trademarks already  obtained through fraudulent or other improper means should be  revoked. This so-called revocation [cancellation] is one of the  reasons for registered trademark termination. We need to  clarify here that cancellation differs from nullification.  Nullification means that the registered trademark owner  voluntarily renounces the use of the registered trademark and  asks for it to be cancelled, or uses its expiration to not  request continued use of the registered trademark so that it is  cancelled; cancellation means that the applicant has violated  the pertinent provisions of the "Trademark Law," and been  subjected to disciplinary sanction, being the use of coercive  means to terminate the trademark rights.    From these set cancellation grounds, as to actions to obtain  registration through fraudulent or other improper means, in line  with the provisions of Article 58 Section 3 of the "General  Rules of Civil Law," actions committed "by fraudulent means" by  one party, "which violate legal or public interests," are  invalid [null and void] civil actions. As invalid civil  actions have no legally binding force from the time the behavior  begins, cancellation of trademark rights means that exclusive  trademark rights are terminated beginning not on the day they  are cancelled, but rather are null and void from the day the  behavior begins, giving them back-dating force. As to invalid  civil behavior, anyone can request validity certification. So  this section of our revised Trademark Law provides that in  addition to the Trade Mark Bureau having cancellation authority,  other units and individuals can request cancellation so that,  with a ruling by the Trademark Examination Commission, the  registered trademark will be cancelled. This provision is fully  in accord with Civil Law provisions on invalid civil behavior.  <H5>  4. They Increase the Penalties for the Criminal </H5> Counterfeiting of Registered Trademarks    In recent years, all sorts of illegal criminal acts, such as  imitating others' registered trademarks, counterfeiting others'  registered-trademark symbols, and selling commodities clearly  known to have fake registered trademarks, had become rampant,  continuing despite repeated crackdowns, to directly infringe  upon registered exclusive trademark rights, bring severe chaos  to socio-economic order, and infringe on the legitimate rights  and interests of the masses of consumers. The increase in fake  commodities was a negative effect of the replacement of the old  economic system with the new, which negative effect had not been  curbed for many reasons. While certain criminal elements  manufactured fake and shoddy commodities, counterfeited others'  trademarks, and used the means of bribes to promote sales to  earn exorbitant profits, the industrial and commercial  administrative management sector imposed mostly fines in such  criminal cases, which objectively fostered criminal arrogance.  In addition, Article 127 of the PRC "Criminal Law" set too light  penalties for counterfeit trademark crimes, providing only for  imprisonment for up to three years, detention for [community]  service, or fines. For those who obtained huge amounts of  illegal income, such penalties were obviously too light to have  a deterrent impact. In light of this, the Seventh NPC Standing  Committee passed on 22 February 1993 the "NPC Standing Committee  Additional Regulations on Punishing the Criminal Counterfeiting  of Registered Trademarks" (abbreviated hereafter as "Additional  Regulations"). These Additional Regulations provide important  revisions and additions to the pertinent parts of our "Criminal  Law," which in detail are as follows:    1. They increase the statutory penalties for such crime.  All who illegally use trademarks the same as other registered  trademarks for similar commodities, where the illegal income is  large or in other serious cases, or who sell commodities well  known to bear counterfeit registered trademarks, where the  illegal income is large, can be sentenced to up to three years  of imprisonment, with those where the illegal income is enormous  being sentenced to 3-7 years imprisonment, as well as fined.  And those who counterfeit or manufacture without authorization  others' registered-trademark symbols, or sell  registered-trademark symbols that are counterfeited or  manufactured without authorization, where illegal income is  large or in other serious cases, can also be punished according  to the abovementioned statutory penalties.    2. Article 127 of the PRC "Criminal Law" provided for  "imprisonment for up to 3 years, detention for service, or  fines." This provided for choosing just one penalty, being  commonly called "punishment without fines, or fines without  punishment." As it used the word "or" rather than "and," the  "Additional Regulations" provide for fines also for criminals  sentenced to up to 3 years imprisonment or detention for  service, as well as for those sentenced to 3-7 years. This will  economically curb this type of crime, keeping such criminals  from benefiting economically.    3. Article 127 of the PRC "Criminal Law" also made  provisions  concerning "violations of trademark management laws and  regulations, in which industrial and commercial enterprises  counterfeit other enterprises' already registered  trademarks...." It is not hard to see that this section provided  only for cases in which industrial and commercial enterprises  counterfeited trademarks, not ones in which individuals did so.  As this was obviously out of line with China's current  conditions, the "Additional Regulations" delete the words  "industrial and commercial enterprises."    4. The "Additional Regulations" provide that "where  enterprises and institutions commit the above two crimes, their  units will be fined and, as to their responsible personnel [1]  and others [2] who are directly liable, criminal liability will  be investigated and affixed according to the above two  regulations." While China's criminal law used to provide for a  single penalty system, legal persons [corporations] can now be  regarded as criminal subjects, which can be sentenced to fines,  with the two abovementioned liable subjects being sentenced to  deprivation of their freedom.    5. The "Additional Regulations" provide that "for state  workers who exploit their posts to deliberately shield or  prevent the prosecution of enterprises, institutions, or  individuals that they well know have criminally violated these  regulations, their criminal liabilitty will be investigated and  affixed according to the provisions of Article 188 of the  Criminal Law." In other words, state workers who commit the  above crimes will be punished according to Article 188 of the  Criminal Law on illegal embezzlement by company employees.  [passage omitted]</p>

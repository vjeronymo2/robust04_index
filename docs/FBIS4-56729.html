			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by James Aparicio] </F>   [Text] Panamanian President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares  has revealed that the Ministries of the Presidency, Education,  Agricultural Development, Health, and Foreign Relations, as well  as the posts of comptroller general and attorney general, will  be offered to political figures who do not belong to the  Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD).    In an exclusive statement to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA Perez  Balladares said that PRD members might occupy the Ministries of  Housing, Public Works, Labor, Commerce and Industry, Planning,  and Government and Justice.    Current Electoral Tribunal Magistrates Eduardo Valdes,  Dennis  Allen, and Guillermo Marquez will remain in their posts, since  they are considered responsible for the holding of the most  important elections ever in Panama's political history.    Sources told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that Jose de los Santos  Chen Barria, a member of the opposition Christian Democratic  Party, might be ratified as comptroller general, and Oswaldo  Fernandez might be retained as director of the National Police  if he is not ratified as a Supreme Court justice.    Perez Balladares refused to confirm this possibility,  however. An investigation by LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA revealed that  the Foreign Ministry might be offered to industrialist Gabriel  Lewis Galindo; the Education Ministry to Stanley Muschett,  president of the Justice and Peace Commission; the Agricultural  Development Ministry to Carlos Souza Lennox, former president of  ANAGAN [National Cattlemen's Association]; the Presidency  Ministry to Raul Arango Gasteazoro; the Health Ministry to  Carlos Garcia de Paredes; and the Commerce and Industry Ministry  to Felix Gonzalez, a PRD leader in Chiriqui Province. [as  published]    PRD Under Secretary General Mitchel Doens might be appointed  government and justice minister, and Christian Democratic  legislator Jose Antonio Sossa might be appointed attorney  general.    Two women will be appointed to cabinet posts in the Labor  and  Planning Ministries, but Perez Balladares did not reveal their  names.</p>

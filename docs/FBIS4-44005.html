			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Will Scharping Push the Curve Up?"] </F>   [Text] There months before the Bundestag elections, Rudolf  Scharping's popularity has sunk dramatically. A survey  performed by the Forsa Institute last week on a representative  sample of 2,523 German citizens in the East and West revealed  that only 26 percent of the population would vote for Scharping  to be chancellor. On the other hand, 42 percent said they would  vote for Helmut Kohl.    Thus, Scharping's popularity has taken a 180-degree turn  since his election to the chairmanship of the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] almost 12 months ago. Kohl lies ahead of  his challenger in the popularity table both in the East and in  the West, among the young and the old, and among all  professional groups, including workers. Eighty-seven percent of  Christian-Democratic Union [CDU] supporters would vote for Kohl,  and 55 percent of SPD supporters would vote for Scharping.  Thirty-one percent of the population, 8 percent more than last  week, thinks that the CDU is the most capable of solving the  country's problems. Only 11 percent think the SPD is the most  capable of doing so, 3 percent less than last week. If the  current voting forecasts survive until October, there need be no  fear of a grand coalition: The CDU and Free Democratic Party  could then continue to govern.    Within the SPD there is increasing doubt whether a turnabout  can be achieved. The dispute over a red-green coalition is  dividing the party. The appointment of a shadow cabinet  centered on Scharping is expected to provide fresh vigor.  However, the party leadership is beset with despondency and  mistrust, brought on by a provoking interview with Scharping's  rival, Gerhard Schroeder.    In an interview for DIE WOCHE, Hesse's environment minister  Joschka Fischer, the leading man of the Greens, tries to rouse  the SPD to battle against Kohl. He criticizes Schroeder thus:  "I consider the things the quasicandidate is doing with the  candidate distasteful."</p>

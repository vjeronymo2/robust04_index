			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The information and study workshop on the  prospects of the Algerian economy, organized by the presidency  and the government and attended by government members and main  social and economic operators, has been crowned by a  recommendation underlining the need for a comprehensive and  coherent program of institutional restructuring and reforms in  order to free the initiatives of the economic operators and to  reintroduce the market economy mechanism. [passage omitted]    The days proceedings of the information and study workshop  was also characterized by the intervention of Mr. Mokdad Sifi,  the head of government, with an address during the opening  meeting in which he touched, in particular, on the consequences  of the agreement our country had recently concluded with the  IMF, which aims to insure the highest possible level of  stability in the national economy and create the objective  conditions to resume a continuous growth that will insure the  alleviation and gradual elimination of all forms of imbalances  and serious pressures at times that burden our society at the  present.    The head of government pointed out in his intervention that  resorting to rescheduling the debts of our country has come at a  time when Algeria has become unable to face the maturity dates  of its debts on the one hand, and to respond to the basic needs  of its citizens and economy, on the other. This reflects the  inevitable nature of the debt rescheduling effort. Here the  head of government said:    [Begin Safi recording] This effort was impossible to avoid,  especially when Algeria had to import the high-cost staple  foodstuffs, which cannot be reduced, with hard currency that  constitute a heavy burden on the foreign currency accounts of  the country.    I would like to point out in this instance, so that we  comprehend the dimensions of the country's financial  difficulties, that we are obliged to face up to annual  expenditures estimated at least to be three billion dollars in  respect of the widely-consumed stuff only. And if we talk about  the details, in respect of cereals, including hard wheat, soft  wheat, and semolina and flour, Algeria consumes more than 3  million tonnes annually, namely to the value of 780 million  dollars. Thus, Algeria alone consumes about 40 percent of the  world exports.    Regarding milk, Algeria consumes 400,000 tonnes worth 560  million dollars. Algeria consumes 400,000 tonnes of oils worth  200 million dollars. Algeria also consumes 950,000 tonnes of  sugar worth 320 million dollars, and 120,000 tonnes of coffee  worth 160 million dollars. Regarding medicines, it consumes a  quantity worth 500 million dollars. Of the total value of only  these commodities I have mentioned, Algeria is committed to  spend an amount estimated at 2.5 billion dollars annually. In  addition to that, the costs of imports of this type of commodity  in the current circumstances is very high. [end recording]</p>

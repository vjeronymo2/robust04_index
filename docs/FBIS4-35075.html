			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Mejia and Carlos Sanabria in Santiago de </F> Cuba for the "Exclusive" program -- live]    [Text] [Mejia] The second Caribbean Businessmen's Meeting  opened today with the participation of over 100 businessmen from  13 countries in the area. Carlos Sanabria Marrero, our newsman  in eastern Cuba, has details on this. Carlitos, we are  contacting you again for an exclusive scoop.    [Sanabria] Yes, Mejia. I am at the Santiago Hotel. Caribbean  businessmen who participated in the second meeting have just  heard interesting statements by Cuban experts concerning Cuba's  trade policy in the Caribbean and their experiences, as well as  the reality and outlook in the tourism sector, and the  possibilities and alternatives for air and maritime  transportation. Comrade Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the ANPP  [National Assembly of the People's Government] economic  commission, and director of the World Economy Research Center,  is here with me in front of Radio Rebelde's microphones. We will  hear his opinion about developments at the second businessmen's  meeting.    [Martinez] I believe that, without resorting to rhetoric, I  can assert that this event is undoubtedly a success. The event  is being held practically on the eve of the Association of  Caribbean States' [ACS] creation, which marks a new and higher  event in the area's integration efforts.    [Sanabria] According to some businessmen -- even according  to  what former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley said in his  speech at the event's opening -- it is predicted that the  association will be created with Cuba's participation.    [Martinez] Yes, that is true. In other words, I think that  one of the things we have to value about the creation of ACS and  the efforts toward Caribbean integration is that it is occuring  based on the Caribbean governments' statements that no Caribbean  integration is possible without Cuba. This is really important.    [Sanabria] Osvaldo, there is an equally important matter:  This event will be followed by the inauguration of the third  Caribbean fair -- Expocaribe 94.    [Martinez] Yes, that is extremely important. The fair is  practically a continuation of the businessmen's meeting.  Bilateral meetings and negotiations should begin tomorrow  between businessmen and Cuban enterprises and agencies. The fair  will also begin.    [Sanabria] This means that many of the things discussed here  concerning the possibility of trade with the eastern provinces  will be determined by the businessmen at the fair.    [Martinez] Yes, I believe it is the complement. We are in  the  theoretical phase right now, which is obviously necessary. The  fair will be the practical side of many of the things discussed  here.</p>

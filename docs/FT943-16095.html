			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pressure on paper prices Sir, I note, with interest, that according to the British Printing Industries Federation (Letters July 1) 'today's price for printing ranges from 1990 levels to 5 per cent below that', and that 'at the depth of the recession it was 6-10 per cent below the peak touched in mid-1990'. We appreciate the dilemma faced by printers in passing on costs and, if the pulp and paper manufacturers had been able to hold price reductions during the recession to 6-10 per cent, I can confidently say printers would not be facing the scale of paper price recovery they are today. However, the fact is that manufacturers' prices for most bulk grades of printing and writing papers fell by between 30 and 40 per cent between 1989 and 1993 (during which period inflation rose by 22 per cent). This has led to massive losses by pulp and many paper manufacturers - for some, the largest they have ever incurred. In facing the fact that it is essential for pulp and paper prices to recover and the industry to return to profitability, we should not lose sight of the long-term trend - over the past 20 years, a substantial fall in prices in real terms as the industry continues to invest in technology and techniques in a highly competitive market.

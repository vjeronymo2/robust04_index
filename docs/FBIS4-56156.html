			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Janice Menezes: "Government-Owned Firms Valued </F> at $47 Billion"]    [Text] The Federal Government's share of the net worth of  government-owned firms totals $29.6 billion, of which $27.4  billion represents its holdings in such firms as Petrobras, the  Rio Doce Valley Company [CVRD], Telebras, Eletrobras, and the  Federal Railroad Network. But with the expectation of  privatization, the "blue chips" alone -- mainly Eletrobras --  are valued at $47.1 billion on the stock exchange.    This means that if the government decided to sell off those  firms quickly, it would collect enough money to pay off a good  share of the public debt. But Marina Figueira, professor in the  Department of Economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of  Rio de Janeiro and author of a detailed study of Brazilian  government-owned firms, says that immediate privatization like  that which has occurred in other Latin American countries would  not work in Brazil because the structure of federally owned  firms is much more complex that that of their neighbors.    "Chiefly since 1964, the Brazilian state has grown beyond  the  public sector. The main economic groups in the government  productive sector are controlled by mixed-economy companies  whose owners include partners in the private sector and whose  shares are traded on the exchange," she says.    Blue chips: An example of that limitation on the state's  ability to divest is precisely the value of its firms in the  stock market. The fact is that of the total stock market value  of shares in those blue chip companies (Rio Doce Valley,  Eletrobras, Telebras, and Petrobras) -- $47.1 billion -- the  government's share comes to $25.6 billion. So in order to get  rid of its shares, the government will have to engage in some  intense negotiations with minority stockholders.    Because of that, according to the study by Marina Figueira,  and unlike what happened in other Latin American countries,  privatization attempts in Brazil are being preceded by  innumerable fights over ownership rights.    The government-owned firms have become so independent of the  state that when subsidiaries have been privatized -- Petrobras's  subsidiaries, for example -- the proceeds of the sale have gone  directly to the holding company, not the National Treasury.    Funds: "If privatization is aimed at raising money for the  Treasury, we must sell our stock in the big parent companies  such as Petrobras, Eletrobras, the CVRD, and Telebras," she  says. But she explains that doing so would also mean selling  ownership in each of those firms to a single parent company. And  in her opinion, that could not be done because it would make the  economy's pattern of efficiency worse. As an example, she points  to the sale of the Chilean electric companies. Their sale  followed that pattern, and the result for the government has  been serious and undesirable problems with regulation.    In view of all those special features, the Brazilian  privatization program must, according to Marina Figueira's  study, be seen not as a way of raising cash but of unburdening  the state and increasing efficiency and competitiveness. The  result, says the professor, is that every step in the direction  of privatization must be carefully executed. "If it is concerned  about its level of revenues, the government could sell the firms  quickly. In that case, the cost of raising cash quickly would  fall upon the private sector," she says, pointing out that a  different approach should be adopted in selling off each group  to be privatized.    SEST: Marina Figueira de Mello warns that her figures  regarding the net worth of government-owned firms were not based  on more recent data than those in the 1988 register of balance  sheets because that was the most recent survey published by the  Special Secretariat for State Enterprises (SEST).    The register lists 258 firms whose majority stockholder is  the Union: 179 in the productive sector, 20 typical government  enterprises (Brazilian Agriculture and Livestock Research  Enterprise, for example), 28 service licensees providing  electricity, 25 financial firms, and six social security and  welfare services.    "Over the past five years, the performance of the  government-owned firms included in the program has improved,  with favorable effects on their operating results, a factor that  has probably caused their net worth to increase even further,"  the professor comments.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1800 GMT on 31 January carries in  its regular 30-minute newscast several reports on the fighting  in the republic.    The studio announcer says that "on this, the 14th day of the  [Serbian] enemy offensive against the free Doboj, Teslic, and  Tesanj territories, the fighters of the 7th South Operative  Group destroyed two more of the aggressor's tanks, an M-84 and a  T-55, which brings the number to nine in this latest aggressor  offensive, and to 72 enemy tanks destroyed since the start of  the aggression against our country."    Reporting from an unspecified location in northern Bosnia,  Hajrudin Redzovic says that "our antiaircraft defense has also  been brilliant today. In the region of (Bojakovici) an  aggressor's helicopter was hit and, badly damaged, forced to  land in the village of Vitkovci." He says that "it was real  hell in the region of Filipovici today, where the enemy launched  a series of tank-infantry attacks, also using howitzers,  self-propelled guns, and cannons of all calibers. Our positions  on (Taratova Kosa) were also exposed to heavy tank fire. All  these attacks were repelled." The report says that "the heroism  of the fighters of the Tesanj 207nd Glorious Brigade was also  extraordinary today. They inflicted heavy losses on the  aggressor's manpower."    The studio announcer cites the Fojnica Press Center as  saying  that "the ustasha offensive on the Fojnica-Kiseljak front went  into its third day today. During the day the enemy launched  three combined artillery and infantry attacks on our defense  lines. While the ustasha were attacking with waves of infantry,  the chetnik artillery and tanks provided them with heavy  support. Our fighters repulsed all these attacks and inflicted  heavy losses on the enemy in manpower. The number of killed  ustasha runs to dozens."    As for the Celic front, the "[Serb] enemy started shelling  the town fiercely in the afternoon hours, just as the  representatives of the Nordic Battalion arrived. They, too,  were exposed to the chetnik fire from artillery, mortars, and  antiaircraft guns." The studio announcer says that "the enemy  fired over 100 shells at Teocak today."    Describing the situation in Sarajevo, the studio announcer  says that "this morning the chetniks shelled Mijatovica Kosa,  Brijesce, Turkusici, and Point 830. This afternoon, the  chetniks shelled the region in and around Zuc, and residential  districts in Alipasino Polje and Sokolje."</p>

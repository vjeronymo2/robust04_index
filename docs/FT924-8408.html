			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Observer: Settling an old score Whatever their current difficulties, one should never underestimate the British royal family's pulling power with foreign leaders. Take Boris Yeltsin's lunch with the Queen yesterday. It was the highlight of the ex-construction worker's first official visit to London. 'We sat next to each other for two hours, and all the time we talked as if we had known each other for years,' said a delighted Yeltsin afterwards. Meanwhile, the Queen's agreement in principle to make her first state visit to Russia set the royal seal of approval on the new Russia, and its first democratically elected leader. No date has been fixed but Yeltsin promised, 'We won't have to wait too long'. The Queen's acceptance was a personal triumph for Yeltsin, who, in the now officially dead Soviet past, used to be the communist party boss in Sverdlovsk. This was the city, then called Ekaterinaburg, where the Czar and several of the Queen's other relatives were executed on Lenin's secret orders. It was that deadly act which made it impossible for the Queen to accept an earlier invitation from Mikhail Gorbachev who, for all the west's approval of perestroika, was still head of the Communist party and leader of the Soviet state.</p>

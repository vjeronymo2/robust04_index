			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Bomber Harris: 'a tactless choice' Norbert Burger, Mayor of Cologne, explains why a statue of the RAF's wartime Bomber Command chief, Sir Arthur Harris, should not be unveiled by the Queen Mother on May 31. THE PRESENT period of European history should make us think twice about raising monuments to heroes of past wars. The members of the European Community have agreed to scrap borders between each other. We want to live in friendship with our neighbours. This is a unique achievement in European history. We must, of course, accept that Adolf Hitler in 1939 started a war unprecedented in its scope, its brutality and its outcome. We must hope that the Second World War will indeed remain unprecedented. In the past half-century the face of the world and the face of Europe have been transformed. Enmity between Britain and Germany has given way to friendship. Contacts between British and German people flourish on every level. One good example is the partnership between Liverpool and Cologne, a link which celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. Together with a delegation from Cologne I paid a visit just a few weeks ago to our English partner city on the Mersey. We have particularly strong ties in culture, art and sport. It is a symbol of how things have changed for the good. I do not anticipate that this friendship will be spoiled by the planned unveiling of the statue. of Sir Arthur Harris. But I cannot say I am happy about it. I heard about the plan last year. I wrote in October 1991 to Sir Christopher Mallaby, the British ambassador in Bonn, and to Hans-Dietrich Genscher, then German foreign minister, to say that it would be wrong to put up such a monument. I had the feeling that old wounds which had healed could be torn open again. I want to clear up any misunderstandings about this. I have no intention of suppressing memories of the war. I certainly do not want to unleash tones of revanchism. There is absolutely no doubt that Hitler's Germany started the war. Germany takes responsibility for it. I made this point clear recently when opening an exhibition commemorating the '1000-bomber attack on Cologne' on May 31 1942. My words were: 'We must not forget: Carpet bombing aimed above all against civilian populations was first planned and carried out by Germans.' Nazi Germany's attacks on Warsaw, Rotterdam, Belgrade and, above all, Coventry, provide the evidence for this. In the night of May 30/31 1942, Cologne was the target of around 1,000 British aeroplanes, which dropped more than 100,000 incendiary bombs and around 1,000 high-explosive bombs, above all on the city centre. According to the official figures, 470 people died during the night. More than 5,000 were wounded and around 100,000 were left homeless. In addition to this, Cologne lost a great deal of its substance. The city lost its face. Many historic buildings were destroyed. Sir Arthur Harris, the supreme commander of Royal Air Force Bomber Command, was responsible for the military and strategic planning of this first 1,000 bomber attack. I am very worried that this monument will idealise a man who was partly responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians and for the destruction of many cities. It is a moot point whether attacks on civilian populations made strategic sense. I believe that the victory over Hitler's Germany came not because of bomb attacks on civilian targets, but through the fronts opened in the Soviet Union, Africa and France, and as a result of the air battle over Britain. But even if the bombing offensive is ascribed a different significance, it has to be acknowledged that no other inventor or executor of instruments or actions of mass destruction has had a monument raised in his name. And rightly so. No monument has been erected to Einstein on account of the development of the atom bomb. And certainly this has not been done for the generals and bomber crews who dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It could be argued that these actions ended the war more quickly and avoided further innocent victims. None the less, no-one - perhaps because of guilty consciences - wanted to put up monuments to those who carried out the bombing. All this explains why I am against the statue. We are trying to build a Europe of peace and friendship. It is particularly unfortunate that this monument is being unveiled precisely on May 31 - the anniversary of the attack on Cologne. It is much more sensible to use this day to commemorate all the victims of the Second World War with an ecumenical church service. Such a service is taking place in Cologne and there is also one in Canterbury, to which I have been invited. We must extend the hand of friendship to each other. And we must build a peaceful future for the whole of Europe.</p>

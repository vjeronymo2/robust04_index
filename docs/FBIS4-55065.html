			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bernard Besserglik] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, May 10 (AFP) -- Bosnia's loyalist Serbs  begin a series of meetings in foreign capitals Wednesday to  demand a role in peace talks on an equal footing with the  separatist Serbs of Radovan Karadzic. A delegation invited to  Moscow will argue before the Duma that the Serb Civic Council,  which supports Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, has as much  right to represent Bosnia's Serb community as the  self-proclaimed Serb republic based in Pale, the council's  leader, Mirko Pejanovic, told AFP.    Delegates will visit Paris later in the month and have also  been invited to Washington and the European Community in  Brussels, he said. The reluctance so far of foreign governments  to recognise the representativeness of the loyalist Serb  leadership is a serious mistake, Pejanovic believed, pointing  out that the number of Serbs in the territory controlled by Pale  is under half the total of 1.3 million who lived in the pre-war  republic. Of the 400,000 Bosnian Serbs who fled the fighting  that broke out two years ago to Serbia and Montenegro and the  100,000 in Europe, the great majority support the loyalist  position, he said.    Pejanovic, a member of Bosnia's collective presidency,  claimed the moral high ground with the argument that since  loyalist Serbs shared the suffering of the Moslems and Croats  during the bombardment of Sarajevo by the Pale forces, they  represent a unique force for reconciliation. "We are a moral  and peace factor because we are for a multicultural society with  equal rights for all groups and seek a negotiated and political  solution. Karadzic has ruled out a multicultural society, and  offers only more war," he said.    The Civic Council was elected by a consultative assembly in  late March to represent the 200,000 loyalist Serbs in Bosnia, of  whom around 60,000 live in Sarajevo.    "We believe that in order to act (in the Bosnian conflict),  the international community must include the loyal Serbs,"  Pejanovic said. "We don't want to represent the Karadzic Serbs,  we don't want to represent criminals. But we cannot accept that  he with his lies represents us."    While Pejanovic and other Civil Council leaders dispute the  legitimacy they believe foreign governments are abusively  attributing to the Serbs in Pale, the loyalties of the Serbs in  both camps are hard to assess. Those who remained in  government-controlled territory did so for a variety of reasons,  in which regard for legality and the democratic process may have  been stronger than any firm commitment to the govermnment that  emerged from parliamentary elections in 1991.    "Loyalist Serbs need not be regarded as pro-government,"  presidential advisor Kemal Muftic said. "They are pro-Bosnian  and patriotic. Governments come and go." The loyalties of  individual Serbs have been tested as the conflict has developed.  They have been regarded by some as a potential fifth column --  there were attacks on Serbs during the early stages of the war  -- and have themselves looked with growing unease on signs of  increasing Islamic sensibility in some government ministries.    A number of Serbs, difficult to quantify, are tempted to  leave if only because of the immense physical devastation  inflicted on this city and the general hardship. The same could  be said of many Moslems and Croats. The morale of Serbs in  Pale-controlled territory is said by reporters who have visited  the provinces to be flagging, and Civic Council secretary Gavrlo  Grahovac said he had received secret messages of support from  such separatist strongholds as Banja Luka and Trebinje.    "Karadzic's power is not greater than ours," he said. "It's  just that he has more weapons."    Grahovac, a publisher, said he and his wife had been wary  during the early stages of the conflict. "Some people were  killed on the street just because they were Serbs." But the  antipathy of non-Serbs had been "very little, compared with what  the Karadzic Serbs did." He spoke of the "shame of many" in the  Serb community at the actions of the separatists, and looked  back with fondness at the days when "there were no Serbs, or  Moslems, or Croats, only Yugoslavs."</p>

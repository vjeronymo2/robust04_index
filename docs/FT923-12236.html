			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Report suggested sugar should no longer be a 'vexed question' Sir, One would have thought following the Department of Health's publication some four years ago of a report by its Panel on Dietary Sugars and Human Disease, of which I was a member, that sugar would no longer be a 'vexed question' (Management July 1). Apart from the undisputed role of sugar, as a fermentable carbohydrate, in the promotion of dental decay, no convincing evidence was found for a specific involvement in the causation of any other disease. As Dr McGannon points out, the brain is well protected from a lack of energy by mechanisms that control the blood glucose, its favoured fuel, within fairly narrow limits. The uptake of glucose from the blood is not insulin-dependent, but an abnormally large increase in blood glucose following a meal or snack containing carbohydrate, or decrease (reactive hypoglycaemia) in response to an excessive insulin secretion, can seriously disturb brain function. The proportion of healthy people who experience reactive hypoglycaemia is unknown, but is likely to be small. Simple sugars like glucose and sucrose (table sugar), and starches after their digestion, cause the blood glucose to rise, some more rapidly than others, and trigger the secretion of insulin. Contrary to what Dr McGannon suggests, the rise following the ingestion of refined sugar, as in a non-diet cola, is little more than half that recorded when glucose (the sugar present in fruits and fruit juices) is consumed, and considerably less than that caused by eating an equivalent amount of starch in breakfast cereals or wholemeal bread. I suspect that the distressing symptoms described by Dr McGannon that appear to afflict our business executives may have their origins other than in reactive hypoglycaemia. His unusual dietary prescription is unlikely to appeal either to the workforce or to those responsible for formulating guidelines for healthy eating. May I suggest that decisions about what should be served in the company cafeteria or executive dining room might best be delegated to the catering officer.

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Beckett launches campaign A CALL for state funding of political parties and limits on parties' national spending on the general election headed the agenda as Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary, launched her election address for the Labour party deputy leadership yesterday. Campaigning, like others, on a platform of modernising the party, Mrs Beckett promised that her first priority as deputy leader would be to set up policy forums as a way of giving individual party members a greater say in formulating policy. Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, as part of his leadership campaign, put forward a vigorous defence of the role of the public sector delivering services. He also criticised the government's approach to compulsory competitive tendering. In a speech to the Fire Brigade Union's annual conference, Mr Gould said that Labour should 'loudly proclaim that there are some services that can only be done properly within the public sector,' while maintaining pressure on the services to improve. Nominations for the Labour party's shadow cabinet elections and a contest for the posts of chief whip and parliamentary party chairman are to go ahead before the leadership is settled. With an early summer recess expected soon after the leadership contest finishes on July 18, senior officers of the PLP have decided to bring both processes forward to avoid delays.</p>

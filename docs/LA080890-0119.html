			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAVERICK COACH GIVES PROTEGES THE ADVANTAGE;  </P> <P> TRACK: CHARLIE DIMARCO FORMED HIS OWN CLUB TO ENSURE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS  OF ATHLETES WOULD BE MET.  </P> <P> The promise of a vaulting pole of his choice lured Charlie DiMarco into  becoming a track coach 11 years ago, but it is the promise of young athletes  that is keeping him in his chosen profession.  </P> <P> Four years ago, disenchanted with what he claimed were numerous restrictions at  the college coaching level, especially his inability to work with high school  athletes because of NCAA regulations, DiMarco, 31, resigned as the field events  coach at Cal State Northridge and started the Advantage Athletics track club.  </P> <P> "It's not enjoyable when you have to fight the political battles of satisfying  someone's ego," said DiMarco, who lives in Northridge and still works  independently with several CSUN athletes.  </P> <P> "What motivates me is to see athletes have the opportunity to reach their  potential, but that's not always the No. 1 priority with athletic directors.  </P> <P> "All they understand is if the team wins or loses. They don't understand if a  kid sets a personal best or a school record.  </P> <P> "In track, the bottom line is personal achievement."  </P> <P> DiMarco, a full-time employee at On Track, a track and field equipment  distributor and manufacturer in Glendale, donates his time year-round after  work and on weekends to help athletes fulfill their potential. In addition, he  says he provides insurance liability for the club out of his own pocket. There  are no membership dues and schools for which the athletes compete underwrite  travel expenses. In rare instances, the athlete himself will pay.  </P> <P> "I don't do it for money because I don't want to put up with the politics of  being on a high school or college staff," said DiMarco, who likens Advantage  Athletics to gymnastics and swimming clubs in that the emphasis is placed on  individual development. "I want to do it for the enjoyment.  </P> <P> "I get satisfaction as long as someone is improving. I don't have to have the  top athletes or Olympians."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, several athletes have left their mark, literally, under the  tutelage of DiMarco. Crissy Mills of USC and Campbell Hall High, Walt Stewart  of CSUN and Melanie Clarke of Valley College all have won significant  championships.  </P> <P> Mills won the girls' high jump in the 1988 and '89 state high school  championships, prevailing with marks of 5 feet 10 inches and 6-0. Stewart won  the 1989 NCAA Division II title in the men's high jump (7-0 1/2).  </P> <P> Clarke, who also trains with Valley Coach James Harvey, won the heptathlon in  the state junior college championships in May and in The Athletics Congress  junior nationals in June (5,034 points and 5,080).  </P> <P> Stewart, who graduated from Notre Dame High, heard about DiMarco's  individualized training methods and chose to attend Northridge on a partial  scholarship in 1985 despite the offer of a full ride from Cal Lutheran.  </P> <P> "I was primarily self-coached in high school," said Stewart, who has a personal  best of 7-2 1/2 and is still training with DiMarco. "I jumped 6-8 in high  school, but I still needed help. I really liked the idea of a coach to work one  to one. I improved four inches in my first year and that's a lot at my level."  </P> <P> Clarke, who threw 71 feet in the javelin in her first heptathlon in April  improved to 121-1 in her third heptathlon, in the TAC Junior meet.  </P> <P> "He's really helped me, not only with my technique but (with) what I need to  focus on before the throw," said Clarke, the woman athlete of the year in field  events in the Western State Conference. "He's a generous man and loves track.  He's out there every day and (he is) a great motivator."  </P> <P> Dave Stephens, winner of the javelin in the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials, was  another DiMarco protege at CSUN. Stephens found DiMarco's methods to be sound,  so much so that in 1984 he won the NCAA Division II championship.  </P> <P> "He'll take you step by step and show you what to do. . . . That makes things a  lot easier to understand. He knows the dynamics of throws . . . and how to use  the stronger muscles to avoid injury."  </P> <P> As much as DiMarco wants to help the athletes who solicit his help, the demands  placed on his time could eventually limit his effectiveness as a coach.  </P> <P> "I have a tendency to take on more than I can handle. I'm just about maxed  out," said DiMarco, who works daily with nine athletes individually and has 16  in the club. "If I take any more, it doesn't allow me time to give 100%. I  can't add people indiscriminately and build my club so big that it can't be a  hands-on club.  </P> <P> "It's not in my personality to turn people away empty-handed, either. I try to  give them advice or steer them toward an age-group club or a masters club."  </P> <P> DiMarco said Advantage Athletics would not have been possible without the  assistance and support of CSUN track Coach Don Strametz, who allows the club to  use the Northridge track and weight room facilities. In exchange, DiMarco  renders his services to the CSUN track program.  </P> <P> "We definitely wouldn't be here without him. Strametz pushed through the  paperwork with the school and got us going," DiMarco said. "He has made the  facilities available to us and gives us the run of the place every evening."  </P> <P> DiMarco, a pole vaulter at Marshall High and Valley College, became  disillusioned with collegiate track after attending San Jose State for a  quarter in 1978.  </P> <P> "I wasn't very good and I was looking for help and nobody wanted to (help),"  said DiMarco, who set a personal best of 14-10 in 1980 while serving as an  assistant coach at Valley College.  </P> <P> "They were only interested in the big top guns. I felt that I could be decent,  but I didn't find a coaching staff that was willing to work with me."  </P> <P> He decided to drop intercollegiate track and complete his degree in television  broadcasting at Cal State Los Angeles. He got his degree but missed the sport  and wanted to get back into it.  </P> <P> DiMarco started coaching in 1979 at Valley College as an assistant to Mark  Covert, currently the track and cross-country coach at Antelope Valley Junior  College. Covert, the NCAA Division II cross-country champion at Cal State  Fullerton in 1970, was unable to put DiMarco on salary for his first season but  dangled another enticement.  </P> <P> "(Covert) was a distance runner and he didn't know anything about vaulting,"  DiMarco said. "He was honest about it and said that if I helped him out that  he'd get me any pole I wanted."  </P> <P> DiMarco got the pole of his choice.  </P> <P> Ironically, DiMarco's first coaching breakthrough came not in the pole vault  but in the high jump. Sue Patterson, who jumped 4-10 at St. Genevieve High and  has since improved to 6-1, placed second in the state junior college meet while  competing for Valley College in 1983.  </P> <P> Both coach and athlete apparently took their relationship and accomplishments  to heart. DiMarco and Patterson, 27, were married in April.  </P> <P> At CSUN, Patterson was a three-time NCAA Division II All-American, twice in the  high jump (1985 and '86) and once in the heptathlon ('85).  </P> <P> "By coaching good athletes, I've learned a lot," said DiMarco, who coached at  Valley and CSUN during the 1984 season, then solely at Northridge the next two  seasons.  </P> <P> "It's a two-way exchange, an equal partnership. I don't teach down to athletes.  I'm at an even level. I learn from them and what they get out (of it) is what  they give. If they give 100%, they get 100% back. If they give me anything  less, they get shown to the gate."  </P> <P> Said Stewart: "He's looking for the serious athlete that wants help. He's very  committed to what he does and expects the same in return."  </P> <P> Leaning on his experiences, DiMarco has designed and marketed several products,  including a foam rubber practice bar for the high jump and pole vault and an  elastic cord that is tied to one end of the javelin and the other to a post for  working on technique.  </P> <P> "I don't plan on coaching forever," said DiMarco, who eventually would like to  handle the club's administrative duties and relinquish the coaching chores to  some of his athletes.  </P> <P> "At the end of every season, I tell myself that this will be the year that I  get out and do something else. But every year the athletes get better and  better and keep going higher, and I tell myself one more year. This year I  didn't feel that way.  </P> <P> "The kids are still tired from the season, but right now I'm revved up and  ready to go."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has called on the  members of the UN Security Council [UNSC] to immediately send  funds to the Palestinians. He noted that Israel continues  paying the salaries of the Civil Administration workers in order  to prevent a crisis, though they are not under Israeli  jurisdiction. The foreign minister asked the Japanese  ambassador to immediately provide the Palestinians with $30  million of the $200 million his country pledged to give them.    Minister Peres met in New York with the ambassadors of the  members of the UNSC. Our correspondent Arye Golan reports that  the meeting was attended by the PLO's UN observer, and the  ambassadors of Morocco and Djibouti.</p>

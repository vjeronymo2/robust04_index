			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HELLS ANGELS MAKE GOOD NEIGHBORS IN VENTURA;  </P> <P> BIKERS: GROUP KEEPS A LOW PROFILE AND PARTICIPATES IN CHARITY EVENTS. BUT  FEDERAL OFFICIALS REMAIN SKEPTICAL.  </P> <P> There they are, roaring through the neighborhood, hanging out in their  clubhouse on Fix Way in Ventura, leather-clad, tattooed, full-bearded,  hog-mounted, the dreaded words "Hells Angels" defiantly arched across their  broad backs.  </P> <P> But the city isn't trembling. The cops aren't braced for trouble. And the  neighbors actually have nice things to say about the bikers.  </P> <P> "They are good people," said P. Hamlet, a middle-aged woman who lives up the  block. "They'll do anything for you."  </P> <P> Hamlet has never actually met a Hells Angel, although they have been neighbors  for 15 years. But her view is shared by others.  </P> <P> "They don't bother us except when they have a party every once in a while,"  said Alice Steward, manager of a mobile home park behind the clubhouse.  </P> <P> A New Year's Eve party lasted until about 3 a.m., she said. But for the most  part, "they don't come across the wall."  </P> <P> The manager of an auto repair shop next to the clubhouse agreed. "They're cool.  I've had no problems with them."  </P> <P> The police describe the group as low-profile and say they haven't had a run-in  with the bikers in years.  </P> <P> "Christie's strongest rule is to keep a low profile in town and don't cause any  problems," a police sergeant said, referring to George Christie Jr., the  chapter leader. "We don't devote any more attention to them than anyone else on  the avenue. There has never been any need for it."  </P> <P> Christie is a soft-spoken, articulate man who attended two years of college and  married his high school sweetheart when he was 20. He has two teen-agers and  owns a business, a martial arts studio.  </P> <P> His profile did jump briefly three years ago when he was tried on a charge of  soliciting the murder of a government informant, an ex-Angel whose death was  faked by federal authorities.  </P> <P> Although federal prosecutors produced two taped conversations in which Christie  and another government informant purportedly settled on the murder plan,  Christie claimed that he was framed.  </P> <P> A federal court jury acquitted him, and several jurors said later that they  liked him and found him to be an upstanding character. To show his gratitude,  Christie and three dozen fellow bikers held a barbecue for the jury on the lawn  outside the clubhouse.  </P> <P> The Angels' home on Fix Way is a white single-story building with heavy metal  screens on the windows and doors. A video camera inside allows members to watch  the front. Located in a working-class neighborhood near downtown Ventura, it  shares the block with several auto repair shops, a bakery and a cabinet  factory.  </P> <P> The clubhouse contains a living room with a TV and stereo, a recreation room  with video games and a pool table, and a motorcycle repair shop, equipped with  state-of-the-art tools.  </P> <P> Since his trial, Christie has cultivated something of a respectable reputation  for the group.  </P> <P> "We don't want to create problems for any of our neighbors and we don't want  them to create problems for us," he said.  </P> <P> Russ Smith, executive director of the Ventura Convention and Visitors Bureau,  said the Angels earned his respect when Christie raised $3,000 from bikers and  ran in the 1984 Olympic Torch Relay. The money raised by the bikers was  directed to the Special Olympics in Pottstown, Pa.  </P> <P> "I really thought that was a hell of a deal," Smith said.  </P> <P> Christie said he is one of two married members of the group. He would not say  how many members are in the Ventura chapter, only that their ages range from 21  to 50. (Law enforcement officials believe that the number may be as low as  five.)  </P> <P> Christie said that for years the Hells Angels have been persecuted because of a  grossly inaccurate stereotype.  </P> <P> "You mention Hells Angels and people say 'O, my God,' " he said. "And then you  ask them 'How many Hells Angels have you met?' and they say 'None.' "  </P> <P> Warm feelings about the Hells Angels are not shared by federal law enforcement  officials, who are deeply suspicious of what goes on behind the clubhouse  doors.  </P> <P> "Just because they have a low profile doesn't mean that has changed them," said  Bill Modesitt, who heads the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's regional  office in Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "They can be businessmen. They are shrewd people and they know how to work the  system."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department in Sacramento said the Hells  Angels has established its reputation as a powerful organization, which she  compared to the Mafia of the 1920s.  </P> <P> "They don't need to beat anybody up," she said. "They can just look at someone  and they know they are the Hells Angels."  </P> <P> A 1980 study by the DEA said four motorcycle gangs -- the Hells Angels, the  Outlaws, the Bandidos and the Pagans -- are reported to control as much as 50%  of the country's illegal methamphetamine market.  </P> <P> In California, the Angels were described by a state commission in 1979 as  dominating clandestine laboratories making methamphetamine in Northern  California and being "heavily involved in this illegal market in Southern  California."  </P> <P> Christie said Ventura Angels do not engage in criminal activities. Of the  suspicions of federal officials, he said: "These are allegations that have been  drifting around for years, and they have yet to prove that the club sells  narcotics."  </P> <P> There are 13 Hells Angels chapters in the state, 30 nationwide and 72  worldwide, according to the Justice Department.  </P> <P> Representatives of each state group meet monthly. National and international  representatives meet annually, according to the government.  </P> <P> "You tell me," the Justice Department spokeswoman said, "are they organized?"  </P> <P> Times staff photographer Alan Hagman contributed to this story.  </P></p>

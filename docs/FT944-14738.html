			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: TeleWest calls again There is little doubt that investors will prove rather more receptive to TeleWest's flotation now than five months ago. General market conditions are healthier, despite some recent new issue disasters in the UK. More importantly, Wall Street's attitude to the UK cable industry has changed dramatically over the past few months. Shares in International Cabletel, issued at Dollars 27 a year ago, had slumped to just Dollars 19 when the TeleWest and General Cable flotations were pulled at the end of May. They have since risen by more than 50 per cent. Bell Cablemedia, which went ahead with its Nasdaq listing in June, has done almost as well and Comcast UK's shares are up almost 30 per cent since its Dollars 200m stock issue last month. The new enthusiasm is based partly on the cable companies' prospects for gaining more telephone subscribers from British Telecommunications. These have been improved by recent regulatory moves. If the climate is now much more favourable for TeleWest there is one new complication: BSkyB is planning to float at the same time. The clash has already forced Goldman Sachs to step down as TeleWest's joint global co-ordinator because of its similar role for BSkyB. Although both sides insist cable and satellite do not compete, it is hard to deny they will do so eventually. When it comes to the competition for investors, TeleWest can point to its opportunities in telecommunications. But BSkyB has one important attraction: it makes money.</p>

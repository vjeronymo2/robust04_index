			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader elected last month to the Louisiana  House of Representatives, called the Rev. Jesse Jackson a "racist" and said  affirmative action and minority set-aside programs should be abolished. "I  think the racists in this city are people like Jesse Jackson," Duke said at a  Chicago news conference after addressing the national convention of the  right-wing Populist Party of America. Jackson declined comment on Duke's  statements, except to say: "I don't think it's an American point of view."  </P></p>

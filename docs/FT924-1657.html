			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Suspect in Carrian affair held in HK THE Hong Kong government yesterday inched closer to a resolution of the 1983 Carrian property scandal when officers of the Independent Commission Against Corruption last night arrested a key sus-pect on his arrival in the colony. Mr Lorrain Osman, former chairman of Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Corporation (BMFC), was extradited to Hong Kong after his 10th appeal was overturned by the House of Lords on Tuesday - ending his seven year attempt to avoid trial. In court today he will face 39 charges of conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to steal, theft and false accounting. These charges are in connection with HKDollars 6bn of loans made to Carrian by BMFC. Carrian was placed in liquidation in October 1983 with debts of more than HKDollars 10bn. Mr Osman has used his considerable personal financial resources to avoid extradition. He had been on remand in a London prison since December 1985 - making him the longest serving prisoner on remand in British legal history. His legal representative in Hong Kong said yesterday that Mr Osman feared for his life. There have been two deaths associated with the Carrian scandal since it broke in 1983 and the ICAC plans to offer him protective custody. A Malaysian government inspector sent to investigate the affairs of BMFC was murdered and his body dumped in a banana grove; in an apparent suicide a solicitor connected with Carrian was found at the bottom of his swimming pool with a manhole cover tied to his neck.</p>

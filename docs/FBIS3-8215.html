The Serb  forces fired three howitzer shells at civilian targets in the  village of Jelah destroying several residential buildings on  Sunday morning, the same source said. The HVO units managed to  repel a severe artillery-supported infantry attack of the Serb  aggressors in the area of Glavasi-Kriz-Komin on the western part  of the Usora battlefield last night, whereas on the eastern part  of the crisis area the Serb forces failed to carry out an  infantry breakthrough in the region of  Cerici-Razbjenjak-Makljanovac at the same time. The enemy  forces opened antiaircraft weaponry and mortar fire all the  night on the Usora battlefield, said the same source. Thus far  one HVO soldier has been reported to be gravely wounded. The HVO  reconnaissance troops noticed last night a concentration of the  Serb aggressors' forces and artillery on the western part of the  Usora battlefield. Another offensive of the enemy formations is  being expected last few days.</p>

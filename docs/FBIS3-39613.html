			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] Aid organisations were today urged to review the  position of any British or international staff in Bosnia as the  NATO deadline on air strikes approaches.    The Government request was seen by MP's as a suggestion that  aid groups should pull out staff who could be vulnerable to  retaliation if air strikes are ordered against heavy weapons  around Sarajevo.    The Foreign Office said: "The Overseas Development  Administration have advised these aid organisations to review  whether they should keep any British or international staff in  Bosnia.    "The advice points out that ODA personnel have been  relocated  in order to reduce the risks to them until the situation becomes  clearer."    The Foreign Office also said: "Since September 1991, all  British nationals have been advised to leave Bosnia-Herzegovina.  This advice remains in force. Those who, despite this advice,  decide to stay do so at their own risk."</p>

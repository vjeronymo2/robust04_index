			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Charges fly in health leak row: Agenda eclipsed by naming of girl portrayed in Labour broadcast A FEROCIOUS row over who leaked the name of the sick child whose case was a model for Labour's controversial political broadcast last Tuesday drove other general election issues off the agenda yesterday. Amid scenes of near pandemonium in the camps of both main parties, the Conservatives and Labour vied repeatedly to take the high moral ground by charging their opponents with cynically abusing a family's privacy for their own political ends. But after a series of increasingly acrimonious and rowdy news conferences which first put Labour on the defensive, the day ended with the Tories in the spotlight when Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, conceded that party officials had 'helped the consultant' at the centre of the case to contact a newspaper. By early evening, Tory officials had felt obliged to issue a 'categorical denial' that Mr Major had known anything of the party's contacts with the child's family, the consultant or the media. They added: 'We did not know the name of the child. When the consultant rang us, he did not give us the name of the child.' The Conservatives also admitted that they had received, but overlooked, a fax alerting them to the imminent broadcast from the child's grandfather, a Tory activist, nine days before the programme went out. While Central Office insisted that this carried no mention of the girl's name, Mr Peter Lee-Roberts confirmed last night that he had named his son-in-law. Jubilant Labour officials refused to accept the disclaimer, however. Hinting the Tories were responsible for the leak they demanded a public apology to Mr Kinnock from Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative chairman, for his remark that the Labour leader's endorsement of the broadcast had raised 'serious questions about his leadership'. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman, later called for Mr Waldegrave's resignation. The beneficiary from the bitter, two-party dogfight may turn out to be Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, who lambasted both his rivals for descending into 'personal vituperation and abuse' while failing to offer 'a single positive idea' for the National Health Service. There seems little doubt, however, that the row has damaged the standing of both main parties as the Tories have charged Labour with inaccuracy and scaremongering, while their opponents counter-claimed that the Conservatives were dodging the issue of NHS underfunding by 'smearing' Mr Kinnock. Yesterday began with Labour in disarray when Mr Kinnock was swiftly embroiled in a renewed dispute over who had identified Jennifer Bennett, the five-year-old whose wait for ear surgery was highlighted in the broadcast. His defence of Labour's actions turned to embarrassment, however, when his denial that Miss Julie Hall, his press officer, had disclosed the girl's first name to journalists was contradicted by Miss Hall herself. She acknowledged that she had divulged the girl's first name, but had given no further details. Efforts to trace the 'mole' then concentrated on the two national newspapers, The Independent and the Daily Express, which first ran stories identifying the girl. Last night Sir Nicholas Lloyd, the Express editor, denied that his newspaper had obtained the name of the girl or her family from Conservative Central Office. But he acknowledged that the paper did obtain the name of the consultant involved 'from a Conservative source probably connected with Central Office'. Adding that The Independent had had the name of the consultant and the name of the family, he said: 'I am quite confident they got those from Labour Party sources.' But The Independent insisted it had found the Bennetts by means separate from the parties, the consultant, or the family. In a further twist, Sir Nicholas later contradicted a Tory claim that the Express had known the family's name when it first called the consultant. As reporters continued to dig for more details of the leaks last night, the central debate over the future of the NHS appeared to have been all but ignored. Labour said it had received more than 1,000 calls from sympathisers, many of whom had volunteered stories of lengthy delays in hospital treatment. However, several examples of these were also subject to criticism when reporters discovered factual inaccuracies in those Labour publicised. The Conservatives, meanwhile, attempted to make the case for their NHS reforms by producing a number of doctors strongly supportive of the changes. The impact of the leak row on opinion polls remained unclear last night. Pundits believe it will be the weekend at the earliest before its effect, if any, shows through. It emerged last night that Mr Kinnock has issued a libel writ against The Sun in connection with a statement in the paper today on the affair.</p>

Seizures of mandrax this year are  likely to go up in comparison to those of heroin, say the  police, who have noted this change on the basis of records of  the past five years.    The other major change in the drug-running business appears  to be a lack of trust among gangs who have now begun to ask for  cash first and delivery at whatever time and place that the  buyer wants.    In fact, what is alarming the police here is the fall in  drug  seizures last year. With seizures being the only indication of  the degree of trafficking in any area, the police and drug  enforcement agencies in the city do not know whether to  congratulate themselves or watch out for gangs who may be  outsmarting them.    "I have a feeling they are using more sophisticated  packaging  at the airport these days," says Mr Rahul Rai Sur, in-charge of  the police anti-narcotic cell. "Recently we were told about  seizures of methaqualone in Moscow and South Africa which  originated from Bombay airport."    Drugs with Pakistani marking also have been fewer since last  year. The last seizure, five kg of heroin, was made in September  last year.    On the other hand, mandrax tablets are flowing in the city.  From only 63 kg in 1990, seizures went up to 4,300 kg in 1992,  along with Rs 4 lakh of equipment used to manufacture them. Last  year 809 kg of tablets were seized by the police.    Not only are there large quantities of tablets but the  police  have also begun locating small factories in and around the city.  With no expertise needed for working the tablet manufacturing  units, which cost Rs 2 lakh each, traffickers are turning to  addicts and unemployed youth to run these.    Shaikh Akhtar Shaikh Abdulla, the Vakola resident arrested  by  the police recently, had put up a machine at Sakinaka and was  running it along with Syed Javed, an addict since the last three  years.    Abdulla had been arrested in a mandrax case in 1989 and was  being supplied the stuff by one Khalil Ahmed in connection with  another man, Shanu, whom the police are yet to arrest. Before he  became a part of the drug racket, he was an agent sending eager  youth to the Gulf.    The addict, Javed, used to get his tablets from Masjid  Bunder, he told the police, and used up three to four vials a  day worth Rs 10 each, it was with the help of Abdulla's  connections that the machine was put up.    A recent seizure of heroin is worrying the police over its  low price. Hanif Mohammed, one of the men arrested in the case,  hails from Ratlam, in Madhya Pradesh. He says he bought the  heroin from one Ramesh at Rs 40,000 a kg which is Rs 60,000 less  than the price in Bombay or elsewhere in the country.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO GET A RUNNING START ON SUPER BOWL  </P> <P> It has been called the largest pregame party this side of Miami. It could be  called the Doo Dah of foot races.  </P> <P> But it is best known as the Redondo Beach Super Bowl Sunday 10K Run and Fitness  Expo. Everyone from the serious runner to the serious partier will feel a part  of this event. There are no age restrictions, costumes are encouraged, and  there's $4,600 to be won -- but set your alarm. The party begins at dawn.  </P> <P> Awards will be given to the top three finishers in each age class and in  wheelchair and baby buggy jogger divisions (men and women).  </P> <P> The centipede and six-pack divisions (groups of 10 or 6 runners connected by a  common costume) will also compete for a $500 prize, which will go to the high  school athletic program of the team's choice. There are no eligibility  requirements for this race, except maybe a good sense of humor.  </P> <P> For the overall winners, $1,000, $500 and $300 will be awarded in men's and  women's divisions. World-class runners Steve Cram of England and Alejandro Cruz  of Mexico are signed up to compete, along with Jacqueline Hansen of Santa  Monica, whose influence helped get the women's marathon and 10,000-meter races  into the Olympics.  </P> <P> Runners and spectators can examine or purchase health products and services,  clothing, food and drink at the Fitness Expo, open 6-11 a.m., just west of the  race starting point.  </P> <P> The racing begins at 7:50 a.m. on North Harbor Drive at Beryl Street in Redondo  Beach, and will end about 9:30 a.m. -- in plenty of time for football fans to  see the opening kickoff of Super Bowl XXIII. The $16 entry fee includes a  T-shirt. For pre-registration or information, call (213) 376-6913.  </P></p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / In the footsteps of a legend: Digital's incoming president will have his work cut out for him After years of speculation and impatient grumbling within the ranks, Mr Kenneth Olsen, 66, founder and president of Digital Equipment, last week finally announced his intention to retire. This living legend of the computer industry will leave behind a proud but troubled company. With revenues exceeding Dollars 14bn (Pounds 7.3bn) last year, Digital is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world behind International Business Machines. Digital pioneered the minicomputer as a cheaper alternative to mainframe computers and later moved ahead of its competitors in recognising the importance of connecting computers of different types and sizes on networks. Today, however, Digital is floundering; trying to come to terms with fundamental shifts in computer technology that have undermined its business model. The role of minicomputers is being usurped by networks of personal computers and workstations. Also, the industry-wide trend toward 'open systems', based upon industry standard software, has undercut Digital's proprietary systems. These challenges have squeezed profit margins throughout the computer industry. But Digital has tried to respond: it offers a broad range of open systems products and has recently stepped up efforts to compete in the markets for workstations and personal computers. Yet critics, within the company and among industry analysts, say Digital resisted change for too long and in spite of job cuts the company remains grossly overstaffed. They blame Mr Olsen. He has ruled Digital from the day, 35 years ago, when he set up shop in a disused woollen mill in Maynard, a small New England town west of Boston. He shaped Digital with his own brand of authoritarian leadership combined with egalitarian personnel principles. Although for years he resisted laying off workers, on several occasions he sidelined executives who crossed him. Yet the tenacity with which he built Digital also proved to be Mr Olsen's failing. Just a week ago, at an event marking the introduction of new products, Mr Olsen reiterated one of his favourite themes; the superior qualities of Digital's proprietary VMS software and the weaknesses of UNIX, the AT&amp;T computer operating system that is at the heart of 'open systems' and a key element of Digital's current product strategy. Digital marketing executives winced when Mr Olsen tossed in remarks to 'trash UNIX'. 'VMS (Digital's proprietary minicomputer operating system software) was his first-born child. He adopted others along the way, but never felt the same about them,' says a Digital insider. Digital Equipment without Mr Olsen is hard to imagine. Although the prospect of his departure, on October 1, has been greeted with a sigh of relief from many Digital executives, he will be missed. Mr Robert Palmer, 51, Mr Olsen's hand-picked successor, is a dark horse. Like most Digital executives, he has made few public statements in the past and has so far declined to discuss his future role. Digital insiders are, however, pleased by his appointment (which has yet to be confirmed by the board) and describe him as a 'sharp, aggressive and determined to get Digital back on its feet'. He joined Digital in 1985. He was one of the founders of Mostek, a chipmaker that has been acquired by United Technologies. Mr Palmer will take over Digital at a point where the company's route to recovery has already been mapped. Before the end of this year Digital will launch the first of a new generation of products upon which the companies hopes for the future are pinned. Its semiconductor operations, previously headed by Mr Palmer, have developed a blindingly fast Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor, called 'Alpha'. Alpha will become the foundation for Digital's new product line which ultimately will span desktop computers through high performance minicomputers. Before Mr Palmer takes over, Digital is expected to begin large-scale cost-cutting. The initiative, which could include thousands of lay-offs, may be announced this week when Digital reports its quarterly results. Digital, which employs about 116,000 people, has cut more than 23,000 jobs over the past two years and closed numerous manufacturing operations. The company suffered its first annual loss in 1991, and lost another Dollars 404m in the first three quarters of this year. When year-end results are announced, the red ink is expected to gush again. With Mr Olsen's departure, industry analysts expect Digital to cut overheads and focus its product strategy more clearly upon open systems. But it could take months to return Digital to profitability and the company faces heavy charges as it reshapes its operations. Analysts predict that Digital will report an operating loss of about Dollars 200m for its fourth quarter, which ended June 30, and the company may take charges of as much as Dollars 1bn to pay for job cuts and restructuring. The transition to Alpha products may also be difficult. As sales of Digital's established products slow down, speeding the new products to market will be crucial. Perhaps the biggest challenge facing Mr Palmer, however, will be to follow in the footsteps of an industry legend. He needs to articulate a vision of Digital as a future technology leader rather than a company clinging to the memories of its past success.</p>

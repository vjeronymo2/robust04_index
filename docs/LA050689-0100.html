			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFINERIES LACK MEANS TO HANDLE CORROSIVE ACID LEAKS, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> Powerine Oil Co.'s refinery in Santa Fe Springs does not have special equipment  to handle a leak of highly corrosive hydrofluoric acid, according to a report  presented Friday to the board of the South Coast Air Quality Management  District.  </P> <P> And, based on information contained in the report, the special water spray  safety systems at another Los Angeles-area refinery -- Golden West Refining  Co.'s facility in Santa Fe Springs -- and at Allied Signal Corp.'s El Segundo  chemical plant are not adequate to deal with a major leak, said David Schwien,  a member of the air quality agency's task force studying hydrofluoric acid.  </P> <P> According to the study, the Powerine refinery does not have a water spray  system designed to mitigate a hydrofluoric acid release. The refinery, which  typically has 9,600 gallons of the acid on hand, does have a firefighting water  system. Powerine officials told the air quality agency that they intend to put  in a water spray system but are waiting for the industry to make available  newly designed equipment.  </P> <P> Allied Signal and Golden West officials said they are planning to upgrade their  systems.  </P> <P> Schwien said he compared the capabilities of safety systems at the five largest  users of the corrosive chemical with data from the largest known release of  hydrofluoric acid, a 1987 accident at the Marathon Oil refinery in Texas City,  Tex.  </P> <P> In that accident on Oct. 30, 1987, about 7,000 gallons of the corrosive  substance leaked out in a 100-minute interval after an 80-ton piece of  equipment was dropped on a pipe leading to a tank containing the acid. About  650 people were injured, 3,000 were evacuated and trees were defoliated for  miles. The EPA said last week that the Texas City accident had the potential of  being as severe as the methyl isocyanate release in Bhopal, India, in 1984 that  killed about 3,000 and injured about 200,000.  </P> <P> Schwien said refinery and industry data indicate that a release at the average  spill rate in the Texas City accident -- 70 gallons a minute -- would overwhelm  existing water spray safety systems at Allied Signal and Golden West.  </P> <P> According to the report, Allied Signal can handle releases of no more than 21  gallons a minute; the Golden West refinery in Santa Fe Springs can handle eight  gallons a minute.  </P> <P> Mobil Oil's Torrance refinery and Ultramar Refining's Wilmington facility are  the area's two largest users of hydrofluoric acid. Both facilities have  considerably larger water spray systems, although company officials  acknowledged that a huge disaster -- such as a plane falling on a hydrofluoric  tank -- could overwhelm their systems.  </P> <P> The five companies keep thousands of gallons of the acid on hand. Oil  refineries use it as one of two possible catalysts -- the other is sulfuric  acid -- to boost the octane number of unleaded gasoline. Allied Signal uses the  acid to manufacture refrigerants.  </P> <P> The study presented Friday was the second update on the progress of the  agency's hydrofluoric acid task force, formed in January, 1988, after two  accidents involving the corrosive chemical to study whether to regulate or  eliminate use of the acid in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> The Marathon Oil accident was one of the accidents focusing attention on  hydrofluoric acid. The other was a thunderous explosion and two-day fire at  Mobil's Torrance refinery in November, 1987, during which 100 pounds of the  substance was released.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Be Lethal  </P> <P> According to industry-sponsored tests conducted in the Nevada desert in 1986, a  release of hydrofluoric acid forms a dense, ground-hugging cloud of gas and  small droplets that, following a two-minute, 1,000-gallon spill, could prove  lethal as far as five miles downwind. Follow-up tests in Nevada in 1988 showed  that water sprays must drench the acid in a 40-to-1 ratio of water to acid to  reduce toxic fumes by 90% -- a comparatively safe level.  </P> <P> Using the 40-to-1 standard, the report said, the best water spray system  currently operating at major hydrofluoric acid users in the Los Angeles area is  a 9,000-gallon-a-minute system at the Ultramar refinery, which could handle a  leak of 225 gallons a minute. At Mobil's refinery, the water spray system could  take care of a hydrofluoric acid leak of 78 gallons a minute.  </P> <P> No agency working on risk assessment for hydrofluoric acid has determined  exactly how big a water spray system should be to handle disasters. But Schwien  said the Texas City accident offers a valid case study.  </P> <P> "It is not fiction. It is not fantasy. It happened. Three of these systems --  at Powerine, Golden West and Allied Signal -- appear not to have (water spray)  systems able to handle the sort of accident that happened at Marathon Oil. In  that accident, according to refinery figures, the average spill rate was about  70 gallons a minute."  </P> <P> Allied Signal plant manager Joseph Barnett said, "While it is true that our  system could not handle a leak of 70 gallons a minute, the sort of leak that  occurred at Texas City is very unlikely because of precautions we have taken."  </P> <P> Golden West refinery manager John Miller said the facility was beginning a risk  study at the request of the city of Santa Fe Springs.  </P> <P> At Ultramar, refinery manager Marshal A. (Bud) Bell acknowledged that "you can  conjure up a scenario that nobody, including us, can handle."  </P> <P> "But in the real world," he added, "when we did our disaster scenario modeling,  the most credible leak we came up with was a pump seal failure." Bell said that  Ultramar's water spray system easily could handle that sort of hydrofluoric  acid leak.  </P> <P> At Mobil, refinery officials are increasing their water system and are planning  to install large holding tanks to drain acid rapidly from processing units in  the event of a rupture.  </P></p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Property claims in eastern Germany Nearly one in four claims on property confiscated by the Nazis, or the Communist regime in eastern Germany, have been resolved since late 1990, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. However, officials from the federal office responsible for the cases yesterday said it would take a decade before all outstanding claims were settled. The claims, which relate to property confiscated between 1933 and 1945, and between 1949 and 1990, total 1.21m, and involve 2.63m titles to property ranging from large enterprises to small businesses, land and houses. Their uncertain status is seen by economists as hindering investment in the region. From late 1990 until the end of June 1993, 28 per cent of the claims on 130,000 enterprises, including agricultural land, were resolved, while 24 per cent of the remaining 2.52m titles were also settled.</p>

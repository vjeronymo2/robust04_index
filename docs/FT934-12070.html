			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Observer: Fight the flak Some selfless individuals from law firm Norton Rose today head for western Bosnia in a convoy of lorries packed with medical supplies and food. Ian Cooke, a 27-year-old property lawyer who leads the nine-strong team on their fortnight's 'holiday', is not a complete neophyte, having done the Romanian orphanage run and visited Croatian refugee camps in the past year. He has raised Pounds 75,000 from assorted charities - while Norton Rose chipped in Pounds 2,000. 'Lack of money is not the issue,' Cooke interjects loyally, pointing out that transportation is the headache. Notwithstanding the shooting of a Danish aid truck driver this week which has prompted the UN to suspend relief to central Bosnia, Cooke says his team are leaving flak jackets behind. 'I don't like to look provocative.' So lawyers have feelings after all? Well, one team member, Gavin Collins, has just parted with the profession - to become a vicar.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACCIDENT CAUSES POWER OUTAGE IN STUDIO CITY  </P> <P> A minor car accident in Studio City triggered a power outage that left 4,000  Los Angeles Department of Water and Power customers without electricity, some  for as long as five hours, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The outage occurred at 11:20 p.m. Monday when a car hit a utility pole on  Laurel Canyon Boulevard at Berry Drive, DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen said.  The utility pole snapped near the top, bringing down electrical wires and a  transformer, officials said.  </P> <P> That set off a chain-reaction of stress on the local power system, knocking out  three circuits that feed electricity to the area, Jensen said.  </P> <P> Primarily, homes and businesses in the area between Mulholland Drive and the  Ventura Freeway were affected. Power was restored to customers throughout the  night, with the last part of the outage ending shortly after 4 a.m. Tuesday,  Jensen said.  </P> <P> The driver, whose name was unavailable, suffered only minor injuries, officials  said.  </P></p>

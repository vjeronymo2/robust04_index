			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Observer: Clingman's coup Even in the fast-moving world of the international trader, Alan Clingman, 33, has come a long way in a short time. Having started broking oil in his native South Africa, Clingman did not move to New York until 1987, and it was not until a year later that he and his partner, Alexander Krasner, reversed their operations into AIOC. Over the last year Clingman's name has been associated with ventures ranging from financing a South African vanadium mine to setting up a joint venture bank in the Ukraine. Now he appears to have been offerred one of those one-in-a-lifetime opportunities to break into the cliquey European metals business - by Axel Johnson, the Swedish conglomerate, which is selling its 127-year-old metals trading subsidiary to AIOC. Clingman's insistence that Axel Johnson was more interested in securing a good home for its metal trading business, rather than the highest price, sounds like self-serving marketing hype. Even so the deal more than doubles AIOC's size, and while Clingman is still not in Marc Rich's league, clearly he is a man to watch, especially if he can continue to grow his private empire rapidly without tripping up.</p>

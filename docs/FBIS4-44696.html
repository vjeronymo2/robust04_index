That is the reason why, in 1989, a start was made  on the so-called Sciamachy project. Sciamachy stands for  "Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric  Cartography." The project includes the development and  construction of an instrument which can measure very precisely  the ozone and other trace gases in the atmosphere. If  everything goes according to plan, the Sciamachy instrument will  be placed on ESA's (European Space Agency) ENVISAT-1 satellite.  The satellite, equipped with Sciamachy, must be launched in  1998.  <H5>  Satellites </H5>   Satellites play an essential role in research into the  atmosphere. Measurements carried out in space are very  attractive because they make it possible to study the atmosphere  at random places above the surface of the earth. Moreover,  space platforms provide the possibility to carry out  simultaneous measurements with instruments that complement each  other. Results obtained via these measurements can then be  compared more easily with each other, and the findings are more  reliable. Because even the smallest trace particles influence  the atmosphere, researchers need to demand high standards for  the measuring sensitivity of their instruments.  <H5>  Advantages </H5>   The problem, for instance, with measuring the local ozone  layer is that local concentrations of ozone not only undergo  many daily changes but also seasonal changes. The concentration  also varies according to the latitude. The determination of  annual trends therefore requires both long-term and accurate  measurement, which is where the great advantages of using  Sciamachy come into play. Sciamachy can perform continuous  measurements for many years. In addition, a particular point is  that this instrument can carry out measurements of unprecedented  exactitude. Sciamachy will be able to measure the precise  composition of the atmosphere to a very high degree of accuracy,  both vertically (looking down perpendicularly) and horizontally  (looking along the atmosphere). Expectations are high:  observations carried out with Sciamachy will play a very  important role in the understanding of the chemical composition  of the atmosphere and of its eventual changes.  <H5>  Together </H5>   Observation of the earth is very costly. The Sciamachy  project is a joint project between the Netherlands and Germany  and costs some 170 million Dutch guilders [G]. The Netherlands'  share of this is G75 million. In constructing this instrument,  Germany and the Netherlands are in fact contributing in kind to  the ESA [European Space Agency] earth observation program. The  Ministry of Education and Science is paying G34 million, that of  Economic Affairs G22 million, while the Ministry of Housing,  Planning and Environment is paying G19 million. It is the first  time that the last-mentioned ministry has been involved in a  large earth observation project, because environmental and  climate research will both benefit from Sciamachy. Netherlands  management for the project rests with the Netherlands Institute  for Aircraft Development and Space Travel (NIVR), while their  German counterpart is DARA (the German Agency for Space  Exploration Matters). At the end of March 1994 the two  countries will sign a memorandum of understanding, to emphasize  once again their positive collaboration on the project.</p>

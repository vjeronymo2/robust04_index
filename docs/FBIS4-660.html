			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In Rwanda, thousands of civilians are continuing  to flee the massacres while the fighting between rebels and  government forces appears to be escalating in the capital,  Kigali. Today Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin confirmed the  deaths of two French gendarmes and the wife of one of them to  the National Assembly. Francois Leotard informed the senators  of the departure late this afternoon of the last French company  of soldiers. Before leaving Rwanda himself our special  correspondent, Philippe Boisserie, sent us his report:    [Begin Boisserie recording] The French military are leaving  Kigali at the same time as the Rwandan Patriotic Front are  entering it. Operation Amaryllis, for the evacuation of  foreigners, is ending. With 120 of his men, Colonel Poncet, who  was leading the operation, left as night was falling, while all  around the airport, the guns thundered. Only 50 French soldiers  remain on the scene. Their mission is to support the Belgian and  Italian soldiers in recovering their nationals who are still  trapped in the four corners of the country. The two warring  sides have promised to allow these operations to go ahead, the  only condition being that everyone should be out within 48 hours.    The Rwandans are thus going to settle their scores among  themselves, and it appears that the Tutsi minority of the Rwanda  Patriotic Front are in the process of taking power.

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROBLEMS OF HIGHWAY CHASES FROM BORDER PATROL CHECKPOINT  </P> <P> I am writing in response to your recent article about a high-speed police chase  originating from the San Clemente checkpoint.  </P> <P> My concern is the safety of innocent people who can and do get hurt as a result  of these chases. Is an illegal alien worth my life?  </P> <P> Yesterday on my way to work, a car came into my lane going in the wrong  direction, being chased by three police cars. What did the person do that it's  worth making it so unsafe for so many others?  </P> <P> BETSY SHAPIRO  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 2 March  on page seven publishes a 1,500-word report by correspondent  Khudayr 'Abbas Mahmud entitled "AL-THAWRAH Reveals a Secret  About the Baby Milk Factory for the First Time." The report  says the factory, which was the target of allied bombing on 21  January 1991, has been reconstructed and is now operational,  producing "milk that is 100 percent Iraqi" called "Biladi"  [English: my country]. The report includes an interview with  the factory's chief engineer, Qays Hanna Dawud.    Asked why the factory was an allied target, Dawud says  everyone in the West knew the factory was built by a French  company at a cost of $35 million and was completed in 1984,  "however, the foreign company failed to operate the factory to  produce milk according to the required specifications. So the  factory remained inactive until 1990 when attempts were made by  the General Establishment for Milk Products, which is currently  in charge of the factory, to find solutions to those technical  problems. The French, who were among the aggressor states, knew  that it was a baby milk factory."    Asked about the connection between U.S. companies and the  factory, Dawud says that the U.S. "Wyath Company" was approached  to modify the factory designs, that a team of experts from that  company had actually visited the factory, and that an Iraqi  delegation led by the late Ghassan Ibrahim, director general of  the General Establishment for Milk Products, was actually in the  United States on 2 August 1990 to sign a contract with the U.S.  company. The contract dealt with operating the factory and  using the trademark of the Wyath Company, which produces the  children's powdered milk brands: "SMA" and "S-26." Dawud notes:  "This secret, which has been revealed by AL-THARAH for the first  time, serves as categorical proof that the Americans and the  French knew that it was a factory for producing milk for  children."    Asked about the damage caused to the factory, Dawud says the  factory sustained 95 percent damage and that allied aircraft  "made use of the information and the visit by the American  delegation of six experts, who came to inspect the factory and  make their technical assessments before the departure of the  Iraqi delegation to the United States. This was in addition to  the maps the French had."    Dawud concludes: Under orders from President Saddam Husayn,  the Corporation for the Implementation of Food and Medical  Projects, an affiliate of the Military Industrialization  Organization, began reconstruction work on the factory on 1  April 1992. Foreign companies were contacted for assistance,  but they refused to provide the equipment needed. So the teams  of the Military Industrialization Organization relied on their  own initiatives and skills and reconstructed the factory, which  was reopened on 21 January 1993, the second anniversary of its  bombing.</p>

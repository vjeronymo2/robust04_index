			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: James Crean buys balance of Valley Fresh JAMES CREAN has spent Dollars 5.5m, or Pounds 3.61m, to acquire the 50 per cent of Valley Fresh Foods, of Turlock, California, that it did not already own and over which it had an option. The Dublin-based food, household goods and industrial equipment wholesaler bought its original 50 per cent holding in Valley Fresh in 1990. Crean said that the performance of the US processor and distributor of branded chicken products had been 'very satisfactory' and that as a result it had decided to exercise its option to buy the balance. In the 1991 year Crean lifted turnover to IPounds 208.7m (IPounds 179.7m), though pre-tax profits declined by more than IPounds 1m to IPounds 18.5m, or Pounds 16.9m. However, it said at the time of the results that the comparisons were skewed by the investments in Valley Fresh and Egidius Janssen in the Netherlands in 1990 and by the consolidation of Valley Fresh's results into the 1991 accounts.</p>

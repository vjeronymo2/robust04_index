			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPROVE THE COMMUTE  </P> <P> Your article, "The High Cost of Housing" (Oct. 1), properly identified the high  cost of land as the culprit. That answer, however, merely raises another  question: Why does land cost so much here?  </P> <P> Land prices reflect supply and demand. Limits on the supply side of the  relationship distinguish Southern California from other areas and explain much  of the differential.  </P> <P> Because of traffic congestion, commuting ranges -- the distances that one can  travel in a given time during rush hours -- rank among the lowest anywhere.  Commuting ranges determine the area in which workers can live, and this area  fixes the supply of housing for them.  </P> <P> As commuting ranges decrease, the area in which people can live decreases. As  the area decreases, the supply of housing does, too, and prices go up because  fewer sellers compete against each other.  </P> <P> As commuting ranges increase, the area increases, and commuters have more  choices for housing. More sellers compete against each other, the supply  increases, and prices decrease.  </P> <P> In New York, Chicago, Boston, Toronto, and, to a lesser extent, Washington and  San Francisco, and in all major cities of Western Europe, commuter rail systems  move many of people over long distances. By increasing commuting ranges and  spreading people over a larger area, these systems increase the supply of land  suitable for housing for urban workers and reduce the price of it. Southern  California has no comparable systems and, consequently, relatively higher  housing costs.  </P> <P> To make housing more affordable here, we must increase the efficiency of our  transportation system. Land costs, housing prices, and transportation  efficiency are inextricably linked together.  </P> <P> As long as public policy here and in Washington ignores this linkage and does  little to increase transportation efficiency, the housing affordability crisis  will continue unabated. The solutions coming from some quarters -- greater FHA  mortgage limits, using IRA savings for down payments and other  demand-increasing schemes -- will only boost demand and increase prices.  </P> <P> BOB CLARK JR.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

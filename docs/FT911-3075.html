			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Whitbread Investment may hold key to brewery battle DEVENISH, the West Country brewer which is fighting off a takeover bid from Boddington, the pubs, hotels and health-care group, was yesterday warned by the Whitbread Investment Company not to expect its automatic support. WIC, an investment trust 49.9 per cent-owned by Whitbread, could decide the outcome of the battle because of its holdings in both companies. It has a 15.3 per cent stake in Devenish and a 21.9 per cent stake in Boddington. Devenish said it was hopeful of WIC's support since the investment trust's policy, as outlined in the 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into the supply of beer, was to support the boards in which it has investments. However, WIC, while not wishing to comment directly on the bid, said it was not its policy to automatically offer support. It pointed out that when Mr Robin Farrington became its chairman three years ago he issued a statement outlining the trust's strategy which would guide its policy in the present takeover battle. Mr Farrington said while WIC did not normally interfere with the management of companies in which it had investments, it would judge each situation on its merits. He added: 'It may be that on occasions a management team from outside is thought likely to provide the best prospects for the longer term development of a company. If that is seen to be the case then the WIC would be prepared to endorse that option. 'The same would apply if a company receives an offer which in our opinion, and that of our advisers, more than fully reflects the company's long-term value.' Analysts interpreted the statement as a significant change of policy from WIC's past strategy of siding with the boards of companies in which it invested. Following the MMC report, the government is forcing all brewers owning more than 2,000 pubs to release the tie on half of those outlets in excess of that number by December 1992. If a brewer has a 15 per cent holding in a rival then those pubs are also included in the total, complicating Whitbread's situation. It owns some 17 per cent of Boddington - 5.9 per cent outright, and another 11 per cent through WIC. However, if Boddington's bid was accepted, Whitbread's holding in the new company would be reduced to about 12.5 per cent, thereby eliminating the need to sell any pubs.</p>

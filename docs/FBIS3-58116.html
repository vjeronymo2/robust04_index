An Alliance With the League Is Permissible'"]    [Text] [Christian Democratic Party, DC, Secretary]  Martinazzoli says he has taken note of the centrists' farewell?  Pier Ferdinando Casini confutes: "If he thinks we are leaving,  he is mistaken. He must be the one to throw us out."    [Lampugnani] But have you been thrown out or not?    [Casini] We do not have the complex of being troublemakers.  But we do not understand what we are being thrown out of since  the DC no longer exists and the PPI [Italian People's Party] has  not been founded yet. The truth is that we find ourselves  entangled in an inextricable contradiction, which has been  caused, among other things, by procedures that are not very  clear and that are forcing us once again to call on the party's  National Council to address all the problems.    [Lampugnani] But do you still feel DC members or a part of  something else?    [Casini] We are currently experiencing a transitional phase  in which everybody is equal.    [Lampugnani] In reality Martinazzoli is saying that you are  now another party, that you have, in effect, placed yourselves  outside the DC.    [Casini] And we have taken note of his statements. The real  problem is a political one, because there can be no casus belli  of this kind. In the DC there has always been a plethora of  position without any need for disciplinary measures to be taken.  In reality the left of the party has been given the freedom of  action that has been denied to us.    [Lampugnani] You are the only ones however, that have  prepared an authentic political program.    [Casini] Our program was presented to the DC. But when are  we supposed to have discussed it since nobody has been meeting  on this issue for the past six months?    [Lampugnani] Meanwhile you have discussed it with everybody  else.    [Casini] Not with [Fininvest President] Berlusconi, but with  Maroni [Northern League lower house floor leader], [Radical  leader] Pannella, Republican member Castagnetti, and Ferri  [Italian Social Democratic Party secretary]. Moreover, talking  with parliamentary representatives is not forbidden as yet.  Should [DC left-wing faction leader] Bindi not have been  allowed to meet with the AD [Democratic Alliance] or the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left]? Debate is a part of politics,  not a disciplinary matter.    [Lampugnani] What will happen now. What will you do?    [Casini] Since Martinazzoli is calling for discussions on  the succession to the DC, we are asking for the immediate  summoning of the party's National Council. On that occasion we  will verify if there any difficulties in our cohabiting with the  others, or if a transfer is necessary.    [Lampugnani] League member Maroni views the position adopted  by Martinazzoli toward you to be his first act in taking the DC  over to the left. Do you concur with this analysis?    [Casini] I do not need Maroni to make this type of  judgement. I say that, just as the PDS is organizing an alliance  that goes from [Communist Renaissance Chairman] Cossutta to  [Italian Liberal Party member] Battistuzzi, we have a duty to do  the same with Formentini [Milan mayor and League member].    [Lampugnani] You have reached breaking point with the DC.  Do you fear a split that will break the party in two?    [Casini] Of course, but we have done nothing to encourage  it.    [Lampugnani] Will the process of aggregating the  neo-centrists be speeded up?    [Casini] I only stress that I did not invent what Segni said  about the League. This process of acceleration is occurring  openly. The construction of the People's Party is the only thing  that is proceeding slowly. The truth is that Martinazzoli wants  us to be the ones to say: We are leaving. Well, if he wants  that gesture, let him make it. Let him be the one to throw us  out. I repeat: we are asking the National Council to dissolve  the DC and then give birth to twins or whatever.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi by </F> correspondent Gary Alfonso in Ulundi -- live]    [Text] [Alfonso] We are standing here with Dr. Mangosuthu  Buthelezi, who has expressed major concern at the fact that this  election might not be free and fair. Dr. Buthelezi, what  exactly are your sentiments at the moment about this election?    [Buthelezi] Well, at the moment my spirits are down because  of the problems that we have encountered, and particularly the  issue of the shortage of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  stickers, because the agreement, after all, that was made on the  19th -- when the president and Mr. Mandela and myself had that  discussion in Pretoria, where we made the agreement that we all  signed -- actually was based on the fact that there would be  only stickers with the IFP space at the bottom of the ballot  paper, and that any ballot paper that didn't have a sticker of  the IFP at the bottom would not be considered to be a valid  paper, and would be regarded as spoilt. So now I have heard  rumors that these ballot papers are getting short. But I am  even more alarmed by the suggestion that is being made that  people could scribble IFP at the bottom, because that is just  not acceptable to us, and we reject that totally, because even  on the 19th that was suggested and it was rejected by us  completely.    [Alfonso] Dr. Buthelezi, is this a warning that you might  not  view the election as a free and fair one at the end of the day,  and that you would have to reconsider all the options you signed  earlier this month in Pretoria?    [Buthelezi] Well, actually, it is not us who broke them,  because the chairman of the IEC [Independent Electoral  Commission] was actually present when we made those agreements,  and therefore it is not the IFP breaking these, but otherwise  it's the IEC that is now deviating. I am not trying to  apportion blame on them, I know that they are doing a very  difficult job, but the point is that there is no way in which we  can agree to what is being suggested now that our people should  just scribble IFP at the bottom of the paper without the IFP  sticker, because this has been a complaint of people everywhere,  even in Cape Town. There are people who wanted to vote me in  Cape Town. This morning I received some faxes from overseas,  from Portugal and from America and from someone who has just  been to London, who wanted to vote for me, but they were told  that they should scribble my name, and these were white people  who are even literate and educated, but they refused to do that  because they say that infringes also the secrecy of the ballot.    [Alfonso] So what will it take for you to be happy with  these  elections?    [Buthelezi] Well, if we have enough stickers, and if the  dates for the elections are extended. I have heard that, you  know, tomorrow may be declared a holiday again, but I think that  is not enough if you take into account that our old folk were  here yesterday. Before old people were here, indigent people,  pensioners and sick people were here and they stayed here for  hours on end, and this is not only here, but everywhere. It has  happened everywhere that these elderly people, sick people, have  come and gone home without voting. Just now I have received a  fax from Vryheid stating the same thing, from Mr. Mentz, you  know, that in Vryheid they have hundreds and hundreds of these  old people who didn't vote yesterday, but even today who find  the situation unsatisfactory. That is why they have sent the  fax to me.    [Alfonso] Dr. Buthelezi, what people throughout the country  want to know, are you seriously considering pulling out of the  election if that doesn't happen?    [Buthelezi] Well, that is a function of the Central  Committee, but I think I will have no option myself. If in fact  they are trying to foist this decision that people should  scribble the name instead of a sticker, then I will have to call  a special meeting of the Central Committee because the Central  Committee has the final word on this. But I think I would be  duty bound to call that meeting because, quite clearly there is  no way in which we can accept that.    [Alfonso] Dr. Buthelezi, thank you very much, and we cross  back to the studio in Johannesburg.</p>

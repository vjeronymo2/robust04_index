			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: Corning held back by charge CORNING, the US specialty glass group, yesterday turned in underlying second-quarter earnings of Dollars 88.4m, or 47 cents a share, a 15 per cent advance on the same period last year. However, net income was reduced by a pre-tax charge of Dollars 16.3m linked to a special charge to cover costs related to silicone breast implants at Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture between Corning and Dow Chemical. As a result, Corning had net income of Dollars 72.1m, or 38 cents, against Dollars 75.9m, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Sales in the period rose 19 per cent to Dollars 926.7m from Dollars 778.2m. For the first half, Corning had net income of Dollars 150.2m, or 79 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.72bn. The results compare with earnings of Dollars 124.3m, or 67 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.47bn a year earlier.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 6 Feb -- The State of Kuwait tonight  strongly denounced and condemned the savage massacre perpetrated  by the Serb forces against innocent civilians in Sarajevo  yesterday, which left a large number of the people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina dead or wounded.    Kuwait reaffirmed its support and backing of the people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and its readiness to receive more of the sick  and wounded to offer them medical care. This was stated at a  meeting of the council of ministers held tonight under the  chairmanship of Shaykh Sa'd al-Abdallah al-Salim al-Sabah, the  heir apparent and council of ministers chairman.    In a press statement after the meeting, Minister of State  for  Cabinet Affairs 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dakhil said that the Kuwaiti  Council of Ministers had called on the UN Security Council's  member countries, the Islamic Conference Organization, and all  the international organizations and bodies to intervene  immediately to stop the genocidal operations to which the people  of Bosnia- Herzegovina were being subjected and to take the  necessary measures to end that regrettable and tragic situation.    The council of ministers expressed its confidence and  satisfaction at the U.S. stance, expressed in a report submitted  by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Congress, regarding  the strict conditions that the Iraqi regime must implement  [tanfidhiha] for any easing of the sanctions. Topping the list  of these conditions was the release of POW's and hostages,  recognizing the demarcation of the Kuwait-Iraq border, and  respecting Kuwait's independence and sovereignty.    The council stressed that the U.S. stance was identical to  that of the international community in its insistence on making  the Iraqi regime yield to UN resolutions, forcing it to respect  international law, and aborting all its attempts to have the  siege lifted until all the Security Council's resolutions  accepted after the cease-fire in the Kuwait liberation war were  implemented.    Minister al-Dakhil said that the council of ministers  approved a draft law on adding a new paragraph to Article 7 of  Emiri Decree 15 of 1959 regarding the Kuwaiti nationality law.  The article stipulates that children born to a naturalized  Kuwaiti after he obtained Kuwaiti nationality are to be  considered native Kuwaitis. The provision of the paragraph added  to the aforesaid article applies to those born before the  introduction of this law.    He added that the council decided to approve the draft law  and referred it to the National Assembly.    Furthermore, the council examined a number of other topics  on  its agenda and made appropriate decisions regarding them.</p>

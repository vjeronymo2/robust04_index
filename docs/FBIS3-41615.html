			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Twenty-five tonnes of nuclear fuel waste have been  sent to Chelyabinsk-65 by the Finnish company Imatran Voima OY.  This is the 11th delivery of the deadly freight from the  company engaged in nuclear waste disposal. The Mayak production  association has already received 200 tonnes of waste. According  to a Norwegian ecological organization, there are about 30  tonnes of plutonium at Mayak's stores. Russian authorities have  told the international organization Greenpeace that Mayak does  not have the necessary licence entitling it to reprocess this  specific material, and therefore the International Atomic Energy  Association does not consider itself responsible for supervizing  the reprocessing of waste. This report was supplied by the  European-Asian News Agency.</p>

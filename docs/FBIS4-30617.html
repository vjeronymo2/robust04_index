			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Focus: Yen's Renewed Surge May Threaten Firms' </F> Restructuring"]    [Text] Tokyo, June 26 KYODO -- The renewed strength of the  yen is likely to obstruct corporate Japan from pushing ahead  with restructuring prompted in part by the protracted recession  and in part by persistent appreciation of the yen.    Japanese industry views the current rise of the yen as a  "temporary phenomenon."    Corporate Japan appears still confident that the economy  will  head for a substantial recovery in the latter half of the  current fiscal year which started in April.    But it is also certain that the dollar's slide to below 100  yen in New York trading last Tuesday [21 June] chilled business  and consumer confidence, coming as it did at a time when  Japanese businesses have started embarking on full-scale  restructuring.    Despite concerted market interventions by the central banks  of the United States and major European countries late last  week, the dollar failed to regain strength in New York.    The Smokestack Steel Industry in Japan is struggling to  bolster its structure that has long been vulnerable to foreign  exchange movements.    Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel  Federation, says, "The steel industry seems to have hit bottom,"  citing an upturn in crude steel production, higher steel prices  in international markets and steady growth in exports.    On the domestic front as well, the steel industry stands to  benefit from a fledgling pickup of its main user, the automotive  industry.    "We can compete with our overseas rivals if the yen stays  around 110 to the dollar," says Reiji Nakato, managing director  of Kawasaki Steel Corp.    There is a danger of the yen's renewed surge putting a drag  on steel manufacturers' cost-cutting, restructuring efforts,  however.    Says Yoshiro Sasaki, vice president of Nippon Steel Corp.,  "The effect of restructuring will weaken if we fail to achieve  production targets. Moreover, we're concerned about a possible  cooling-off in consumer confidence."    In order to keep consumer sentiment from cooling, Japan  needs  to take measures immediately to pass benefits from a high yen on  to consumers and rectify its external trade imbalances, he says.    In the 1980s, Japanese consumers benefited from a strong yen  in a limited number of areas, with prices of consumer goods  remaining high relative to those abroad.    The yen's rapid rise was touched off by the 1985 Plaza  Accord  reached among finance ministers of the Group of Five (G-5)  industrial powers.    Of late, however, a price gap between Japan and overseas has  been narrowing.    An official of major supermarket operator Seiyu Ltd. says,  "domestic prices will go down further," expressing a readiness  to join in efforts to push down prices by taking advantage of  the yen's appreciation.    Meanwhile, electrical machinery and automobile manufacturers  are stepping up "transplant" production by shifting output to  their overseas footholds.    Toyota Motor Corp. has raised the ratio of overseas  production to the total output to 40 percent. The largest  Japanese automaker is to discontinue exports of small trucks to  the United States next January and churn out such trucks  entirely in that country.    But industry analysts point out that it seems hard for  lower-ranked car manufacturers to boost overseas operations  because of weaker financial positions.    An auto industry official predicts the yen's unabated  strength will bring into bold relief the mixed performances of  automakers.    Performance gaps between companies and industries are  expected to widen for the coming years if the yen stays high.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Charity funds for Tories attacked THE Charity Commission has backed a complaint about a registered charity's funding of the Conservative party in elections for Westminster City Council. Mr Andrew Dismore, leader of the Labour opposition on the council, complained to the commission about the Foundation for Business Responsibilities making payments to Marketforce Communications, a public-relations company. The company was employed by Westminster council's Conservatives to promote their party before the May 1990 local elections, in which the Tories increased their majority over Labour on the council. The commission's rules bar charities from engaging in political activities. The foundation was established in 1972 as an educational trust. In a letter to Mr Dismore, the commission said the charity paid more than Pounds 98,000 to Marketforce, and the payment infringed charity rules. The money has been repaid to the charity by its trustees, although yesterday it was still not clear where the refund came from. Mr Dismore said yesterday that he was seeking an Inland Revenue investigation into the foundation to discover if it has breached laws concerning tax relief for charities. He has also written to Dame Shirley Porter, the Conservative leader of the council at the time of the payments, asking for clarification of her involvement with the use of the charity's funds for politically motivated public-relations work for her party. A representative of Dame Shirley, who is abroad on holiday, yesterday denied that she had any connection with the foundation.</p>

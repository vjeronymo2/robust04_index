			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela takes coup attempt in its stride - High domestic liquidity has helped the Caracas exchange to recover Even an attempted coup earlier this month failed to do any lasting damage to confidence on the Caracas Stock Exchange. The stock market was closed during the failed military uprising against the government of President Carlos Andres Perez on February 4. When trading resumed on February 6, the Caracas Stock Exchange index fell by more than 9 per cent over the next four trading days. But since then the market has recovered. The index closed at 34,142 in nominal terms on February 3, a rise of 16.5 per cent from the end of 1991. Some investors - mostly individuals - sold shares in the wake of the military uprising, but there was no panic. On February 24, the index closed at 31,378, an increase of 7 per cent since the end of December. However, the stock market has not performed so well in dollar terms, notes Mr Federico Laffan at the London-based Latin American Securities Limited, because of the fall in the bolivar against the dollar. The index in dollar terms closed at 548.6 on February 3, a rise of 15.4 per cent since the end of December, but ended at 480.1 on Monday, just 1 per cent higher than at the end of 1991. Mr Laffan says that while the stock market was not ruffled by the failed coup, the foreign exchange market tells a different story. The bolivar has fallen to 65.4 against the dollar from 62.2 just before the uprising as Venezuelans switched into the safety of the dollar or took their funds out of the country. The swift crushing of the coup, the first in Venezuela since the early 1960s, has helped maintain confidence in the stock market. Moreover, the government has pledged to continue its three-year old economic reform programme, in spite of its broad unpopularity. Reforms initiated in 1989 produced a sharp decline in economic growth that year, and had caused a painful fall in living standards. The programme generated 5.3 per cent GDP growth in 1990 and an expansion of 9.2 per cent last year, the highest growth rate in Latin America. But the country still suffers from inflation, which stood at 30.7 per cent last year. The Caracas Stock Exchange, which rose 34.3 per cent in dollar terms in 1991 after a huge 555 per cent jump in 1990, continues to attract domestic and foreign attention, especially in the latter case, from emerging market funds. Venezuelan investors - both individual and institutional - have been drawn to the stock market because of high domestic liquidity, caused by falling rates on certificates of deposit and other fixed income instruments and lower US interest rates. Trading this year has been brisk, even though the exchange offers only a dozen or so active shares. According to Mr Alex Dalmady, president of a Caracas advisory firm InvestAnalysis: 'Demand for shares has been growing, but supply has not. Therefore, prices have inevitably climbed to new heights. Quick profits are feeding the frenzy.' Mr Dalmady feels that stock prices are high 'by most yardsticks', with price/earnings multiples for 15 financials averaging 24 and for the 21 industrial stocks 35 at the end of January. Share supply has increased in one area, however, as industrial companies place their shares abroad and at home via American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) or Shares and Global Deposit Shares (GDSs). Sivensa, the country's largest private steel maker, was the first Venezuelan company to enter the ADR market, placing its shares in the US in 1991. Since then other companies - including Corimon, a diversified industrial group, and Venepal, a paper producer - have also placed shares abroad. One sign of continuing investor confidence in Venezuelan equities was the successful international and domestic placing of 2.6m GDSs by Corimon, during the abortive uprising. Each GDS is worth 25 Class B Corimon shares. Foreign listings are also likely to increase. Madosa, Venezuela's leading producer of domestic appliances, last year became the first foreign company to be listed on the Caracas Exchange. The exchange, which recently moved into new headquarters, still continues to be plagued by problems such as back office bottlenecks and lack of computerised systems. The market remains relatively small, and a trade of Dollars 500,000 to Dollars 1m can have a strong effect on prices. Trading in 1991 totalled Dollars 2.3bn, up from Dollars 2.1bn in 1990.</p>

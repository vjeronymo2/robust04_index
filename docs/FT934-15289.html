			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK wins opt-out on labour law: EC concession on young workers lifts government hopes on investment THE British government last night predicted that multinationals in Europe might move their operations to the UK to save costs, after Britain won a six-year opt-out from legislation to protect young people at work. But Britain failed to prevent the 11 from deciding to go ahead with plans for the mandatory introduction of elected works councils in companies that operate in more than one country. The compulsory introduction of works councils comes under the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. The treaty was finally ratified by Germany yesterday after the country's federal constitutional court removed the last legal hurdle to its approval. Mr David Hunt, UK employment secretary, claimed victory on all fronts. In spite of Britain's isolation, he said: 'We are turning the tide in Europe.' He added: 'In private, many of my (EC) ministerial colleagues agree with me.' He said of the opt-out from the main provisions of the young workers' directive: 'We have won a victory for newspaper boys.' On works councils, he said Britain had refused to accept 'an alien model of compulsory consultation' of workers on investment, relocation and jobs plans. He was backed by Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, who said in a letter to Mr Hunt that it would 'impose a rigid and bureaucratic procedure for informing and consulting'. Mr John Monks, the TUC's general secretary, disagreed, saying the UK government had 'lost the argument' over the issue. 'The works council directive will sooner or later apply in Britain,' he said. 'The era of the British veto is over. This is good news for British workers and the whole country.' The British government's resistance to the introduction of the working hours directive for young people stems from its general belief that the EC will add unnecessarily to the cost burdens on business by introducing inflexibility into labour market regulation in giving protection to young people aged 16 and 17 who have left school. Mr Hunt predicted that 'there may well be companies that decide to concentrate more of their activities in the UK,' a provocative remark in view of controversy that the UK is gaining unfair advantage in investment by staying outside EC social and employment regulations. German, Dutch and French officials poured scorn on the idea of a mass industrial exodus from the Continent to the UK. 'But you can be sure the Council (of Ministers of the 12) will react if any such thing were to happen,' a German official said. The object of the directive is to regulate the number of hours and the conditions of work for children (up to the age of 15) and adolescents (from 15 to 18 years). The EC works councils directive, obliging companies with more than 1,000 workers in more than one member state to consult and provide information to elected workers' representatives on the German and, increasingly, French model, will now be put forward again under Maastricht's social chapter for the 11. More than 100 British companies in continental Europe would fall under the rules, which the UK will now be powerless to shape. In addition, multinationals based in Britain and on the Continent may face demands from their workers to offer the same consultation rights in the UK as in the rest of the EC.

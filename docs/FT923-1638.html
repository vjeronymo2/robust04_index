			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Markets weaken on narrow result in referendum EUROPEAN government bond markets weakened yesterday on disappointment that the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty had resulted in only a narrow majority in favour. The result was seen as prolonging uncertainty over the future course of European monetary union and did little to ease tensions within the exchange rate mechanism. French government bonds fell 1 1/2 points from the peaks on Sunday night in the immediate aftermath of the vote. However, 10-year bonds finished only marginally down on Friday's closing levels. The 10-year benchmark bond closed on a yield of 8.62 per cent, from 8.57 per cent on Friday. The narrow margin in favour of Maastricht left the franc under pressure on the foreign exchange markets and investors remained nervous that the French currency could still be devalued within the ERM. The franc closed at FFr3.42 against the German currency, against a floor in the ERM of FFr3.4305. The Bank of France left its money market intervention rate unchanged at 9.6 per cent. Some traders had been anticipating a small cut in rates if the referendum resulted in a vote in favour of Maastricht. However, any easing of monetary conditions is unlikely until the franc climbs further above its ERM floor. GERMAN government bonds traded lower as the French referendum result killed off hopes of an interest rate cut by the Bundesbank. Traders said the bund market had been overbought at the end of last week on hopes of an easing in German rates. If France had rejected European economic and monetary union on Sunday, the Bundesbank might have lowered rates to help support the French Franc. However, given the small majority in favour of the Maastricht treaty, the Bundesbank looks less likely to lower interest rates. Bunds suffered heavy selling pressure, especially longer-dated issues, resulting in a flattening of the yield curve. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, told reporters in Washington that the central bank's policy-making council would review German interest rates at its meeting next week, but dealers remained sceptical about whether this would lead to an easing. The Bundesbank cut its discount and Lombard rates at the beginning of last week to reduce tensions in the ERM. The bund futures contract opened at 90.75 and fell to a low of 90.41 before ending at around 90.72. Traders said the market will be watching the August money supply figures which are due to be released this week. M3 money supply for August is expected to show growth of about 8.5 per cent, unchanged on the July figure. UK GOVERNMENT bonds continued to rally at the shorter maturities yesterday, but gilts fell back sharply at the long end on fears of renewed inflationary pressures in the economy. The 9 per cent bond maturing 2008, the benchmark long-dated gilt, fell over 1 1/2 points. The stock closed at 98 1/32 for a yield of 9.23 per cent. In contrast, the 12 per cent gilt maturing 1995 closed up  1/3 of a point on the day for a yield of 8.6 per cent. Analysts are anticipating Thursday's parliamentary debate on the economy, at which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, is expected to outline plans for the future conduct of monetary policy. Mr Lamont has indicated that he would return to a policy based on the targeting of monetary aggregates rather than exchange rates. In addition to fears about inflation, long-dated gilts prices were also depressed by fears that overseas investors will desert the market now that sterling is floating outside the ERM. The government may have to fund the public sector borrowing requirement at higher yields if domestic institutions are the only substantial buyers of gilts. The sharp rally in shorter maturity stocks since sterling was suspended from the exchange rate mechanism last Wednesday means that short-dated gilt yields are lower than long-dated yields for the first time since 1988, when base lending rates were cut briefly to 7 1/2 per cent. The gilt yield curve was last 'disinverted' for a protracted period in the early 1980s. The rally in short-dated stocks reflects hopes that interest rates will be cut sharply to stimulate economic activity. The December short sterling contract on Liffe traded at around 91.65, implying base lending rates of 8.35 per cent by the year end against a current rate of 10 per cent. This view was also reflected in the interbank loans market, where three-month funds were trading at 9 7/16  - 9 5/16 per cent. EUROPE'S traditional high-yielding markets  - Spain and Italy  - weakened on disappointment over the outcome of the French referendum. The small Yes majority and resulting pressure on the French franc has dashed hopes of lower interest rates in France and Germany, which means that the Italian and Spanish currencies will remain under pressure. Dealers speculated that the lira would probably be devalued further before re-entering the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. SWEDISH government bonds fell sharply as the market ignored the government's sweeping austerity package  - announced on Sunday  - and the cut in the marginal lending rate yesterday from 500 per cent to 50 per cent. Traders said the SKr40bn budget-cutting programme was viewed with some disappointment by the market, as the government had already publicised its intention to cut spending. Domestic and foreign investors took profits yesterday and yields closed higher. Yields on three-month treasury bills climbed from 18 per cent to 27 per cent, while the yield on the 10.25 per cent bond due 2003 rose to 11.55 per cent from 10.75 per cent at Friday's close. Adding to the poor sentiment, yesterday's auction of nine-year bonds saw poor interest: SKr5.5bn of bonds were offered but only SKr5.23bn were sold. UNCERTAINTY surrounding events in Europe in the wake of the French weekend vote and concern about this week's trial version of Dutch auctions in the sale of two and five-year notes left Treasury prices slightly lower across the board yesterday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  7/32 at 98 13/16 , to yield 7.343 per cent. The two-year note was down  1/8 at 100, to carry a yield of 3.861 per cent. Although analysts had expected the markets to receive a boost if the French voted in favour of Maastricht, the close nature of the referendum, with 51 per cent voting Yes and 49 per cent No, failed to clear up the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic integration in Europe. Consequently, many investors chose to stay on the sidelines yesterday, and prices slipped lower in very light trading. Market participants were also cautious ahead of the Treasury auctions, in which the government plans to experiment with a new method of selling its securities in which all bidders will receive their securities at a single price.</p>

It was learned that as a first step in this context, Syria  has forced Apo to leave Damascus and that the PKK leader is in  the Lebanese capital, Beirut.    [Begin unidentified reporter recording] It is a known fact  that Syria does not want to lose its PKK trump card against  Turkey. However, Hafiz al-Asad, who wants to integrate with the  West and who openly expressed this intention to Clinton, is  expected to further hem in on Apo. According to available  information, Syria took its first step on this issue recently  and forced PKK leader Apo to leave for the Lebanese capital of  Beirut. Apo currently is being kept under control in Beirut.    Considering Syria's influence on Lebanon, however, it  appears  that al-Asad will not give up its Apo and PKK trump cards, at  least until he gets Turkey's consent for an agreement on river  water.    Sending Apo off to Beirut is perceived by Ankara as an  indication of goodwill from the Damascus government. However,  Ankara believes Damascus has to take more positive steps.  Ankara is now getting ready to launch a diplomatic offensive in  Washington to further pressure Damascus on the PKK and Apo.  [end recording]</p>

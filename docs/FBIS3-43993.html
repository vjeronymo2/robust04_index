Some condemned prisoners,  who have served more than 10 years as at 7 January this year,  are to have their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. The  list excludes armed robbers convicted to death. Others to  benefit from the amnesty are persons condemned to death for  economic sabotage, who are to have their sentences reduced to  fifteen years.    Some prisoners serving life imprisonment, who have served at  least 10 years as at 7 January, are to have their sentences  reduced to 20 years. This excludes armed robbers. Some  prisoners serving sentences of 20 years and more, who have  already served five years, are to have their sentences reduced  by one-third. They exclude armed robbers and those convicted of  drug trafficking and rape. A number of first and second  offenders who have served half of their sentences are to be  released on parole and would be obliged to undertake community  service. The details will be implemented by the Ministry of the  Interior. Those in this category do not include persons  convicted for murder, manslaughter, rape, armed robbery, and  drug trafficking.    A number of prisoners who are considered seriously ill and  those sixty years of age are also to be released. This list  excludes those serving sentences for rape, murder, manslaughter,  armed robbery, and drug trafficking.    An official statement restated that the general amnesty  granted to all Ghanaian citizens in voluntary exile outside the  country is still open. The only exceptions are persons  convicted of any criminal offense or declared wanted by the  police for any criminal offense, and persons convicted and  sentenced to death by any court or tribunal. It urged persons  who wish to take advantage of the amnesty to apply to the  minister of the interior or to the Ghanaian diplomatic mission  nearest to their places of residence with the relevant  information, including the date on which they left the country.  It is noted that a number of persons have already taken  advantage of the amnesty and returned home.</p>

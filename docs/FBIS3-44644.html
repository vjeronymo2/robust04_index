			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Economic Jottings" by Mu Zi (2606 1311): "`Legal Evasion </F> of Taxes' Is Illegal"]    [Text] According to ZHONGGUO SHUIWU BAO [0022 0948 4451  0523 1032 -- CHINA TAX JOURNAL], some strange phenomena, such as  "legal tax evasion training class" and "lectures on legal tax  evasion," have appeared in society recently. Some books on  "legal tax evasion" also have been published. What a strange  thing! How can "tax evasion" be "legal?"    As a matter of fact, the so-called "legal tax evasion" is  aimed at instructing tax evaders to pay less tax or no tax at  all under the pretext of "legality." In the final analysis, it  is aimed at instigating people to violate the law.    In China, with the development of reform and opening up, the  contradictions between tax evasion and the struggle against tax  evasion are growing day by day. The phenomenon of tax evasion  has appeared in both domestic and foreign-owned enterprises, but  more frequently in the latter.    Of course, this does not mean that all foreign-owned  enterprises have evaded taxes. Many of them have been doing  well in this respect, but quite a few of them have tried to  evade taxes by all means in the links, such as signing  contracts, providing funds, carrying out production and  management, purchasing equipment and materials, and selling  products. This is also a fact. The main method they have used  is to transfer profit and let the enterprises suffer "losses."  Checking their accounts, we find that the losses suffered by  some foreign-owned enterprises in some areas are more than 50  percent of their investment. Ridiculously, very few such  enterprises have closed down because of these losses. Some  foreign- owned enterprises that are suffering "losses" have even  continued to increase investment despite such losses. These  abnormal phenomena merely show that their "losses" are not real  and that what they are doing is precisely to evade taxes. By  doing so, the "tax evaders" have earned greater profits, but the  interests of the state have been harmed.    To absorb foreign funds and implement a preferential tax  policy toward foreign-owned enterprises is a policy we have  adopted since reform and opening up. The purpose is to promote  cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit. If the enterprises  play tricks and try to evade taxes at the expense of the public  interest, further cooperation between the two sides certainly  will be harmed. This is not only a practice to which we are  opposed, but also a practice that is not tolerated under  international law.    Over the past few years, China's tax departments have  studied  the experience and practice of other countries in opposing tax  evasion. Gradually, and in light of China's realities, they have  worked out and perfected some laws, regulations, and methods, as  well as a series of measures to fight tax evasion. It is  necessary to run training classes on fighting tax evasion and to  explain the relevant articles of the "Law of the People's  Republic of China on Tax Levy and Administration" to those who  try to evade tax payments "legally" so they can remember that it  is illegal to "evade tax payments legally." It is also  necessary for the departments concerned to check those people  who are instigating others to "legally" violate the law, to see  what kind of people they are.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] If Israel prevents working meetings by French  diplomats at East Jerusalem's Orient House, France will, in  reaction, restrict the meetings of its representatives with  Israeli representatives in Jerusalem. This was made clear by a  senior French Foreign Ministry official in a meeting held at  Israel's Embassy in Paris. Our political correspondent  'Imanu'el Rosen reports that Jerusalem is concerned by the  increasing Palestinian pressure, exerted through foreign  countries, for the achievement of a political status in  Jerusalem.</p>

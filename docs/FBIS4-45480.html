			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Bento Amaro] </F>   [Text] Real estate, hotel establishments, casinos,  lotteries, and the purchase of objects made of gold and other  precious metals are the main destinations of the money laundered  in Portugal. There are currently 20 proceedings related to the  "laundering" of money originating in the drug traffic. There  have been no detentions, nor even dates set for trials.    According to a Criminal Investigations Police [PJ] official,  most (nearly half) of the laundering cases are associated with  the Lisbon area. The industrialized zones in the north and the  Algarve recreational areas are other sites mentioned in the  proceedings.    The same police source also notes that, in the respective  proceedings, the amount of money laundered is unknown. However,  when one observes the sectors chosen for its application (gold,  hotels, casinos, etc.), it is not difficult to conclude that  "the sums of money involved are too large for the local  environment."    One of the main ventures of the individuals engaged in money  laundering in Portugal is the purchase of lottery tickets.  According to the agents from the Central Directorate for  Narcotics Trafficking Investigation (this being the section  dealing with all laundering cases, since all those known are  associated with the drug traffic), the method consists of  purchasing large numbers of whole tickets at prices slightly  higher than those stipulated. There is almost always a guarantee  of profits accrued by whoever sells them.    In the case of the casinos, the money is "blended" through  the purchase of chips, which are later exchanged for cash.  "`Dirty' money is used to purchase chips, and then, after a few  bets, the same chips are exchanged for money; and, at some  point, the player no longer has any illegally procured assets."  The police call this rotation "blending." There are also some  who illustrate the operation by using the example of a sausage  stuffing machine: "The pork enters at one end, and the sausages  emerge from the other. When the operation is finished, there is  always meat."    As for the nationalities of those involved in the  proceedings  that are under way, although the majority are Portuguese, there  are also individuals born or settled in "other European  countries (heroin trafficking cases) and on other continents  (South Americans connected with the cocaine business)."  <H5>  Trials Could Take Years </H5>   The absence of detained persons and, particularly, the  uncertainty regarding when the first trials for laundering can  begin, are justified by the late date on which Portugal obtained  proper legislation. It was not until 15 September of last year  that a Community directive issuing regulations pertaining to  this crime was adopted.    The slowness of the proceedings is also attributed, by  Criminal Investigations Police officials, to the fact that the  suspects identified to date are individuals of considerable  means. Therefore, "they have sufficient financial capacity to  engage the best lawyers, thus achieving foot-dragging in the  procedures, through funds and more funds."    The Portuguese proceedings and law relating to money  laundering are, moreover, included among the topics for  discussion during the seminar to be held at Vilamoura from 29  May to 2 June. Besides the Portuguese police, officials from the  Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) stationed in Madrid, and  police from Spain, Gibraltar, Andorra, Italy, and probably  Sweden, will be present at the meeting.    Contrary to previous reports, the International Seminar on  Money Laundering is not the Portuguese authorities' first  attempt to deal with the problem. In fact, last year the issue  prompted several meetings between the PJ and other police forces  affiliated with Interpol.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): New York continues to lift continent A FIRM start on Wall Street propelled bourses higher for the second day but trading remained thin as investors stuck to the sidelines, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT registered its biggest one-day gain in a month, the DAX index closing 32.96 or 2.3 per cent higher at 1,465.50. But turnover rose only slightly to DM3.8bn from DM3.3bn and trading logistics, rather than an improvement in sentiment, were given credit for the rise. The tendency to move upwards, prompted traders to cover short positions and this had an exaggerated effect in an illiquid market. Major moves among international blue chips, Volkswagen rising DM13.20 to DM270.70 and Bayer by DM7.50 to DM249.70, were a clawback from VW's underperformance in the third quarter and the chemical industry favourite's exaggerated response to a hazardous materials scare on Monday. Thyssen put on DM11.90 to DM169.50, also after a poor third quarter. Deutsche Babcock rose DM9.10 to DM137.80 for a two-day gain of 10 per cent, after a newspaper interview on Monday in which Babcock's chairman said the company's performance in the year to September 30 had beaten expectations . AMSTERDAM featured KNP which fell sharply following its announcement after Monday's close that it expected net profit to fall to Fl 100m from Fl 294.7m in 1991, because of a disappointing third quarter and unfavourable prospects for the fourth quarter. The CBS Tendency index finished 0.4 lower at 107.1. KNP initially tumbled 20 per cent to an intraday low of Fl 31.60 but recovered slightly in the afternoon to close down Fl 6.50 at Fl 33.00. Other paper stocks weakened on the KNP news, with Buhrmann-Tetterode shedding Fl 3.10 to Fl 30.80. Fokker also attracted sellers following another unconfirmed report that Dasa might withdraw from its proposed takeover. The shares fell to a day's low of Fl 15.60 before recovering to close up 50 cents at Fl 17.00. PARIS rose steadily during the day and closed at the day's high but trading remained thin. The market was lifted by bargain-hunting in blue-chips and by the firmer start on Wall Street. The CAC-40 index closed up 30.04 or 1.8 per cent at 1,685.09 in modest turnover of FFr1.3bn. Euro Disney was one of the day's most prominent risers, adding FFr4.80 or 6.9 per cent to FFr74.70 on news of better-than-expected attendance figures for September. Among second-line stocks, Valeo was in demand, rising FFr29 to FFr630. The company held a meeting with analysts yesterday. ZURICH saw its big price changes in second line stocks as the SMI index rose 12.1 to 1,893.6. In the forefront was a SFr35 rise to SFr805 in Swiss Volksbank, up SFr145, or 22 per cent over the past five trading days. Mr Jeremy Silewicz at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said that Volksbank had underperformed this year and that rumours of a takeover bid had had an accordingly electric effect on the share price. Otherwise, after a strong market performance this year, investors were looking beyond the obvious blue chips to extend their Swiss portfolios. MILAN came off early lows as share prices staged a late recovery. Trading was technical ahead of the close of the account today. The Comit index ended 2.57 lower at 394.28 in turnover estimated at between L150-200bn. Fiat settled down L81 at L4,100 but rose in after-hours trading to L4,400 and Generali, fixed L520 lower at L27,610, picked up later to L28,400. There was still some downward pressure on Ras ahead of its rights issue, which starts tomorrow, the first day of the new account. The shares lost L10 to L14,890. Avir, which was suspended limit-down on Monday, remained suspended yesterday pending an announcement from the company. MADRID paid little attention to the better-than-expected CPI data which showed an increase of 0.9 per cent in September and the general index lost 1.28 to 192.68 in low volume. STOCKHOLM was lifted by firm foreign bourses. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 10.5 to 675.8 in turnover of SKr264m after SKr213m. Astra was the session's most active issue with combined turnover of about SKr47m for both classes of shares. The A shares rose SKr12 to SKr517 while the B shares rose SKr9 to SKr506. BRUSSELS was led higher by insurance shares which rose in response to last week's cut in domestic interest rates. The Bel-20 index closed 7.3 higher at 1,099.84 in turnover of BFr648m. Leading insurer AG closed BFr25 or 1.3 per cent higher at BFr1,970. VIENNA was encouraged by OMV's forecasts of good profit growth this year and its announcement of a new North Sea oil find. The ATX index rose 8.15 to 778.67 while OMV improved Sch11 to Sch680.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 13                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          Open     11.30     12.00   13.00     14.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    990.30   991.02    991.71   993.87    994.41 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1076.57  1076.89   1078.88  1079.57   1078.24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                  15.00        16.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100            994.05       998.58     999.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1079.23      1086.88    1085.38  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Oct 12     Oct 9     Oct 8     Oct 7     Oct 6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   984.55    987.08    986.33    971.05    954.29 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1069.79   1070.52   1060.95   1052.71   1035.93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 -999.62; 200 -1087.11 Low/day: 100 -990.14  200 -1076.48  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

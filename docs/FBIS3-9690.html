This  is a new position in these talks and neither the Christian  Democrats nor the Social Democrats have ever championed this  position so far.    It is also rather nonpolitical to say that the Social  Democrats equal Janez Jansa. The Social Democrats were given an  opportunity to take part in the government. Now, whether they  will decide for cooperation or not is another matter. However,  the fact is that whenever somebody has been replaced so far,  parties did not leave the government coalition because of it.  Woe to those parties that are prisoners of the ambitions of  their presidents! [end recording]</p>

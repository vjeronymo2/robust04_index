			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Grassroots role was decisive: A look at the battles behind yesterday's announcement When the government set out to privatise the nation's forests, the group of civil servants set up to review the Forestry Commission's role received thousands of letters from the public, most of them opposed to a sell-off. It is this overwhelming public opposition which appears to have been the main factor that persuaded the government to abandon the idea, at least for the time being. Environmental organisations, walkers' groups and private-sector timber growers all weighed in with protests. Among the few advocates were the forestry management groups that stood to gain from a wholesale shift of woodlands into private hands. 'The level of opposition right across the spectrum was more than they expected,' said one industry observer. With a raft of other thorny measures under way, such as the introduction of value added tax on fuel and the reorganisation of local government, ministers felt a highly unpopular measure involving the 1.1m hectares of public forests would be ill-timed, especially if it affected traditional Tory voters in the countryside. Privatisation would also have required legislation, creating the potential for a messy parliamentary process. Chief among the concerns expressed by the public was that access to woodland would be impeded - or blocked altogether - if private landowners took over. Three former senior commission executives said a forced sale might raise only Pounds 500m while additional costs to the Treasury in lost timber sales and grants for planting could rise to Pounds 83m a year by 2010. The commission's lack of financial transparency - one of the government's reasons for seeking radical change - also proved in the end to be a reason for postponing privatisation. Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary and an ardent free marketeer, is understood to have argued against the Treasury's push for a sell-off on the grounds that the commission's management and accounting practices first had to be modernised. The internal government debate on privatisation was complicated by disagreements between ministers. Responsibility for the nation's forests is divided between the Scottish Office, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in London, and the Welsh Office. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, are believed to have opposed privatisation, arguing that it would be unpopular. They also felt the commission, reorganised into separate commercial and regulatory arms as recently as 1992, was beginning to prove itself in better shape, with the prospect of break-even this year or next. It is thought those in favour of a sell-off were the Treasury, anxious to hold down public spending; Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, who wanted the commission to be made more efficient; and, until recently, Mr Redwood. Tensions between cabinet colleagues were exacerbated by a long-standing distrust of the Forestry Commission by ministers and Whitehall officials. Although the commission is the government's forestry department, it is run by a government-appointed board of commissioners which has contributed to diluting ministerial control. Mr Redwood, for one, is understood to have wanted three separate 'next steps' agencies for England, Wales and Scotland to be created out of Forest Enterprise, the commission's commercial arm, in order to improve the commercial output of the forests under his control. The question of eventual privatisation remains un-resolved. Most of the forests were planted after the 1930s and many are only now reaching maturity. It is thought some ministers believe privatisation would be more successful once those forests are fully productive. 'It's an open question as to whether they're being fattened up for privatisation,' said an industry observer. 'Quite a lot of these executive agencies are. Is this one? It's clearly not happening at this stage, however.'</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Italian market calms after post-election slide ITALIAN government bonds levelled off after Monday's slide as the full results of this week's elections confirmed the weak position of the ruling coalition. Given the instability of Italian politics, a small majority of seats in the chamber of deputies was seen as inadequate to produce a stable government. Further elections could follow later in the year. The news prompted mixed views in the bond market. On the one hand, the lack of a decisive result was seen as the prelude to another weak government, one which was unlikely to get to grips with the country's dire fiscal position. That makes it less likely that Italy will meet the Maastricht conditions for economic convergence in the short term, postponing any greater convergence with other European bond markets. Optimists, however, claimed the result would hasten an overhaul of the Italian political establishment. In a heavy day on Liffe, with more than 23,000 contracts traded, the Italian bond future was trading at 97.83 late, close to its closing levels of the day before. At a yield equivalent of 12.68 per cent (gross of withholding tax), Italian bonds are now around 4 2/3 percentage points above their German counterparts. UK government bonds gained confidence as sterling strengthened, helping the long gilt future on Liffe to climb back up close to 94 for the first time in a week. The market has settled on the view that this week's elections will fail to provide an absolute majority. Against this background, the better news from foreign exchange markets reduced some fears that sterling would come under pressure after the election, helping bonds to recover and providing an opportunity for some profit-taking during the afternoon. The long gilt future, which opened at 93 3/8 , was trading at 93 29/32 late, a gain of around half a point. The gains were also reflected in the cash market, with the 9 per cent benchmark bond maturing in 2011 gaining  5/16 of a point on the day to close at 94 5/16 , for a yield of 9.65 per cent. Among 10-year bonds, the 9 3/4 per cent bonds due 2002 gained a third of a point, to close on a yield of 9.92 per cent. US Treasury prices firmed at both ends of the maturity range as trading remained light ahead of today's auction of seven-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  3/16 at 101 11/32 , yielding 7.876 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  5/32 at 100 27/32 , yielding 5.278 per cent. As on Monday, investors were cautious about committing themselves to the market before today's sale of Dollars 9.75bn in seven-year notes. Prices at the long end had been lower as players made room on their books for the new securities, but the continued sluggishness of the economic recovery and hopes for an easing of monetary policy helped bonds recover the lost ground. The short end, meanwhile, was aided by expectations that the maturation of cash bills next week will trigger a shift of cash into shorter-dated government securities. GERMAN government bonds continued their gains of Monday - but only after a rumour, later denied, that a compromise had been reached over the public sector pay dispute. Late in the day, the yield on 10-year bunds fell further, to 7.92 per cent, from a high of around 7.95 per cent on the day - a firm move back below 8 per cent for the first time for three weeks. On Liffe, bund futures climbed from an opening of 87.77 to 87.94 late. AFTER the government support given to the Japanese bond market on Monday, and with a stronger yen, the market in Japanese government bonds opened firmly in Tokyo. However the shakiness of recent days quickly returned as Japanese share prices tumbled yet again, this time taking the Nikkei average to below 18,000 by the end of the day. The bond market has failed to take heart from the battering share prices have taken, as logic suggests it should. Instead, fears about the yen and pervasive gloom in Tokyo, together with a feeling that the official discount rate will not be cut further, have helped fuel selling in recent days. The yield on the benchmark bond no 129, which opened at 5.575 per cent, closed at around 5.645 per cent. During the London trading day, prices slipped further, pushing the yield up to 5.67 per cent, before reverting to around its Tokyo close.</p>

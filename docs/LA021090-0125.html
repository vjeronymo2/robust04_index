			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD;  </P> <P> MILE, 1,500 MARKS FALL TO MELINTE  </P> <P> Romanian Doina Melinte smashed world indoor records in the women's 1,500 meters  and the mile, but Britain's Peter Elliott fell just short in his attempt to  break those marks in men's events Friday night in the Meadowlands Invitational  track and field meet.  </P> <P> Melinte, 33, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist at 800 meters and the silver  medalist in the 1,500, ran the second half of the mile almost by herself after  Brit Lind-Peterson of Canada dropped out after setting the pace for about 800  meters.  </P> <P> Melinte, intent on earning the $100,000 that was being awarded to any runner  breaking the world record in the mile, finished in 4 minutes 17.13 seconds. She  was clocked in 4:00.27 for 1,500 meters.  </P> <P> Melinte had held the mile record of 4:18.86, set in 1988 on the fast,  10-laps-to-the-mile Meadowlands track. The previous record for the 1,500 was  4:00.8, set by Mary Decker Slaney of the United States in 1980 at Madison  Square Garden in New York.  </P> <P> "I expect to keep the money," Melinte said. "The best thing about (the  Romanian) revolution is that now I can keep all the money."  </P> <P> Elliott, coming off a brilliant victory in the 1,500 meters at the Commonwealth  Games in Auckland, New Zealand, last week, thought he had a shot at Eamonn  Coghlan's indoor record of 3:49.78 and the $100,000 bonus that was on the line.  But he couldn't maintain a fast early pace and finished in 3:52.02, breaking  the British indoor record of 3:53.70 he set in finishing second to Ireland's  Marcus O'Sullivan in the 1988 Meadowlands mile.  </P> <P> Also, two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom won for the first time in the  indoor track and field season, and double Olympic gold medalist Jackie  Joyner-Kersee suffered her third consecutive loss, falling to LaVonna Martin in  the women's 55 hurdles.  </P> <P> The 400-meter world record-holder Butch Reynolds was declared the winner of the  600-yard race after first-place finisher Danny Harris was disqualified for  knocking down Antonio McKay.  </P></p>

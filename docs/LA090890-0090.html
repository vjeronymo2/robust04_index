			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES / MIKE HISERMAN;  </P> <P> PLUSH CANYONS STADIUM NEEDS A TENANT  </P> <P> Let's get this straight.  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge, a university with more than 30,000 students and a  football team that has been a winner for four consecutive years, will play host  to Eastern New Mexico tonight in a stadium that can graciously be described as  antique.  </P> <P> A broken down, insect-infested antique.  </P> <P> North Campus Stadium has approximately 6,000 available seats -- more than half  of which are temporary. The press box is open air, so there is no need for  ticket holders to tune in to KGIL radio for Joe Buttitta's play-by-play. They  can hear it live. And the lights? Players could see better tonight if the 2,000  or so fans all lit a match.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the best football facility in the region will be empty tonight.  </P> <P> The football stadium at College of the Canyons has an estimated capacity of  7,000, an enclosed, climate-controlled (trendy way of saying it has a heater)  press box, lights you could read the classifieds by, and, since 1981, no  football team.  </P> <P> What a waste.  </P> <P> Canyons had a football team from 1967 to 1981 before the district dropped the  sport as part of a massive budget cut. Pierce College did the same thing a few  years ago, but its program was quickly resurrected.  </P> <P> At Canyons, which serves the football-crazed area of the Santa Clarita Valley,  there are no such plans.  </P> <P> Hart and Canyon high schools, whose graduates form a large percentage of  Canyons' 6,000 enrollment, have won a combined 56 football games in the past  three seasons. A few of the players from those teams have earned football  scholarships to four-year universities.  </P> <P> A much larger percentage weren't big enough, fast enough or strong enough -- at  the time -- for the big time. They enrolled at junior colleges. Not the local  school. Instead, they traveled to Valley, Pierce, Glendale, Antelope Valley and  beyond.  </P> <P> Some people can make light of the situation. The vagabond players are "away  from home, but not so far away that they can't take the laundry home on  weekends," said Harry Welch, Canyon High's popular football coach.  </P> <P> Welch said he has never heard one of his athletes complain about not being able  to play for the local junior college.  </P> <P> Others have.  </P> <P> Mike Herrington, coach at Hart High, has a brother, Dean, who was an  All-Southern Section quarterback at Hart in 1981. Dean planned to attend  Canyons until the school dropped football. Instead, he went to Pasadena City  College. "We need the local community college to have a program," Mike  Herrington says.  </P> <P> There have been a couple of attempts to bring the sport back. A few years ago,  a study concluded that it would cost more than $300,000 -- a figure Herrington  says is ridiculously high -- to start it up again. College board members showed  little interest in making such an investment.  </P> <P> "We don't have a real supportive cast there," Canyons Athletic Director Lee  Smelser says.  </P> <P> When Canyons dropped football, the school's enrollment was only about 2,000 and  most of the players were recruited from outside the area. The faculty and board  believed too much money was being spent on students who came from outside the  community.  </P> <P> That was before the Santa Clarita Valley became a hotbed for the real estate  boom of the '80s. Canyons' enrollment has more than tripled, even though there  are some who believe its growth has been stunted by the lack of an  extracurricular activity with the popularity of football.  </P> <P> Smelser says there are those in the Canyons athletic department who would be  overjoyed to have football back. Herrington says there is some support for it  in the community. Both agree that a stronger endorsement is necessary.  </P> <P> "We're just not a real big noise right now," Smelser said.  </P> <P> What a waste.  </P> <P> Weird statistics: Northern Arizona was credited with only eight first downs --  four passing and four rushing -- in a 37-3 win over Northridge last week.  </P> <P> The Lumberjacks' passing first downs all came on touchdowns, covering 76, 10,  63 and 41 yards. Northern Arizona quarterback John Bonds passed for 292 yards,  of which 190 came on the four scoring plays.  </P> <P> Injury report: Cal State Northridge lost its starting quarterback and free  safety to injury in last Saturday's football game, but Northern Arizona's only  injury was far more serious.  </P> <P> Quinn Fauria, the Lumberjacks' starting fullback, sustained a knee injury in  the first quarter that required surgery the next day. Fauria, a redshirt  freshman from Crespi High, is out for the season.  </P> <P> Northridge hopes that free safety Clayton Bamberg will play tonight in the  Matadors' home opener against Eastern New Mexico. Quarterback Sherdrick Bonner  will miss the contest but should be ready for CSUN's next game, Sept. 22 at  Central (Okla.) State.  </P> <P> Rumor mill: Expect Jody Robinson, former assistant to Augie Garrido at  Illinois, to be hired as top assistant for the Northridge baseball team.  Robinson was on the same Cal State Fullerton staff as current CSUN Coach Bill  Kernen when the Titans won the NCAA World Series championship in 1979.  </P> <P> Robinson has been an assistant at Illinois for three seasons. When Garrido  returned to Fullerton, Robinson applied for the top post at Illinois but was  passed over in favor of former Southern Illinois Coach Richard Jones.  </P></p>

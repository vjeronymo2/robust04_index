			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] The North Atlantic Cooperation Council meeting  began in Istanbul today. Attending today's meeting are a total  of 41 countries, including 16 NATO member countries, 22  countries which signed the Partnership for Peace program, and  Slovenia, Finland, and Sweden as observers. The meeting started  with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin's speech.    Cetin declared that the meeting in Istanbul, which links  Asia  to Europe, is fulfilling the function of a bridge between  different communities and former adversaries. In short, this is  where East meets West and north meets south, Cetin stated. He  remarked that recent changes have eliminated the rigid unions of  the past and countries which attained their independence have  now occupied the places they deserve in the international arena.    Cetin continued: We are well aware, however, that this  transition period has not always been civilized and peaceful.  Old dangers such as excessive nationalism, racism, and  xenophobia have resurfaced in certain places. We observed the  total eradication of logic and humanitarian feelings of  compassion. Certain communities appear to prefer a struggle to  the death instead of rapprochement and a quest for  reconciliation. They seem to have abandoned all the values of  the civilized world.    Cetin announced that Russia's participation in the program  is  important and said that he expects this to happen.    Also addressing the meeting, NATO Deputy Secretary General  Sergio Balanzino noted that cooperation is the most viable way  to achieve security and stability in Europe. Otherwise,  Balanzino remarked, we will be faced with instability and  division, stressing that the efforts of the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council on this matter are very important.    After the speeches, the meeting continued in camera.  [passage omitted]</p>

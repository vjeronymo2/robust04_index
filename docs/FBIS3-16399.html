Before we do so,  however, we wish to comment on the meeting the chairmen of the  Supreme Soviets of Armenia and Azerbaijan held on the border  between Idzhevanskiy and Kazakhskiy Rayons on 12 March.    The meeting was anxiously awaited. Undoubtedly, it was very  important. It is premature yet to discuss the outcome of the  talks. However, several mass media organs have issued  conflicting reports.    The situation along NKR's front lines is tense. The  situation at the front lines has not changed during the past two  days. Azerbaijan's National Army [ANA] units have fired  intensely on the Armenian positions in several areas with  various types of arms. They have also launched wide-scale  attacks in an attempt to penetrate the Armenian defenses. As  usual, the ANA units failed to achieve their objective. They  were counterattacked by the Armenian Armed Forces and forced to  withdraw to their previous positions after losing men and  military equipment.    Positional fighting took place at the NKR front line  yesterday.    The situation deteriorated on the border between Armenia and  Azerbaijan during the past week. This is because several  Armenian border areas were fired on from Azerbaijan. The  Armenian side has not retaliated in order to avoid worsening the  situation.    The Armenian Ministry of Defense press service has disclosed  that tension has escalated on Noyemberyanskiy Rayon's border.  The ANA units fired on the defense positions around Koti with  infantry combat vehicles and machine guns yesterday. However,  no one was hurt. The Armenian border guards refrained from  launching retaliatory operations. The Armenian Ministry of  Defense has warned that Azerbaijan will be held fully  responsible if tension further escalates as a result of the  provocative activities. The ministry said that the situation at  other parts of the border was relatively peaceful yesterday and  last night.    We hope that the talks between the chairmen of the  parliaments of the two republics will contribute toward the  establishment of peace on the entire border.</p>

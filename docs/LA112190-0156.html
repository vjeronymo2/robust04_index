			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RETAILER, RABBI SQUARE OFF OVER KOSHER HOT DOG  </P> <P> A dispute over how to grill a hot dog has a Palestinian food retailer pitted  against a rabbi who is Baltimore's lone inspector of kosher meats.  </P> <P> The merchant, George Barghout, was still touting his dogs as kosher Tuesday  despite a conviction last week for violating a city ordinance that bars  merchants from claiming their products are kosher when they're not.  </P> <P> Rabbi Mayer Kurcfeld has spent 15 months dogging Barghout, insisting that the  kosher wieners he sells at his Yogurt Plus eatery are rendered non-kosher  because he grills them next to non-kosher dogs.  </P> <P> "If the consumer believes he is getting kosher food, that is what he should  get," the rabbi said.  </P> <P> Jewish dietary laws forbid the commingling of kosher and non-kosher foods.  Barghout says the cooking does not deprive the hot dogs of their kosher  qualities. "The flame doesn't contaminate the meat; it purifies it," he said.  </P> <P> "It doesn't make any difference what he thinks," Kurcfeld replied.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SINGLE TRAVELER  </P> <P> Now I know: Single people do get cheated when it comes to room distribution on  a tour.  </P> <P> We pay extra but come up with less. On a recent tour, nearly every night my  room faced rear buildings so close that I had to keep blinds closed. Roofs  and/or balconies were so close that I locked my windows and doors and spent the  night in an airless room.  </P> <P> Complaining to the tour guide and desk was of no use. Several times I looked at  couples' rooms to see a view of lake or mountains. I wish tour companies and  hotels would consider single travelers, especially women, as people, too.  </P> <P> FRANCES BLAKE  </P> <P> Lemoore, Calif.  </P></p>

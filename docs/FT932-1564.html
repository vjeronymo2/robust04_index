			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Highs and lows of a dizzy decade: Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the out-going governor of the Bank of England, speaks to Peter Norman These are busy days for Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England. His 10 years with the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street are ending in a giddy social whirl. On Monday, he took his leave of the City and politics. Three former chancellors, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new tenant of Number 11 Downing Street, and Lady Thatcher were among those bidding farewell in the Bank's ornate Court Room. Last night it was time to say goodbye to his staff. In eight days, Mr Leigh-Pemberton hands over to Mr Eddie George, the present deputy governor, and a new deputy, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, formerly of the Economist. The departure of any Bank governor is a significant event in UK financial history. But Mr Leigh-Pemberton is going after a particularly momentous two terms of office. Monday's high turnout of the great and the good from Westminster and the City may be a sign that the Bank's star is again in the ascendant after recent setbacks. Although Mr Leigh-Pemberton has experienced his fair share of ups and downs since trading the chairmanship of the National Westminster Bank for his secluded office facing on to the Bank's Garden Court, he is leaving the Bank in reasonable shape in spite of the pound's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism and criticism of the BCCI closure. It has benefited from Britain's departure from the ERM to the extent that it now has a clear mandate to fight inflation and a more open relationship with the Treasury, with which it shares responsibility for monetary policy. In the lively debate under way over whether the Bank should have more autonomy, Mr Leigh-Pemberton clearly feels that the tide of history is moving the Bank's way and in the direction of independence. Nevertheless, in spite of the internationalisation of the City and the cut-throat competitiveness of today's financial markets, he argues that the Bank still has 'a very strong traditional position of prerogative in the City'. The governor's eyebrows may be backed with statutory powers rather than a dominant position in the markets these days. But used judiciously, they can still exact obedience in the Square Mile. Speaking in his office yesterday, Mr Leigh-Pemberton, who was elevated to the peerage in the recent Queen's birthday honours list, said he was convinced that central bank independence is 'an idea that is gathering momentum all round the world'. He appreciates that Britain has a problem of reconciling independence with parliamentary accountability: 'But I'm not convinced that this is insoluble.' The way forward, he suggests, is to allow the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee to play a key role in holding the governor of an independent British central bank to account. 'One or two MPs have said to me that answerability on the floor of the Commons is fundamental,' he says. 'But as a matter of fact, MPs have a much better opportunity to test an official or a governor in the select committee where you can follow a line of argument to its end over a period of three hours. On the floor of the House, you get a question, a supplementary and then perforce the matter moves on.' He believes a Treasury Committee report on the future of the Bank, which is due towards the end of this year, could be a good starting point for a 'a very careful and considered debate' on the merits of Bank independence. In the meantime, much of the obscurity and secrecy that used to surround the making of monetary policy by the Bank and Treasury have been stripped away as a result of the greater openness that has followed Britain's departure from the ERM and the adoption of a specific inflation target committing the government to keeping underlying inflation below 4 per cent over the rest of this parliament. This state of affairs is 'quite the most satisfactory of my 10 years as governor', he says. But the Bank, unlike some central banks, has other responsibilities besides achieving price stability. Is there not a danger that it will be subject to conflicts of interest if it retains responsibility for banking supervision or the welfare of British industry? 'I don't think there is. I find it surprising that people ask that question,' he says. 'I've never found a conflict of interest between our prime function, which is sound money, either with banking supervision or with the Bank's industrial finance policy. 'People may think one must go easy on banking supervision or one must go easy on monetary policy because of the strain on the banks. Quite the opposite, we must make sure the financial sector remains vigorous in an environment of monetary stability. And the same goes for our work in industrial finance.' Nor does he consider the problems that the Bank's supervisory department has faced in controversial cases such as the Johnson Matthey bank rescue of 1984 or the more recent closure of BCCI are reasons for the Bank to pull out of supervision. 'I understand the arguments for hiving off. And there have been moments when I've been sorely tempted to say the Bank would be better off to be relieved of this very difficult function. But my opinion still remains that on balance it is best that supervision is carried out in the central bank.' A free-standing supervisory authority would have to rely on intelligence provided by the Bank. At the same time, the Bank needs to 'remain very close to the banking industry, partly in order to work its market operations better but chiefly also to have its finger on the pulse for lender of last resort functions'. But remaining close to banking does not mean taking an uncritical view of developments in the Square Mile. Lapses in the City's commercial morality clearly worry Mr Leigh-Pemberton. 'People in the City are driven to cutting corners by competitive pressure,' he says. In this hyper-competitive world, the central bank governor has to use his powers differently than in the past. But the famous eyebrows can still have an impact. 'It is still possible to exercise powerful influence over leading figures in the City and its institutions. The reason one can do this nowadays is perhaps because of the background of statutory powers.' Whatever the reasons, the end can be effective. There have been cases where 'one might have to say to a certain person or a certain house: 'Well look, the way you're conducting business, it's not really acceptable. Please accept my advice and adjust your style, because if not, we may have to think about a formal finding. And I'm sure you wouldn't like that.' ' Such tactics may be reminiscent of the old-boy network of past decades, but they have worked in his 10 years of office. Looking back, Mr Leigh-Pemberton would like to be remembered for having helped bring inflation down. He is also pleased with the progress that Britain is making in European affairs although 'there have been terrible ups and downs'. 'But if you want me to answer you quite personally, I would like to be thought to have given good leadership to the City, the banking industry, even modestly internationally,' he says.</p>

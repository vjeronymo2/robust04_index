			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Romie Evangelista] </F>   [Excerpts] A senior officer and one of the pioneers of the  Revolutionary Nationalist alliance-Young Officers Union  (RAM-YOU) yesterday asked Armed Forces Chief General Lisandro  Abadia to stop making the military rebel group as his "whipping  boy" for his failure to unify the military. Former Philippine  Constabulary Lieutenant Colonel Billy Bibit, said RAM-YOU  members are making rounds inside the various military camps but  stressed that they were just visiting former classmates.    According to Bibit, his group should not be denied access in  visiting classmates and friends still in the military service.  "We are visiting our friends. What do they want, that we don't  visit our friends anymore; isn't it normal for us to go and  visit them because we also used to be in the AFP?" Bibit asked.  "If they've failed in their mission (to unify the AFP), they  shouldn't point a finger at anyone. They can't use us as their  "whipping boys," he added. [passage omitted]    Bibit said unifying the AFP is a difficult undertaking, and  it was the primary objective of the RAM (formerly called the  Reform the AFP Movement) after the 1986 civilian backed military  uprising which toppled President Marcos from power. "But after  three or four months, the RAM backslided because of patronage  system," Bibit said.    Bibit disclosed that military officials have already  identified the patronage system as contributing factor in the  growing discontent in the military ranks, but only failed to  neutralize them. "They know what they are supposed to do but  nobody dares to for fear of their own security, or let us say,  you are not popular if you do not have proteges," Bibit said.    One of the advantages in the patronage system, according to  Bibit, is having better opportunities for schooling abroad,  promotion and good assignments.</p>

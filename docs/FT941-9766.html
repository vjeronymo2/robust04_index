			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / How Rothschild saved the City from collapse: David Kynaston tells the story of a 19th-century crisis that almost destroyed London as a financial centre and irrevocably changed the banking system On Saturday - that dreadful Saturday l shall never forget - the run increased to a frightful degree, everybody came in to take out their balance, no-one brought any money in. One old steady customer, who had usually Pounds 30,000 there, drew it out without, as is usual, giving any warning, and in order to pay it the House was left literally empty. Henry went out to endeavour to borrow but people made shuffling excuses. Old Scott cried like a child of five years old . . . That unforgettably dreadful Saturday was December 3 1825. The hysterical partners all belonged to the private banking firm of Pole, Thornton, Free, Down &amp; Scott, and the City of London was in turmoil. It was the worst crisis since the South Sea Bubble of 1720, when hugely inflated schemes of trade in the Pacific and elsewhere had ended in tears and acrimony. There had been several other crises since, but none so threatening to the whole financial and commercial edifice. Everyone knew the cause, few the remedy. From the early 1820s the City had been in a state of headlong, uncontrolled, irrational bullishness - the first of the great 19th-century booms following the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815. As anyone who has been anxiously watching the market in recent weeks will understand, stocks can go bounding upwards so long as everyone is confident that they will continue to rise, but as soon as people begin to lose their nerve, the whole house of cards can collapse. Even in modern regulated markets the psychological fundamentals are the same as in the great crisis of 1825. In those days, the banking system also depended crucially on confidence, partly because its capital reserves were inadequate and completely unpoliced. Protection for investors was minimal; the private sector Bank of England, little more than a century old, was still groping uncertainly towards modern notions of central banking; and a host of new entrants from the continent was flocking into the City to take advantage of London's new position as the world's dominant financial centre. The square mile was at this time no place for faint hearts. One of its specialities was grossly overpriced loans to the newly liberated countries of Latin America. But at least Colombia, Chile and Peru were all real places - unlike Poyais, an imaginary country reputedly somewhere in central America for which bonds were successfully issued. By late 1825, the bubble in foreign loans and company promotions had burst, hastened by speculative over-trading in imported commodities, rashness on the part of the country banks, and a Bank of England policy that veered between complacency and an over-sharp contraction of credit. 'There will be a general crash,' the Duke of Wellington, who became Tory prime minister from 1828 to 1830, had predicted in March. He took a grim satisfaction as events unfolded. Keeping his head while all around lost theirs, was 28-year-old Henry Thornton. His sister, Marianne, recorded the events of that terrible day: 'They shut up always at five. At four, he ordered the balance for the day to be struck, and found that during the next hour they would have to pay Pounds 33,000, and they should receive only Pounds 12,000. This was certain destruction and he walked out determined to try one last resource.' He went to a fierce rival, the banking house of Smith, Payne &amp; Smiths and threw himself at the mercy of John Smith. He said that he could hardly expect him to lend him money, but if he could get them through until five, it would be 'an inexpressible relief'. Smith asked if he could give his word of honour that Pole, Thornton, Free, Down &amp; Scott was solvent. Henry gave it. 'Well,' continued Marianne, 'then he said they should have everything they could spare, which was not quite enough tho', for they had been hard-pressed themselves that day, but he went back with Henry to watch the event. Two people had chanced to pay in some money whilst Henry had been absent. This, with what he had borrowed, exactly met the demand upon them. But never, he says, shall he forget watching the clock to see when five would strike, and end their immediate terror - or whether any one would come in for any more payments. The clock did strike at last, and they were safe for the moment . . .' Thornton's bank might just have pulled through, but on Thursday, December 8, news came that Wentworth &amp; Co, a leading Yorkshire bank had failed, owing Pole's a vital sum which could not be repaid. Hudson Gurney, the Quaker banker, expressed the fear that gripped the country that day: 'Who may be able to stand on a general shrinkage nobody can well foresee.' Adding: 'I have been run to death, apparently doing nothing, but am utterly bothered in mind and spirit.' Charles Churchill, the timber broker, declared in his diary on the Saturday: 'The distress for Money among respectable Dealers &amp; Merchants is beyond anything ever experienced.' A tidal run on the country banks was beginning and Henry Thornton was convinced that there was no alternative but for his bank to stop payment. 'If he had borrowed more money,' Marianne explained, 'it would have only been to lend to Country Banks, who might all have stopped tomorrow'. Henry took his decision calmly enough, bringing down over three dozen country banks. But when he told the City on Monday morning, the reaction was frenetic. 'The dense fog which prevailed throughout the day was scarcely more gloomy than the countenances of those who are affected by the present alarming state of the Money Market,' the Morning Chronicle reported. Tuesday was no better, as news came that Williams &amp; Co, of Birchin Lane, was in trouble. An impassable crowd gathered outside that particular banking house. 'Never were such times,' cried many of the oldest visitors of the exchange, while others exclaimed: 'If this state of things continues, we must ask not who is gone, but who stands? For unless something is done to relieve the pressure, and to restore confidence, few can resist so overwhelming a torrent of distrust.' On Wednesday, panic mounted and: 'The Royal Exchange was thronged long before the customary hour of assemblage, and Cornhill, Lombard-street, Nicholas-lane, and all the streets in which banking-houses are situated, were crowded to such a degree, as to impede the progress of passengers.' Police were called and 'kept up a constant cry of 'move on''. Gloom pervaded the Stock Exchange, where 'in the Foreign Stocks all were on the decline, and of Home Shares nothing was said except a hearty wish that they were all in a very warm place'. The only positive development of the day was a meeting at Mansion House of about 100 merchants and bankers, who passed a resolution expressing confidence in the Bank of England's attempts to stem the crisis. Their confidence was, on the whole, justified. Since the start of the week the Bank had been making every effort to bolster the market. A key moment came on Thursday, when Lord Liverpool's Tory government reluctantly gave its sanction to the Bank issuing Pounds 1 notes for the first time since Britain's return to the gold standard four years earlier. Yet by Friday, the situation was as grave as ever. Relations between government and Bank were at best irascible and Frederick Robinson, chancellor of the exchequer, was held in contempt by the City for irresolution. Only one possible saviour was left. The City turned to an outsider, a foreigner and a Jew, who was held in grudging respect for the sharpness of his financial dealings. Nathan Rothschild, one of the greatest financiers of all time, was the third son of a Frankfurt merchant. He had been based in the City since 1808 and was already acknowledged as its nonpareil figure. Having made a huge fortune by conducting audacious bullion operations on behalf of the British Government during the later stages of the Napoleonic Wars, this was Nathan's chance to do something similarly striking in peacetime, to save the nation from financial collapse and make a handsome turn at the same time. By the end of that Friday he had managed to obtain from the continent up to Pounds 300,000 in gold, replenishing the Bank of England's barren coffers. In the era before the telegraph, this was an astonishing feat. Rothschild had developed a sophisticated private courier and homing pigeon system, which enabled him to communicate with his brothers in Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna and Naples, all at the hub of international finance. This extraordinary family, together with Barings, occupied a position comparable to that of central banks or even the International Monetary Fund today. In the rueful words of the brother of the Governor of the Bank of England: 'The Rothschilds have become the metallic sovereigns of Europe . . . They have obtained a control over the European exchanges, which no party ever before could accomplish, and they now seem to hold the strings of the public purse. No sovereign without their assistance now could raise a loan.' It was in the full knowledge of Rothschild's efforts that the Iron Duke now stood firm, telling Liverpool that 'while there was life there was hope' that the Bank of England must not be allowed to go off the gold standard, and instead 'the Government were bound to support them to the very utmost of their power . . . for their interests were those of the country'. During the next few days the tide turned, and by Christmas confidence had been restored. Thornton even succeeded in landing a new post. Williams &amp; Co, although it had stopped payment on the 13th, managed by the end of the year to reconstitute itself as Williams, Deacon &amp; Co and brought in the battle-hardened Henry as one of the new partners. There beckoned, for E M Forster's great uncle, an illustrious career in banking. It was a profession that was irrevocably changed by the 1825 crisis. A series of inquiries began which laid the foundations for the modern banking system. Inadequately capitalised private banks outside London took much of the retrospective flak, and legislation was passed permitting the establishment of joint-stock banks outside a radius of 65 miles from London. Within a few years joint-stock banks, in addition to the Bank of England, were allowed in London, beginning with the London and Westminster Bank (now the NatWest) which opened for business in Throgmorton Street in 1834. The other direct consequence of the crisis was that the Bank of England tightened its control over the currency, setting up 11 provincial branches in the late 1820s in order to promote wider use of its own notes. After the crisis Thomas Love Peacock, poet, novelist and an official of the East India Company, reflected on the crazy phenomenon in verse, which might equally well have been an epitaph on the banking follies that caused the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s: Oh] where are the riches that bubbled like fountains, In places we neither could utter nor spell, A thousand miles inland 'mid untrodden mountains, Where silver and gold grew like heath and blue-bell? Now curst be the projects, and curst the projectors, And curst be the bubbles before us that rolled, Which, bursting, have left us like desolate spectres, Bewailing our bodies of paper and gold.

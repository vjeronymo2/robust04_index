The demonstrators, who included  some from the provinces, especially the Plaine Central, used as  their authority the recent people's congress held at the  initiative of notables in the north. They chanted slogans  hostile to the parliamentarians and the international community,  demanding the lifting of the embargo. Uniformed and armed police  were inside the parliament [words indistinct]. Since the  congress, Haitian deputies have rejected a petition demanding  the installation of a ruling triumvirat and the dissolution of  the parliament. Jean Luckenson reports:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Luckenson] On Thursday, 25  January at about noon, dozens of young men and women  demonstrated in the streets leading from Rue des Miracles and  Rue des Casernes to the Haitian parliament. They were protesting  the embargo and the return of the president elected on 16  December, and demanding the dissolution of the parliament while  calling on [national founder] Father Dessalines to return to  help them. The demonstrators said they would block the country  if their demands were not satisfied. [passage omitted]    The demonstrators, parading before the front and rear gates  of the parliament, carried a big Haitian flag and placards that  expressed the demands of their home areas. We saw several  pickups, filled with policemen, parked a few meters from the  demonstrators to ensure their safety. Deputy Pierre Francois  Vital, in reaction, supports the objectives of the demonstration  and emphasizes the parliamentary dissolution demanded by the  demonstrators. According to the Alliance [for Parliamentary  Cohesion], nothing has been accomplished in the chamber for  three years.    [Vital] As long as this chamber is there, nothing can be  done  in Haiti because whoever is at the palace as president or in the  government of Haiti will always have problems with this chamber.  In my opinion, unavoidably, regardless of whether one has worked  well, whether or not one has some money saved up, I see that the  parliamentarians must leave in order to give the country a break  because they are like a band of children who are always joking.  [passage omitted]    [Luckenson] Deputy Denis Saint-Fort believes it is normal  for  the demonstrators to express their opinions. It is democracy,  and there must be pressures for anything serious to be  accomplished. As for dissolution of the chamber, the deputy has  reservations; but regarding the [lifting of] the embargo, he  agrees 100 percent because it is one of the biggest cancers  gnawing our society. [passage omitted]    I must tell you that a few minutes after the demonstration  began, the members of the National Front for Change and  Democracy Parliamentary Bloc hastened to run off, one after  another. But there was an important safety device inside the  parliament grounds. Several other deputies and senators, who  arrived two hours later while the demonstrators were in front of  the gate, got out of their cars with gun in hand to enter the  parliament.

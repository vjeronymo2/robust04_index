			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup": "Fujian Girds for Economic Takeoff"] </F>   [Text] Fujian, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Fujian, a southeast  Chinese province with a booming economy, is gearing up for an  economic takeoff by greatly improving its infrastructure.    According to Zhang Jiakun, deputy governor of the province,  Fujian plans to pour 300 billion yuan (about 34 billion U.S.  dollars) in the upcoming six years into the construction of such  infrastructure projects as airports, harbors, railways, highway,  telecommunications and power plants.    In addition, the province is to push ahead with reforms of  the systems of banking, finance and foreign currency exchange,  and simplify the procedures for foreign investment so as to  attract more investment from overseas.    Situated on China's southeast coast facing Taiwan across the  Taiwan straits, Fujian is the ancestral home of eight million  Overseas Chinese and 800,000 residents from Hong Kong and Macao.  Some 80 percent of the population of Taiwan can trace their  roots to the province.    Deemed a frontier for national defence, however, Fujian  benefited little from the state economically in the first two  decades after the people's republic was founded in 1949.    With the introduction of the policy of opening up to the  outside world and the easing of tensions across the Taiwan  straits, the province spent a total of 15 billion yuan (about  1.78 billion U.S. dollars) during the 13 years from 1979 to 1992  on energy, raw materials, communications and telecommunications  projects. A total of 13 such projects went into production last  year alone.    Now the province's three airports -- in this provincial  capital, Xiamen and Wuyishan -- boast over 70 routes linking it  with all the major Chinese cities as well as Hong Kong,  Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia.    Its 400 harbors of various sizes connect the province with  Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, Japan and Thailand. Modern railway  and highway transportation and telecommunications facilities  make the province an increasingly attractive spot for overseas  investment along with an ample power supply.    Along with improved infrastructure, various organizations  have sprung up in Fujian to help foreign investors with  registration, hard currency adjustment, insurance and supply of  production materials.    The move has proved effective as the province had approved  the setting up of 12,797 overseas-funded enterprises by the end  of 1993, with a total contractual investment of 22.52 billion  U.S. dollars. Nearly six billion U.S. dollars of this has  actually been used, making up ten percent of the country's total  foreign investment.    In the first quarter of this year the province attracted 626  million U.S. dollars in overseas investment and exported 1.45  billion U.S. dollars-worth of products, representing increases  of 52.1 and 42, 8 percent, respectively.    To accelerate its economic development, Fujian has further  drawn up policies to encourage overseas investment in  infrastructure construction and push ahead with reform in  various sectors so as to meet the international standards of  economic development. The province is also busy working out  regulations to protect the legal rights of overseas investors.</p>

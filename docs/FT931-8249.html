			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Observer: Muffled move The decision to change chairman by Kleinwort Benson has been so discreet as to camouflage the boardroom upheaval that has occurred at the old established merchant bank which has lost its momentum. David Peake, a member of the family and a banker, is handing over to Lord Rockley, a few months older and a corporate finance man. Peake, who at 58 has been doing the job for a mere four years, stays on the board. Considering that it was only last year that another corporate finance man in the shape of 51-year-old Simon Robertson was promoted to be Peake's deputy, he would have seemed the natural successor to a casual outsider. But merchant banks are more collegiate than most outfits, and it seems to have been felt that an Old Etonian city gent like Lord Rockley, a vice-chairman, was the best bet to command the trust and confidence of the troops. But will he take the tough strategic decisions needed to restore Kleinwort to former glory? Somehow, one suspects not.</p>

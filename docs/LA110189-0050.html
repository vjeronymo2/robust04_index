			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SPECIAL ON GARBAGE CRISIS OFFERS NO EASY SOLUTIONS  </P> <P> "Out of the Dumps," the latest episode of the KCET series "By the Year 2000,"  airing at 7:30 tonight on Channel 28, takes a quick look at Los Angeles'  garbage crisis. And, while adding nothing new to the discussion, it is a timely  reminder that this growing problem will not go away on its own.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County is throwing away 50,000 tons of garbage a day, enough to  fill the Queen Mary -- a rate that will soon exhaust the county's capacity to  handle its daily waste.  </P> <P> In the program's opening segment, we see trucks being turned away at the Puente  Hills landfill -- the largest garbage dump in the county and the second-largest  in the nation -- at noon each day as the landfill reaches its daily quota.  These trucks leave, looking for other places to drop their noxious cargo.  </P> <P> The bureaucrats' solution: Enlarge existing landfills and open new ones. The  problem: Nobody wants one in his back yard. Incineration? Another  not-in-my-back-yard solution.  </P> <P> "Out of the Dumps" explores the alternatives, offering an in-studio discussion  with a doctor, city attorney and president of a waste-disposal company and a  separate interview with Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus. However, in a  choppy attempt to be thorough, producer Steve Talley has come up with a show  that has the look and feel of an extended nightly news segment. MARTIN  ZIMMERMAN  </P></p>

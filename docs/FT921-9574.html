			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Observer: Royal Bank's odd turn If there was one UK clearing bank which seemed to have cracked the problem of how to own a London merchant bank and not destroy it, it was the Royal Bank of Scotland. So why is it talking about selling its Charterhouse merchant banking subsidiary? Charterhouse has thrived while the likes of Hill Samuel and County NatWest have provided nothing but grief for their owners. Royal Bank's capital ratios are stronger than most, so it does not need the money; and anyway, now is hardly the best time to get premium prices for banking assets. Royal says that Charterhouse will benefit from a 'larger European dimension'. But surely that was supposed to be why the Royal's new chief executive, George Mathewson, had worked so hard at forging a 'European alliance' with Spain's Banco Santander. The obvious conclusion is that this proves once and for all that the oft-quoted benefits of having a merchant bank and a commercial bank working side by side in the same group are nothing compared with the disadvantages. Even so, it still looks an odd move. If one had to choose between owning a mainstream merchant bank in Europe or a quasi-savings bank in Rhode Island, most bankers would opt for the former. Yet Royal Bank's new top management team seems bent on doing the opposite.</p>

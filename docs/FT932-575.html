			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Tietmeyer plays down weak D-Mark and hints at rate cut THE BUNDESBANK sees the current weakness of the D-Mark as part of a 'normalisation' process and not the start of a run on the currency, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, its vice-president, said yesterday. In a radio interview, he also reiterated the commitment of the German central bank to bringing down interest rates when conditions are appropriate  -a statement which, in conjunction with his apparent nonchalance about the currency, may stimulate hopes of further early cuts in interest rates. Some economists believe these could come as early as Thursday, when the Bundesbank's policymaking council meets in Leipzig. 'The current exchange rate situation is in my opinion thoroughly appropriate for the German economy,' Mr Tietmeyer said, arguing that after the correction of exchange rates within the European exchange rate mechanism, the recent weakening of the D-Mark was a 'normalisation process' as money flowed out of the D-Mark back to other currencies. 'We must take care to ensure that this normalisation doesn't turn into something entirely different,' he said. Mr Tietmeyer said markets had confidence in the Bundesbank's monetary policy 'as they have always had,' and therefore he believed there would not be a run on the D-Mark. But he pointed out that investors took account of Germany's entire 'policy mix', including pay and fiscal policy as well as social considerations. The statements appear designed to exert more pressure on the political establishment to agree meaningful cuts in public expenditure. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, is finalising proposals for spending cuts in order to tackle government borrowing requirements which are expected to reach 7.5 per cent of gross national product this year. 'We certainly don't want to keep interest rates unnecessarily high,' Mr Tietmeyer said. 'Our main concern is to avoid the situation where if we cut short-term interest rates, this leads to a rise in rates at the long end of the yield curve.' This meant higher long-term interest rates. He warned against trying to stimulate Germany's economy via rate cuts, but said: 'This doesn't at all mean that interest rates at the short-term cannot be brought down further.'

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Audit rivals contest The normally peaceful world of auditing magazine circulations, the key currency for advertising, is being disturbed by the first stirrings of serious competition. BPA International, the US-based body responsible for auditing the circulations of more than 1,600 magazines, mostly in the US, is increasingly moving into Europe, and the UK in particular. The organisation already serves 67 magazines in the UK but has now set up a European sales and marketing office, much to the irritation of the official British audit body the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Both BPA and the ABC are non-profit making bodies. Joseph Foley, BPA's international director, believes he is bringing extra choice and higher standards of verification to the UK marketplace, at a time when publications are becoming more international. BPA says it provides detailed information on who a magazine goes to in terms of job title, something that is not part of the standard ABC audit. John Beadell, chief executive of the ABC, says his procedures are among the most stringent in the world, certainly comparable to those of the BPA and that more detailed information was introduced with the ABC Profile in 1991. 'There's not going to be a war. It would damage the integrity of circulation audits,' he says. Organisations such as the Periodical Publishers Association believe advertisers, agencies and publishers want a single currency for comparing magazine circulation in the UK and it should be the ABC. 'Two competing currencies in the same marketplace must devalue both through undermining confidence,' Ian Locks, chief executive of the PPA, says. He fears the next stage in the competition will mean players having to buy both sets of data - thereby doubling the cost.</p>

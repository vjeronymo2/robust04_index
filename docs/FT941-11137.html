			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The largest single transaction of the week was recorded in Perpetual, the unit trust and discretionary portfolio management company. Martyn Arbib, the chairman, sold 300,000 shares at Pounds 10.80. However, the stocks have been performing extremely strongly recently and he still retains the lion's share of the company. Kenwood Appliances, famous for their mixers, came to the market in June 1992 and first featured on this list in November last year. Since directors started selling then at 316p, the shares have actually continued to rise and are currently trading around 389p. This week's sales were slightly higher at 393p. Filofax keeps cropping up as a company in which directors are still prepared to invest, despite the share price racing ahead. Whether the company merits such a high rating, even given its product's global development prospects is hard to judge. Such a high degree of director confidence is surely worth monitoring.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 No of Company                 Sector          Shares      Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Archer (AJ)               Insu          15,000         11           1 Black Arrow               OS&amp;B          25,000         10           2 Blick                     E&amp;EE           9,448         49           3 Burndene Inv              Dist          20,000         11           1 CaledoniaInv              OthF           7,500         54           1* Frogmore Estates          Prop          35,039        184           1* Gibbon Lyons              Chem          10,000         14           1 Hambros                   MBnk          10,000         46           1 Helical Bar (a)           Prop         294,090        335           1 H'land Distilleries       SW&amp;C          30,000        124           1* Hodder Headline           Mdia           7,430         25           3 John Laing (b)            BCon           9,898         35           1 Kenwood App               E&amp;EE         150,700        592           2 Menvier Swain             E&amp;EE          20,000         48           1 Millwall Holdings         L&amp;Hl         666,667         29           1 Perpetual                 OthF         300,000      3,240           1 Protean                   Eng            5,000         11           1 Rathbone Brothers         OthF           9,000         31           1 Stirling Group            Text          25,000         15           1 Vardy (Reg)               Dist          55,555        114           1* Vodafone                  Tele          70,000        417           1* Warburg SG                MBnk          36,141        363           1* Wood (JD)                 Prop          50,000         50           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Archer(AJ)                Insu          30,000         23           1 Asprey                    RetG           3,000         11           1 Carclo Engineering        Eng           20,000         28           1 Crest Nicholson           BCon          10,000         11           1 Filofax                   OS&amp;B          25,000         40           1 Gt Western Res (c)        OilE         100,000         40           1 Johnston Group            BM&amp;M          10,000         17           1 Sycamore Holdings (d)     BM&amp;M       1,910,169         38           3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

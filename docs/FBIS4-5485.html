			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Kazakhastan President  Nursultan Nazarbayev left Tokyo Saturday [9 April], concluding a  four-day visit that resulted in a pledge by Japan to offer  financial aid for dismantling the nation's nuclear arsenal and  promoting economic reform.    Before departing from Tokyo's Haneda Airport, Nazarbayev  told  reporters that the central Asian country will proceed with  ongoing economic reform although he acknowledged it is  impossible to achieve the reform without "pain." He also said  that raising productivity through joint ventures with advanced  countries, such as Japan, that have high technologies would  contribute to preventing falling living standards of the people  in the former Soviet republic.    In a joint statement signed by Nazarbayev and Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa Friday, Japan pledged to allocate 1,170  million yen to Kazakhstan to help dismantle its nuclear arsenal  inherited from the former Soviet Union.    Tokyo will also provide a loan totaling 12,982 million yen  for improving railway infrastructure and tackling air pollution  from thermal power stations.    The Export-Import Bank of Japan will extend an untied loan  valued at 220 million dollars to support its transition to a  market economy.</p>

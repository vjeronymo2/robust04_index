			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF WATCH: DAY 43;  </P> <P> A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS  </P> <P> Diplomatic Front:  </P> <P> Fears of an Iran-Iraq alliance were eased as the United States said there was  no evidence that Iran was violating U.N. trade sanctions, and Iranian officials  have denied any agreement to swap food and medicine for embargoed Iraqi oil.  </P> <P> At the U.N., the Security Council approved arrangements for the dispatch of  food to Iraq and Kuwait in the case of urgent humanitarian need. Earlier, the  Senate approved a bill imposing sanctions against any country that uses  chemical or biological weapons. The bill also increases penalties for violating  the embargo against Iraq, up to $1 million in some cases.  </P> <P> In Mecca, 400 Muslim leaders from 60 countries adopted a declaration that  accuses Iraqi President Saddam Hussein of violating the tenets of the faith by  invading Kuwait.  </P> <P> Military Front:  </P> <P> Iraq has successfully test-fired a medium-range missile outfitted with a  chemical weapons warhead. The test shows that the potential threat to U.S.  troops and Saudi sites is greater than once believed. Iraq also warned of  possible terrorist attacks against U.S. forces in a memo given to a U.S.  official in Baghdad.  </P> <P> In Saudi Arabia, U.S. troops peppered Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, with questions about how soon they could go home. Powell  also urged European nations to join the multinational force with tanks and  personnel carriers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Pentagon nixed the postmaster general's offer to allow military  personnel in the gulf to send mail free, saying Congress and President Bush  must approve the action. AT&amp;T said it will allow families of soldiers free  use of fax machines at 400 centers beginning next week in a program called  Desert Fax.  </P> <P> Trade Front:  </P> <P> The Administration unveiled an array of voluntary initiatives to encourage fuel  conservation and promote domestic oil production. But it admitted that it is  bracing for worldwide oil shortages as early as next month.  </P> <P> Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said if necessary, the United States is  planning to draw some supplies from the strategic petroleum reserve, which  holds nearly 600 million barrels.  </P> <P> Crisis Indicators:  </P> <P> U.S. troops on the ground: 100,000-plus  </P> <P> U.S. sailors aboard ships in region: 35,000  </P> <P> U.S. warships in region: 50-plus  </P> <P> U.S. reservists to be mobilized: up to 50,103  </P> <P> Iraqi troops in/near Kuwait: 265,000  </P> <P> Iraqi tanks in Kuwait: 1,500  </P> <P> High temperature in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: 108  </P> <P> Total Americans in Kuwait: 1,400  </P> <P> Total Americans in Iraq: 200  </P> <P> Retail gasoline (U.S. average per gallon): $1.263, up $0.004  </P> <P> Crude oil (spot price per barrel): $31.20, up $0.35  </P> <P> Dow Jones industrial index: 2,582.67, down 43.07  </P></p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / (CORRECTED) Lloyd's drafts in help from outsiders Correction (published 30th October 1992) appended to this article. THREE consultancy teams are working on initiatives to resolve some of the most pressing problems at Lloyd's, the insurance market. All have been appointed within the last few weeks by Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's new chief executive. Mercer Consulting, management consultants, has been invited to develop proposals to resolve the problem of 'open years', which occur when syndicates are unable to close their accounts due to uncertainty over future claims. Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting on the market - who are members of syndicates with open years are unable to leave the market. The number of syndicates with open years rose sharply this year. Mr William Knight, of solicitors Simmons and Simmons, and LEK, the consultants, are to examine how errors and omissions insurers - which cover businesses on the market against legal awards for negligence - might aid an out-of-court settlement of litigation between Names and their agents. New litigation between the two groups is possible following the completion of recent investigations into the losses at syndicates managed by Gooda Walker and Feltrim agencies. Another consultancy firm, First Consulting, is conducting a review of operations at the Lloyd's Corporation, which provides administration and marketing services for the market as a whole. Mr Middleton is keen to improve the corporation's efficiency. Both the Mercer Fraser team and Mr Knight will work alongside committees of Names, chosen for their business experience. Mr Middleton and Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, are writing this week to potential members. They are hopeful that the consultants can complete their work before the end of the year. First Consulting is expected to report within the next few weeks. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday launched a ranking service for Lloyd's syndicates. Syndicate Stability Rankings awards one, two or three stars to syndicates according to their financial stability. The rankings take into account the syndicates' reported results for the last four years. CORRECTION In a story headlined 'Lloyd's drafts in help from outsiders' in yesterday's FT, reference was made to Mercer Consulting and Mercer Fraser. Both references should have been to Mercer Management Consulting. We apologise for the error.</p>

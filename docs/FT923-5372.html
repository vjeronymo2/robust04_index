			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent feels the absence of London LONDON's closure for the bank holiday yesterday affected levels of trading on the Continent, writes Our Markets Staff. Country by country, share prices moved both ways, the recovery in Germany contrasting with the painful erosion of Nordic equity values. FRANKFURT saw German stock market turnover fall from DM4.7bn to DM4.2bn as equities extended their recovery from last Tuesday's lows, the DAX index rising 24.78, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,541.25. Dealers saw no fundamental reasons for the upturn, but Ms Barbara Schumacher at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf noted that the DAX had doubled a gain of about 12 points which it registered an hour before the official close. Daimler continued its uptrend after last week's interim results, putting on DM14 to DM628 for a gain of nearly 8 per cent since its rebound from 1992 lows began last Wednesday; yet, on analysis, some observers were wary of a 3 per cent drop in oper-ating profits of the car business, on a 9 per cent rise in turnover. They also said that gains in chemicals lacked discrimination, with Bayer, up DM5.70, a good buy on its recent progress report but Hoechst, DM6.50 higher at DM245, seen as distinctly less attractive. The big rise of the day among DAX stocks came from Lufthansa, severely depressed by the problems of the international airline industry but DM8 higher at DM102. Yesterday, talks with unions on a cost-cutting programme entered a final phase and DAG, the smaller of the two unions concerned, offered a year's wage freeze. Among other bombed-out stocks, Metallgesellschaft rose DM10.50 to DM328.50 and Mannesmann DM5 to DM235.50. PARIS ended slightly lower as London's absence and continued uncertainty ahead of the Maastricht referendum reduced turnover to just FFr860m. The CAC-40 index closed 2.65 down at 1,684.88 after a high of 1,695.60 and a low of 1,679.01. Eurotunnel continued to gain on growing optimism of an early resolution to the dispute with TML. The stock added FFr1.30, or 3.6 per cent, at FFr37.70. Among smaller stocks, household appliances maker Seb fell FFr24.90, or 6.1 per cent, to FFr384.10 after disappointing six-month results. STOCKHOLM was held back by firmer domestic interest rates, as the Affarsvarlden general index slipped 7.3 to 772.7, in thin turnover of SKr260m, against SKr532m. The construction group Skanska saw its B free shares drop as low as SKr66 on news that the company will lose SKr500m to SKr600m this year because of unauthorised currency speculation by the president of its finance subsidiary. They later recovered to close a net SKr3, or 4.2 per cent, down at SKr69. Trading in Skanska shares had been halted for 35 minutes pending the announcement. OSLO dropped 4.2 per cent on news of deepening troubles in the country's financial sector. The all-share index was 14.11 weaker at 318.89 in thin trading worth NKr154.8m. Yesterday, a Norwegian court appointed a committee to work out how the investment company, Investa, could repay its debts after winning court protection from its creditors over short-term borrowings of NKr2.8bn. ZURICH featured some action in second liners as the SMI index firmed by 5.9 to 1,751.6. Adia bearers, second on the active list, rose SFr15 to SFr218 on news of a SFr200m loan from its majority shareholders, Mr Klaus Jacobs and the German retail chain Asko. Oerlikon-Buhrle, also actively traded, rose SFr7 to SFr446 ahead of today's conference, at which the engineering and armaments group is expected to confirm that it is making a profit after several years of losses. MILAN had a colourless day as traders felt the absence of London. 'Nobody wants to do anything, the market is without direction,' said one broker in Milan. The Comit index shed 2.67 to 390.93, a new low for the year, in turnover estimated at around Friday's L45.7bn. Weakness in market leaders set the tone for the day's trading, with Fiat losing L51 to L4,019 and Generali falling L120 to L26,130. Montedison showed little reaction to news that chairman Mr Giuseppe Garofano was to be interviewed in connection with a wide-ranging investigation into the financing of political parties by companies. AMSTERDAM ended mixed after a thin session. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.2 to 109.9. In the financial sector, ABN Amro and Aegon, both ex-dividend, fell a net 60 cents and 80 cents respectively, to Fl 42.80 and Fl 59.90. MADRID fell in flimsy trade, the general index closing 0.64 off at 204.97 on a day distinguished only by block trades in the chemicals company Cepsa. VIENNA started the week in a buoyant mood, advancing 2.5 per cent on the back of gains on foreign stock markets. The 18-share ATX index rose 18.22 to 735.58 while the broader bourse index put on 4.04 to 348.41. ISTANBUL gained as hopes for lower bond and deposit rates were refreshed by a newspaper report that sharp rate cuts were awaited at the Treasury's auction this week. The 75-share index climbed 40.63 to 4,157.83. The FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index was unavailable yesterday because of the holiday in the UK.</p>

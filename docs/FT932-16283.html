			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays pressured High Street bank Barclays, which is exposed to troubled hotels group Queens Moat Houses, was under increased pressure yesterday as Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken published a severe sell recommendation. Carr's banking analyst Mr Derek Chambers said that since the bank's massive rights issue in 1988 it has seen its market share fall by between 15 and 20 per cent. He added that even though it needs a higher capital ratio, 'it is difficult to see how the bank. . . can achieve this without another rights issue.' Barclays retreated 10 to 405p.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / US quits Philippine base today US personnel pull out today from the Philippines' Subic Naval Base, the largest American overseas military facility, as part of a process that puts an end to a 45-year military presence. At its busiest in the late 1980s Subic, which served as repair and supply centre for the US Seventh Fleet, was home to more than 6,000 staff and troops and 5,000 or so dependents. A year ago the Philippine Senate voted down a treaty that would have given the bases another 10 years. American spending from the bases represented about 5 per cent of Philippine gross national product, but many argued it distorted growth. The remaining 1,000 base staff are moving to Cubi Point, an adjacent naval air station where the final goodbyes are due in November. An agency formed by Philippine civilian and military officials will now operate the Subic facility. The Philippines continues to have a mutual defence treaty with Washington, and Mr Richard Solomon, the new American ambassador to Manila, said yesterday that the US was ready to work out a new arrangement which could include joint military training and intelligence gathering. The physical infrastructure facilities in the 55,000 acre Subic site are, meanwhile, attracting investors from Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong. Its deep harbour and airstrip offer easy transport. It has its own electric power generator that could shield industries from the pernicious power cuts in Manila. A Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority will oversee the transformation of the base area into an industrial enclave.</p>

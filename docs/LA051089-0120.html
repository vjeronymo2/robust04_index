			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 7 GRATEFUL DEAD FANS ASK IRVINE NOT TO BAN CONCERTS  </P> <P> Seven fans of the rock band the Grateful Dead on Tuesday night urged the Irvine  City Council not to ban concerts but to look for a solution to ensure public  safety at future events.  </P> <P> The council responded by saying the city will continue to work with the  management of the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre to avoid future problems.  </P> <P> The controversy surrounded the band's three-night stand on April 28, 29 and 30.  On the second night 500 fans without tickets reportedly began throwing rocks  and bottles at police and security officers, and lighting bonfires when they  could not get into Irvine Meadows.  </P> <P> Officials said two officers suffered minor injuries and 40 people were  arrested, most for drug-related offenses and assault. The night before, 25  people were arrested and on Sunday night -- the last night -- only nine were  arrested.  </P> <P> The Grateful Dead has been playing since 1965 and has a loyal following of  fans, known as Deadheads, some of whom follow the band from city to city.  </P> <P> After the dust settled from the concert, city officials such as Mayor Larry  Agran cited concern about continuing trouble each time the Grateful Dead  appears at Irvine Meadows. But he said he realized that the council had no  authority to tell Irvine Meadows management whom not to book.  </P> <P> At its meeting Tuesday night, the council agreed that most of the problems  could have been avoided if the event had not been scheduled on the same weekend  as the El Toro Air Show and if more camping grounds were provided.  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Paul Brady said that after the city met with Irvine  Meadows management, amphitheater officials agreed not to schedule events on the  same weekend as the air show and not to have events in which Irvine Meadows  could not provide sufficient security and camping grounds.  </P></p>

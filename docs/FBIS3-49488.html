"We do not want to declare territorial autonomy, but to  economically develop southern Slovakia," said Istvan Pasztor,  chairman of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny  Island and mayor of Komarno, on the demands of the Hungarian  minority.    Ethnic Hungarians do not want "anything but to have the same  rights as are extended to other, purely Slovak regions," said  Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement (MKDH), on the proposal to create new  territorial-administrative units in southern Slovakia, where  ethnic Hungarians make up a majority of the population.    Duray expressed the conviction that after yesterday's  meeting, the Slovak Government and Parliament would not act  against the principles of the European Charter of the Rights of  Minorities and the Charter of Self-Government. He also said  that he would strive for the revision of the Benes Decrees,  under which ethnic Hungarians (as well as the Sudeten Germans)  were expelled after World War II.    Regarding police inspections on the roads to Komarno before  the meeting, which prevented several participants from  attending, Bugar said that the Hungarian deputies in the Slovak  parliament would make an interpellation with the interior  minister. If it is determined that the minister gave the order  to the police, or if he refuses to give an answer, Bugar said  the deputies from Egyutteles and the MKDH would call for his  removal.</p>

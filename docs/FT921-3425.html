			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Independnce brings grist to the mill - James Buxton on Inveresk's new-found freedom and buoyancy MR STEFAN Kay beams with pleasure as he bustles round his paper-mill, and his employees smile warmly back at him. 'You can't imagine the satisfaction we've had in the past 17 months from running our own business,' he says. In the autumn of 1990 Mr Kay and his senior colleagues completed a Pounds 31m management buy-out of Inveresk, the Scotland-based maker of fine paper, from its US owner, Georgia-Pacific (GP). The way Mr Kay tells it, they have not looked back since, and in January this year Inveresk paid off all the Pounds 25m of debt the MBO had lumbered it with. GP had acquired the ailing Inveresk, which had a famous name in British paper-making, in 1981. It was obliged to sell, when in 1990, it bought Great Northern Nekoosa, a US paper-maker, and plunged deeper into debt. GP co-operated in the MBO process put together by Mr Kay, Inveresk managing director since 1988, though the deal took six months to conclude. The MBO brought a change of attitude in the management of Inveresk. Mr Kay says: 'GP hadn't focused on profit. There wasn't an attitude of mind in GP that black numbers are better than red numbers.' This meant plenty of opportunities for the new management to make savings. For example GP was (and still is) a major supplier of pulp to Inveresk, which used to hold between six and 10 weeks' supply at its four relatively small mills, three of them in Scotland and one in Somerset. 'GP said the big inventory didn't matter because the pulp was GP's wherever it was,' says Mr Kay. 'But after the MBO we were paying interest on it.' So Inveresk cut its inventory to between one and two week's supply of pulp. It also tightened up on customer credit arrangements. 'We were paying our creditors in 30 days, but our debtors weren't paying for 60 days. So we went to our creditors and said we'd pay them within 45 or 60 days,' says Mr Kay. 'We also tightened up our debt collection, which had always been good, and tightened up our finished goods stock.' All those measures, says Mr Kay, generated extra cash in a business which turns over about Pounds 100m a year. By the end of December Inveresk went back to its lenders and paid off all Pounds 22m of its senior and Pounds 3.3m of its mezzanine debt. 'We'd never wanted mezzanine financing in the first place,' says Mr Kay. 'We always had an asset base and this was never a leveraged buy-out." Instead of the debt Inveresk took on a Pounds 20m revolving credit facility from banks led by Morgan Grenfell, which had organised the MBO and taken equity in Inveresk. Since gaining control, Mr Kay and his colleagues have made good the lack of investment which affected the later stages of GP's ownership. It spent Pounds 2.5m on installing the latest equipment to make furniture laminate paper at its St Cuthberts mill at Wells, Somerset, a project which, under GP, had been postponed for a year. Some Pounds 1m was spent last year at each of the Scottish mills, and now spending of Pounds 4m has been approved for the Carrongrove mill near Falkirk to increase output of the coated board the used for the covers of company reports, a project which Mr Kay calls a strategic investment. Other spending is aimed at removing bottlenecks in the mills and gradually moving them from working five and a half days a week to seven days a week. 'It's satisfying to be able to work up your investment projects and present them to your own board for approval rather than taking them to Atlanta,' says Mr Kay, who runs the company from Caldwells Mill at Inverkeithing, on the Fife side of the Forth Bridge. Although three of the four mills are working at full capacity, Inveresk is finding conditions tight in the paper industry - the mills are operating with only a two to three week supply of orders. But although Mr Kay sees no sign of an upturn in the UK economy, the company is not wholly dependent on the UK market: some 40 per cent of its output is exported, mostly to EC countries including Germany and France, and these markets have held up reasonably well. 'Building up other people's confidence in us in our export markets was a 10-year process,' says Mr Kay. 'The Germans don't understand quality failure. From their point of view the fact that you are 500 miles away doesn't mean you can't deliver at 10am on Tuesday. They allow you just one hour each way on delivery.' Inveresk's priority now is to increase capacity utilisation at its mills and grow organically, but it is also keeping an eye on investment opportunities. These are likely to be in Germany, France or other EC countries, since most paper mills in the UK are owned by large groups. Part of the Pounds 20m revolving credit might have to be used to finance production to meet an upturn in demand. In a few weeks' time the company should report pre-tax profits for the year to December 1 1991 of just under Pounds 6m. As for the future, Mr Kay says: 'We recognise that our backers are not in it for a terribly long haul.' The equity providers, as well as Morgan Grenfell, are County NatWest Ventures, 3i and Prudential Venture Managers. Mr Kay lists the options: Inveresk could be sold to another company in a trade sale; it could obtain a quote through a reverse takeover; or it could seek a stock exchange listing. 'A trade sale is not personally very attractive to me,' he says, 'but there could obviously be a price at which it was acceptable. It's difficult to see who one would do a reverse takeover with. So that leaves a stock exchange listing. We're looking at it, but not on a tremendously urgent timescale. We're thinking in terms of the end of this year, next year or into 1994.'</p>

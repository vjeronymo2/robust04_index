			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan's two-way trade  totaled U.S.$40 billion in the first three months of this year,  cp 3.3 percent from the same period of 1993, according to  customs statistics released Saturday [26 April].    Of the amount, exports accounted for U.S.$20.1 billion, up a  marginal 0.4 percent from the year-earlier level, while imports  rose 6.3 percent to U.S.$19.9 billion.    Taiwan's major trade partners for the period were Asia,  North  America, Europe, the Middle East, Oceania, Africa, South America  and Central America in that order.    Compared with the first quarter of 1993, two-way trade with  Asia rose 8 percent, while trade with North America and Europe  edged up less than 1 percent.    Trade with Central America registered an impressive 50.8  percent increase during the three-month period as compared with  the year before. Taiwan exported U.S.$400 million worth of  goods to Central American countries during the period, while  imports totaled only U.S.$37 million.    The figures indicated that Central America is a promising  market worth tapping by Taiwan manufacturers, trade officials  said.    Two-way trade with South America rose 3 percent, while trade  with the Middle East, Oceania and Africa fell 7 percent, 3  percent and 18 percent respectively.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- Top Japanese and  U.S. trade negotiators ended a predawn meeting Friday [11  February] apparently without breaking a deadlock on how to  measure imports to Japan and leaving the success of the imminent  U.S-Japan summit in jeopardy.    "It remains somewhat difficult," Japan's Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata told reporters after emerging from a three-hour  meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor.    Hata said he is not sure whether he and Kantor will  return to the negotiating table prior to the summit meeting  between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill  Clinton.    Hata and Kantor resumed the latest round of negotiations,  their third since Thursday morning, at 1 A.M. Friday in a bid  to break the deadlock in the ongoing trade talks.    "There is always room for mutual concessions," Hata told  reporters on arrival at Kantor's office, fanning hopes that an  accord could be coming.    Hata returned to face the top U.S. trade negotiator after  consultations with Hosokawa, who arrived in Washington Thursday  evening for the summit meeting with Clinton.    Negotiators from the two countries have been trying to  hammer  out an accord by the time the two leaders sit down for talks at  11:30 A.M. Friday (1:30 A.M. Saturday Japan time.)    Japanese officials said the United States insists on working  out "objective critieria" -- some kind of measurable goals -- to  gauge Japan's progress in opening its markets to foreign  products.    "Without objective criteria, we can't have a good  agreement,"  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was quoted as saying in a  separate meeting with Hata Thursday evening.    Senior Clinton administration officials have warned that  Clinton has made it clear he would rather have no agreement than  "a bad agreement" reached by papering over differences.    In between negotiations with Kantor, Hata also took up  Japan's case -- Tokyo's commitment to open up its markets and  deregulate its economy -- in separate meetings with Vice  President Al Gore and Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    Hata even took time out from a frenzied schedule for an  informal dinner meeting with U.S. lawmakers to sound out the  mood at Capitol Hill, which has increasingly called for a  get-tough U.S. trade policy with Japan.    There was no crack in the responses Hata heard from his U.S.  hosts.    Japanese officials said Gore reiterated the Clinton  administration's position that "objective criteria" are  essential for measuring trade results.    The controversy stems from an agreement reached between  Tokyo  and Washington last July that provides for the use of "objective  criteria, either qualitative or quantitative," to determine  whether foreign companies had made headway in penetrating the  Japanese market.    U.S. officials have argued for a "results-oriented" trade  policy with Japan as past trade agreements have failed to dent  Japan's global trade surplus, which totaled 130 billion dollars  last year, almost half of it with the United States.    Christopher, talking to reporters before his meeting with  Hata, emphasized that Washington is determined to change the  situation.    "The United States is determined that we will redress the  great imbalance in our trade. We will seek in a determined way  access for American business in the Japanese market,"  Christopher said in a photo-taking session prior to his meeting  with Hata.    The sharp dispute over "objective criteria" was not the only  problem Hata faced in his encounters with key members of the  Clinton administration Thursday.    Washington also launched a barrage of criticism against the  15 trillion yen tax cut and government spending plan Tokyo  announced earlier this week, saying it will be ineffective for  stimulating the ailing Japanese economy.    Japanese officials said Hata heard the U.S. displeasure in  talks with both Bentsen and Gore.    Christopher openly criticized the Japanese economic plan in  the photo-session with Hata, saying the U.S. is "disappointed"  with the program.    Along with opening markets, Tokyo also pledged last July to  take macroeconomic measures to stimulate the Japanese economy as  part of Japan's efforts to reduce its global trade surplus by  boosting demand for imports.    The shape of the Japanese economy is expected to be high on  the agenda at the Friday meeting between Hosokawa and Clinton.</p>

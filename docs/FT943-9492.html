			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Senate votes cash to cut Jordan debt The US Congress yesterday tossed its contribution into the Middle East peace pot when the Senate voted to set aside money for reducing Jordan's debt. In voting for final passage of a Dollars 13.8bn (Pounds 9bn) foreign aid bill, which now goes to President Bill Clinton for signature, the Senate agreed to set aside Dollars 99m to reduce Jordan's debt burden. Mr Clinton promised King Hussein of Jordan relief on Dollars 700m of debt, and the Senate vote yesterday will allow him to achieve nearly a third of that. Peace in the Middle East has always been a central theme in justifying the US aid budget to a reluctant Congress. The debt relief for Jordan, however, has a direct link to the country's decision to end four decades of hostility, while the lion's share of the US aid budget still goes as military assistance to Egypt and Israel. All told, Israel is allocated Dollars 3bn and Egypt Dollars 2.1bn, together nearly 40 per cent of the total US aid budget. The foreign aid bill also includes Dollars 50m for emergency assistance to Rwandan refugees. Another Dollars 170m of Rwandan aid is to be included in a defence spending bill, and congressional leaders have promised to consider an additional Dollars 100m requested by Mr Clinton later this year. Another measure ends the formal ban on US aid to Vietnam. Although no money is set aside for Vietnam, the step could allow the US Export-Import Bank to provide credits for US businesses there.</p>

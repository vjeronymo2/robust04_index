			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Polish defence minister sacked President Lech Walesa of Poland yesterday sacked Mr Piotr Kolodziejczyk, defence minister, at the request of Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister. The dismissal of Mr Kolodziejczyk - a 55-year-old retired navy admiral who has been defence minister since the new leftist government was formed a year ago - follows a conflict between the civilian minister and the military over spending, reforms and control of the army. President Walesa had asked Mr Kolodziejczyk to resign after military officials criticised the minister during a meeting at a battlefield in Drawsko Pomorskie on September 30. The minister had refused and had the backing of parliament in what was seen as a struggle between the president and the cabinet over control of the military. However, Mr Pawlak yesterday unexpectedly wrote to the president requesting his dismissal. Mr Pawlak said Mr Kolodziejczyk had failed to 'normalise the situation in the defence ministry'. The move comes two days after Mr Joseph Kruzel, the US deputy assistant defence secretary, gave his backing to the minister on a visit to Poland.</p>

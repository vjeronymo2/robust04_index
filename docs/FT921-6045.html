			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds/Macarthy It was eminently predictable that Lloyds Chemists would resume last year's stymied attempt to take over Macarthy. After all, the referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of its original paper bid was one of the Trade Secretary's stranger decisions. If anything, though, the delay has helped. Lloyds's higher share price means it can make its higher bid at the cost of less cash. It has found an underwriter for a cash alternative, while a problem over Macarthy's wholesale drug supplier conveniently dissolved. More fundamentally, when it bid last August, Lloyds was fresh from the acquisition of Kingswood and an accompanying Pounds 71m rights issue. The referral gave it a chance to catch its breath before resuming its relentless dash for growth. The proposed shape of the combined group is clear enough. Lloyds will have 60 per cent gearing on net assets of perhaps Pounds 80m, so some smart work will be required to generate cash and restore the balance sheet to health. Shareholders have grown used by now to seeing the equity base expand, but have been kept happy since 1986 by a compound annual growth rate in earnings of 37 per cent. That may slow, but by normal measures Lloyds' shares are cheap and the group should easily outperform other retailers for another year or two. The trick for investors will be in timing a switch should Lloyds' management show signs of wanting to diversify away from chemists shops and health foods.</p>

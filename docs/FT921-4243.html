			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / American productivity rises 0.3% last year THE productivity of American workers inched up 0.3 per cent last year as the economy struggled to emerge from the recession, the US government said yesterday, AP reports from Washington. The growth reversed two years of decline. The Labor Department also said productivity in the final three months of 1991 jumped a revised 1.7 per cent annual rate, more than the 1.1 per cent estimated initially. Productivity had increased by a 0.9 per cent annual rate in the third quarter, 1.9 per cent in the second and 0.1 per cent in the first. Increased productivity, defined as getting more output from workers per hour of work, is considered vital to increasing Americans' standard of living without increasing inflation. It also boosts the competitiveness of US goods overseas. The 0.3 per cent annual growth in productivity was a bit stronger than the 0.2 per cent initial estimate.</p>

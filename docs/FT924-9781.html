			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Victory For Clinton: It's just too much for folks in Little Rock EXCITED crowds of Arkansans and tourists yesterday descended on a 16-block area cordoned off in Little Rock for a giant America's Watch Party and to celebrate a historic shift in US politics. Governor Bill Clinton's final punishing 28-hour, eight-state drive to win the US presidency had ended when his aircraft touched down in Little Rock at 10am and he was surrounded by 500 supporters. Looking energised, he drove by motorcade to vote. When his limousine stopped near an elementary school, children he had often visited rushed over. His secret service guards seemed less nervous as he was engulfed in a mass of tiny arms. Not yet accustomed to special treatment, Mr Clinton, his wife Hillary and their daughter Chelsea, waited in a long queue to vote. From there he was to go to the governor's mansion to rest. In the Clinton-Gore headquarters in the Arkansas state capital, red-eyed and weary, 400 senior officials had supervised a massive turn-out-the-vote effort. Some 12m telephone calls were made to voters in the last hours of the campaign; 250,000 workers were organised to bring voters to the polls. Ms Betsey Wright, deputy chair of the Clinton campaign, said plans were under way to extend this effort to give US voters a role in the transition to a new government through 'a modern communications mechanism'. Clinton staff have talked of establishing a special toll-free telephone number to allow citizens to express 'those ideas that have been stifled across the country'. Ms Wright expressed intense bitterness about President George Bush's criticism of Arkansas during the campaign and said it was unprecedented for a sitting president to attack a state. The president had opined that Mr Clinton was 'the failed governor of a small state'. Many Little Rock people seemed stunned by the visiting hordes. Many expressed indifference to Mr Clinton and talked about his tax increases. 'Bill Clinton is much more unpopular in Little Rock than he is outside outside the city,' said Mr Marc Ginsberg, the governor's deputy press secretary. 'Little Rock is an island unto itself. There is an historical relationship of hostility between the city and the rest of the state. It is sort of like Paris to the rest of France.' However, at Hot Springs, 55 miles from Little Rock, there were few indications of popular support for the governor. One sign proudly proclaimed Hot Springs 'Bill Clinton's Home Town'. Another sign along the highway exhorted: 'Christians, vote God's heart, not your pocket book.' Back in the Paris of Arkansas, outside the centre set up for the media, crowds of tourists listened to blaring jazz and rock music. Visiting dignitaries and wealthy contributors were checking into the luxury downtown hotels. Shops did a brisk business in campaign buttons, balloons and T-shirts. Inside the headquarters, tourists were reading letters from small children to Mr Clinton. One demanded to know if he would raise taxes. A seven-year-old girl said he had won her backing, not because her parents supported him, but because 'I think you will make a better tomorrow and I think you would be for women's rights.'</p>

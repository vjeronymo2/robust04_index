			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VISITS U.S. TROOPS  </P> <P> The picture on the front page of your Thanksgiving edition showing President  Bush laughing with Saudi King Fahd was obscene. To see Bush laughing with the  oil king of Saudi Arabia, when he has ordered thousands of young Americans to  die in the desert, as he prepares to unleash a horrifying war that may include  chemical and nuclear bombs, is disgusting. Shame!  </P> <P> BASIL LANGTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

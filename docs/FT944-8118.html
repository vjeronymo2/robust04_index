			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Palestinian aid programme 'has been failure' The international aid programme to Palestinians has been a 'failure', the United Nations said yesterday, warning that unless donors urgently changed strategy, further violence could erupt in the Gaza Strip, torpedoing Middle East peace. In his strongest and most sombre assessment yet, Mr Terje Larsen, UN under-secretary-general for Palestinian territories, said living standards in Gaza were falling 'like lead'; donors were largely to blame for the looming Palestinian economic crisis. 'The situation in Gaza is more dangerous today than before the peace agreement was signed,' Mr Larsen said in an interview with the Financial Times. 'The gap between expectations and delivery is so large, and unless donors get together to deliver, the peace process will fail. Time is running out. We are at the edge. It could collapse any day.' Mr Larsen's remarks came as tension between Mr Yassir Arafat's supporters and the Islamic militant opposition continued on the streets of Gaza. Up to 10,000 loyalists of Mr Arafat's Fatah faction, hundreds firing guns in the air, chanted warnings to Islamic groups they blame for last Friday's internal violence which left 14 Palestinians dead. Mr Arafat encouraged the demonstrators, calling the march a referendum on the self-rule authority he controls and on the Palestine Liberation Organisation. 'The state of alert continues. You are the protectors of security, no one can take away from Fatah and the Palestinian police.' Leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had not reached agreement with Mr Arafat on how to calm the situation since Friday's killings; each side accused the other of being 'traitors'. Mr Larsen said World Bank figures showed only Dollars 140m disbursed to Palestinians this year of a total Dollars 700m (Pounds 437m) pledged for 1994. Most had gone for salaries and running costs of the Palestinian authority; only one project, to clean up Gaza, had made any impact on living standards. 'The donor effort is a failure; the strategy wrong, the priorities wrong and the timetable wrong. There has been an over-emphasis on long-term projects, but the poor and hungry and sick can't wait. If there is no food for the children and no heat for the winter, who will support the authority and the peace process?' Donors needed to refocus aid on public works to generate employment in Gaza (unemployment 52 per cent), and where at least one-third of families live below the poverty line of Dollars 470 a year. A public works programme worth up to Dollars 100m to provide 20,000 jobs for the next six months was needed within 'weeks' to save the peace process. Mr Larsen criticised Israel's closure of the Gaza border which stops thousands of Palestinians reaching their jobs in Israel. 'The policy of closure is a collective punishment. It undermines the peace experiment, donor efforts and Israeli interests. It must be stopped immediately.' Palestinians were to blame for disorganisation and inconsistency, but donors should have found ways to disburse the money they promised. 'Predominantly I criticise donors, not the Palestinians.'</p>

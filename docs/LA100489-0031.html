			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> San Diego police are searching for two men who escaped from the back seat of  separate police cars parked at police headquarters Monday, a police spokesman  said.  </P> <P> Police said a man who identified himself as Chris A. Brown, 31, of 30th Street,  escaped about 2 p.m. from a police car parked in the basement area of police  headquarters at 1401 Broadway. Officials are "perplexed" by the escape and  unable to explain how the handcuffed Brown managed to get outside the vehicle,  spokesman Bill Robinson said.  </P> <P> To compound the situation, Robinson said another man, identified as Martin  Garcia, 29, escaped about two hours after Brown. Officials suspect that Brown  returned to the area and released Garcia by opening the police car door,  Robinson said. Both Brown and Garcia were in custody on suspicion of auto  theft, he said.  </P> <P> Robinson said standard procedure calls for officers to leave suspects  unattended while they run record checks before transporting them to County  Jail. The building's parking area is enclosed by fences, he said.  </P> <P> Officials suspect that Brown and Garcia fled through a pedestrian gate used by  Police Department personnel, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Robinson said that he could not recall a similar escape but that the procedure  for leaving suspects unattended while officers enter the headquarters building  is under review.  </P></p>

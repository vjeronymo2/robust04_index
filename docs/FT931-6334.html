			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Observer: Nothing ventured If anyone doubted Robert Drummond, chairman of the British Venture Capital Association, when he said back in January that one of the biggest challenges facing venture capitalists was raising new funds, they should have been watching the final episode of BBC2's Adventurers programme. The series, based on Drummond's own venture capital firm, Grosvenor Venture Managers, revealed that Grosvenor set out in early 1992 to raise Pounds 60m. It was forced progressively to reduce its sights until, by the end of the series, it had gathered in only Pounds 7m. On top of this, the two young turks who joined the firm at the start of the series were both quitting. Clearly Drummond has not got the same sort of star qualities as TV Troubleshooter Sir John Harvey-Jones who comes from the same TV production stable. But it would be a great pity if Drummond's experience deterred others from revealing warts and all on camera.</p>

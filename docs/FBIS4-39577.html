			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Doctor of Economic Sciences, Professor </F> Nikolay Shmelev by unnamed ITAR-TASS Correspondent:  "Treasury-Funded Enterprises -- A Means of Softening the Blow"  -- first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] The Russian President's recent edicts remain a  topic for discussion among economists and politicians. Your  ITAR-TASS correspondent met with Doctor of Economic Sciences,  Professor Nikolay Shmelev.    [Correspondent] What is your assessment of the package of  "economic" edicts that the president has signed?    [Shmelev] I do not know about the "mini economic revolution"  that some newspapers have been talking about, but the very fact  that these edicts have appeared attests to the desire of the  country's leadership to move forward and not merely stand still.    Take taxation policy, for example. Perhaps I am  oversimplifying things but for a long time I have wondered why  our leadership just cannot understand that the lower a tax is,  the higher the tax yield to the treasury is, and not vice versa?  But our age-old tradition is to live by "jacking up prices"  rather than by increasing turnover, a practice which we did not  change in the period of liberalization. Let us recall, for  example, the fuss that the first congress of people's deputies  made about the progressive tax on personal incomes but the  result was that if you earned just slightly more than a nurse  there was no point in working, you had to resort to theft...  Gaydar introduced some incredible taxes, which he justified  with a single moral argument: I know that this is bad, he said,  but the budget has to be balanced somehow and the gaps have to  be plugged: Just as soon as things get a little easier we will  have a normal taxation system. In our country, however,  everyone has known for a long time that there are no  difficulties more permanent than the temporary ones.    These edicts seem to reflect the philosophy that President  Reagan pursued with such success: He cut taxes to a little over  30 percent, freed investments from tax, and as a result the  treasury received more than it had done beforehand. If we  really start to be guided by the same principles -- if we reduce  the infamous value-added tax, finally exempt investments from  tax, give tax breaks to new investors, including foreigners, cut  the rate of profits tax, and so forth -- the situation will be  encouraging.    In the final analysis there is a political interest to all  this. Just look at the pressure from taxation in Russia on  industrial enterprises and on private business, in particular.  The tax system drives private initiative out onto the street,  into "back alleys," into street stalls, or at best into  commercial banks -- fine, just so long as that doesn't mean into  mafia structures. There are not many people who want to engage  in the business of production because that is known to be a  loss-making venture. And if we are finally beginning to  overcome this tendency, it means there is the likelihood that  the Russian economy will become more efficient. Second, even  though there is a certain naivety in these documents -- they  contain all sorts of fines and penalties for nonpayment and so  forth -- an attempt by the state to take control of the tax  sphere can only be welcomed.    [Correspondent] But how do you regard the idea of creating a  new category of production units in state ownership -- the  so-called "treasury-funded [kazennyy] enterprises"?    [Shmelev] In principle this is a good attempt to begin the  scrapping of production units that are not viable by means of  direct adinistrative pressure on them. We have not yet made up  our minds to resort to the normal and natural market method of  bankruptcy even though it is clear that in the end we cannot  avoid this. But you can understand this indecision. It is due  to the fear of unemployment, the next social catastrophe after  the confiscation of savings and the fall in the living standard.  "Treasury-funded enterprises" are the means whereby we hope to  soften the blow.    [Correspondent] What about the edict on abolishing export  licenses and quotas?    [Shmelev] I know that some businessmen do not see this as a  particular improvement because the export sales outlets have  still been carved up by monopolists. Nevertheless, we should  consider the fact that Russia is still virtually the only  country in the world which pursued the absurd policy of curbing  its own exports. Not encouraging them, but curbing them!    Of course, there were objective reasons for that, the main  one being that domestic prices, primarily for raw materials, lag  behind world prices. Now prices are evening out and the  potential for making a fortune through export speculation is  being nullified. Another reason is the massive exodus of capital  abroad. Nevertheless, restrictions on the export of  non-strategic goods, not MiG's or nuclear technologies but the  most ordinary goods, is the height of absurdity. The fact that  we are doing away with it, that we are moving in our economic  philosophy away from the absurd ("Beware! They Are Selling  Russia Off!") toward common sense is an undoubted blessing.</p>

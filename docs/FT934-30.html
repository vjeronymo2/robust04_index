			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc price forecast to shine in new year Lead is the non-ferrous metal likely to show the biggest average price increase in 1994 but zinc is expected to be the best-performing of the materials traded on the London Metal Exchange, according to Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at T. Hoare and Co., the financial services company. 'While lead prices are expected to peak around the end of the first quarter, zinc looks to be in a bull market which is likely to be sustained through the year,' she says in a special report, Base Metals, 1994. Both lead and zinc mines have been cutting output in 1993 and these cuts are now flowing through into smelter and refinery closures, Ms O'Connell points out. She forecasts that lead prices will move up by more than 21 per cent from an average of 19 US cents a pound in 1993 to 23 cents in 1994. However, the 1994 first-half average of 24 cents will ease back to 22 cents in the second six months, she predicts. Meanwhile, an 11.4 per cent price rise is forecast for zinc, taking it from an average of 44 cents a pound in 1993 to 49 cents. Ms O'Connell suggests that zinc's 1994 first-half average will be 48 cents, moving up to 50 cents in the second half. According to the analyst, nickel will experience the biggest price fall in 1994, one of 7.4 per cent from an average of Dollars 2.43 a pound to Dollars 2.25. Nickel is the only metal for which she expects demand to fall in 1994, from an estimated 651,000 tonnes in 1993 to 634,000 tonnes. Copper's average price is predicted to fall by 6.3 per cent, from 88 US cents a pound to 82.5 cents, while aluminium's, already very depressed, is forecast to fall from 53 US cents a pound to 51 cents.</p>

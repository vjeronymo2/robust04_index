			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LEBANON;  </P> <P> AOUN SUPPORTERS DISRUPT FUNERAL  </P> <P> Thousands of supporters of Lebanon's defiant Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, vowing to  die defending him, disrupted the funeral of demonstrators who were among 25  killed while protesting a blockade of his territory in Beirut. The open-air  service for six of Aoun's followers, who had taken part in the candle-lit  protest march Monday night, was repeatedly drowned out by chants against  leading Roman Catholic and Maronite churchmen who failed to attend. Aoun has  been locked in a power struggle with President Elias Hrawi, whom Aoun refuses  to recognize.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JOSE;  </P> <P> DOG PEDIGREE PAPERS ARE LABELED 'A JOKE'  </P> <P> The American Kennel Club has certified thousands of dogs across the country  that investigators contend were fraudulently registered and others whose  pedigrees are uncertain, according to a newspaper report. "The breeders and the  pet stores all know the AKC papers are a joke, but they make their livelihood  on it," Robert Baker, a veteran investigator with the Humane Society of the  United States, told the San Jose Mercury News.  </P> <P> Club officials said the organization routinely accepts a dog owner's word that  an animal is a purebred and does little to verify the applications for the 1.3  million dogs it registers each year. "Basically, the whole system is based on  trust; let's face it," said AKC President Kenneth Marden. The AKC has never  said registering a dog guarantees its breeding, he said, although the public  generally believes that to be true.  </P></p>

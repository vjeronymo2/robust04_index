			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Sterling firmer against both the dollar and D-Mark The D-Mark lost ground on the markets yesterday as the post-election rally in the currency faded, writes Philip Gawith. The generalised weakness confirmed the view that the relative strength of the D-Mark against the dollar, over the past few days, was more a case of US currency weakness than D-Mark strength. The D-Mark finished in London at FFr3.431, from FFr3.434. It was also lower against the Italian lira, which closed at L1,020 from L1,023. After an overnight low of DM1.4930, the dollar stayed above DM1.50 for most of the day, ending at DM1.5003, from DM1.5036. Against the yen it was barely changed at Y97.685 from Y97.85. It closed in New York at DM1.5025 and Y97.725. Sterling had a good day, rising against both the dollar and the D-Mark. It finished at Dollars 1.6154, from Dollars 1.6074, and at DM2.4235 from DM2.4168. The phenomenon of sterling simultaneously rising against both the D-Mark and the dollar has been fairly rare recently. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said that, during the spring, the pound moved down with the dollar about 90 per cent of the time. More recently, the two have moved in opposite directions around 25 per cent of the time. In spite of yesterday's move, he said there was not yet enough evidence to suggest that the link between the two currencies had been broken. On a trade weighted performance, sterling remains fairly weak. It finished at 80, compared to a high for the year of around 83 in February. Against the D-Mark, it also remains close to the lows for the year. Against the dollar, however, the picture is brighter, with the pound near a two-year high. Mr Rob Loewy, head of foreign exchange at Midland Global Markets, reported 'fairly strong institutional demand against both the dollar and the D-Mark'. 'It seems to be the case that a lot of UK corporates pre-sold sterling on its rise above Dollars 1.55. Now there is an absence of supply and this has encouraged buying.' Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro, noted that options volatility in sterling had risen more than in the D-Mark since the start of the week. 'This suggests there is more of a fear of sterling, rather than the D-Mark, rising sharply against the dollar.' Relative short-term interest rates provide some support for sterling strength. Three-month money in the US is currently around 5.5 per cent, compared to 5.2 per cent in Germany and 6 per cent in the UK. Consumer inflation, however, is around 2 per cent in the UK, compared to 3 per cent in the US and Germany, so sterling compares even more favourably from the point of view of real interest rates. The dollar was fairly subdued after Monday's weakness. 'There is certainly not the same sense of panic about the dollar that we saw yesterday,' said Mr Loewy, although the currency did wobble at one point on rumours, later denied, that Fed vice-chairman Mr Alan Blinder had said US interest rates would not need to rise again this year. The flip-side of this was a more sober attitude towards the D-Mark. After the rush to buy D-Marks on Friday and Monday, there was some evidence yesterday that investors had begun to take profits. Mr Loewy said he did not think the market was expecting central bank intervention at current levels. The speed of a currency's fall is normally as important as the level to which it has fallen in determining central bank activity. The dollar had dropped nine pfennigs in 11 days - to DM1.5170 from DM1.6050  -when, in July, it was the subject of co-ordinated central bank intervention. The US currency will face a renewed test today with the release of August trade figures. A larger than expected deficit will refocus attention on the US's trade dispute with Japan. Recent figures from Japan show its bilateral trade surplus with the US rose in September to Dollars 5.8bn from Dollars 5.7bn. In the futures market, short sterling paused for a breather after the recent rally which has seen shorter-dated contracts rise 60 to 70 basis points. Traders said the market was in a consolidation phase. Volumes were fairly low, with the December contract trading only 22,685 contracts to close at 93.54 from 93.61. The December Euromark contract ended unchanged at 94.82. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.207bn of assistance after forecasting a Pounds 1.2bn shortage. Overnight money traded between 3 and 6 1/8 per cent.</p>

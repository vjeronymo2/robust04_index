			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: OECD employment plan called into question Sir, You report that the OECD has revised its growth forecast for Germany for 1994 upward from 0.8 per cent to 1.8 per cent ('Retreat by bunds drags European prices lower', June 8). These figures may appear trifling but they represent huge sums of money. Instead of adding Dollars 12bn to its gross domestic product - the OECD's original estimate - the Paris statisticians now say Dollars 28bn of extra wealth will be created in Germany. There are three important conclusions that can be drawn from this. First, what other economic organisation gets its forecast wrong by more than 100 per cent? Second, how is this impressive German growth squared with complaints that Germany has the highest social costs, highest wages, and most powerful unions and works councils in the world? Third, should we take much notice of the OECD plan for employment which is largely based on theories of deregulation, lower wages and longer work hours which have only increased poverty and social division when applied in the UK and US in recent years?

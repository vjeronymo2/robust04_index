			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Travel: Gulliver meets an Asian goddess - David Pilling visits Khatmandu and learns about the rigorous process of selecting a Kumari, a child worshipped as a living goddess by the Nepalese TAKE one three-year-old girl with the eyelashes of a cow and a neck like a conch shell. Lead her into a darkened room filled with freshly-severed buffalo heads. If she remains calm, you may have a goddess on your hands. The selection process for the Kumari - a prepubescent girl worshipped in Nepal as a living goddess - is a rigorous affair. Girls must be born into the goldsmith caste and display 32 characteristics including spiralling lines on the soles of the feet; long and well-formed toes; cheeks like a lion; small and well-recessed sexual organs, and a body shaped like a banyan tree. Any child so anatomically blessed, one might imagine, would automatically win the right to be worshipped. Not at all. The contestants are then put through a trial of bravery, their nerve tested at the dead of night with bloody animal heads and men in demon masks. The victorious girl, untroubled by such foolish pranks, must then have her horoscope scrutinised. Assuming that her astral inheritance does not clash with that of the king, she is proclaimed a living goddess and taken to a house in Khatmandu to live out her prepubescent years. I set off one afternoon in search of this diminutive deity. Flagging down a cycle rickshaw in Thamel, the part of Khatmandu favoured by budget travellers, I asked the boyish cyclist to pedal me to the Kumari's palace. As we creaked and sloshed through the narrow, medieval streets of old Khatmandu, hot drops of monsoon rain slid from the heavy air. The rickshaw driver struggled to maintain speed and a patch of perspiration spread steadily across his back. Old Khatmandu is like a large city shoehorned into a confined space where tumbledown brick buildings, as well as people, seem to jostle for position. Houses, temples and roads have a hunched, bundled, slightly distorted appearance as though reflected in the back of a spoon. As I rattled by, I felt positively Gulliverian, thrust into an Asian Lilliput. The toy-town feel is exacerbated by Khatmandu's architecture, which features intricately-carved wooden balconies, gilded roofs, cascading multi-tiered pagodas, Buddhist stupas like inverted ice-cream cones, and doll-house shops crammed with sacks of spices, household goods and religious paraphernalia. We progressed through the warren-like streets, forcing a swathe through the press of people. Many were carrying black umbrellas which they whisked from our path as the rickshaw rattled by. Eventually we clattered to a halt near the Kumari's palace. I settled my fare with a dog-eared note and approached the home of the living goddess. The imposing gate at the palace threshold was flanked by two shoulder-high stone lions, painted in primary colours. Just inside was a small anteroom where a watchman lay asleep in a dusty alcove. Passing into the 18th century courtyard, I looked up at the decaying copper-coloured brickwork and the dark wood of the ornate windows. Behind one of these carved marvels, the living goddess was now hidden. The Kumari's life is not that of a regular child. Once taken into the palace she does not emerge again, save for the odd religious festival, until she becomes 'impure' - either at menstruation, or after bleeding heavily from the loss of a tooth. On the rare occasions she leaves the palace, the little goddess's feet must not touch the ground for fear of pollution, a stipulation that obliges her to walk on cloth or be carried in a wooden chariot. The Kumari's daily routine includes sitting patiently on a throne while she is worshipped by a stream of devotees, playing with her nurse's grandchildren, and appearing at her window for the benefit of tourists. Her appearances at the balcony must on no account be photographed. Once a year the king comes to worship. The Kumari bestows upon him authority to rule the nation by placing the red tika mark on his forehead. On one occasion, a rather disobedient little goddess ignored the king and placed the tika instead on the smooth forehead of his son. The king, needless to say, died within a few months and power passed to the prince. The goddess's most riotous time comes during the festival of Bhadra Kumari when thousands gather in the square outside her house. Three huge chariots, one for her and two for her male attendants, wait outside. Bands play and masked dancers leap about. As the king and queen appear on a balcony opposite, the Kumari emerges decked from head to toe - not a great distance in a five-year-old - in fabulous jewellery. A goat is sacrificed on the yoke of her chariot which then moves off slowly through Khatmandu as guns fire and the king bows in respect. The next day, the procession again trundles through the streets, pausing before a demon-like mask with white fangs and staring red eyes. Beer spews from the mask's mouth, arching into the crowd and precipitating a frenzied struggle for the holy liquid. The Kumari, too, partakes. For one accustomed to being the centre of such grand events, puberty must come as quite a shock. On this day the young girl's godlike powers desert her and she must leave the palace forever, never again to be worshipped or revered. From being a living deity whose every whim is answered, she is transformed overnight into a rather awkward teenager with few friends, a rudimentary education and next to no experience of the world beyond her palace walls. Former Kumaris receive a state pension, but some ex-goddesses have had difficulty adapting to the daily slog. Many find it hard to secure a husband since a Kumari must overcome the widely held belief that any man who marries her is doomed to an early grave. I was lost in thought - thinking how strange it was that a few hours in a jet plane had brought me to a country where such beliefs were common currency - when I suddenly became aware of movement at the balcony above. I looked up to see a young and slender woman with a small child in her arms. It took me a second to realise that this small child was the goddess herself. Her tiny body was swathed in red silk and a red bow nestled in her hair. The goddess's face was painted extravagantly with coal-black makeup which curved from her piercing eyes to the tips of her ears. Suddenly she was gone. As she was looking down on me - I was alone in the courtyard - she had begun to squirm impatiently, evidently on the verge of a tantrum. Her attendant had quickly whisked her away before she could begin to cry. This little girl, who had looked upon bloodied buffalo heads with equanimity, had reacted to my face with rather less composure. I headed back to my hotel feeling all-too-mortal, avoiding mirrors all the way. David Pilling travelled c/o London-based Promotion Nepal (3 Wellington Terrace, Bayswater Rd, W2 4LW; tel: 071-229-3528) and local operator Temple Tiger. Nepal has three main attractions: Khatmandu for temples and culture; the mountains for trekking; and Chitwan national park for tigers. Promotion Nepal offers tours combining some or all of these elements. For example, the 'Complete Picture' tour incorporates Khatmandu, the classic Annapurna sanctuary trek and a stay at Chitwan with white-water rafting and an elephant safari. This 21-day tour starts at Pounds 1,600. More modest trips begin at around Pounds 1,000. Flights from the UK are with Royal Nepal Airlines which operates the only direct route to Khatmandu, twice weekly from Gatwick.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fahmi Huwaydi: "Review of the Season's </F> Testimony"]    [Text] I do not know when we will stop being frivolous in  handling an issue as serious and dangerous as terrorism. I  maintain, however, that the interview with a repentant extremist  which Egyptian television broadcast three times last week raises  several serious issues for discussion.    By frivolity I mean the attitude of treating the issue  superficially, focussing on some outward features, and  summarizing the entire affair with a collection of anecdotes and  sensational headlines harping on the same old story--primarily  that those groups contain only young guys with sexual and  emotional hangups who receive orders and financing from abroad.  The media has persistently driven this image home by various  means, most recently via television soap operas and motion  pictures.    This method is especially bad because it caters to our  spontaneous and emotional responses and fosters in us an  attitude of disgust. It bypasses our minds and does not require  us to think. It makes people angry without understanding why  they are angry and therefore convinces them that the individuals  concerned are evil, deviant, criminal. People do not understand  why those individuals are like that. Were they born that way or  were they originally good and later became perverted? The root  cause of the problem is ignored and the essential question "why"  is not asked, so it follows that no one asks: "What should be  done?"    To be precise, in this way of addressing the issue we are  preoccupied with the sick person while ignoring the sickness.  It is a method of caricaturing terrorists and terrorist  behavior. The terrorist dossier itself, however, is left  unopened.    The testimony of the repentant leading member -- 'Adil  'Abd-al-Baqi -- is important because it was a direct testimony  illustrating the views and experiences of some existing groups.  Regardless of possible guidance and the revision of his  testimony and no matter the degree of accuracy of his  information, we believe that it revealed, in a general way, some  important aspects of this disease. It shed some light that  deserves to be followed up in order to answer the big question  that still needs to be discussed seriously and courageously,  namely: Why does such deviant behavior occur? Where does it  come from?    Before we attempt to interpret the testimony from this  angle,  we must pause a moment and examine who the witness and his group  are, in order to identify the case study we are addressing. We  shall use the man's own statements as evidence.    He was born in 1961, did not complete his secondary  education, and joined these groups in 1977 at the age of 16. It  was at this point that he was taught to say that this is an  infidel society. He was arrested after President al-Sadat's  assassination in 1981; and while in jail he became a member of  the group known as "al-Shawqiyun," named after "Shawqi  al-Shaykh," a dissident belonging to Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman's  "Islamic" group. Apparently, however, he quarreled with the  al-Shawqiyun and joined another group known as "Hesitation and  Confirmation." Throughout his life he has relied on his  personal reading to acquire religious knowledge; and at the age  of 22 he was regarded as a theoretician, issuing rulings about  what is permitted behavior and what is taboo, and leveling  accusations of disbelief and apostasy. By chance he came across  Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali's book "Jurisprudence in the Life of  the Prophet," in which the writer discusses some aspects of the  conduct of the Prophet, may God's prayers and peace be with him.  He realized then that he and his group were seizing other  people's money wrongfully. This was the first spark in his  gradual enlightenment as to the errors in the various groups'  views and behavior. Other events prompted him to reconsider the  whole issue and eventually led him to testify on television,  where he renounced the ideology he had embraced for 17 years.    The "Hesitation and Confirmation" group to which he was said  to belong is a link in the chain of groups that are covered by  the blanket of the heretic ideology which brands [yadmagh]  individuals, society, and the authorities as unbelievers. These  groups went under various names, notably the "Repudiation and  Renunciation," "al-Shawqiyun," "Those Delivered from the Fire,"  and the "Hesitation and Confirmation" groups. These four groups  are the most prominent manifestations of intellectual deviation  on the Egyptian Islamic scene. They are small groups of limited  influence, drawing their grassroots membership from among  simple, unsophisticated people to whom a person like 'Adil  'Abd-al-Baqi can act as an "authority" able to lead them  intellectually and organizationally. The heretic ideology is  limited to these small groups. An essential difference between  them and the larger well-known groups, that is the Muslim  Brotherhood, the Islamic Group, and the Salafis [revanchists] is  that the latter, despite having diverse programs, methods, and  goals, do not call anyone an unbeliever. This repentant leader  took care to explain this difference. His explanation corrected  the widespread misconception that branding others as unbelievers  is the foundation of Islamic action, a misconception created by  frivolous media treatment of the issue. Actually, the heretic  ideology is a deviant concept and an exception to the general  rule.    If we go back to our subject and examine his remarks  carefully, we will find in them important hints concerning the  points of weakness and disorder through which this intellectual  deviation infiltrates, paving the way for events culminating in  terrorism. Here are examples of such factors:    First, he did not find in school anything to satisfy his  desire for religious knowledge and thus he left school to seek  that knowledge elsewhere. He was asked: Are the school  curricula designed to help every person learn true religion? He  replied: I felt that the religion of the mosques and what we  learn in school did not satisfy my religious needs as a young  man.    Both the question and the answer raise an issue which I  believe is crucial in tracing the roots of intellectual  deviation. This is that our youths emerge from school with a  very shallow religious background that fails to give them a  minimum of protection for keeping their balance and straight  thinking. As a result, young men become soft and pliable putty  for anyone to shape.    Regrettably, some of those annoyed by the deviations now  apparent in the Islamic stream are calling for countering them  by reducing the religious content of the academic curricula on  the hypothesis that extremism grows in religious soil so by  eliminating that soil we can slow the spread of deviations.  These people have used and are still using the slogan "Dry Up  the Springs." I remember I criticized this stand in previous  articles and said we need to adopt a purposeful policy on  religion, not dry up its springs. I warned that the advocates  of drying up the springs drive students to various types of  extremism and deviation so that they thereby do not fight  extremism but encourage and spread it through their poor  judgment and shortsightedness.    The example of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi confirms this. The young  man did not find what he was looking for at school, so he went  looking for it outside school, became involved in illegal acts,  and dragged many others with him. I have no doubt that entire  generations are suffering from what this person suffered from,  and there is no way to save them except by reconsidering the  education policy and curricula in a manner that will restore  prestige to religious culture and immunize our youths to  deviation.    I mentioned before that the years of nationalistic fervor  dictated these "nationalistic subjects" at the various education  levels right up to university. It was an understandable  approach during that stage. In the period of religious  resurgence we are now experiencing, we ought to give our youths  the healthy food they need at school before they swallow  adulterated and poisoned food from street vendors.    Second, when he joined the groups, one of the leading  advocates of the proposition that society is heretical convinced  him about "legalization" -- that is to say that stealing money  from others, from "the infidels," and using this money for one's  duty is permissible. He was convinced of this and advocated it.  He added: "We used to read things, but found no one to advise  us on correct concepts. At the same time we shut ourselves in,  regarded all preachers as part of the "infidel" regime, and  turned our backs on them." At another point he said: "I could  not find a clergyman who would tell me if what I read was right  or wrong."    This is the first time I have heard the term "legalization."  I know that some kind of a shari'ah loophole justifies seizing  other people's money on the pretext that they are "infidels."  This opens our eyes to the fact that there is an unknown world  out there in the dark in which the weirdest ideas are spreading  with no one to stem or rectify them.    This draws our attention to more than one crisis:    --the crisis of darkness, in which such groups move;    --the crisis due to preachers who have lost the youths'  confidence and forced them to be satisfied with their underworld;    --the crisis of indignation against a society that fostered  the mind set among young men that accepts the idea that the  society is heretical and that it is permissible to seize  people's money and property; and    --the crisis of the higher religious authority, which should  be making sure of the correctness of the ideas these youths  absorb and taking the lead in seeking a prudent and moderate way.    Suppose this young man, and hundreds or thousands like him,  had found a public, legitimate agency to nurture them and  satisfy their desire for piety and public service; would the  concept of the repudiation of society have spread so easily  then? Can anyone imagine that the term "legalization" would  have appeared then?    Such questions lead to the discussion of an issue totally  ignored amid the preoccupation with extremism and terrorism. It  is the need to provide avenues of moderation for these young men  before they find themselves compelled to join illegal groups  that will indoctrinate them with whatever ideas those groups  want, without supervision or accountability.    Another question arises: Why did those young men not find  reliable, authoritative ulema to correct the ideas that had  taken hold of their minds? The young men regarded preachers as  part of the government, a form of authority, and establishment  mouthpieces and so they lost faith in them and did not listen to  them.    Preacher convoys have toured the country. Reports and  photographs of them holding seminars and conferences to fight  deviant ideologies fill the newspapers, but when young men were  asked about them, they replied: Those preachers did not discuss  any issues with us. They came to the villages to dictate things  to us.    There is no doubt that those preacher convoys were a  bureaucratic solution adopted merely as a stopgap measure and to  show that the authorities were doing something. Perhaps we did  not need this repentant's testimony to reach the conclusion we  are now reaching.    What is the solution? It is necessary to make do better in  training and upgrading preachers. Al-Azhar must play its role  and do its duty as a beacon of sober thought and an independent  institution responsible for the defense of Islam in Egypt and  all over the Islamic world. Those who seek to undermine and  slander al-Azhar and those who seek to subjugate it and make it  part of the political establishment are derogating it and  reducing its credibility. Every reduction of its credibility  gives free help to deviancy and terrorism. Efforts to undermine  or control al-Azhar serve the same ends as extremism.    Commenting on the membership of the deviant groups, the  repentant leading member said that most of those who have joined  since 1985 were unemployed who "came to us and we provided them  with employment in the form of robbery within the context of  legalization." He explained that "they wanted to marry and we  provided them with the money for that. Within four months such  a member would feel he had become somebody, with a job, a home,  and a wife."    This description places the socioeconomic factor squarely  before our eyes. Unemployed persons find self-fulfillment in  the embrace of those groups that provide them with the things  society has been unable to give them. If we remember that there  are 3 million unemployed people in Egypt, we will immediately  realize that those groups have a huge potential army.  Unemployment is an important source of members, of those who  are looking for a job and self- fulfillment. The issue goes  beyond this, for once they are persuaded that their society is  heretical and that their mission is to change that society from  a swamp of unbelief into an oasis of faith, those young men will  find a cause to defend and for which to make sacrifices.    Does not this situation demand some very deep thinking about  the younger generation crushed by the ordeals of unemployment, a  search for self-fulfillment, and the quest for a dream and a  cause?    Should not this situation make us think again of what we are  doing for our young people, who actually live on the margins of  society where no one cares about them even though one day they  will have to lead the country?    Our friend said that his mother gave him 4,000 pounds to  start a project and earn a living. She did this after she  realized that he had definitely abandoned his studies. He spent  the money on forming his "Hesitation and Confirmation" group.  He rented a house in which he lived with 25 companions. When  the money ran out two months later, the solution was the  legalization fatwa. They started stealing bicycles and selling  them. When this became insufficient they stole motorcycles, and  so on. "The greater the need for money, the more legalization  was granted."    This discussion raises the issue of who finances them. Many  people find it easy to link financing to foreign sources. Much  published comment and various recent movies give the same  message. According to this repentant man, generalized statements  about links to foreign parties are at the very least not very  accurate. He personally spent every penny his mother gave him  on a cause he judged to be worth while. Later on, the  legalization of theft was the solution to getting the funds  necessary for continuing the "mission." What I mean is that  this entire scene we are examining was homegrown, including the  ideas, the people, and the money. It means that foreign parties  were not part of the picture in the beginning. At worst, the  role of foreign parties--if such a thing is proved--came later  and was incidental.    We are not concerned with exonerating the foreign parties.  Our chief concern at this time is to focus attention on the  domestic factors in order to give them priority in our effort to  eradicate this phenomenon. In other words, repeatedly hammering  away about foreign parties does more harm than good because it  diverts attention from the original and real domestic causes.  These causes lie at our feet and are in our hands but we insist  on looking beyond our borders, searching for an unknown foreign  party that we cannot see.    What applies to money also applies to weapons. When the man  was asked where he had obtained weapons, his simple answer was  that weapons are found in every house in Upper Egypt. This  means that the weapons have been found inside the country since  the beginning. The means of violence were available from the  start. What happened afterwards was a development and an  exploitation of those means.    In conclusion, one cannot but notice in the statement of the  repentant leading member that he wasted 17 years of his life on  his miserable adventures and refused to meet his mother when she  came to visit him in jail. We cannot fail to notice his  references to those who abandoned their families and devoted  their lives to a cause they considered righteous. He spoke of  the science student who left his studies to peddle socks in the  streets and the specialist surgeon who abandoned his profession  to sell watches. When one examines these images, one realizes  that this army of young men are victims of a corrupt cause and a  fallacious dream. This raises the puzzling question: Who is  responsible for this waste? Is it merely the responsibility of  those who have misled the young men and tempted them with  corrupt ideologies about repudiating society and considering the  theft of its wealth as legitimate? Or is it also the  responsibility of a society that has failed to rally them around  an honorable cause and did not fire their imagination with a  great dream?    'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi said that he used to act on the  understanding that he had a cause that filled his thoughts and  took hold of his feelings and that, in those days, if he had  been given 50 death sentences he would not have regretted his  acts. That is because he believed he was right and would die a  martyr. He is not alone in this; there are many like him. They  think they are right and express a willingness to die in defense  of their convictions. These are urgent questions: Is there a  way to channel these feelings in the right direction, one that  can serve the homeland's and the nation's noble objectives? Is  there a means to channel this energetic faith, so full of  resentment against society, in a way that will help society to  progress and realize some of its legitimate dreams?    In the midst of our media's renowned buffoonery,  sensationalism, and confusing tactics, it is difficult to answer  these questions. Regrettably, sensationalism has governed even  the way we read the testimony mentioned here. Many people have  focused on the accusations, scandals, and other sensational  material that emerged from the testimony. Only a few noticed  the moral behind it. Hence, instead of organizing a roundtable  to discuss the various aspects of the issue and the  responsibility of all parties, we were astounded to see a great  pavilion being set up full of shouting, clowning people. They  gave us a headache with their loud but empty talk. Those who  tried to say something serious could not be heard above the din.  This means that the frivolous method of addressing the issue  still has the upper hand and that the time for seriousness has  not yet come!</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Harcourt moves deeper into the red DEBT-laden Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the US publisher and insurer which saw a Dollars 1.4bn bid for the group falter last month, reported an increase in its first-quarter net loss, from Dollars 72m last year to Dollars 78.7m. The company said the figures were due primarily to higher interest expense and to lower publishing operating income, including the one-time costs of consolidating Harcourt's college publishing operations. General Cinema last month abandoned a Dollars 1.1bn tender offer for Harcourt's publicly-held debt - part of a Dollars 1.4bn offer for the entire group - after failing to agree terms with the bondholders. It is unclear whether the bid can be revived. Harcourt, which said at the time that it would have to consider 'all available alternatives', declined to comment on the bid yesterday, but said it would give further information in a filing next week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Harcourt said yesterday's results, which were struck on revenues of Dollars 280m, against Dollars 276.9m, and worked through at a loss of Dollars 1.13 a share (Dollars 1.07 loss) were not indicative of the year, which was highly seasonal, with most educational sales in the June to September period. Reader's Digest, publishers of one of the world's best-read magazines, yesterday reported a 27 per cent rise in third-quarter net income, from Dollars 63.9m, or 54 cents a share, to Dollars 81.2m, or 68 cents. Revenues were ahead by 15.8 per cent to Dollars 640.6m. US revenues rose 5.8 per cent, while international revenues advanced by 24.9 per cent, or 18 per cent when exchange rate movements were stripped out.</p>

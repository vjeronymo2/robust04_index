In 1963 he was made general manager of the group's coal department in New York and became vice president of C Itoh (America) in 1971. He went on the board of C Itoh in 1985 and was appointed chief executive in June 1990. Sir Peter Walters, chairman of Midland Bank, and Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, have also joined the HSBC board following the takeover of Midland. ***** Claus Moehlmann has been appointed md in the investment banking group of SWISS BANK CORPORATION; he will be based in London. ***** Brian Constant has been promoted to be a director of LLOYDS BANK's corporate banking division. ***** David Gibson has retired from HENDERSON ADMINISTRATION.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / German businessmen see deeper recession this year GERMAN entrepreneurs see no prospect of a domestic economic improvement in 1993 and are instead planning further production cuts and redundancies, according to the biannual poll of business opinion by the German chambers of commerce and industry, the DIHT. The survey, which takes the pulse of 20,000 companies in west Germany and more than 5,000 in the east, suggests that the number of businessmen believing the economy will slip further into recession is steadily increasing. In western Germany, 48 per cent of entrepreneurs see the state of the economy worsening, compared with 31 per cent last autumn. Only 10 per cent of them see the future with confidence, compared with 18 per cent six months ago. Further job cuts are to be expected, with employers blaming high labour costs as the main cause. Investment plans are to be revised downwards and structural problems are apparent in all sectors of the economy, the report says. 'The recession is widening and a spiraling economic decline cannot be ruled out any longer,' Mr Franz Schoser, chief executive of DIHT, said yesterday. What hopes there are for a recovery are pinned on economic growth in the US, a moderate growth in salaries and a further reduction in interest rates, he added. But uncertainty over the future economic policy of the federal government is aggravating feelings of instability among business men and hampering investments. In western Germany, 43 per cent of companies are planning to invest less this year, compared with 34 per cent last autumn. Despite the recent appreciation of the dollar against the D-Mark, more than a third of businessmen expect no immediate rise in their exports. However, glimmers of hope come from eastern Germany where the mood is slightly less pessimistic. While more entrepreneurs there also believe that the overall economic situation is worsening, a third of them expect the situation in their own companies to improve. This is slightly more than in the last survey. The most optimism is in the trade, services and construction sectors. Food stuffs, luxury and consumer goods are the targets of increased investment. In general, the level of investment is continuing to increase, showing the sustained efforts of companies to improve productivity.</p>

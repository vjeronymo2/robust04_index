			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BOARD TO VOTE ON CONTRACT  </P> <P> The Ventura County Community College District board will vote next week on a  contract that was ratified this week by secretaries, maintenance workers and  other employees.  </P> <P> The proposed three-year contract, ratified by a 4-to-1 margin of the Service  Employees International Union Local 535 membership, covers more than 400  district employees who have been working without a contract since July 1, union  field representative Gregory Cross said.  </P> <P> About half of the classified employees, who work at Moorpark, Oxnard and  Ventura community colleges, are voting union members, Cross said.  </P> <P> Under the proposed contract, employees would receive a 3% pay raise retroactive  to July 1 and another 3% increase in January, union and district officials  said.  </P> <P> The district will continue to pay all health insurance premiums -- which had  been a major issue with the employee group -- until at least July, 1991, said  Jerry Pauley, associate vice chancellor and the district's chief negotiator.  </P> <P> Then if health insurance premiums increase by less than 20%, employees will get  a 4% raise.  </P> <P> However, if increases exceed 20%, the difference will be taken from the 4%  raise.

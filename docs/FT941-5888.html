			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Brown attends cabinet discussion at Downing Street UK entrepreneur David Brown (right), who has played a key role in the development of export markets for Proton, Malaysia's national car, is seen leaving Downing Street yesterday after cabinet discussions certain to have centred on the breach in trade relations between the UK and Malaysia. Mr Brown was not available for comment on the talks. However, he is known to have maintained close and cordial contacts with key Malaysian government figures since the late 1980s, when he founded Proton Cars (UK). The UK has become an important market for Proton - with sales providing Malaysia with annual earnings approaching Pounds 100m. Businessmen such as Mr Brown, who has a permanent office in Kuala Lumpur, could provide a sounding board and possible link between the two sides in the dispute. Mr Brown is currently preparing the ground for the launch of Proton exports to continental Europe.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Britains warns US over BA purchase of USAir BRITAIN has warned the US that failure to approve British Airways' planned purchase of a Dollars 750m (Pounds 460m) stake in USAir would 'strengthen the hand of those in Europe opposed to further liberalisation' of air transport, Daniel Green writes. Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, said approval would give 'new impetus to liberalisation'. If the deal were stopped, 'repercussions would go beyond just the UK/US (bilateral air services) agreement,' he told the American Chamber of Commerce in London. Bilateral talks resume next week.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Militants urge Algerians to 'take to the gun' ALGERIA'S Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), with its leaders and thousands of militant supporters locked up, has made its first appeal to Algerians to 'take to the gun', Reuter reports. The banned fundamentalist movement is widely blamed for the killing of nearly 50 members of the security forces in ambushes and isolated attacks since early February. 'After the vain appeals for dialogue, the people must move from the word to the gun,' the FIS said in a weekly letter circulating yesterday in mosques and markets in the capital, Algiers. Up to now, the FIS has skirted the issue of armed struggle, saying only that thwarting the 'people's will' - a reference to a cancelled election the party was set to win - could force Algerians to use 'other methods'. The authorities scrapped the poll in January, saying that the FIS did not have a mandate to destroy democracy. The head of the country's five-man presidency, Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, said yesterday that ending the poll was an urgent need in the terrible crisis Algeria faced. 'After 100 days we have been able to banish the spectre of fitna (war between Moslems), violence and the splintering of Algeria,' he told an inaugural session of a 60-member national consultative council. The council, which he called 'the true silent majority'is to help the leaders in the absence of the dissolved parliament. Algiers radio on Tuesday quoted an FIS communique saying: 'The people will remember the names of the consultative council members and inscribe them on the list of accomplices of the oppressors.' An Algiers court last month ordered the FIS dissolved on the grounds that it was guilty of 'multiple violations of the law'.</p>

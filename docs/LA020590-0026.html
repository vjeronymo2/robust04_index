			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Jason, Freddy May Help Violent Teens: Teen-agers who exhibit violent behavior  are being treated with more violence -- albeit televised violence -- in the  office of Dr. Jeffrey M. Turley, a child psychiatrist and fellow at the  University of Virginia.  </P> <P> To keep his unruly clients in line, Turley relies on Jason, the warped  goaltender of "Halloween," and Freddy Krueger of "Nightmare on Elm Street." The  psychiatrist found the so-called slasher films helped a 14-year-old boy, who  axed the interior of his family's home, deal with his feelings of anger. But  Dr. Carole I. Lieberman, a psychiatrist for the National Coalition on  Television Violence, says she has misgivings about this treatment because she  believes "these kinds of movies stimulate aggression."

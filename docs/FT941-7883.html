			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Cable companies told to cut rates The Federal Communications Commission yesterday voted to impose another round of rate cuts on cable television operators after last year's efforts to curb cable prices backfired in many areas. The majority of cable companies which do not face competition in their areas will be required to cut rates by 17 per cent if they exceed benchmarks set by the FCC. This reduction is substantially more than the 10 per cent cut ordered by the FCC last year in its first stab at implementing regulations for a law controlling cable television prices passed by Congress in 1992. The new rule adopted yesterday by the three FCC commissioners will also allow the commission to examine a la carte pricing structures offered by cable operators to make sure that they are not getting around the restrictions on pricing by removing channels from their basic packages. Cable systems which wish to charge more than the benchmarks may submit detailed data on their costs to the FCC, to be measured against an 11.52 per cent standard rate of return. While cable company revenues for regulated services have fallen by 5.9 per cent under the old rules, according to an FCC study published yesterday, other studies have shown that prices actually increased for around a third of cable subscribers, and did not yield the Dollars 1bn savings to consumers that the FCC had promised. The 1992 law, the only legislation on which Congress overrode former President George Bush's veto, came in response to a wave of consumer protest that cable companies, which in most areas operate as a monopoly, were abusing their dominant position by raising prices steeply.</p>

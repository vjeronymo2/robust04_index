			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Attack on bank interest rates MANY leading banks were behaving like 'back street moneylenders' by imposing excessive interest charges on small businesses, Mr Michael Bates (Cons, Langbaurgh) told the Commons last night. He said some of their customers were still being charged 16 per cent or 17 per cent interest even though base rates had been reduced to 7 per cent. Mr Bates, supported by an unusually large attendance of Tory backbenchers in the final debate of the day, said the lack of effective competition indicated that the high-street banks were behaving like a cartel. He said that because of over-charging by the banks the national economy was being 'short changed' and not securing the full benefit of the Pounds 1bn a year which should result from each percentage point reduction in base rates. Mr Bates called on the government to make it clear to the banks and other lending institutions that their practices were unacceptable. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the widespread concern demonstrated by the support Mr Bates had received from his backbench colleagues was reflected in the letters in his ministerial postbag. While confirming that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, intended to have further talks with the chairmen of individual banks, he ruled out a government inquiry into their codes of practice.</p>

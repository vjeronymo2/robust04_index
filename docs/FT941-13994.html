			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A victory endangered by defeat Sir, It is ironic that the NUT teaching union should accuse other unions of 'breaking the unity' over the teacher boycott ('Pressure on Patten eases as two unions lift boycott', January 15). All the other five teacher unions agree a famous victory has been secured for the teaching profession. Huge changes have been secured to the national curriculum testing and assessment system to slim down the workloads. If any 'confusion' is created it will be in the minds of parents and the public unable to comprehend why one union cannot acknowledge the enormous progress that has been made and respond accordingly. Recent history has some sad, if spectacular, examples of defeat being snatched from the jaws of victory by unending industrial action in pursuit of the total capitulation of the other side. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary, NASUWT, 5 King Street, Covent Garden, London WC2</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Tory jet charter points to April 9 election CONSERVATIVE party managers have signed an agreement to charter a corporate jet to carry the prime minister and his top aides between mid-March and April 10, the firmest confirmation to date that the government is planning an April 9 election. The BAe 146 jet, an 80 to 100-seat medium-range aircraft, will carry Mr John Major, and the entourage of journalists and television crews accompanying him, around the country for the four-week campaign. Details of the contract, including the name of the leasing company, remain confidential both for security reasons and to mask the implications about election timing. The contract can be cancelled if the opinion polls dissuade Mr Major from calling an April election. The aircraft is due to be returned on April 10, however, with the clear implication that the vote is expected to be the day before. While politicians of all parties have been convinced for some time that Mr Major will call an election for April 9, until now there has been no corroborating evidence from the parties' campaign plans. Mr Major will not make his final decision until he has analysed the polls in the week following the March 10 Budget. But most senior Tories now believe that only disastrous opinion poll figures will stop him from calling an early April ballot. In the interim, Tory campaign managers are now clearly planning for an April 9 election. The contract for the jet charter will almost certainly have included a significant cancellation clause, penalising the lessees if they fail to take up their option. Journalists wishing to travel with the prime minister during the campaign have already been told that the deposit alone on a 'season ticket' has been fixed at Pounds 3,000 and the final cost may be substantially higher. At normal commercial rates, the rental of a BAe 146 would vary between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 15,000 a day, depending on crewing, routing and other factors. A lengthy hiring such as for an election campaign would command large discounts, however, particularly in a recession when business is scarce. Conservative Central Office yesterday would neither confirm nor deny the signature of an air charter contract with an April 10 return date. 'There are preparations for a range of dates and they are not all April 9,' an official said. Labour and the Tories were level pegging in weekend opinion polls, in spite of gloomy economic statistics last last week, with support for the Liberal Democrats increasing, Ralph Atkins writes. But Labour leaders were yesterday confident that as perceptions about the economy sank in, their support would rise. Labour has set the recession as the central part of its campaign strategy but will also focus on health and education, including attacks today on the 'privatisation' of the National Health Service. The Tories will respond with claims about Labour's continuing links with trade unions. Labour sees recession as its election winner, Page 6</p>

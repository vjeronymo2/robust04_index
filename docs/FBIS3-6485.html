These are achievements made in the county over the past  thirty years after the publication of the socialist rural theses.    The county situated in the central western coast of Korea  was  a backward agrarian county in the past.    The agriculture of the county began to develop after the  liberation of the country and made a rapid progress from the  mid-1960s when the socialist rural theses was published.    The great leader President Kim Il-song gave on-the-spot  guidance to work of the Changyon, Wonpyong, Kwanhae and other  cooperative farms in the county and clearly indicated the  direction and ways of the county's agricultural development.    The county has put big efforts into agricultural irrigation.  It dammed the Hanil, Kuwang and other rivers and streams to  build reservoirs, including the Kwanhae and Kuwang reservoirs,  and set up more than 400 pumping stations and completed a 200 km  waterway project. Thus, all paddy and non-paddy fields were  brought under irrigation.    The area of the cultivated land increased by hundreds of  hectares through the reclamation of tideland and acquisition of  more land.    With many dwelling houses, nurseries, kindergartens,  hospitals, and public welfare and service facilities built in  the countryside the rural villages have turned into socialist  cultured ones good to live and work in.    At the cooperative farms where comprehensive mechanization  has reached a stage of completion the farmers joyfully do  farming with the help of machines.    The cooperative farms in the county have sixtyfive farm  machines of more than 20 kinds each on an average.    Each farmer tends 10 hectares of maize fields at the  Changyon  and other cooperative farms.    Grain production has increased year by year in the county.  Over 23,000 more tons of grain was produced last year than the  previous year, countywide.</p>

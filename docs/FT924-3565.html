			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / UB protests to SME overItalian crisp sell-off ITALY'S fledgling privat-isation programme has been hit by an unexpected spat over a state-owned potato crisp maker. United Biscuits, the UK-based multinational, has written to SME, the government-owned foods group controlled by the IRI state holding company, expressing disappointment over the sale of Pai, a potato crisp and savoury snacks maker, to an Italian rival. Pai was sold for L30.2bn (Pounds 13.8m) late last month to Unichips, the Italian family-owned concern. Mr John Warren, UB's group finance director, said the transaction was 'lacking transparency'. UB said Wasserstein Perrella, the US investment bank handling the deal, gave bidders 'just a weekend' to come up with indicative offers. No detailed information about the company was provided. On Friday night, SME said negotiations on the sale 'took place according to a procedure guaranteeing all potential buyers the same level of information, and, therefore, the possibility to make offers on a totally equal basis'. 'We noted how the bid had come about and said we might have been able to make a better indicative offer in other circumstances,' said Mr Warren. It has not received a reply. The dispute over the Pai sale could be embarrassing to the Italian government. Mr Giuliano Amato, prime minister, has pinned his hopes on disposals as a source of income.</p>

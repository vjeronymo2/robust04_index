			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Accounting change on subsidiaries BRITISH COMPANIES will be forced to include more of their subsidiaries in their group accounts under a new standard issued by the Accounting Standards Board yesterday. Accounting for subsidiary undertakings, the second financial reporting standard (FRS) to come into effect, tightens criteria under the 1989 Companies Act for subsidiaries that must be consolidated or placed in group accounts. It comes into force for financial periods ending on or after December 23 this year. Mr David Tweedie, ASB chairman, said the new standard was 'the foundation stone for how we will deal with group accounts'. He said that additional standards stipulating whether to consolidate joint ventures, associated companies and off-balance-sheet companies would follow over the next two years. FRS 2 tightens one part of the 1989 Companies Act which allows subsidiaries to be exempt from consolidation if they are very different from the parent company. The standard says that banking and insurance subsidiaries, as well as non-profit entities, should now be consolidated, whereas previously they could be exempted. In principle, all subsidiaries should be consolidated when a parent company can direct their financial and operating policies with a view to gaining economic benefits from their activities. The new standard also incorporates the third ruling issued by the ASB's urgent issues task force earlier this year dealing with goodwill - the difference between the purchase price of an acquisition and the value of its net assets. It states that any goodwill written off on the acquisition of a company must be passed through the profit-and-loss account if the company is later sold, unless it has already been written off against profits.

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Sport: Lone Star state of mind - Dallas fans won't hear of Super Bowl defeat / American Football IF ANYWHERE in the US can lay claim to being the heart of American football country, it is Texas. Many states provide more players to the professional game. Some have more NFL teams and blue-chip, football-playing universities  -but there is nowhere quite like Texas when it comes to passion for the sport. It is no surprise, then, that Texans are going wild over tomorrow's Super Bowl at Pasadena, California, which pits their beloved Dallas Cowboys against the Buffalo Bills from New York state. Their enthusiasm for the game starts at the lowest level. Texas is mad about high school football. 'A typical game in the city will draw between 5,000 and 10,000 people,' says Steve Davies, a sports reporter at the Dallas Morning Herald. 'In the smaller towns, the crowds are the same which means that, in some places, about 20 per cent of the local population is often at the game.' Indeed, high school football is most popular in country areas - and not just because it is often the only action in town other than the rodeo. For as long as anyone can remember, rural Texas has been producing big, brave farm boys suited ideally, in physique and temperament, to the bone-crunching rigours of the gridiron. The link between farming and football reaches its apotheosis at Texas Agricultural and Mechanical, the finest footballing university in the state. This year, A &amp; M attracted crowds of up to 80,000 as they won all their games in the regular season and challenged for the title of national college champions. At professional level, football mania reaches even greater heights. Two weeks ago, the Cowboys held a rally at their stadium in the city's outskirts for fans wanting to boost the players in their bid to win the club's first Super Bowl since 1978. On a dull, rainy mid-week day, 70,000 people turned up. The rally was shown live on local television and repeated on the same channel two nights later, attracting big ratings both times. Even the Lone Star state's most famous entertainment export cannot compete. The Cowboys' National Football League championship game against San Francisco two Sundays ago attracted the biggest local television audience ever in their home town, far outstripping the record held by the 'Who Shot JR?' episode of the soap opera Dallas. Although Texans are an hospitable bunch, the football fans sometimes take their fanaticism to absurd limits. When the Philadelphia Eagles arrived earlier this month to contest the Eastern Division title, shopkeepers in the Dallas area removed cartons of Philadelphia soft cheese from their shelves. And Buffalo, Texas, (population 1,900), has changed its name - to Blue Star  -for this weekend. The irony of the Cowboys' wonderful run this year is that the chief architects - Jerry Jones, the owner, and Jimmy Johnson, the coach - both are former star footballers at the University of Arkansas, a great college rival of Texas A &amp; M and the University of Texas, and just a few miles across the Texas state line. The two Arkansas alumni took charge of the Cowboys 3 1/2 years ago. After a couple of disastrous seasons, their drive to turn round a dispirited club and a struggling team began to pay off. After winning only one game in the 1989 season, Dallas improved so rapidly that this year they won 13 of the 16 regular season matches. Jones and Johnson have been ruthless in re-shaping the club - the old management was purged and unwanted players traded away to make room for fresh faces. They have shown a willingness to gamble, too, both with the selection of their teams and with the plays that have been called during games. Like the Miami University team that Johnson coached to a national college championship late in the 1980s, the Cowboys are built on speed, or what American footballers call 'quickness' - which means speed and agility over short distances, and an ability to think and react quickly in tight, unscripted situations. Dallas exploits that quickness with a flexible, attacking game that is comfortable both running and passing the ball. In recent games, the Cowboys' offence has been as swift, precise and potent as the San Francisco 49ers' attack during their long reign in the 1980s as the NFL's best team. The comparison was not lost on some of the San Francisco players who faced the Cowboys a fortnight ago. 'It looked like we were playing the mirror image of ourselves at times,' said Jesse Sapolu, one of the 49ers' key offensive players. Although the bookmakers have installed the Cowboys as the favourites tomorrow, many wise heads are warning that the Bills (who have been to, but lost, the past two Super Bowls, the 1991 game by a single point) will have much more big-game experience - Dallas are the youngest team in the NFL, with an average age of 26. Young they may be, but there is no shortage of confidence from the Dallas players. As Emmitt Smith, their star 23-year-old running back, said so disarmingly this week: 'Experience? How much experience do you need to play in a Super Bowl? I've been running the ball my whole life. What more experience do I need?'</p>

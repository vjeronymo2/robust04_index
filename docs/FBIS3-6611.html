			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan and China Should Mature Relations </F> Through a Straightforward Dialogue"]    [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is to make a  three-day visit to China starting 19 March. During his visit,  he is scheduled to meet with President (and CPC General  Secretary) Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and other Chinese  leaders.    In his talks with Li, Hosokawa is expected to reaffirm  "future-oriented" relations between Japan and China. The two  leaders will also deal with "bilateral ties that contribute to  the international community," in talks on security in the Asia  region, the Korean peninsula, disarmament, nuclear  nonproliferation, weapons export control, the role of the United  Nations, and environmental and drug-related issues.    Needless to say, the two countries rely heavily on each  other  and relations with China are very important for Japan.  Development of good and stable relations between Japan, China,  and the United States is indispensable for the security and  prosperity of the Asia- Pacific region, and for the rest of the  world.    Hosokawa should use his visit as an opportunity to frankly  exchange opinions with Chinese leaders based on a global  viewpoint to deepen and mature bilateral relations.    One of the pressing issues to be discussed in Beijing will  be  how to cope with the suspected nuclear weapon development by the  DPRK.    The Japanese Government has urged China to use its influence  over the DPRK to persuade that country to accept nuclear  inspections.    Jiang has said: "Our unchanging position is that the Korean  peninsula should be nuclear free." China has promised to lend  its support, saying: "We will wield our influence for a  positive purpose."    However, recently the DPRK again refused to open its  undeclared nuclear sites to inspections by the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA has said in its report  that "it has not been proved that Pyongyang has not been  developing nuclear weapons," thus the nuclear suspicion has not  yet been dispelled.    We hope that Hosokawa will again urge China to persuade the  DPRK during his visit.    Meanwhile, Asian nations are becoming increasingly concerned  about China's growing defense outlays. In China's fiscal 1994  budget plan, 22.4 percent are allocated to defense expenses.    The Chinese Government has repeatedly told Japan that it has  no intention of strengthening its military power. However,  Beijing should realize that the fact that the defense program of  superpower China is not transparent has caused concern among  neighboring countries.    During his visit, Hosokawa should question China's true  intentions in expanding its military forces, and convey to  Chinese leaders the strong concerns held by neighboring nations.  He should also urge Beijing to make its defense program clearer  by issuing "defense white papers."    China is currently under pressure from the United States to  improve its human rights record so that it can maintain its  most- favored-nation trade status. Based on the understanding  that respect for basic human rights is a universal value,  Hosokawa should encourage China to show other countries specific  measures to improve its human rights record.    In recent years, trade between Japan and China has greatly  increased. The trade volume reached about $38 billion last  year. Japan has now become China's largest trade partner in the  region, surpassing Hong Kong. Japanese investment in China has  also increased.    China, which is making a rapid transition to a market  economy, is beset by various problems. Therefore, it has high  expectations from Japan.    During his visit, Hosokawa is expected to pledge Japan's  support for China's reform and open-door policies. He is also  expected to unveil a new aid program for China that includes the  fourth yen loan plan.    We hope that the prime minister will have a productive  dialogue with Chinese leaders.</p>

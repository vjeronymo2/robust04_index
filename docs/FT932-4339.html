			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bilfinger und Berger Bau BILFINGER und Berger Bau, the German construction group, said domestic orders rose by 11.4 per cent during the first four months of 1993 to DM1.20bn, Reuter reports from Mannheim. However, foreign orders fell by 16 per cent to DM813 m for an overall 1.6 per cent decline, Mr Christian Roth, the chairman said. Output in the period fell by 4.5 per cent to DM1.73bn. Domestic output rose by 13.2 per cent to DM1.06bn, but foreign output fell 23.5 per cent to DM667bn. The decline was due to the winding down of major foreign projects which has not yet been compensated for with new orders. Bilfinger's biggest foreign contribution to output in 1992 came from Nigeria, where it handled a number of projects stemming from the move of the Nigerian capital to Abuja from Lagos. Other projects included the completion of the Challawa Gorge Dam near Kano and a mosque and hospital in Minna.</p>

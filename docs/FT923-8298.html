			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Labour calls for benefits statement LABOUR yesterday called for the government to clarify its policy on unemployment benefit in the wake of newspaper reports that it plans to halve the period for which benefit will be paid to six months, David Owen writes. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said such a move would amount to 'a cynical cost-saving exercise'. The government 'should not try to get themselves out of the economic mess they have created by attacking the incomes of the unemployed'.</p>

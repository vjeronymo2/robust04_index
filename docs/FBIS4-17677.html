Attackers fired two shots killing an officer  on duty, Major A. Tedeyev, and managed to flee.    According to the press centre of the Pacific Fleet, there  were four attackers. The gunmen, most likely, penetrated the  unit's location with a view to stealing weapons. As a result of  the attack, they seized two Makarov pistols and cartridges for  them.    This was already a second such attack in recent days.  Literally a week ago, on April 20, unidentified gunmen attacked  a small arms depot in a Vladivostok suburb.

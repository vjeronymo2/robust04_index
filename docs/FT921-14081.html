			<p>920117 FT  17 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Nissan freezes production at Lima car plant NISSAN has suspended work at its car assembly plant in Peru, it said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. Japan's second-largest vehicle maker had been producing finished cars in Lima while Peru's 50 per cent tariff on finished cars made marketing of imported cars there prohibitively expensive. But, since Peru cut that tariff to 15 per cent last year, it has become cheaper to import finished cars than to assemble them locally from imported parts, the company noted. Nissan said suspension of work, in effect since last October, did not necessarily mean permanent shut-down.</p>

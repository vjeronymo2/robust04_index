			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOCUS ON SENDING SOVIET JEWS TO ISRAEL  </P> <P> Memories of the Holocaust years have played a significant role in so much of  the activity of the organized Jewish community in America. In particular, we  know that we cannot afford ever again to be silent, that we have to resolutely  act to protect endangered Jews anywhere in the world and to work actively on  behalf of the security of Israel.  </P> <P> Once in a while, however, the lessons of the Holocaust years are misread (I say  this as a refugee who, with his parents, survived the Holocaust). Such is the  case in the recent disputes surrounding the destination of Soviet Jewish  emigres, in particular the new U.S. regulations that limit emigration to  America.  </P> <P> While there is much important debate on the specifics of any given proposal  regarding Soviet Jews, underlying some of the talk is the notion that this  time, American Jews must make sure that the gates of America are open to all  Jews who want to come here. We all recall that during the 1930s and '40s those  gates were closed, and the feeling exists in some circles that if American Jews  had done more to pry them open, the tragedy of the Holocaust might have been  mitigated.  </P> <P> But there is little parallel between then and now, primarily because when the  Nazis were annihilating European Jewry, America was really the last best hope  to save large numbers of Jews. Today, that is not the case at all.  </P> <P> The place that offers not only the chance but the guarantee of haven is Israel.  The issue today is not that a tragedy for Soviet Jews could occur because no  one would admit them. Israel's doors have always been open to all Jews.  </P> <P> For American Jewry, the challenge has been for Soviet Jews to gain the right to  leave. That has been the focal point of the activities of the National  Conference on Soviet Jewry and other organizations such as the Anti-Defamation  League that have worked tirelessly -- and successfully -- through political and  public channels to keep pressure on the Soviets to allow Jews to emigrate.  </P> <P> If there were no Israel, it would be the obligation of the Jewish community to  do everything in its power, no matter the difficulties, to see to it that as  many Soviet Jews as possible could come here. Since Israel exists, other  factors must be taken into account.  </P> <P> First, we would like Soviet Jews to have a choice of where to go. That is why  we agree that direct visas either to Israel or to the United States should be  issued in Moscow. For many Soviet Jews, it now means the choice of obtaining a  visa immediately to go to Israel or waiting, perhaps for a very long time, for  a visa to the United States. The key factor is that they may decide for  themselves.  </P> <P> Second, one cannot afford to ignore the existence of many other refugee groups  around the world seeking to come to the United States, some of them in dire  straits with other shores of refuge closed to them.  </P> <P> What is right here, morally and politically? What are our obligations as  concerned Jews and as humanitarians?  </P> <P> There are no easy answers, but clearly an approach is called for that still  provides for admission of significant numbers of Soviet Jewish refugees to the  United States, while recognizing that there are other needs and limited funds.  </P> <P> Our other obligation is toward Israel. It has been said again and again how  important substantial Soviet Jewish immigration -- aliyah -- is to Israel. If,  somehow, it was a choice between saving Jewish lives or supporting Israel, then  there would be reasons to give precedence to lives. That is clearly not the  case.  </P> <P> Therefore, our primary obligation is to focus our energies on how to encourage  as many Soviet Jews as possible to go to Israel. By working toward that end --  through financial assistance and a balanced approach to the refugee issue in  the U.S. Congress -- we will be able to look back with pride on our role as  American Jews. For we will have helped achieve our two main goals -- freedom  for Soviet Jews and the strengthening of the state of Israel.  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Death of Nixon: Bitter harvest from seeds of mistrust - Watergate brought out the best in the US system, demonstrating that the president was not above the law Richard Nixon's legacy still lives in the great Washington institutions of politics, press and judiciary, all of which were instrumental in his downfall. It is, on balance, not beneficial. Whereas Watergate itself brought out the best in the open American system, not least by demonstrating that no man, not even a president, was above the law, it also sowed seeds of mistrust which have produced some bitter harvests. The practice of politics is now less than ever an honourable and respected profession. Rapscallions there always have been, but Mr Nixon's breach of faith with his country was of a magnitude that reinforced the impression politicians are in the game not for the public good but for private or ulterior motives. Good people are now deterred from serving by the amount of scrutiny to which they will be subject. Those who have served, like the famous 'class of 74' which swept into Congress in the first post-Watergate election intent on reform, have departed, disillusioned and cynical. The quality of the US Congress is not high at present. Scandal, real and imagined, over- and underblown, has been the leitmotif of the last 20 years, often with the suffix '-gate' appended (Irangate, Iraqgate, Korea-gate, Travelgate, Nannygate). Private peccadilloes - with much less public import than John Tower's drinking or Gary Hart's womanising - routinely lead the news. Watergate might have instilled a higher respect for the law in public officials, but too often has not. In Iran-Contra, Oliver North had no compunctions in deliberately circumventing an Act of Congress prohibiting aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. He got away with it, albeit on a legal technicality, and is now running for the Senate from Virginia. Watergate cauterised the media. This was a real scandal unearthed by a handful of investigative young journalists, led by Woodward and Bernstein of the Washington Post. It is the beacon guiding the successor generation of reporters towards their Pulitzer prizes. But for each revelatory success there have been huge misses, not least the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s, a wholesale and then mostly unnoticed looting of the public purse, and the early stages of the BCCI scandal in Atlanta, broken, as much as anywhere, in this newspaper. Knowledge of these omissions has spurred the press further, now into the darker woods of Arkansas. Watergate featured meticulous triple-sourced reporting, with editing to match, while today too much journalism constitutes the printing of any charge or rumour as equivalent to fact. No individual has suffered more from this over the last year than poor Cardinal Bernadin from Chicago, pilloried by CNN among others over always suspect accusations of sexual molestation. The allegations have now been completely withdrawn. There was a concrete objectivity to the 'high crimes and misdemeanours' of the im-peachment facing Mr Nixon. Today's standards of wrongdoing are far more dubiously subjective, best described in Speaker Tom Foley's words as 'the appearance of the appearance of impropriety'. Any contact between the White House and other departments over Whitewater comes into this category and is reported with much innuendo and rush to judgment. Politicians, now too easily willing to settle scores dating back to Watergate, slaver at the scent of scandal, sometimes with gross hypocrisy. Nothing offends more than the sight of Senator Al D'Amato of New York, himself no stranger to controversy, taking the high moral road over Whitewater. At least Sam Ervin of the Watergate committee had no comparable skeletons in his closet. Washington occasionally reflects on what Richard Nixon did right, in foreign and domestic policy, and even inadvertently, in appointing a justice such as Harry Blackmun to the Supreme Court. But what he really left behind was a perverse vacuum. Lacking him to kick around, the capital now goes after everyone else in sight.</p>

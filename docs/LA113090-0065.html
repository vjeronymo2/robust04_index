			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> RECYCLING PROGRAM EXPANSION PLANNED  </P> <P> The city of Ventura will begin a recycling program in mid-December for  apartments, condominiums and mobile home parks featuring a scavenger-proof  recycling bin, city officials announced Thursday.  </P> <P> The multifamily program, which is expected to collect between five and 10 tons  of materials each day, will be added to the commercial and single-family  programs.  </P> <P> Participants in the single-family program are now recycling 25 tons of refuse a  day and commercial accounts contribute 30 tons.  </P> <P> Residents of single-family homes are provided with ordinary plastic trash bins,  but apartment and condo dwellers will use a bin that opens when a garbage truck  flips it upside down.  </P> <P> The new bins weigh 500 pounds when empty and will have one compartment for  newspapers and one for plastic, glass and aluminum.  </P> <P> They have a small lid on top that functions like a mailbox -- allowing  residents to deposit recyclables, but making it difficult for materials to be  removed from the bin.  </P> <P> The bins, which cost $300 to $350 each to manufacture, will be purchased with a  $40,000 grant from the State Department of Conservation.  </P> <P> Starting Saturday, volunteers from the League of Women Voters will pass out  brochures on recycling bin sites.

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: MCI drops plan to buy 17% stake in Nextel Shares of Nextel Communications, the US wireless communications company, fell sharply yesterday when MCI cancelled an agreement to acquire a 17 per cent stake in the company. Nextel has ambitious plans for a US-wide service combining mobile voice, data, paging and dispatch radio services. It was trading at Dollars 24 3/4 in mid-session yesterday, finally closing at Dollars 25 1/4 for a net loss of Dollars 5 1/4 on the day. In February, MCI agreed to pay Dollars 1.3bn for 17 per cent of Nextel shares. The telephone company was to become Nextel's marketing partner in its bid to create a nationwide wireless communications network. Comcast, another Nextel shareholder, was also a party to the agreement. Yesterday, the companies said they were continuing to explore the possibility of a strategic alliance, but on different terms. Since February, when MCI signed a letter of intent with Nextel and Comcast, Nextel's share price has fallen from Dollars 42. Analysts said MCI may have been renegotiating the price it agreed to pay for Nextel shares, which was Dollars 36 a share for an initial tranche and Dollars 38 for additional shares to be purchased over a three-year period. Also, since the initial agreement with MCI was signed, Nextel has announced planned acquisitions of OneComm and Dial Page and the purchase of Motorola's specialised mobile radio licences, mostly for stock. The issuance of new stock would have diluted MCI's planned stake in Nextel to about 12 per cent. News of MCI's decision to pull out of the deal with Nextel hit the share prices of OneComm and Dial Page as analysts speculated that Nextel may reassess its plans to acquire the two companies. However, Nextel said its planned deals would go ahead.</p>

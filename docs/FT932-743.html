			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: River Plate catches a new tide - Philip Coggan examines a trust that started with Argentina and now thinks global / Doing the Splits RIVER PLATE and General Investment trust was a 19th century example of that recent fashion, the emerging markets fund. It was founded in 1888, specifically to invest in Argentinian companies. The policy was changed only in 1952, when it was allowed to buy securities anywhere. The decision to go for a split structure came in 1987, when other trusts such as River &amp; Mercantile and Scottish National were making similar moves. At the time, many people questioned the need for general trusts. Some disappeared through takeover; others restructured in an attempt to please their shareholders by eliminating the discount to net assets on which the shares traded. River Plate was one of the first to launch zero dividend preference shares. These have first claim on the assets of the trust and their entitlement grows at a set rate of 12.28 per cent a year so that, eventually, they are repaid at 100p in 1996. According to fund manager Jupiter Tyndall, these zeros have the best cover in the market, with the trust currently having enough assets to meet the final redemption value 2.5 times. Or, put another way, the trust's assets would have to decline by 23 per cent a year between now and 1996 for the zeros not to be repaid in full. Because they are seen as safe, the zeros offer the lowest yields in the sector, with a gross redemption yield of just 7.4 per cent. But investors who have owned them since issue have had a good deal: the price has doubled and the increase is taxed as capital gain, not income. The income shares receive all the revenue of the trust and are entitled to be repaid at 100p on wind-up. Jupiter Tyndall says there are enough assets to meet the final repayment value of the income shares 1.1 times. The final dividend was maintained last year at 8.9p and the interim dividend has since been maintained at 3p. On Wednesday's share price of 103p, the income shares are on a flat yield of 10.8 per cent. Philip Middleton, analyst at Smith New Court, says the income shares are decent value provided the trust is able to maintain the final dividend. The capital shares receive all the assets of the trust after the other classes have been repaid. As with other split trusts, there are two ways of assessing the asset value of the capital shares. If you allow only for the present claims of the other classes, the net asset value is 131.9p, putting the shares (at 56p) at a whopping 58.3 per cent discount. But if you allow for the wind-up claims of the other classes, the assets per capital share are just 11p, according to Middleton. Thus, on a conservative basis, the shares are trading at a substantial premium. As with most of the other trusts launched in 1987, it is the capital shareholders who have lost out. When River Plate was launched, the capital shares had assets of 250p each and an original trading price of 100p. Middleton says the capital shares are 'a bit dear.' If the trust's assets grow at 5 per cent a year, he says the shares would return 9.2 per cent a year. He points out that a high asset growth rate is more difficult to achieve because of the high portfolio yield. But a recent research note from Iqbal Assan, at Olliff &amp; Partners, said the shares 'are among the most highly-geared in the sector and have considerable appeal for investors taking a bullish view of the UK equity market over the next three years.' The note does, however, emphasise that the shares are a high-risk recommendation. There are also warrants, which entitle the holder to buy capital shares at 250p each. Given that the capital shares will need to quintuple within three years for it to be worthwhile exercising the warrants, the latter are trading at just 2p. The trust is managed by Michael Heathcoat Amory, a nephew of a former Conservative chancellor. He says the trust has a large number of stocks in its portfolio (200), with an overweighting in small and medium sized companies which has helped its performance lately. In the six months to April 30, total assets rose by 19 per cent, compared with a rise of 10.5 per cent in the FT-A All Share index. The 10 largest holdings at the end of April were: PWS Holdings (a small insurance broker), Shell, BAT Industries, General Electric, Scottish Power, Williams Holdings (convertible), Merlin Jupiter American Capital fund, Mezzanine Capital and Income trust (income shares), and Dalgety. Heathcoat Amory says the yield on the portfolio is 6.5 per cent. The holding in Merlin Jupiter American Capital (a Jupiter Tyndall managed unit trust) has recently been reduced and Heathcoat Amory says that Jupiter Tyndall funds now make up just 6 per cent of the trust's assets. Smith New Court's Middleton adds: 'In terms of fund management, the trust has performed creditably without being outstanding.' Figures from the Association of Investment Trust Companies show River Plate's total return of shareholders' funds has been above average (for the split capital sector) over the past year, below average over the past three years, and above average over five years. Key facts Total assets at the end of April were Pounds 99.1m and the annual management fee is 0.5 per cent of assets. The trust is due to be wound up on October 31, 1996. Board Peter Hill-Wood, the chairman, is also vice-chairman of Hambros Bank. Other outsiders on the board are Andrew Buxton, a director of Norwich Union; Harry Littlefair, former vice-chairman of Allied Dunbar Unit Trusts; and Simon de Zoete, a director of BZW. Jupiter Tyndall men on the board are John Duffield, Heathcoat Amory and Timothy Pilkington. Savings scheme and Pep details There is no savings scheme and Jupiter Tyndall does not run Peps. But River Plate is Pep-qualifying for those with a self-select plan.</p>

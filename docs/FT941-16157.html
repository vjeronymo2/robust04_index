			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Accord raises German pay hopes: Chemicals workers accept award below forecast inflation level West German chemicals workers yesterday accepted real wage cuts in return for more job security. The late- night agreement on a 2 per cent award reinforced hopes of similar settlements in other industries which would increase downward pressure on inflation and short-term interest rates. The 15-month deal was equivalent to an annual increase of 1.5 per cent compared with expected average inflation of around 3 per cent, economists said. It coincided with the release of data which showed the economy still in recession and in need of fresh stimulation to fuel recovery. West German gross domestic product showed no growth in the final quarter of last year and was 0.7 per cent lower than in the comparable part of 1992, according to provisional figures from the federal statistics office. The recessive trend had ended but it was not yet possible to divine when the economy would start to improve, the office said. However, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister claimed the 1.3 per cent drop in pan-German GDP for the full year, reported on Monday, concealed a slight recovery which had started after the sharp collapse in the first quarter. Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt, said if the chemicals workers' pay deal set a pattern for other industries it was 'extremely good news'. Taken together with the economic data, it would not be long before markets started considering the outcome of next week's Bundesbank council meeting, he added. There was a good chance of a rate cut if inflation and money supply showed signs of slowing growth. Most independent economists agree that the key discount rate, currently 5.75 per cent, will be down to 4 per cent by the end of the year. Two of Germany's leading economic institutes last week urged the bank to cut rates. The chemicals pay deal, widely welcomed as good news for industry, includes a 15-month contract, back-dated to the end of October. The 2 per cent increase will take effect next month. Other elements include agreement that employers can take on long-term unemployed workers at 90 per cent of basic pay rates and shorten working hours according to market needs. The provisional 1993 economic data showed that the steepest slump in western Germany since the war was marked by a 14.7 per cent drop in spending on plant and equipment. Public consumption in the region fell 1.3 per cent, while private consumption, equivalent to 50 per cent of GDP, stagnated. Exports fell 7.3 per cent and imports were down 10.8 per cent. In the east, where GDP rose 6.3 per cent after 9.7 per cent in 1992, capital investment rose 15 per cent while spending on construction rose 21 per cent Numbers employed in the whole of the country fell almost 720,000, while the number of registered jobless climbed 440,000 or 14.8 per cent. Pan-German disposable incomes rose 2.8 per cent, comprising a 2.2 per cent rise in the west and an increase of 7 per cent in the east.</p>

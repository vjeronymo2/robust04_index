			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Buoyant Paris stock market puts brokers back in black France's stockbrokers moved back into the black last year due to the buoyant state of the Paris stock market, which helped them to return to profit after three years of heavy losses. The latest figures from the French Stockbrokers' Association show that the 57 French stockbrokers made collective net profits of FFr1.01bn (Dollars 179m) in 1993. The surplus compares with an aggregate deficit of FFr1.96bn for the three preceding years. The chief catalyst for the return to profits, according to the association, was the 'explosion in volume trading' during the year combined with a 'significant reduction in restructuring costs' for the stockbrokers themselves. Last year marked a turning point for France's stockbrokers, which suffered severely during the sluggish climate of the early 1990s. The industry then faced the parallel problems of low volume - reflecting weak demand for French equities following the bullish conditions of the mid-1980s - and fierce competition fuelled by the arrival of foreign houses in the Paris market. These problems were aggravated by the strategy adopted by some of France's big banks of using their stockbroking subsidiaries as loss-leaders to protect their positions elsewhere in the financial sector, thereby destabilising the market and making life more difficult for the incoming foreign houses. However, the Paris stock market rallied last year as foreign funds poured into France. At the same time the supply of equity increased, due to a stream of issues from private sector companies and the Balladur government's privatisation programme. The programme began last year with the sale of the state's stake in Banque Nationale de Paris, and is continuing with the current Union des Assurances de Paris issue. As a result, the industry has benefited from increased demand and an improvement in the Paris stock market's long-standing liquidity problem, which has enabled the stockbrokers to return to profit.</p>

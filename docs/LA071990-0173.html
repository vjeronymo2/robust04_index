			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSBITES: NEW HANGOUTS FOR FOODIES IN LAGUNA  </P> <P> * The Renaissance Cafe at 234 Forest Ave. in Laguna Beach offers "tastes of  things" daily from 7 a.m. to midnight, according to Charles See, who is a  partner in the operation with Darrel Anderson, a grandson of Walter Knott.  Mornings, they serve fresh fruit, oatmeal and one-egg omelets.  </P> <P> From 11:30 on, the "things" include soup, brie with fruit, calamari tacos (!),  pasta and such grilled dishes as fish and orange pepper chicken. Live  entertainment Sunday afternoons from 2 to 6 varies from light jazz to dulcimer  music. (714) 497-5282.  </P> <P> * Cafe Zoolu has, along with the usual tables, an exhibition kitchen surrounded  by a counter with nine (comfortable) seats. The place, at 860 Glenneyre St. in  Laguna, used to be an antique shop until chef-owner Lonnie Painter and his  artist wife Jeri Kissler came along. The menu reflects Painter's experiences at  Hotel Laguna and at Trees in Corona del Mar: You'll find fresh fish (often  served with salsas), meat loaf and pastas priced from $8 to $14. Kissler's  paintings grace the walls. And there's live entertainment. (714) 494-6825.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, down the street:  </P> <P> Chef Rosann Ruiz has left Sorrento Grill at 370 Glenneyre St. But the  restaurant filled the gap quickly with Italian-trained Duilio Valenti, who has  worked at Rex Il Ristorante in Los Angeles and Villa d'Este in San Diego. Ruiz  is freelancing now for the Robert Mondavi Food and Wine Center in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Here 'n' There: LaFayette, a French restaurant at 12532 Garden Grove Blvd. in  Garden Grove, is now open Sunday nights, offering complete dinners at prices  from $16 to $27. (714) 537-5011. BEVERLY BUSH SMITH  </P></p>

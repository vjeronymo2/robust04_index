			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Arms For Iraq - The Scott Inquiry: Anatomy of an inquiry Lord Justice Scott will write his report during the summer with publication expected before Christmas. He will make recommendations on Public Interest Immunity certificates and export legislation, and although his independent report was commissioned by the government, it is not binding in law. There will be no public hearings in April, but some further hearings early in May. In the meantime, the inquiry team will continue to assemble written evidence. So far, the inquiry has considered: 4.3m words of typescript in evidence 200,000 pages of documents, each copied five times 166 witnesses have given written evidence:  -of these, 57 have given a total of 400 hours of oral evidence in public  -12 have given 50 hours of oral evidence in closed session Cost of the inquiry estimated at Pounds 940,000, mainly covered by DTI Before making a criticism of a witness in his report, the judge will give that witness an opportunity to make, in writing, any comment. Every witness was sent a comprehensive request for detailed background information as well as the questions Lord Justice Scott would ask. The longest questionnaire, to Mr Alan Moses QC, ran to 172 pages. Witnesses could call on lawyers, or anyone else, to assist them in preparing written statements and to sit beside them at oral hearings.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP: O'MEARA, HICKMAN HOT AT 64  </P> <P> Mark O'Meara beat the heat and his mid-season blues with a seven-under-par 64,  and shared the first-round lead with late-finishing Greg Hickman after  Thursday's opening round of the Anheuser-Busch Golf Classic at Williamsburg,  Va.  </P> <P> "I certainly can't say that my confidence was riding very high when I teed off  today," said O'Meara, who missed the cut in two of his past three events and  tied for 66th in the other.  </P> <P> O'Meara had nine birdies and two bogeys on the Kingsmill Golf Club's layout  along the James River. Then Hickman, a rookie playing in the next-to-last  group, put together seven birdies, two bogeys and an eagle for a 64.  </P> <P> Lanny Wadkins and Brian Claar were a shot back.  </P> <P> Greg Norman, who leads the 1990 money list with $832,709, opened with a  five-under 66 and was joined at that figure by Larry Mize, Larry Rinker, Donnie  Hammond, Russ Cochran and Jim Gallagher Jr.  </P> <P> A large group at 67 included Curtis Strange, who lives at Kingsmill, and Hal  Sutton, whose round included a hole-in-one on the 177-yard 17th hole.  </P> <P> On a humid day when the temperature rose well into the 90s and there was  virtually no wind, many of the golfers found Kingsmill played shorter than its  6,790 yards.  </P> <P> "The greens look like they pumped a lot of water into them last night, and it  becomes just like a birdie shootout," Norman said. "It's a putting competition  is all it is."  </P> <P> O'Meara, who finished third in the season-opening Tournament of Champions and  got career victory No. 5 at Pebble Beach four weeks later, said he's unsure why  he starts strong every year and tails off toward the middle of the season.  </P> <P> "Mentally I feel like maybe I play too much in the beginning of the year," he  said. "Maybe I need to back off."  </P> <P> Hickman, 35, a veteran of the mini-tour, has missed the cut in nine of his 13  events this year.  </P> <P> Britain's Mark Mouland fired a two-under-par 67 and retained his lead after the  second round of the Monte Carlo Open with a 36-hole score of 130.  </P> <P> Australia's Wayne Riley was two shots back after a 64 in the second round.  </P> <P> Spain's Seve Ballesteros made a hole in one on the 140-yard second hole. He  shot a 66 and is at 138.  </P></p>

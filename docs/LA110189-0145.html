			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SAVINGS BOND SALES SUSPENDED OVER LACK OF DEBT LIMIT LAW  </P> <P> Sales of U.S. Savings Bonds were suspended indefinitely today because of  failure to enact legislation raising the federal debt limit, the Treasury  Department reported.  </P> <P> "Without new legislation to increase the debt limit, the government lacks  authority to issue any new debt obligations," a Treasury statement said.  </P> <P> Without the legislation, the government's borrowing authority at midnight  dropped from $2.87 trillion to $2.80 trillion.  </P> <P> The House has voted to raise the debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion for the current  fiscal year, but Senate legislation has been blocked by a squabble over whether  to cut the capital gains tax.  </P></p>

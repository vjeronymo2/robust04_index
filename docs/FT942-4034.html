			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues VideoLogic, an electronics company based in Kings Langley, north of London, is being demerged from its parent Avesco, the quoted broadcast equipment services group, and will be floated on the stock market through a placing which will value the company at up to Pounds 83.9m, writes Alan Cane. Some Pounds 21.5m before expenses is being raised. The need to demerge the company complicates the issue. Existing Avesco shareholders will receive one VideoLogic demerger share for each Avesco share and will have a preferential opportunity to participate in the placing. Warburg, which is underwriting the placing, will invite selected brokers and intermediaries to take up any shortfall. The share price, being set through a book-building exercise, is expected to fall between 55p and 70p and applications close at noon on June 30. VideoLogic is a leader in the design of chips and boards which can be fitted into personal computers to enable them to display full-motion video, essential for many multi-media applications. The demand for its products is expected to be explosive, given the growth of the personal computer market and accelerating interest in multi-media. The company is being demerged because its demands for research and development cash are now beyond Avesco which, in any case, is anxious to concentrate on its core business.</p>

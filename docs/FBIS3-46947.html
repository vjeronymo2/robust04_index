			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press statement by Kim Pyong-sik, vice president of the </F> DPRK and chairman of the KSDP Central Committee, on 4 January;  place not given--read by announcer]    [Text] Kim Pyong-sik, vice president of the DPRK and  chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Socialist  Democratic Party [KSDP], issued a press statement yesterday [4  January] supporting the fatherland reunification formula  clarified by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New  Year's address.    The press statement by Kim Pyong-sik, vice president of the  DPRK and chairman of the KSDP Central Committee, is as follows:    All KSDP members are filled with boundless excitement and  swelling emotionAll KSDP members are filled with boundless  excitement and swelling emotion on hearing the New Year, 1994,  ushered in by the New Year address of the respected and beloved  leader Comrade Kim Il-song, a peerless patriot and the sun of  the nation.    The respected and beloved leader President Kim Il-song, in  his New Year's address, proudly summed up last year's  achievements of our people who gave full play to the indomitable  spirit of chuche Korea by vigorously accelerating the socialist  economic construction with revolutionary zeal and achieved  successive triumphs in political, military confrontation with  the imperialists and reactionaries. He also clarified the  invariable principled stance of the government of our Republic  regarding the fatherland's reunification and set forth  programmatic tasks for making 1994 a year of historic upturn in  our country's revolution and construction.    In the name of all the KSDP members, I extend warm support  and welcome the respected and beloved comrade leader's historic  New Year's address.    The respected and beloved leader President Kim Il-song has  taught: For our people, reunifying the fatherland is the  supreme task of our nation which must not be delayed.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, in his New Year's  address, set efforts of the government of our Republic to pave a  way for the fatherland's reunification on the united strength of  the nation to counter the South Korean authorities' antinational  acts which undermine such efforts. He also righteously pointed  out that a so-called civilian regime in South Korea is only a  disguise which does not differ from the successive military  dictatorial regimes.    Out of the people's love of the country and desire to break  the deadlock lying in the way of the country and the nation, and  to explore a way for the nation, last year, the government of  our Republic put forward a 10-point program of great unity for  the whole nation for the fatherland's reunification and made all  efforts to put it into effect.    The 10-point program set forth by the respected and beloved  president is a great charter of the national unity and a bright  patriotic torchlight for reunification aimed at ending the  tragedy of separation and confrontation forced by outside forces  and turning out all the compatriots in the North, South, and  overseas to unite their strength to reunify the fatherland at an  early date. The only way we can reunify the fatherland in the  90's is thoroughly carrying out the 10-point program of great  national unity.    Under conditions in which the newly-emerged South Korean  regime professes itself to be a civilian regime, the government  of our Republic hoped that they would take the road of  reconciliation and cooperation in response to our 10-point  program of great national unity, we also took important steps  for an exchange of top-level special envoys between the two  sides.    But the South Korean authorities, more wicked than their  predecessors, have taken the path of depending on foreign forces  and of confrontation between the North and South and ignoring  our magnanimous proposal and the desire of the entire nation for  reunification.    Contrary to their open declaration that any allied country  could not be better than the nation and that they would promote  the North- South relations proceeding from the point that we are  the same fellow countrymen, they staged large-scale nuclear war  exercises almost every day against their fellow countrymen in  collusion with outside forces and drove the North-South  relations to the worst situation on the pretext of North's  nonexistent nuclear issue.    They left intact evil fascist laws, including the National  Security Law which is a relic of the previous military fascist  dictatorship, and the Agency for National Security Planning and  the Defense Security command, which are suppressive agencies,  thus brutally suppressing the righteous struggle of the South  Korean people and students for independence, democracy, and  reunification.    How can the Kim Yong-sam regime be called a civilian  government and different from preceding military fascist regime  when it did nothing but treachery, fascist and splittist acts,  and North-South confrontation [taegyol] during its rule helped  by outside force?    National independence is to love one's country and relying  on  outside force is to ruin one's country. The reason that our  country is divided into two and that the tragedy of division is  not ended are also because of the outside force. The outside  force brought us not benefit but misery in the past. It is  laying on us not mercy but pain today.    It is an intolerable antinational crime that the South  Korean  authorities keep refusing the fellow countrymen's offer to open  a road for the nation to live on through reconciliation and  cooperation between the North and South, and joining the outside  force to aggravate North-South confrontation and intensify the  tension.    Our nation should never choose to bring about  self-destruction and let the outside force gain the profit by  fighting with fellow countrymen under any circumstance. The  road our nation should walk along is not the road of war due to  hostility and confrontation but the road of reunification  through national reconciliation and cooperation.    To a nation, independence is life. To defend the life, the  whole nation should unite together. A nation not united cannot  display its might, and a nation without might cannot keep its  independence. If our nation achieves the great national unity  with the pride of having kept a single nation for over 5,000  years since Tangun, we can competently repulse any outside  force's invasion or interference, break off [kkokko porigo]  great powers' might, and achieve reunification in the nineties.    In his New Year's speech, the great leader pointed out that  the Republic Government will make all its effort in the future  to achieve the country's reunification in the form of the  confederal system based on one nation, one country, two systems,  and two governments, in accordance with the three major  principles of independence, peaceful reunification, and great  national unity.    If our nation, which has lived as a single nation during the  long 5,000-year history, joins wisdom and might with national  ideology, it could establish a pannational united country in the  form of the confederal system for the North and South to coexist  and co-prosper as we wish leaving two systems and two  governments existing in the North and the South as they are.    All Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas  should come out and firmly unite as one under the banner of the  10- point program of the great unity of the whole nation for the  reunificaiton of the country transcending the differences of  idea and ideology, and political preference and religion, to  establish a reunified country in the form of the confederal  system.    In this year's New Year's speech, the respected and beloved  leader President Kim Il-song also set forth the Republic  Government's principled position that the nuclear issue of the  Korean peninsula should by all means be resolved through the  DPRK-U.S. talks. The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula was  originally raised not because of the suspicion over the North's  nuclear development that the United States and its followers are  talking about but because the United States brought in nuclear  weapons to South Korea and threatened us with the weapons.    Therefore, the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should  be resolved through the face-to-face negotiations between the  United States which brought in nuclear weapons, and we, who are  directly facing the threat. The United States should know that  there is nothing to gain by clinging to suppression and threat.    As the respected and beloved president has taught, the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should be resolved in  conformity with the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement.    The principled position on national reunification declared  by  the respected and beloved leader President Kim Il-song in his  New Year's speech is indeed an inspiring banner for overcoming  the difficulties faced by the nation and vigorously driving the  whole nation to the great cause of reunification in the nineties.    All party members of our Korea Socialist Democratic Party of  Korea, of which political ideology is the triad of men's  independence, national independence, and mankind independence,  shall make all their efforts to achieve the reunification in the  nineties with great national unity highly upholding the New  Year's speech of the great leader President Kim Il-song.    Taking the opportunity, I firmly trust that all Korean  compatriots in the North, the South and overseas will come out  as one to the sacred cause of making this year as the historical  year that opens a new phase of the national reunification highly  upholding the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole  nation for the reunificaiton of the country.</p>

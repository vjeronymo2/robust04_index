Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the British  minister  quoted President Suharto as requesting Britain's assistance in  implementing Indonesia's development projects, including the  construction of railway tracks, expressways, liquefied natural  gas terminals, and telecommunications facilities. The British  minister agreed to comply with the request and said he would  urge British companies to invest in Indonesia in order to  fulfill the president's wish. With investments totaling about  $2 billion, Britain is now the largest European investor and the  third largest foreign investor in Indonesia. He noted that  Britain is now involved in the construction of railway tracks  linking Jakarta and Banten, which will allow for a 10-fold  increase in the transportation of coal from Sumatera and Java.  The minister also expressed his readiness to provide assistance  in the construction of double railway tracks between Jakarta and  Surabaya if the Indonesian Government so desires.    Also present during the talks were Saleh Afiff, state  minister for development supervision and chairman of the  National Development Planning Agency, and the British ambassador  to Indonesia. President Suharto, in his capacity as chairman of  the Nonaligned Movement, and Kenneth Clarke, in his capacity as  a minister of a G-7 country, also discussed G-7 economic  assistance to Nonaligned Movement members.</p>

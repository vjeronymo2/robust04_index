			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Japan's top two automakers,  Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., said Friday [21  January] their domestic motor vehicle sales and production in  1993 dropped from the previous year for the third consecutive  year.    The lackluster performance is attributable largely to the  national economic slump, the two automakers said.    Toyota, leader of the industry, said its exports of  passenger  cars, trucks and buses declined 9.4 percent from the year before  to 1,539,005 units.    Domestic sales also dipped 7.4 percent to 2,065,687, the  company said.    Toyota said its domestic production slumped 9.4 percent to  3,561,750 but overseas output surged 16.2 percent to 888,559.    "Although exports to Asia and Oceania fared well, total  exports were down because of a decrease in exports to North  America, Europe and the Middle East," a company statement said.    In December, the company said exports were down 14.3 percent  at 113,114 while domestic sales slipped 15.1 percent to 135,636.    Nissan said its exports of passenger cars and commercial  vehicles in 1993 plummeted 27.4 percent from the preceding year  to 684,088 while domestic sales were down 8.4 percent at  1,098,502.    It was the second straight year that the company's exports  had declined from the year before, the company said.    Production overseas climbed 16.5 percent to 1,006,204 but  domestic output plunged 14.5 percent to 1,811,591, the third  consecutive year-to-year fall, the second-largest automaker said.    "The sluggish economy worldwide and appreciation of the yen  against foreign currencies badly affected Nissan's exports," the  company said.    In December, the company said exports nose-dived 47.9  percent  to 44,463 while domestic sales dropped 12.9 percent to 72,865.    Domestic production dropped 23.9 percent to 117,494 while  overseas output fell 11.8 percent to 66,543, it said.</p>

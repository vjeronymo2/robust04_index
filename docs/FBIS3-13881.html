Jawad Naji, head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's  (PLO) Economic Department in Amman, said there was a good  response to advertisements in the past two months inviting  applications from qualified candidates in the Arab World and  elsewhere.    More than 95 per cent of all applicants are Palestinians and  the rest were both Arabs and non-Arabs, Dr. Naji said, adding  that the priority of the council was to select heads of  departments who will then be given leeway to set up the  departments and recruit their support staff.    The 13-member PECDAR was established in late 1993 as PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat as its head and Faruq Qaddumi, chief of  the Political Department of the PLO, and Muhammad Zuhdi  al-Nashashibi, head of the Economic Department of the PLO, as  his two deputies.    Other members of the council are: Ahmad Quray'  (director-general), Hasan Abu-Libdah and Sari Nusaybah (deputy  directors-general), Sufyan al-Sultan, Ibrahim Dikkah, Nabil  Qassis, Muhammad Samhuri, Khalil al-Hindi, Yusuf Sayigh, Antoine  Zahlan and Nabil al-Sharif.    The council is entrusted with devising a structure for  economic development and administration for the occupied  territories during the five-year Palestinian autonomy period  envisaged in the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO accord.    It will also draw up plans for development projects in the  occupied territories and act as a conduit for international  assistance to support Palestinian self-rule as envisaged in the  autonomy accord.    Dr. Naji rejected suggestions that pressure from donors, who  have pledged $2 billion in aid to the Palestinians, had prompted  the council to look for talent outside the PLO. Reports have  suggested that the donors were insisting that the council be  administered by qualified economic experts rather than political  appointees.    He said the council had established a good rapport will the  World Bank, which is coordinating the international effort to  financially support Palestinian self-rule and develop the  Palestinian economy.    The interviews that the council plans to conduct in Tunis,  Jerusalem and elsewhere this month and next month will be with  applicants for the posts of directors of treasury, budget,  financial administration, internal audit, tax and customs as  well as computer experts.    "We have to have a stream-lined state economy with no less  responsibilities and functions than those of a full government,"  said Dr. Naji. "As such, every aspect of a national economy has  to be addressed."    The council expects that it needs $400 million for running  costs during the first year of Palestinian autonomy. A meeting  of a steering committee supervising aid for Palestinians decided  in January to allocate up to $160 million to help start autonomy.    "That is their estimate, but we believe that the $400  million  figure reflects more accurately our actual needs," said Dr. Naji.    He said contacts were continuing between the council and the  steering committee. The panel is meeting in Paris this week to  review the progress of self-rule arrangements and review  allocation of funds for specific projects.    Some of the donors have already allocated part of their  pledges to various U.N. agencies already working in the occupied  territories.</p>

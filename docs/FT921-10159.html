			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Amex may face action on Olympics advertising AMERICAN EXPRESS, the US financial services group, may face legal action from this year's Winter Olympics organisers for allegedly 'ambush marketing' the event. The games open tomorrow at Albertville in France. Mr Dick Pound, chairman of the International Olympic Committee's marketing commission, yesterday accused American Express of conducting an advertising campaign implying it was an official sponsor of the games, which is not the case. One of the Olympics' main sponsors is credit card agency Visa, which with 12 other sponsors is paying about Pounds 170m towards the cost of staging the games. 'The long-standing war between Visa and Amex continues, just like a Russian novel - no beginning and no end in sight,' Mr Pound said. American Express has taken magazine space and billboard posters in Albertville for slogans such as 'Amex at the Games.' Mr Pound said the Amex campaign was 'trying to undercut' Visa. He declined to comment on how much Visa was paying to sponsor the games but it is believed to be in the region of about Dollars 20m. Mr Frank Vaccaro, American Express's director of public affairs (international), said yesterday his company was 'aware of reports of legal action being taken by the IOC but as yet we have not seen anything and have not been officially informed of any pending legal action.' Mr Vaccaro accused Visa of conducting a 'months-long' comparative US advertising campaign, attacking American Express by suggesting visitors to the Games should leave their Amex cards at home.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Are We Going, Friends, to the Virgin </F> Lands? The Question of Moving the Republic Capital to Akmola  (the Former Virgin Lands Capital) Is Brought to the Level of the  Supreme Legislative Body"]    [Text] It was Nursultan Nazarbayev who last Thursday asked  people's deputies to make this decision. His main argument: "It  is much more convenient to run the republic from the center  rather than from the southern outskirts." The president pointed  to the overpopulation of Almaty and the adverse ecological  situation. It is true that the current capital already has one  and a half times more inhabitants than it is designed to  accommodate, plus tens of thousands of visitors daily, including  from the far and near abroad. Considerable areas of agricultural  land that previously fed the city already have been allocated  for Almaty's development.    As to the environment, over the past year the oxygen content  in the capital's atmosphere has decreased by 2 percent.  According to specialists' calculations, Almaty needs an  additional 1 million trees to maintain optimum air quality, but  the number, unfortunately, continues to decline. The capital's  "lungs" are sick, negatively affecting the condition of even  healthy people. There is also growing concern about potential  destructive earthquakes, since the formation of the relatively  young Alatau mountains continues. All this is true, but let us  return to the key point--the need to relocate the republic  leadership headquarters from the southern outskirts closer to  the center. One can discern not only administrative-economic  aspects in this, but also serious political ones.    Moving a capital had been and continues to be part of world  practice. Recall how Lenin moved his headquarters from  Petrograd's Smolnyy to the Moscow Kremlin. In the united Germany  the capital is now returning to Berlin. But in our case the  analogy is hardly appropriate, since Akmola at this point is no  more than an oblast center. True, this was the potential  intention of the great liberalizer Nikita Khrushchev. He was not  able to see it through, however.    Now at the new stage of Kazakh history, in the conditions of  national sovereignty, the question of moving the capital to  Akmola is being brought again into the realm of practical  decisions. At this point it is hard to predict what the position  of the people's deputies will be, and whether they will support  the president's proposal or will try to find a compromise  solution.    We, on the other hand, would like to recall that ABV  ("Akmola  Is More Dear to Us Than Berlin to the Germans," No. 43, 2  November 1993) has already discussed the issue of moving the  capital of Kazakhstan. And emphasized at the time that this very  costly undertaking will cost our taxpayers $10 billion at  minimum. If we compare these figures with the revenue part of  the republic's budget last year, our compatriots will have to  work hard for at least five years just to pay to move the  capital to Akmola. But in addition to financial problems a whole  set of other issues arises, which cannot be left out, either.</p>

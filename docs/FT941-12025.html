			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Confidence grows in plan for aluminium output cuts There was growing confidence in the aluminium industry yesterday that output cuts of about 1.5m tonnes, representing 10 per cent of global production, were achievable following the unprecedented international trade deal agreed at the weekend between the world's leading aluminium-producing countries. Two European aluminium producers, Hoogovens of the Netherlands and Norsk Hydro of Norway, yesterday indicated they were prepared to make cuts to bring the market back into balance. In the US, Southwire said it would immediately cut by 10 per cent output at its 170,000-tonnes-a-year Hawesville smelter in Kentucky. Scepticism about the potential success of the agreement voiced by some analysts was reflected on the London Metal Exchange where the price of aluminium for delivery in three months slipped by Dollars 4.25 a tonne to Dollars 1,233.25. However, aluminium prices already had perked up at the prospect of a deal and last week reached the best levels for 6 1/2 months. The price has risen about 12 per cent in January to stand 21 per cent above the eight-year lows touched in 1993. Mr Stewart Spector, who produces the Spector Report on the industry, said he believed producers would make cuts because it was the industry that had pleaded with governments to negotiate to stem the rising tide of aluminium from Russia. 'They will simply be doing what they should have done before, or what the market would force them to do it they do not make more cuts,' he said. Mr Spector estimated that a cut to global supply of 1.5m tonnes would bring the market back into balance within a year. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at the GNI international trade house, also pointed out in his latest metals monthly that the deal would need to hold for only one year for it to make a substantial impact 'and two years to place the market in a very healthy state for the rest of the decade'. However, if the deal broke down 'the market will not see a price revival until the end of the century'. Various aspects of the deal, enshrined in a 'memorandum of understanding,' agreed by trade delegates from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway, Russia and the US, became clearer yesterday. Among the main points are: Russia will cut its output by 300,000 tonnes in the next three months and by further 200,000 tonnes in the following three months. Delegates said the two-tranches approach would enable the Russians to make sure that their initial cuts were being matched by western producers before moving on to deeper ones. There is no mention in the memorandum of specific targets for individual western countries because of anti-trust problems. Neither is there a global target mentioned, but the trade delegates agreed at previous meeting that cuts of 1.5m to 2m tonnes were necessary. Cuts dating back to November last year, after the first contacts between the trade delegates, count towards the global total. Delegates pointed out this would enable Reynolds Metals of the US and Alcan of Canada, which are in the process of implementing cuts totalling about 250,000 tonnes, to claim they have already made contributions. The cuts should last no longer than two years. It says unilateral trade measures would be inconsistent with the agreement. Delegates suggested that this indicates the EU will drop its restrictions on aluminium imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States, first imposed last August to 'safeguard' the European industry, when they end on February 28 and that the US industry would not press claims that the Russians have been dumping the metal in their market. There is nothing specific offered in financial assistance from the west for the Russian industry but the western nations have indicated that they will help the Russians implement their reconstruction plan. Help from the EU will be provided from the TACES (Technical Assistance to the CIS) programme, which is spending about 500,000 Ecus a year. Production cuts will be monitored by the International Primary Aluminium Institute, a London-based data collecting organisation, to which the Russian smelters will now start providing information. Two Russian officials will meet the IPAI secretariat on February 16 and 17 to pave the way for their country's eventual membership. There is to be another meeting between the trade delegates in Canada on February 28 to assess whether the scheme is working properly.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: French bank to take 20% stake in Aerospatiale CREDIT Lyonnais, one of France's leading nationalised banks, will acquire a 20 per cent stake in Aerospatiale, the state-controlled aerospace concern, AP-DJ reports from Paris. The Economics Ministry said the move was designed to strengthen the competitive positions of the two companies, and to enable Aerospatiale to pursue the costly development of new aircraft and missiles. Under the terms of the agreement, Credit Lyonnais will inject FFr1.4bn (Dollars 280m) into Aerospatiale through a capital increase. The French government will give Credit Lyonnais some of the shares it owns, so that the bank will hold 20 per cent of Aerospatiale's equity. Aerospatiale, which has borrowings of around FFr14bn, last year made a net profit of FFr213m.</p>

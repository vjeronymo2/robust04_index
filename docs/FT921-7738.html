			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: SA glass group seeks R354m through rights PLATE Glass and Shatterprufe Industries, South Africa's largest glass manufacturer which recently became part of the South African Breweries (SAB) group, has announced it will be raising R354m (Dollars 125m) in a rights issue, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg. The cash will enable PGSI to increase the equity base of its offshore operations and refinance local borrowings. Some R210m will be used to recapitalise PGSI's international operations, enabling them to take advantage of growth opportunities. The balance will, in the short term, be used to reduce local borrowings. PGSI's ordinary shareholders will be offered renounceable rights to subscribe for new ordinary shares at R43 a share, a 20 per cent discount to the market price of R54 at the time of the announcement. The move is part of a complex web of transactions announced over the past two months between PGSI and SAB. The main transaction sees SAB acquiring 54.6 per cent of the equity of Placor, holding company for PGSI, with a proposed scheme of arrangement in Placor whereby, if successful, it will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAB.</p>

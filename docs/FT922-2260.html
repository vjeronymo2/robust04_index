			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Supervisors are 'underestimated' MANAGERS are confused about what supervisors do and frequently underestimate their competence, the UK body responsible for setting standards in management training said yesterday The Management Charter Initiative disclosed the finding at the launch of the first national standards outlining best practice for supervisors. Earlier this month, the Confederation of British Industry published research showing that supervisors themselves are confused about their jobs. The new finding adds to general concern at the performance of UK supervisors compared with their counterparts in Germany and elsewhere. The UK's 1.2m supervisors have a significant effect on business productivity. The MCI discovered the confusion, which stems from poor communication between the two tiers, during trials of the new standards conducted at 200 organisations from every sector of the economy.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / No re-run planned after Grand National shambles THE 1993 Grand National, one of the world's most famous sporting events, will not be re-run after being declared void on Saturday amid scenes of chaos. A global television audience of 300m and a racecourse crowd of 60,000, who paid seat prices ranging between Pounds 29 and Pounds 55 (Dollars 40-Dollars 78), were witness to one of the great shambles in British sporting history. After the first start, Mr Keith Brown, the official starter, signalled with a red flag to stop the race. After the second false start, in which some horses and jockeys again became entangled in the tape, Mr Brown's warning flag failed to unfurl. About 30 of the 39 jockeys taking part continued to race. Some finished the 4 1/2 -mile course despite attempts to stop them. One of the course commentators announced: 'The race that is happening is not happening,' to raucous laughter from thousands of spectators. The starter was later booed from the course as spectators queued in heavy rain to get their money back from bookmakers. Mr Peter Greenall, chairman of Aintree racecourse near Liverpool, said yesterday that after consultations with leading trainers, it had been decided that it would not be practical to restage the world's most famous steeplechase at the next meeting in November. Bookmakers, preparing today for a rush of punters reclaiming about Pounds 75m staked on the race at betting shops throughout the country, said they would continue to press for a re-run. Senior executives of bookmaker William Hill are also to meet today to decide whether to sue the racecourse for the Pounds 2m the company claims it lost. Ladbroke said: 'The damage done to the public image of racing is immeasurable both in Britain and throughout the world. This is the biggest sporting event for Britain, let alone racing, and we owe it to the British public to put it back, the sooner, the better.' Seagram, the Canadian drinks group which sponsors the race through its Martell label, registered disappointment at the outcome but showed no inclination to withdraw support for the race. Mr Greenall said Aintree's overriding consideration was the long-term image of the race. 'I am not as sceptical as many that the Grand National has been so dented,' he said. 'The race has been run for 150 years and is a special part of our heritage.' Stewards of the Jockey Club, racing's ruling body, are expected to begin an inquiry today. Their investigation could lead to changes in the system used to recall runners after a false start.</p>

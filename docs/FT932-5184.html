			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Volvo takes on food group as row ends THE Swedish government and Volvo, the car and truck maker, yesterday resolved an 18-month dispute over the future of Procordia, the food and drugs group, by agreeing to split the company in two with Volvo taking over the food and consumer products side of the business. In a share swap deal, to be completed in the autumn, the government will become the majority shareholder in Procordia's pharmaceutical and biotechnology businesses, including 51 per cent of Erbamont, an Italian drugs company acquired in May from Italy's Montedison. Volvo, Sweden's biggest industrial group, will take a 74 per cent share in the demerged non-drug Procordia units, and seek to buy the remaining 26 per cent held publicly. It will retain a 25 per cent stake in Procordia's pharmaceutical operation, with the option to increase its holding to 35 per cent as the government sells its stake over the next 18 months. Volvo holds 39.5 per cent of Procordia's equity and 42.8 per cent of its voting rights, while the state holds 34.2 per cent of the capital and 42.7 per cent of the votes.

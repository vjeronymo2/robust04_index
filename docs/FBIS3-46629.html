			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Yasushi Kudo, Shizuo Tazaki] </F>   [Excerpts] An incumbent cabinet member says: "We were  unable to get to the heart of the problem." Faced with the  negative effects of deregulation and resistance by the  bureaucracy, no bold policy is forthcoming. Bureaucratic  opinions aside, the global market presses for deregulation. No  budget progress is possible and there is no room for a  choice.    Why is deregulation necessary now? Why do the corporate  managers seek deregulation in unison? Some cases are perceived  of those who seek expansion of their vested interests and make  self-centered contentions. However, there is an undercurrent of  reverberating cries that seek a breakthrough in the serious  blockage of Japan's economy.    The present business recession is not as simple as portrayed  by the optimistic view in the Economic White Paper as  "relatively large in the postwar years." Unlike the Economic  White Paper which incorrigibly forecasts a "recovery from the  last half of FY93," the managers closely sense a potential for  the worst recession in postwar years. Above all, they are  troubled by an unprecedented lack of clarity.    Conditions now are worse than the recession following the  oil  shocks. After the oil shocks, such measures as downsized  management, massive and intensive exports, and strong budget  actions were permitted. Today, however, due to the high yen  resulting from the trade frictions of the past 20 years, exports  are providing no relief. In addition to a holding balance of 190  trillion yen in national bonds, the fiscal situation with a drop  of several trillion yen in tax revenues is at a standstill. If  downsizing is pushed, a company's loss in volume means a  personnel cut, and reduced investment will cause a contractile  spiral that lowers macrobusiness. Moreover, financing which  should support the struggling real economy has been hurt and has  lost its leeway.    The greatest change of all is the loss of confidence by the  managers. The fighting spirit that faced the oil shocks and  high-yen recession is now rarely seen. One reason is that the  endurance of the high yen has reached its limit. The experience  of mistakes during the bubble has dulled the edge of judgment.    Amid these circumstances, it seems impossible to escape from  the contractile spiral unless a modest market is created.  Conditions to utilize the positive aspects of the high yen must  be formed. The network of protective regulations formed to  protect vested interests will then become merely "overheavy  armor." Regardless of how highly efficient and splendid the  armor, it is just a white elephant if the warriors who wear it  cannot move in it. Japan's economy will choke to death without  progress in deregulation.  <H5>  Although It Is a Small Step... </H5>   The Hosokawa administration was forced to set forth  deregulation as the centerpiece of an ad hoc economy policy,  which inherently cannot serve as a business stimulus measure. It  conversely exposed its do-nothing posture regarding the present  fiscal impasse and the record low business level.    Moreover, it has ended in half measures in its policy which  should be based on a long-term vision of deregulation.    The Hosokawa administration positions deregulation, its  centerpice measure, as the "first step in reforming the economic  structure." However, as far as the recently announced measure  indicates, it continues to be a shortcut reappraisal under  bureaucratic leadership, and not even a sense of its direction  surfaces.    Led by cabinet members who received repeated instructions  from the Prime Minister's Residence, the targets of deregulation  have increased from the original 60 items to 94 items. The prime  minister himself reportedly stated that "we will not let  deregulation end up according to the proposal by the  bureaucrats." However, there was ultimately not a single item of  bold deregulation.    Chairman Shinji Shimizu of Life Corporation says:  "Regulation  means bureaucrats and, as long as the number of bureaucrats does  not decrease, it is essentially impossible to expect the  bureaucrats to deregulate. With the majority of the regulations  essentially unnecessary, what is needed is not easing but  abolition."    Naturally, in this regard also, there was reportedly a  fierce  exchange between the bureaucrats, who basically do not wish to  deregulate, and the prime minister's staff.    Displeasure regarding the "cold attitude, considering our  long acquaintance," was indicated by the bureaucracy also to  Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations], which  requested 30 supplemental items and threw the ball into the lap  of the Prime Minister's Residence. There was also protest from  the industrial organizations (which are under Keidanren's wing)  that "we do not recall requesting deregulation to that extent."    Ukehisa Iwakami, managing director of the Japan Department  Stores Association, remarked about the recent measure as  follows: "The trunk of the tree called regulation remains. Only  a few branches and leaves were trimmed." That is because, after  the conclusions and review directions on most of the 94 items  were decided, they ended up as merely an array of deferred  items. [passage omitted]    Of course, there are some items that can be partially  evaluated. For example, items excluded from the application of  the antimonopoly act could be reevaluated by the end of FY95.  Customs information could be displayed which has been kept  secret in the past from the shippers, as if in spite, to protect  the customs brokers. Also, the submission of value declarations  on prices of duty-free commodities which accompany the payment  of consumption taxes could be abolished. [pasage omitted]  <H5>  "Sanctuary" Remains </H5>   Conversely, what did not surface in the recent deregulation  measure may be considered important from the standpoint of  understanding the lack of meaning and substance in Japan's  regulations.    For example, the Finance Ministry has stated that it will  ease regulations concerning permits to listed large stores of  more than 10,000 square meters in floor space that are engaged  in sales of sake. Actually, notification regarding this already  went out in July 1993 and, in this case, even if they receive  permits, they will be unable to sell beer or sake for three  years. Also, the majority of the medium-sized stores of less  than 10,000 square meters in space are still unlicensed despite  petitions by industry circles.    For a supermarket to open for business, permits and licenses  are said to be required on the basis of the Large-Scale Retail  Store Law and 42 other laws, including the Liquor Tax Act. Daiei  Inc. has made a prior trial accounting which indicates that, if  permits and licenses are abolished, commodity prices will drop  by 0.3 percent due to cost reductions. However, because it had  already been decided to reappraise the Large-Scale Retail Store  Law in late January 1994, it was included in the recent list,  but its reappraisal is limited to reporting criteria for  store-opening times and days of closure, with abolition not even  considered.    Furthermore, all of these regulations on distribution  obstruct free entry and competition to excessively protect the  established dealers.    Regarding the problem of farm products, deregulation decided  by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF]  amounts merely to "flexibility regarding the bidding system for  semirationed rice" and "promotion of new entry by rice  retailers." Both are established directions and do not probe  into the formation of a fair price market for semirationed rice  or the problem of the Nokyo [Agricultural Cooperative  Association], which has a monopoly on collection of cargo,  distribution, and sales.    For example, the "flexibility of semirationed rice" included  in the recent deregulation is merely a study of the past  regional distribution of listed rice on a prefectural basis, and  the prevention of self-bidding on Nokyo-related wholesales,  which has already been pointed out as a violation. Moreover,  improvement is being deferred with the listed rice itself  remaining at 25 percent of this year's semirationed rice, of  which 75 percent is being transacted to the Zenno [National  Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives] on a relative basis,  and the price range is limited.    Also, deregulation that coerces tied-in domestic-foreign  sales to protect the domestic producers, such as exempting  customs duties only for dealers who purchase domestic barley  germ, indicates a deferment of all deregulation despite the  wishes of industry circles, and protection of the "sanctuary."  Regarding these circumstances, a person affiliated with the  ruling coalition parties remarks: "It was said that,  individually, farm products are not excepted, but the majority  of the ruling parties themselves belong to the protectionist  faction, and they are not acting in unison. The result was that  a judgment was avoided."    Another fact seen in the recent deregulation is that, in the  same context as the 1985 Nakasone plan on the people's  livelihood, the easing of the capacity ratio and the easing of  municipal regulations indicate the surfacing of a deregulation  policy based on emphasis on supply, with the wishes of industry  circles and the politicians as the backdrop.    Regarding the easing of the capacity ratio, there is still a  discrepancy between the wishes of the industry circles and the  government's view, which is oriented toward deregulation  centered on housing. However, aside from the abolition of the  surveillance areas where the role has already ended with the  slump in land prices, the introduction of the incentive called  the expansion of capacity ratio simply means that the outlook  for deregulation itself is an anachronism.    Amid the present office recession without an exit and the  slump in land prices, the easing of the capacity ratio is  nothing more than relief for established land brokers who bought  up land and are suffering, and expectation of another bubble.  The 1985 Nakasone plan for the people's livelihood, which began  under the same economic conditions as the present conditions  with an expansion of domestic demand and deregulation, pushed  for the sale of government property and large-scale development  with a supply theory as its slogan, opening the way for the rise  of the bubble economy. It is now unrealistic to expect the  return of such a dream.    It is more important to conversely control the cities  through  downzoning and to expand the livelihood base. Expansion of  rights is now totally unrelated to deregulation.  <H5>  Turning to a Debate on the Abolition of Principle </H5>   We are not exactly unaware of why the recent deregulation  remained extremely insufficient. When regulations are eased, the  domestic-foreign price differential is reduced and new entries  begin in the established domestic fields, and an extremely large  deflationary effect appears.    Instead, the erasure of domestic-foreign price differentials  means the appearance of new suppliers despite the continuing  supply surplus and plant-and-equipment surplus. For example, the  U.S. machine tool industry is being dealt a devastating blow by  imported products, and the same thing could happen in Japan if  it takes the wrong approach. Despite arguments that it could be  a plus for the consumers, such views would undoubtedly die down  under conditions where unemployment continues to rise.    According to computations by the Japan Research Institute,  the total demand expansion effect of deregulation is 11.9  trillion yen, while the employment-creating effect will be an  increase of 1.02 million workers. However, this is based on the  calculation of 5.12 million newly employed workers versus 4.1  millison workers layed off due to the price fall. The new  employment of 5 million workers is premised on the creation of  consumer purchasing power with domestic/foreign price  corrections (lower domestic prices).    However, the new purchasing power could not immediately  provide goods and services of corresponding quality and  quantity. In contrast, there is a possiblity of quicker layoffs  due to a domestic-foreign price correction. If there is a fear  of such a mismatch, it will be extremely difficult to move  toward deregulation.    Moreover, as is clear from the requests by Keidanren, in  terms of smoothly facilitating deregulation, the logic of the  supply side is in the forefront. The Large-Scale Retail Store  Law and the reappraisal of the capacity ratio are typical.  Although deregulation equaling liberalization in the established  fields is profitable for the consumers due to lower prices, in  one aspect the world of the survival of the fittest expands.  Only the share of the strong rises, but total employment does  not. On the contrary, when the efficient and strong grow, the  possibility is great for total employment to drop. The same  result could be seen regarding elimination of the  domestic-foreign price differential, which would equate to  promotion of imports.    Consequently, in order to really implement deregulation, it  is necessary to combine it with the creation of a new market  that absorbs the micro minuses. It is not possible to find a new  market immediately. When it is found, everyone will have already  moved into it.    In more acccurate terms, it is futile to expect the  bureaucrats to form a new market. A free market can only be born  through trial and error. It means detachment from the  conventional administrative approach of pushing development  toward a designated model. Deregulation is therefore a kind of  cultural revolution.    On 18th of this month, Eiji Suzuki, adviser to Asahi  Chemical  Industry, and Iwao Nakatani, professor of Hitotsubashi  University, presented an ad hoc proposal as follows. "Reexamine  deregulation on a zero base. It is quicker to abolish the  principles and conversely adopt a cumulative approach." This is  indeed a revolutionary declaration against the bureaucracy-led  economy.    Certainly, regulations are not all bad. There are necessary  regulations concerning such irreparable matters as life and  health. By merely taking the cumulative and restructuring  approach, it should be possible to eradicate the burdens of the  economy considerably.    However, it is not clear whether the awareness of the  administration is being changed through what is perceived to be  bit-by-bit deregulation. The number of permits and licenses  issued by the government agencies by the end of March 1992  totaled 10,942. Although the necessity for deregulation was  pointed out repeatedly on the basis of the 1985 Administrative  Reform Council report, progress was slow and the number of items  per se rose bynearly 1,000 items.  <H5>  Real Test To Come </H5>   An executive of the Management and Coordination Agency said:  "Although there is criticism that the majority of the  deregulation items have appeared previously, it is significant  that they have been taken up as a government measure. It means  that it will absolutely be done." In other words, in order to  move still further, it is necessary for politics to make  decisions based on a long-term vision.    Meanwhile, the private sector has also continued to depend  on  regulation, which equates to protection. A certain top manager  does not hold great expectations when he says: "With  coordination of the industry circles and rejection of entries  from the outside left up to the government, they do not wish to  be tainted themselves. Therefore, deregulations notwithstanding,  there could not possibly be anything that will discomfort others  or result in their own loss."    In the first place, is it the aim of the current  deregulation  to correct the domestic-foreign price differential = expansion  of imports = reduction of the trade surplus, or to dismantle the  government-bureaucracy-industry alliance, or to improve the  so-called low-productivity service industries, or to smooth  business implementation for the established enterprises? A look  at the 94 items gives an impression of a hodge-podge of those  aims.    Even the Hosokawa cabinet, which proclaims that "structural  reform is a historical mission of the cabinet," does not display  any long-term vision. It gathered a large number of bureaucratic  old boys and formed the Hiraiwa council to draft a second  Maekawa report, but debate has barely begun. Although it cannot  avoid the agricultural problems from the standpoint of  structural reform, there is still no consensus regarding the  rice problem within the ruling coalition parties.    After announcing an ad hoc measure, Minister Hiroshi Kumagai  of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said:  "We were not able to delve into the heart of the problem." This  was probably not a statement in reference to rice, but even an  incumbent cabinet member is aware of the inadequacy. Jiro Ushio,  chairmman of Ushio Inc., voices encouragement to the Hosokawa  administration, saying: "It is not the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP], which grew with regulation, but the non-LDP that can  implement structural reform. The non-LDP is attempting to  formulate a policy that is detached from the `zoku' Diet  members." However, the details depend on future policy.    It must be remembered that the structure--which nurtured  industries with export competitiveness, provided profits as tax  revenues, enabled the granting of subsidies, and maintained an  extremely low unemployment rate compared to Europe and the  United States--is no longer permitted within the global economy.  If the external balance deteriorates, the form of support  through fiscal action cannot be expected to expand beyond the  present state. The argument to increase national bond issues is  deep-rooted, but who will buy them? Assuming that we depend on  fiscal investment funds, there is no guarantee that long-term  interest rates will not jump up. In addition, fiscal freedom  will inevitably and increasingly be lost due to interest  payments.    If we should look far for the causes, we will eventually  arrive at the collapse of the Berlin wall. With the cold war  over, we were no longer able to presume upon U.S. kindness. From  that point on, our domestic "socialist domain," wherein the  means of regulation = protection was maintained, probably ended.    Amid this trend, a transition to a self-responsible economy  that does not depend on the bureaucracy means deregulation. A  rose-colored dream is by no means promised, but there is no path  except this for the Hosokawa administration.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO LEADS IN RACE FOR 1992 GOP CONVENTION;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE WHITE HOUSE IS NERVOUS ABOUT FALLOUT SURROUNDING KLANSMAN DAVID  DUKE IN LOUISIANA AND THE ELECTION OF ANN RICHARDS AS TEXAS GOVERNOR, SOURCES  SAY.  </P> <P> The 1992 Republican Convention is likely to be held in San Diego, primarily  because the White House is nervous about political fallout surrounding  Gov.-elect Ann Richards in Texas and former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke in  Louisiana, key GOP sources said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Representatives from Houston, New Orleans and San Diego -- the cities competing  for the 1992 convention -- completed interviews with the GOP's Site Selection  Committee this week in Washington, and sources said San Diego emerged as the  favorite. The site committee will make its recommendation by Jan. 11 to the  full Republican National Committee, which will make its final choice Jan. 25.  </P> <P> Despite logistic and aesthetic concerns involving the San Diego Convention  Center and San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, where a portion of the convention  would be staged outdoors, the sources said California's pluses far outweigh the  negatives of Houston and New Orleans.  </P> <P> "San Diego is not just a front-runner but is in the commanding position," said  a GOP source from California, who asked not to be identified. "At this point,  the convention is San Diego's to lose."  </P> <P> Among the factors working against Houston was the recent gubernatorial victory  of Democrat Ann Richards, who at her party's 1988 convention delivered a speech  that many in GOP circles considered a personal attack on President Bush, the  source said.  </P> <P> In the speech, Richards said Bush was out of touch with the needs of most  Americans, adding: "Poor George. He can't help it. He was born with a silver  foot in his mouth."  </P> <P> After the November election, Houston's chances dimmed considerably, the sources  said, because of Richards' victory over Republican Clayton Williams -- for whom  Bush actively campaigned.  </P> <P> Despite having one of the best possible sites in the Superdome, New Orleans'  chances have been hurt by the specter of state legislator David Duke, a former  Klan member who recently was defeated in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat. The  White House is nervous about Duke, who might run for governor or even as a  third-party presidential candidate in 1992, the sources said.  </P> <P> Another GOP source said many in the Republican National Committee favor  Houston, the President's hometown, but the White House -- in particular, top  Bush adviser John Sununu -- have made no secret of their preference for San  Diego.  </P> <P> "I think it ought to go wherever the White House wants it to," Angelo said.  "And when I say the White House, I mean the President. If that's San Diego,  that's fine with me."  </P> <P> In addition to Sununu, San Diego is backed by Sig Rogich, another of the  President's advisers, who several months ago asked San Diego Mayor Maureen  O'Connor -- a Democrat -- to have her city submit a bid.  </P> <P> Paul Downey, the mayor's press secretary, said Wednesday that meetings with the  Site Selection Committee in Washington earlier this week went very well, but  Downey cautioned against San Diego celebrating prematurely.  </P> <P> "They wanted to know if we could handle two sites (the Convention Center and  stadium), and we assured them we could," Downey said. "We felt it was a good  session. They did not give us any indication whether we were ahead of or behind  the others."  </P></p>

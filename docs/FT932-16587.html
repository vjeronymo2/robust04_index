			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Marlboro cowboy wants more territory / Analysis of the latest effects of a price war and other changes in the US cigarette market IF Jim Johnston, head of RJR Nabisco's huge US tobacco operations, knew he had a problem during the group's annual shareholder meeting Friday morning, his phlegmatic demeanour gave nothing away. Only when the meeting finished, did the RJR Nabisco executive concede that he had a big price war on his hands. 'We will take appropriate steps to maintain our competitive positions in every segment of the market,' said Johnston, tersely. The price war comes courtesy of Philip Morris, the leading tobacco manufacturer in the US. While RJR shareholders were gathering in Delaware, Morris was telling analysts in New York that it planned to slash the price of its top-selling Marlboro brand 'to a level which has proven . . . to be effective in encouraging consumers to make brand selections based on brand preferences rather than price'. This is widely interpreted as a price cut of about 40 cents a packet. That would reduce the retail cost of 20 Marlboro cigarettes from Dollars 2.10-Dollars 2.20 to Dollars 1.70-Dollars 1.80 (Pounds 1.26). Morris will make these savings available by a mix of promotional schemes, including discount coupons and mail-shot offers, thus formally maintaining current wholesale prices. It will also extend promotional activity on its other full-priced brands, such as Benson &amp; Hedges. Finally, the company has set no time limit on the trade-war: 'We expect to forego any further price increases on premium brands for the foreseeable future,' said Morris. For the Dollars 46bn (Pounds 32.3bn) US cigarette market, Philip Morris' decision to defend market share rather than to chase short-term profits is momentous. Together, Morris and RJR account for about 70 per cent of all cigarettes smoked in the US. Marlboro takes almost one-quarter the market - meaning that it sells about 6bn packs a year. With some justification, Morris calls its leading brand 'the world's most valuable trademark'. But, formidable though Marlboro's position has been in the past, the brand has been badly threatened of late. Last year, for example, Marlboro shipments fell by 5.6 per cent. Market share, according to John Maxwell, analyst at Wheat, First Butcher, has been slipping since 1989. There are two principal reasons for this. First, the entire tobacco industry is under assault from the health and anti-smoking lobbyists, and from the nation's tax-gatherers. While such pressures are not new - they largely explain why cigarette consumption has been declining by about 2.5 per cent a year in the US - they are particularly acute at present. On the one hand, a recent Environmental Protection Agency report, claiming that 'passive smoking' causes 3,000 cancer deaths a year, has almost certainly accelerated the move towards smoke-free restaurants and workplaces. On the other, the new 'non-smoking' White House is widely expected to increase excise taxes on cigarettes to help fund changes in the nation's healthcare system. Many state governments are also contemplating a heavier fiscal burden on the industry. Secondly, there has been the phenomenal growth of 'discount' and 'generic' cigarettes. These labels were virtually non-existent 10 years ago, and even as recently as 1990, accounted for less than one-fifth of all cigarette sales. Today, on Philip Morris' reckoning, they account for about 36 per cent. These cheaper cigarettes retail for half the price of the traditional 'full-priced' brands, such as Marlboro or RJR's Winston and Salem. Ironically, they are made by the same companies which produce the full price brands. Philip Morris started manufacturing and promoting its own discount labels in earnest a couple of years ago, when it realised the inroads cheaper cigarettes were making into the US tobacco market could not be ignored. RJR, having concentrated heavily on bolstering its full-price brands in the early 1990s, also redirected its attention to its discount brands in 1992. But both companies know well that the profits made from these cheaper cigarettes are a fraction of the very juicy returns which the likes of Marlboro and Winston generate. It has been estimated that the profit per pack of Marlboro is about 10 times that made on a pack of the cheapest 'discount' smokes. So, given this background, analysts had little difficulty in interpreting the rationale behind Philip Morris's announcement on Friday. 'This is not a new price war,' said Roy Burry at Kidder Peabody. 'It's the latest blast in a price war which has already been going on. Philip Morris has come down with both feet on the market, and it's going to destroy the discount brands.' The logic is simple: it will be impossible for the discount cigarettes to come down in price by a similar amount, so the price differential between full-priced and cheaper smokes will narrow. If Philip Morris is right, this smaller differential will mean that smokers' purchasing is governed by brand preference, not price. So Marlboro, with a classier image and a distinctive taste, should regain market share. The losers, meanwhile, would be the likes of Brown &amp; Williamson, part of BAT Industries of the UK, and American Brands, which are heavily dependent on the lower-priced brands. Will it work? Competitors, and some analysts, pointed out one obvious danger  -namely, that Marlboro loses its carefully-cultivated premium image. 'We view this as a defensive move, cheapening the Marlboro brand,' said B&amp;W. A second problem could also arise if consumers become resilient to future price increases, and Marlboro becomes mired. Philip Morris' strategy will not come cheap. The company said that it expects operating profits from its US tobacco business to be down 'by as much as 40 per cent' in 1993 as a result of this strategy. That goes to the heart of the Morris money-machine: in 1992, domestic tobacco produced an operating profit of Dollars 5.18bn, almost half the group total of Dollars 10.96bn. Analysts, who had been predicting earnings per share of approximately Dollars 6.45 for the group in 1993, quickly redid their sums. New estimates ranged between Dollars 4.75 and Dollars 5.15. The situation at RJR Nabisco is every bit as gloomy - particularly given the company's heavy debt load, and current plans to divide its stock into two share classes, pegged to food and tobacco respectively. Analysts assume that RJR will have to follow Morris' pricing lead on its full-priced brands, with the result that domestic tobacco profits - which accounted for 58.8 per cent of group operating income last year  - will also be savaged. 'It looks as if everyone will have to deal with lower profits for a while', says Barry Ziegler, at AG Edwards.  -------------------------------------------                TOP 10 BRANDS:             US MARKET SHARES 1991                  (By volume)  -------------------------------------------                                 Per cent  ------------------------------------------- 1.

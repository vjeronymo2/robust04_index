			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / End to potato scheme nearer THE Agriculture Bill, which would empower ministers to scrap the Potato Marketing Scheme, passed its second Commons reading last night with a government majority of 44 (287 votes to 243). Potential Tory rebels indicated they had agreed to support the government following private assurances from ministers that amendments passed in the Lords would not be reversed. The bill also provides for the ending of milk marketing schemes.</p>

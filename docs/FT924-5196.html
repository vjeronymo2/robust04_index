			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (1): Modern yet monumental - First impressions / Paris is a city of contrasts, a compelling combination of the old and the new New York and Tokyo - or monumental, like Rome and Prague. Paris is almost alone in being both. It is a picture postcard of a city - breathtakingly beautiful and steeped in history, but with all the techno-toys of a modern metropolis. The Mitterrand era is now nearing its end. But Francois Mitterrand and his glittering Grands Projets will leave as strong a stamp on the fabric of Paris as Henry IV's 16th century construction schemes and Baron Haussmann's 19th century urbanisation drives. The Grands Projets are President Mitterrand's monuments to modernism, but he has also breathed new life into the city's past. In the Mitterrand years, ancient buildings have been renovated, the statues of the city regilded and the grime washed away from the sandstone bridges along the Seine. The result is a compelling combination of the old and the new. The real appeal of the Grands Projets is their rapport with the ancient aspects of Paris. The giant glass pyramid in the Louvre is all the more beguiling because of the contrast between its glacial modernity and the grandeur of the old courtyards. The brutal new Grande Arche at La Defense looks at its best when framed by the 19th century splendour of the original Arc de Triomphe. Then there is Palais-Royal, the arched arcades built by Cardinal Richelieu as an aristocratic enclave in the 17th century that degenerated into dens of debauchery under Philippe d'Orelans in the next century. The Grand Vefour, the restaurant where Napoleon dined with Josephine, is still there today as is the tiny cobbler tucked away on rue de Beaujolais, a beneficiary of Paris' paternalistic property law. But Palais-Royal is also the home of Jack Lang's arts ministry. The ministry itself has been meticulously restored, but a futuristic wall of video screens shimmers through the windows and Daniel Buren's monochrome sculptures glower in the courtyard. Paris does share the shortcomings of most metropolises. The streets are choked with traffic. The pavements are littered with the homeless, the jobless, the penniless and the new efflux of emigres from eastern Europe. The city centre may be plush and prosperous but its suburbs are socially-explosive powderkegs of poverty and violence. This is a side of Paris that the traveller can choose not to see. The French excel at le luxe and Paris can pamper its visitors like no other city. A grand hotel like the Crillon, or the great restaurants, Taillevent and Lucas-Carton, offer classic French style at its very best. This is the peculiarly Parisian product of finesse and instinct, beautiful, but restrained without the slightest hint of vulgarity. But the paupers' Paris has its pleasures too. It costs next to nothing to travel from one end of the city to another on the fast and efficient Metro system, or to sip a steaming cafe-creme at the counter of an Art Nouveau cafe-tabac. As for staring at the silhouette of the Seine islands while crossing the Pont des Arts, or catching the magical moment when the lights of Place de la Concorde come on all at the same time, that costs nothing at all.</p>

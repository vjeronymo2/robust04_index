			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Foothold in a low-cost manufacturing base - German Message High up in the company's cylindrical tower block on the outskirts of Munich a few months ago, a BMW board member gazed wistfully in the direction of the Czech border. 'They work there for a whole day for the wages we pay a German worker for one hour,' - adding that BMW's largest challenge was to reduce costs. One important aspect of the Rover takeover is that it gives BMW a high-level industrial foothold in a country now generally recognised as one of western Europe's lowest-cost manufacturing bases. The deal extends a long list of German investments in Britain in recent years - underlining Britain's accelerated economic integration with the rest of the Continent. The sale of a prestigious manufacturing name will be labelled by some British industrialists as an unsatisfactory 'sell-out' to foreign interests. Negative effects on employment would certainly result from any transfer abroad of headquarters' functions such as marketing and development activities. However, the deal marks further public recognition by a large German company that the UK is an effective place to do business - a step that should be positive for jobs and investment. The deal sends a message to German workers about the need to keep costs down as German motor and engineering groups signal their desire to shift some production abroad. Coincidentally, the takeover was announced on a day of warning strikes by the IG Metall trade union to press home demands for a pay rise of up to 6 per cent. One German investment banker said yesterday the acquisition would provide BMW with a 'useful yardstick' to help press for more streamlined and lower-cost production at home. He said BMW could now effectively put its workers into competition with Rover employees on productivity and quality standards. According to the German-British Chamber of Commerce, the value of German investments in the UK rose to DM26.1bn at the end of 1992 compared with DM22.1bn at end-1990 and only DM8.7bn at end-1985. British investments in west Germany have risen far more slowly, to DM13.6bn at end-1992 against DM10.7bn at end-1985. A survey by the chamber at the beginning of the 1990s cited good labour relations and high productivity as main factors encouraging German companies to boost UK investments. At current exchange rates, British manufacturing wages are 65 to 75 per cent of German levels, although the differential can be smaller in high technology sectors such as chemicals. More importantly, British non-wage charges - primarily social security levies - are only about 40 per cent of wage costs, compared with 85 to 100 per cent in Germany. Heading the league table of German takeovers in the UK have been the acquisitions in 1989 by Deutsche Bank of Morgan Grenfell, which cost Pounds 950m, and by Siemens and GEC of Plessey, valued at Pounds 2bn. Although German groups have largely been satisfied with their UK experiences, not all German takeovers have been success stories. In the late 1980s, Hochtief, the construction group, bought a 25 per cent stake in Rush &amp; Tompkins, but the deal turned sour when the UK contractor went into receivership in 1990.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GERMAN INVESTMENTS IN THE UK  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Number                  employed   Line of business  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Siemens             About   Electrical/Electronic Engineering from                    10,000   chips to power stations Hoechst             5,064   Chemicals/Pharmaceuticals Polymers/Agro                             Chemicals Colours/Building Products ASF                 1,900   Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals, Plastics Bosch               2,100   Alternators, heating equipment Deutsche Bank   About 600   Investment and commercial banking Weidmuller      About 650   Manufacturer of electrical and electronic                             components Mercedes-Benz         950   Sales, marketing and after sales service                             for trucks and cars Wella                 630   Manufacture, sales and marketing of hair                             care products Linde               2,000   Manufacture of fork lift trucks,                             refrigeration and industrial gases Continental           283   Tyre sales and marketing Bayer         Group 2,800   Chemicals and plastics, pharmaceuticals,               Bayer 1,700   diagnostic products, film and other imaging                  Agfa 700   products, allergenic products                Others 400 Schering            1,975   Pharmaceuticals, Agro chemicals, Industrial                             chemicals  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Value of investments in                   Where based    UK operations  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Siemens          HQ Bracknell    Takeover of Plessey with GEC in 1989                                  cost Pounds 2bn Hoechst           HQ Hounslow    18m in 1992 for Hoechst UK Group only:           (located throughout    Doesn't include some of their bigger                       the UK)    companies eg Roussel BASF              HQ Wembley     N/A Bosch                Cardiff     Pounds 100m invested in Cardiff                    Worcester Deutsche Bank         London     N/A Weidmuller         Sheerness     New investment of Pounds 6-7m per year Mercedes-Benz      Barnsley,     Pounds 35m                      Harwich              &amp; Milton Keynes Wella        Basingstoke and     Pounds 3m fixed assets net book value                  South Wales Linde           Basingstoke,     Pounds 15m factory at Basingstoke                 Abingdon and     Pounds 10m invested in other                     Redditch     companies in the UK Continental     West Drayton     N/A Bayer               Newbury,     Fixed assets; Approximately Pounds 60m                  Basingstoke                   Brentford,                  Altringham,           Selby, Bromsgrove,                     Bridgend              Bury St Edmunds Schering       Harkstone and     Approximately Pounds 130m            Chesterford Park,                 nr Cambridge                Stapleford nr                  Nottingham.

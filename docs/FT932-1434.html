			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Ferruzzi owes foreign banks Dollars 4.25bn, minister says FERRUZZI, Italy's troubled industrial group, owes foreign banks about L6,500bn (Dollars 4.25bn) Mr Piero Barucci, Treasury minister, told a parliamentary committee in Rome yesterday. The group said last month its total borrowings approached L31,000bn. Mr Barucci warned of the dangers to Italy's credibility in international financial markets if the crisis at the company were allowed to reach the proportions of last summer's collapse of the Efim state holding company, which has total debts of more than L15,000bn. He said about 110 foreign banks had lent to Ferruzzi, but did not name them. The fact that Ferruzzi is one of Italy's most international companies, especially on the agro-industrial side, explains the large number of foreign banks involved. Bankers in Milan suggested the biggest exposure could be among French institutions, given Ferruzzi's traditional interests in that country. The group controls Eridania Beghin Say, the agro-industrial concern formed in 1991-92 from the merger of Italy's Eridania with Beghin Say, the diversified French sugar company which is indirectly controlled by Ferruzzi. The spread of Ferruzzi's operations and its voracious financing needs implies many other leading international banks might have been big lenders. Mr Barucci sought to calm fears in parliament that the problems at Ferruzzi implied a collapse. 'Ferruzzi is Italy's second biggest conglomerate and its activities touch on strategic areas for the country', he said. It is therefore urgent to intervene, not just in the group's own interest but especially to avoid any risk to the credibility of Italy as a whole'. He emphasised the group was still trading actively and was 'industrially healthy'. Bankers said Mr Barucci's stress on acting quickly to solve Ferruzzi's debt problems was coloured by his experiences during the Efim affair, and the previous year's collapse of the Federconsorzi farm service group. Both episodes triggered a bruising battle of wills between foreign bank creditors and the Italian authorities. The Efim debacle in particular, marked by confusing messages from the government and indications that the Treasury would not fully honour group debts, tarnished Italy's reputation just as the lira was coming under mounting pressure before last September's currency crisis. The share price of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria holding company fell by more than 12 per cent to L559 yesterday. Mr Pier Carlo Marengo, managing director of Credito Italiano said his bank's exposure was about L1,300bn, AP-DJ reports from New York. Despite the scale of Ferruzzi's difficulties he said he was optimistic about the outcome of the situation. He said although the Ferruzzi family hoped to keep control of Eridinia Beghin-Say, 'everything else is up for sale'.</p>

"Our  system, which is one of free market prices, does not include  compulsory mechanisms. The government is not thinking of  controlling market prices," the minister said, rather irritated  and nervous. The government strategy regarding oligopolies,  according to the minister, will be to talk with them in order to  identify factors explaining all excessive price increases.    Cardoso said the government decision to call on research  institutes to help formulate the URV variation index has the  purpose "of making clear to society that the URV is not an  indicator used to manipulate results. We still have not lowered  the hammer on this, but the government wants to ask these  institutes to help us." According to the minister, FIPE  [Economic Research Institute Foundation] President Juarez  Rizzieri said the institute might have difficulties calculating  the daily inflation rate, but it is willing to cooperate with  the government.    Cardoso believes the definition of the criteria to update  the  URV "is a delicate matter" that must be decided "calmly and with  patience." Regarding the minimum salary, Cardoso said the way to  increase the minimum salary's real purchasing power -- as the  president wants -- is by increasing companies' productivity and  stabilizing the price of food and other consumer goods. "Without  those elements, everything will be just fantasy. We do not want  to create another illusion," Cardoso said. The minister admitted  the possibility of discussing the conversion of the URV with  economic interest group representatives. "We can, but we have  not talked about it," the minister said.    Cardoso said state companies also will cooperate with the  economic plan. "We are making a major effort to stabilize the  economy. It is necessary for people to wait for a few month in  order to achieve what we want afterward," Cardoso said.</p>

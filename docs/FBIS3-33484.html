The candidates were presented in the  Pasos Perdidos Hall of the Chamber of Deputies. The speaker is  Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez, whose name is at the top of the  list.    Alvarez said: "Our candidates want to guarantee that the new  Constitution will strengthen democracy, establish new rights,  and recover a judicial system totally independent from political  power." He criticized the administration of President Menem, and  did not spare the Radical Civic Union; he spoke of the "ethic  submission" of this political party and of the need for the  Grand Front to become an election alternative in the district.    Indeed, one paragraph of the document released yesterday  states: "We will be the only alternative to the single party  system that seeks reelection through the Menem-Alfonsin pact."  After reading the document, Alvarez presented the candidates.    The second name in the list is Anibal Ibarra, councilman and  former prosecutor, followed by Deputy Graciela Fernandez Meijide  and lawyer Raul Eugenio Zaffaroni. Given the public activity of  Ibarra and Zaffaroni, Alvarez said that the Grand Front "seeks  to struggle in the assembly in favor of a system of justice  really independent from Menemist corruption."    Next on the list are Eduardo Barcessat, Adriana Puiggros,  Alicia Oliveira, a former member of the CELS [Center for Legal  and Social Studies], and Jose Miguez Bonino, from the Permanent  Human Rights Association. Alvarez described Puiggros as an  "expert on education and science." He took the opportunity to  criticize the Olivos pact, saying: "That pact has also forgotten  education, which is why we included it on the list," he said.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELCOME SHIFT ON CAMBODIA;  </P> <P> U.S. SUPPORT FOR RESISTANCE COALITION ENDS  </P> <P> The announcement that the United States will open a dialogue with Vietnam over  the war in Cambodia marks a major -- and decidedly welcome -- shift in U.S.  policy towards Indochina. It effectively ends U.S. support for a Cambodian  resistance coalition that included the bloody Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> By enlisting Hanoi's help, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said  Washington hopes to end a decade of fighting in Cambodia and prevent the Khmer  Rouge from returning to power. But he cautioned that the talks will be confined  to Cambodia, and do not signal the normalization of relations between the  United States and Vietnam.  </P> <P> The new approach, however, does suggest a new realism about Indochina, one  driven less by ideology and more by pragmatism. It is a significant  acknowledgement that it's time for the United States to move beyond the painful  wounds left by the Vietnam War, especially now that Vietnam is being forced to  change, too, as it receives less aid from the financially strapped Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> Baker's announcement, after conferring with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard  Shevardnadze, came at the conclusion of talks in Paris. There, members of the  United Nations Security Council met again to attempt to draft a cease-fire  between Cambodia's rival factions and to provide an interim U.N. administration  pending free elections.  </P> <P> The United States has long shunned Cambodia's current Vietnam-backed Communist  government of Prime Minister Hun Sen. It has insisted instead on supporting a  coalition of non-Communist groups headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a former  Cambodian ruler. The triumvirate, however, includes the Khmer Rouge, who were  responsible for 1 million to 2 million deaths while they controlled Cambodia  from 1975 to 1978.  </P> <P> The result, at best, has been an uneasy alliance in which the Khmer Rouge has  been the least cooperative member. Most recently, Khmer Rouge representatives  refused to attend peace talks in Tokyo to discuss forming a multifaction  council to organize a free election.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, even as the Paris talks began, the Khmer Rouge was threatening new  attacks against the Hun Sen regime if its terms were not met. Baker said in  Paris that Washington would no longer recognize control by resistance groups --  including the Khmer Rouge -- of Cambodia's U.N. seat.  </P> <P> Baker's announcement comes as mixed signals on Cambodia and Vietnam are coming  out of Washington. For example, a week after the House voted in June to  continue aid to the non-Communist resistance groups in Cambodia, the Senate  Intelligence Committee voted to cut off such aid. The contradictory positions  are to be worked out later this month.  </P> <P> The policy shift should mark the beginning of a consistent and compassionate  Cambodia policy.  </P></p>

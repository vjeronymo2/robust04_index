Extending his welcome to the guests, Rong described the  relationship between the Assembly of the European Council and  the National People's Congress of China (NPC) as a "good  cooperative one."    Rong noted that China is a developing country whose people  hope that it can be built under a peaceful international  environment, which is essential to the development of Europe and  Asia as well.    The vice-president added that Europe has achieved great  progress in the economy, science and technology and is  complementary economically to China.    China hopes that its friendly relations and cooperation with  Europe in the fields of economics and trade, science and  technology and other fields will be strengthened further, Rong  said.

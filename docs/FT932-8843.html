			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Letter: The debilitating effect of late payments Sir, Your article on late payment ('UK's late-payment culture attacked', May 10) brings a welcome focus to an aspect of business even more debilitating to enterprise than government policy. It seems that late payment reflects so many aspects of our society where transgressors are rewarded for their action, or inaction. If only the government would act, or enable organisations such as the chamber of commerce to act, to ensure that all businesses behave in an honourable way towards their suppliers. One would hope that this would also reduce the flow of mindless reminders, requests and demands for payment which the issuer knows is no more than feeble wolf-crying.

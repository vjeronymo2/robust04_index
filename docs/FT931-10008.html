			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Chinese mount reverse takeover of Stonehill A PRIVATE Chinese-based property development company is coming to the London market through a Pounds 51.7m reverse takeover of Stonehill Holdings, the UK property management group which owns and manages Stonehill Business Park in north London. Under the terms of the agreement, Stonehill will acquire Cathay International United Investments for Pounds 51.7m in new paper from Cathay International Investment, a company set up in 1988 and owned by Mr Wu Zhen Tao, a former Beijing government official. Of the 517m new Stonehill shares which CII will receive, 117m will be placed with institutional and corporate investors in China, Hong Kong and the UK by Marshall Securities. Stonehill, a furniture manufacturer until the late 1980s, has a market capitalisation of Pounds 2.31m and posted a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 170,000 (Pounds 290,000) in the six months to September 30. The group's shares were suspended at its request early last month at 11p apiece. Once the acquisition is completed Stonehill will become a subsidiary of CII with Mr Wu, who was born and educated in Beijing and has held a number of important positions in government scientific and financial institutions in China, as chief executive. The company then plans a 2-for-1 rights issue of 42m shares to raise Pounds 4.2m which will be used to reduce borrowings and provide working capital for the new enlarged group. In addition CII will make a general offer for the existing 21m shares to satisfy the City Code on takeovers and mergers. The transactions have been arranged so that CII will own not less than 69 per cent and not more than 74.3 per cent of the enlarged group. CIU's main asset is the 346-room Landmark Hotel in Shenzhen, China, which represents the final phase of a mixed housing, retail and commercial development undertaken by CIU. The hotel is due to open in June and will be managed under contract by a joint venture company between CII and the Hong Kong-based Koppen Yan Zimmermmann group. Mr James Buchanan, Stonehill's chairman, said the deal will enable the enlarged group to pursue property opportunities in both China and the UK. Despite closing its furniture operations the UK group has remained highly geared and loss-making and has lacked the resources to expand.</p>

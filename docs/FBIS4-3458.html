			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>   [Text] Textile industries which expose illegal  transshipment among their counterparts could be rewarded with a  larger share of export quotas from the government. This is a  part of the new measures being taken by China to strike back at  the unlawful textile activities. (Li Peishuang) has more:    [Begin recording] [Li] The activities mainly refer to  bypassing the textile [word indistinct] administration by  exporting Chinese goods through a third country or region to  nations which set quotas on mainland products. At present, 17  countries limit the amount of the mainland's textile exports.  They include the United States, Canada, the European Union,  Finland, Norway, and Austria. China's new regulations were  under discussion last week in Guangzhou at the fourth national  conference on quelling illegal trade activities in textiles.  Although the laws have yet to emerge publicly, a top official  with the foreign trade ministry said they demand stricter  penalties for violators. Zhou Keren is the director for the  trade administration department.    [Zhou speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation]  Zhou Keren says punishments range from issuing warnings to  confiscation, and from fines to the suspension of the violator's  export right. He says businesses should be brought to court if  they have incurred serious losses for the country. Meanwhile  the government is calling for assistance from all sides to check  transshipments. The ministry official Zhou Keren says the  government will award the larger export quota for enterprises  which inform on illegal transshipments. In fact, four  enterprises in coastal Liaoning, Fujian and Guangdong provinces  have already faced the tougher new penalties. Liaoning's  (Shankou) company signed a contract last August with Hong Kong  to export shorts and pajamas to Singapore. The products were  made by three Chinese factories. However, they were labelled  made in Fiji and sent to the United States late last year. The  foreign trade ministry confiscated all the company's earnings  from the trade deal, cut off all its export quotas of export  textile, and deprived of its right to apply for such quotas in  1994. The ministry official Zhou Keren says no cases of illegal  transshipments occur occasionally in China [sentence as heard].  The problem in general is not as bad as the U.S. made out  earlier this year. Back then, the transshipment issue sparked  the dispute between China and the United States and forced both  countries to compromise to insure continued trade. Finally Zhou  Keren says exposure of malpractices will serve as a signal to  potential violators that China is more resolved than ever to  fight future illegal transshipments. [end recording]</p>

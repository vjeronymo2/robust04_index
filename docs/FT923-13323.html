			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Names' leader to head new agency SIR DAVID Berriman, a prominent City figure and a leader of loss-making Lloyd's Names, is to head a new agency at the troubled insurance market. Sir David, a former merchant banker who holds a range of directorships, will chair the agency - which has been formed by a merger between two smaller groupings, Knightstone and Spratt &amp; White. He is the latest of a number of Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's - to take a more active role in the management of the market's businesses. Sir David has assumed prominence at Lloyd's as chairman of the Rose Thomson Young Action group, formed by Names who are members of Syndicate 255. This syndicate ran up heavy losses as a result of its involvement in spiral reinsurance, in which syndicates and companies reinsure each other's exposures to catastrophe losses. Sir David said: 'A lot of the failures of Lloyd's in the past have been linked to the failure of managing agents to manage underwriters. We will watch our syndicates like hawks.' In a separate development the High Court will today hear a motion from Lloyd's seeking to set aside a motion calling for a judicial review of the market's authorities. Six Names connected to the Gooda Walker Action group initially sought the judicial review in May. Judicial reviews are actions against public or semi-public bodies which are alleged to have failed to observe their - often statutory - duties. Meanwhile, Lloyd's confirmed yesterday that voting on the resolutions being put forward at the society's extraordinary general meeting on 27 July will be by postal ballot.</p>

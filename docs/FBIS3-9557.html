The coalition for the local elections is a first step for an  agreement on cooperation in the general elections, Weiss told  journalists. The coalition should offer citizens a "clear  political alternative" and will receive support from partner  parties in Western Europe, Weiss said.    The parties of the left coalition are the Social Democratic  Party in Slovakia (SDSS), headed by Jaroslav Volf, and the  Agricultural Movement (HZ), led by Jozef Klein.    The SDL has offered coalition membership also to the newly  founded Slovak Entrepreneurs Association (ZPS), which however  has decided to enter the elections independently. Polls show  the ZPS to be Slovakia's fourth strongest party. With 4.8  percent support among voters it would represent a significant  boost to SDL popularity, currently rated at 11 percent.</p>

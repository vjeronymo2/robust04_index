			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Whisky's youthful look The search is on for a lost generation of UK whisky drinkers. Over the next few months, United Distillers and Hiram Walker will re-launch their two best-selling brands to attract younger customers. The move has been prompted by the rise of white spirits, such as vodka and tequila, and the growing market share of foreign beers and wine. But there is also a fear that whisky's reputation as a drink for older professional men - an image promoted by the producers themselves - is alienating a whole generation of younger customers. 'Most young people relate to whisky drinking in terms of their fathers,' says Pat Doble, core brands development director at Distillers, which manufactures the market leader, Bell's. 'Our challenge is to make them look at whisky in a different way and to see it as an energiser, not a winding down drink.' Distillers plans to spend Pounds 30m over the next two years re-launching Bell's. The twin themes of the campaign will be to promote whisky as a mixer drink and to lower its customer age profile. But in order not to alienate its core older customer base, Bell's is also to be marketed as a more mature Scotch, with a guarantee that the blend is made of whiskies which are at least eight years old. Hiram Walker is to relaunch Teachers, the third biggest selling brand, to attract younger drinkers. 'There will be no pictures of wildlife, claymores or countryside. We have to recapture the aspirations of our customers,' says David Jarvis, managing director of Allied Lyons, owner of Hiram Walker. Underpinning the campaigns is the decline in sales in the UK, the product's biggest market. UK off-trade sales dropped from 68m litres in 1983 to 60m last year, according to Stats MR, the market research group. In the same period, vodka sales jumped from 13.45m litres to 20.05m. Distillers has been encouraged by its campaign to revamp Dewar's - the biggest-selling Scotch in the US - which halted its sales slide. The company also points to the remarkable rise of Venezuela, Thailand and Greece as leading whisky markets which now contribute 20 per cent of Distillers' profits. 'Whisky is seen as the young person's drink in these markets,' said Doble. 'If we can do it there, we can do it here.'</p>

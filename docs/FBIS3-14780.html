			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mircea Dascaliuc and Anca Florea report from Chisinau] </F>   [Excerpts] In the course of a discussion I conducted about  half an hour ago with Mrs. Raisa Botezatu, vice president of the  Central Electoral Commission, I was given the following  information:    In connection with the data centralization system, Mrs.  Botezatu told us that from local commissions data are passed on  to a technical group, which in turn submits them to the Central  Electoral Commission to be processed with the help of computers.  Unfortunately, at that time, the Central Electoral Commission  did not have any information on the number of participants in  the elections. [passage omitted]    Insofar as the east rayons of the Republic of Moldova are  concerned, up until yesterday 3,910 out of 400,000 possible  voters had crossed the Dniester River to cast their vote.    A total of 2,278,959 citizens were registered in the list  and  confirmed; this number, however, does not include the voters in  the south rayons; nothing was known about them either. So far,  Raisa Botezatu told us, 163 foreign observers and more than  5,000 local observers have been accredited.    On the other hand, local special envoys and correspondents  of  the national radio broadcasting station of the Republic of  Moldova report that control at the Dniester River crossing in  both directions was particularly strict this morning. All those  people who wanted to cross the river were registered. According  to the same sources, the number of people who wanted to cast  their vote in the course of the week was much higher than today,  when local authorities made it difficult to cross the Dniester  River.    We also want to inform you that this morning at 0745 [0545  GMT], Mircea Snegur, president of the Republic of Moldova, cast  his vote at the Russian-Polish School. According to the  national television station, on this occasion he reiterated his  hopes that the elections will yield a parliamentary majority.    Yesterday, a completely unforeseen incident occurred.  Following yesterday's visit by the international observers, the  illegal authorities in Tiraspol confiscated the automobile in  which Romanian Senator Adrian Paunescu was traveling and the  driver of the automobile was detained. The vehicle is the  property of Romania's Senate. Diplomatic sources we contacted  told us that the real reasons for this incident are not known.  [passage omitted]</p>

Late on Tuesday, following a meeting between senior figures  from the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and Pawlaks Polish  Peasant Party (PSL) at Warsaws Parkowa Hotel, both sides  expressed their willingness to maintain the coalition for the  full four-year term of the present parliament. The participants  also stressed that their first priority was to see the 1994  budget safely through parliament.    The meeting was closed to the press, but reporters noted  among the participants: SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski, Sejm  Speaker Jozef Oleksy, Justice Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz  and Marek Borowski for the SLD - while for the PSL: Prime  Minister Pawlak, PSL President Jozef Zych, Education Minister  Aleksander Luczak, and Cabinet Office minister Michal Strak.    Earlier, following an hour-long meeting between Prime  Minister Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader told  the "Panorama" TV news bulletin that there was "little chance"  of an agreement. However, Sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy told a  late-night TV news bulletin that the coalition partners had  agreed to compromise, out of a feeling of responsibility for the  governance of the state. According to him, the main result of  the meeting at the "Parkowa" Hotel had been an agreement to  respect the terms of the coalition agreement between the SLD and  the PSL.    Oleksy added that the SLD would be nominating a replacement  for Borowski as finance minister, but declined to name any  likely candidates.    Meanwhile, leading figures in the opposition parties  declined  to comment directly on the present crisis. The leader of the  Democratic Union (UD) Tadeusz Mazowiecki ruled out the immediate  possibility of UD participation in government. "I do not  believe the UD will change its position on the political scene:  That we need to build a lasting opposition."    Heart surgeon Zbigniew Religa, a senator and leader of the  Non-Party Reform Bloc (BBWR), said that he believed the fall of  the current ruling coalition would be advantageous for the BBWR.    Leszek Moczulski, leader of the Confederation for an  Independent Poland (KPN), reiterated that the price for KPN  involvement in any future coalition would be the exclusion of  the post-communist Social-Democracy of the Republic of Poland  (SDRP), the leading political force in the Democratic Left  Alliance (SLD).</p>

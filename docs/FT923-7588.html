			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Waiting for M3 GERMAN monetary policy will come under even closer scrutiny this week, as the D-Mark threatens to make further gains against both the US dollar and European currencies, writes James Blitz. Last week's figure for German wholesale prices in July suggested that inflationary pressures had eased, and slowed the D-Mark's gains against the dollar. Dealers believe that falling German inflation will reduce the need for the Bundesbank to keep interest rates high, reducing the wide differential between US and German short-term rates that is driving the market. July's figure for M3 money supply in Germany, which is due out this week, will help to confirm whether the pressure on rates has really eased. The indicator is the guiding light of Bundesbank policy, and is expected to reamain high, at around 8.6 per cent from a previous close of 8.7 per cent. Some analysts think that the figure could even come in above 9 per cent, ensuring tight monetary policy. The markets will keep a close eye on the Bundesbank's weekly intervention in the money market. Last week, the central bank triggered a fall in the dollar by withdrawing more liquidity than was expected, pushing call money up to the Lombard rate level. If the Bank adds net liquidity on Wednesday, the D-Mark could weaken. Inside the European Monetary System, the main attention will be on sterling. Barring open intervention from the Bank of England, sterling's key indicator will be the provisional figure for second quarter GDP, due out on Wednesday. After a  1/2 per cent fall in the first quarter, the market believes that the decline is slowing down to -0.2 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- Former de facto president, General  Jorge Rafael Videla, was acquitted yesterday on charges of  promoting crime filed against the former head of the military  dictatorship after he had said that the Armed Forces should have  been paid, instead of having to pay the price for their actions  during the Dirty War.    According to the verdict issued by Judge Fernando Larrain,  Videla did not intend to make his opinions public because they  came in the context of a speech made at a dinner last year in  front of some 50 retired military officers.    The complaint had been filed last November by the government  through the Human Rights Under-Secretary Alicia Pierini after  Videla's statements were reproduced by Buenos Aires daily  CLARIN. Government sources yesterday refused to comment on the  verdict. [passage omitted]</p>

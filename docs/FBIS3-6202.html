At the meeting presided over by Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime  minister and minister of the National Unification Board (NUB),  the ministers agreed to strive for an agreement on exchanging  special envoys at the seventh contact.    They also decided to keep pushing for the exchange by March  21 after analyzing the results of the six inter-Korean  working-level contacts held so far.    The ministers, however, reaffirmed that if North Korea  delays  the envoy exchange to the last minute, the third round of  high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington should be put  off too, informed sources said.    Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu reported on the  results of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspection of North Korean nuclear sites, officials said.    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Senior Presidential  Secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs Chong  Chong-uk also attended the meeting.</p>

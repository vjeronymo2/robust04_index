			<p>BFN     [Text] Gdansk, May 24 -- The international drugs business  is increasingly often using the Gdansk route to smuggle drugs to  western countries since the Balkans have been ridden by war and  the traditional routes are unsafe. [sentence as received]    For example, prosecutors in Gdansk are investigating the  case  of Janusz H. who was arrested last January under the charge of  having tried to smuggle half-a-tonne of cocaine aboard a Polish  ship "Lublin 2," but they also work to trace all the  international ramifications of the case.    According to reports obtained by Gdansk prosecutors from  U.S.  authorities, Janusz H. had earlier been sentenced in the United  States for a similar crime to 30 years in jail. In 1985 he was  the skipper of a fishing ship "Kuna" and got caught off Florida  coast while trying to smuggle 15 tonnes of marijuana.    Released earlier and deported to Poland, Janusz H. started  his own business as the owner of a Col-Pol-de-Pesca company  chiefly preoccupied with trading with Colombia. His interest in  doing business with Latin Americans was not incidental. While  in a U.S. jail, he had made friends with a Bolivian citizen  Pedro Julio B.A. who was serving an 18-year term for cocaine  smuggling. This man was seen in Gdynia at the time when Janusz  H. was arrested but prosecutors did not manage to gather  evidence against him and he was released. Last June, police in  Ecuador seized a 10-kg parcel with heroin addressed to Janusz H.  in Gdynia, Prosecutor Mariusz Marciniak told PAP.</p>

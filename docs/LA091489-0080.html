However, two players who turned in outstanding games on defense were  linebackers Jeff Gustin and Phil Heppner.  </P> <P> Occidental was led on offense against Menlo by running back Steve McClaskey, a  former player for Azusa Pacific who rushed for 109 yards and one touchdown.  Another leader for Occidental is quarterback Tony Werbelow, who played at  Arcadia High.  </P></p>

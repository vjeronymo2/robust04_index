			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Higher shipments help lift Whirlpool profits 11% Whirlpool, the leading US maker of white goods, yesterday announced an 11 per cent increase in fourth-quarter net earnings, helped by higher unit shipments in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia. The group made Dollars 69m, or 94 cents a share, up from Dollars 62m, or 87 cents, in the same period of last year, while revenues rose 4 per cent to Dollars 1.90bn, despite the negative effect of currency translation. The figures included Dollars 14m, or 19 cents, in after-tax charges for restructuring in Canada and Europe and for ending agreements with distributors in the US. The 1992 quarter was reduced by an Dollars 11m, or 15 cents a share, special charge. Whirlpool made Dollars 51m, or 67 cents, in 1993 as a whole, down from Dollars 205m, or Dollars 2.90, in 1992, although excluding special charges earnings would have been 32 per cent up at Dollars 271m. The company said shipments in its core North American market had grown in 1993 well ahead of the sector's 5 per cent expansion and it expected regional industry shipments to rise by 3-4 per cent this year. Whirlpool's North American operating results were up significantly on 1992. In Europe the group recorded strong shipment growth despite an industry decline of 1 to 2 per cent. Industry shipments in 1994 were expected to be similar to last year. Maytag, the white goods manufacturer, reported fourth quarter income up 55 per cent, from Dollars 11.2m, or 11 cents in 1992, to Dollars 17.5m, or 16 cents. The improvement was due mainly to increased volume, especially in premium brands, and greater production and operating efficiencies. However, the Hoover Europe subsidiary lost Dollars 6.9m, against income of Dollars 4.1m, due to pressure on operating margins and inefficiencies associated with its consolidation of vacuum cleaner production in Scotland.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KENNEDY WINS 3-A TENNIS TITLE;  </P> <P> DEPTH CARRIES GOLDEN COUGARS PAST EAGLE ROCK IN CITY FINAL  </P> <P> Craig Raub was supremely confident that his Kennedy High boys' tennis team  would respond to the challenge of the City Section 3-A Division championships  Friday.  </P> <P> "This team is really happy-go-lucky and casual about everything," Raub said.  </P> <P> And so it was that the Golden Cougars took the 3-A title in stride, using a  well-balanced attack to defeat two-time defending champion Eagle Rock, 20-9  1/2, at the Racquet Centre in Universal City.  </P> <P> Kennedy, which dropped from the 4-A to the 3-A Division this season, had never  previously reached the final round of the City team finals. This season,  however, depth set Kennedy apart. As a prime example, the Golden Cougars' three  doubles teams combined to win 43 of 45 sets during the playoffs.  </P> <P> "For us to have a chance, we were going to have to semi-neutralize their  doubles," said Eagle Rock coach Hal Stepeau, whose team had won five of the  last seven 3-A titles. "We just couldn't find any holes or creases to probe."  </P> <P> After his team beat Poly in the semifinals Tuesday, Raub lightened his rigorous  practice regimen, cutting workouts short.  </P> <P> "I figured that if we don't have it down by 18 weeks, we don't have it down  period," Raub said.  </P> <P> Kennedy had beaten Eagle Rock (25-2) earlier in the season, but Raub took  nothing for granted.  </P> <P> "We were dead even," he said, touching his index finger and thumb to  approximate the parity of the teams. "It was by the skin of our butts."  </P> <P> Kennedy's Bobby Butler, Tony Yean and David Schwartz each lost a singles match  and Josh Etting lost twice. In doubles, Eun Sung Song and Che Naveja, the  Cougars' No. 3 team that did not lose a set in the regular season, swept their  matches, 7-5, 6-2, 6-3. Henry Wang and Jimmy Min also swept three matches, 6-1,  6-4, 6-4. Ted LeGrand and Tin Hoang won two sets, 6-2, 6-3, and lost, 7-5.  </P> <P> Taft, which stunned University in the quarterfinals, lost to Palisades, 23  1/2-6, in the 4-A Division championship that also was held Friday at the  Racquet Centre.  </P> <P> "I'm proud of how hard they worked to get here," Taft Coach Marvin Jones said  of the Toreadors (13-4), who last won a 4-A Division title in 1984. "In a round  robin, it's depth that counts . . . and Palisades is deep."  </P> <P> Palisades Coach Bob Kling agreed.  </P> <P> "Sometimes we've had three or four nationally-ranked kids and they come out  here and decimate people," said Kling, who has won 10 team championships. "This  year, we just have a bunch of hard-working kids."  </P> <P> Taft failed to win a singles set. Scott Pitters came the closest when he lost,  7-6 (8-6 in the tiebreaker), to Drake Jantze, Palisades' top player.  </P> <P> Jeff Hartman and Jeff Harlan of Taft defeated Greg Rosenbloom and Damon Curran,  6-2, and beat Jeremy Grunstein and Arseen Solomon, 6-2. Beau Heggen and Derek  Halpern won Taft's only other set, beating Rosenbloom and Curran, 7-5.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There has been a change in the agenda of the  presidents and heads of government. A lunch had been scheduled  at the Fishing Club around noon today. However, in the wake of  numerous statements on individual positions each president has  regarding the Cuban issue, the U.S. economic blockade, and  President Fidel Castro's unexpected speech yesterday, the  leaders decided to meet or have lunch here at the convention  center to discuss, behind closed doors, the positions presented  on the Cuban case.    Later on, at approximately 2100 GMT, the last working  session  will be held. Tonight, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria  Trujillo and Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem will close  the event. They will be the only speakers at the ceremony.</p>

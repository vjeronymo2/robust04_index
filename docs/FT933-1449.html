			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: 'Dictator' Yeltsin free to mould new order  -The president's constitutional blueprint RUSSIA is now a wholly centralised state, lacking, at the federal level, even the formal bodies of a countervailing power which were present in the Soviet period. Until the election of a new parliament in 11 weeks time, Mr Boris Yeltsin, as president, has the powers of a dictator. The hope that he will not become one rests upon his promises, and those of his government and aides. The founding instrument of this new precarious state is Mr Yeltsin's decree, signed on Tuesday, 'On step-by-step Constitutional reform in the Russian Federation'. It is a historically important document, for it seeks both to destroy the old constitutional order which has governed Russia since the collapse of the Union at the end of 1991 - and provide the basis of the new, temporary one. It claims parliament has 'endangered the state and security of the country', and that Russia, as a new state, needs a new constitution, a new parliament and new deputies. It sets out a timetable for these elections - on December 12 - and the tasks to be accomplished: A draft constitution must be approved by a constitutional commission and a constituent assembly. The draft will be placed before parliament as soon as it meets. A Federation Council, composed of council leaders from the regions and republics will form the upper chamber; a state duma with 400 members will form the lower chamber, and will be elected in December. The decree abolishes the Soviet-era parliament, both the standing Supreme Soviet and the occasionally-convened Congress of People's Deputies. It brings the central bank and the procurator general's office from parliamentary to governmental control (both Mr Viktor Gerashchenko and Mr Valenin Stepankov, the Procurator General, formerly hostile to the government, have pledged loyalty). The Constitutional Court is suspended until a new parliament is elected. Though the military has also pledged loyalty, it has become clear that the bulk of the security function will fall on the Interior Ministry and its troops. One of the first decisions of the cabinet, on Wednesday, was to pass a resolution 'On strengthening the defence of social order', which calls for 40,000 more recruits into the interior forces and the founding of a volunteer corps to patrol neighbourhoods. Though Mr Yeltsin has promised to use no force, neither Mr Viktor Yerin, the Interior Minister nor General Pavel Grachev, the Defence Minister, have been so categorical - the latter promising to return provocation with force. In the regions, the president claims the adherence of most heads of administration - though not of the elected councils, where the majority are probably against him. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister, said no move would be made against them if they merely expressed opposition - they would only be dissolved if they attempted to interfere with elections. As to the deputies still claiming to run the country in the Russian parliament, Mr Shakhrai said that no move would be made against them - unless their armed guards themselves opened fire on people, or on buildings. 'We are quite prepared to live with a situation where not everyone agrees with us,' he said. 'But we can't tolerate a tragedy.' Mr Yerin, giving the Interior Ministry's estimation of how many people have so far vocally disagreed with the president, said that only 20,000 people across 27 cities (excepting Moscow) had demonstrated so far. The Interior Ministry has, however, kept itself busy by arresting corrupt bureaucrats, he claimed. This is, as Mr Shakhrai admitted yesterday, presidential rule. It depends on the will of the president as to how soon it will become a democracy. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

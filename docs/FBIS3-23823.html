			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Krivov, acting leader of Russian </F> Federation president's expert group, under the rubric "Reform  and Prognosis": "With An Eye to the Future"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Situation in the Economy </H5>   An analysis of the economic situation in Russia will produce  few consoling results so far. The year 1993 really was not one  of stabilization.    There are many reasons for this. The absence of a broad  segment of property owners in the country had its effect.  Another factor was the extremely low level of enterprise  investment activity caused by the high inflation. Producers  found it impossible to recover from the collapse of trade with  the CIS countries.    As a result, the production of products of industry and  agriculture in 1993 amounted to only 84 percent and 94 percent  of the preceding year's, respectively. The volume of cargo  shipments dropped by almost 30 percent. Consumer prices rose  more than 10-fold and retail commodity turnover decreased by 6  percent.    Still, these indicators are better than the ones for 1992.  In  terms of the absolute majority of parameters the recession is  slowing, and the rates of inflation have decreased by more than  half. Prognosticatory indicators of the development of the  economy in 1994 obtained by the government of the Russian  Federation show that stronger tendencies toward stabilization  have been observed.    According to predictions, in 1994 inflation rates will drop  by half, the decline in the volumes of industrial production  will be only 6 percent, with more than twofold--in light  industry, the volume of investments will stabilize, and the  federal budget deficit will not exceed 6 percent of the gross  domestic product.    Thus the new type of economy that has developed during the  years of reform is beginning to settle into a stable operating  routine, although still with certain interruptions. Primary  transformations have been carried out, which have made it  possible to create the foundations of a market economy to  replace the administrative-command system.    But the modern Russian market is still imperfect in many  ways. On the one hand, the roots of the administrative system  have remained--there is an extremely strong dependence of  enterprises and entrepreneurs on decisions of bureaucrats. On  the other hand, many of the worst features of a market  environment are appearing. These include, above all, the lack of  real legal protection for citizens and enterprises and the lack  of responsibility on the part of participants in economic  activity to their partners, consumers, and the state.    Today, now that the primary reforms have basically been  completed, it is necessary to earmark new points of reference  for work for the restoration and development of the Russian  economy in the immediate future.  <H5>  Putting Economic Legislation in Order </H5>   One of the major priorities, in whose realization the  Federal  Assembly will play a special role, is to eliminate the chaos in  economic legislation and the practice of its application, which  plays a large negative role in the development of the crisis.  The lack of the necessary laws, disparate and contradictory  acts, and constant revisions of previously adopted decisions  make it impossible for industrialists and entrepreneurs to work  normally.    The practice of adopting special decisions regarding  individual branches and enterprises is having an extremely  negative effect. It violates the unity of the economic  mechanism, gives rise to bureaucratic omnipotence and  corruption, and perverts the motivation for the operation of the  enterprises (not work but consumer demand and "pushing through"  advantageous administrative decisions become the main focus).    Finally, there is no real responsibility on the part of the  enterprises to their partners, clients, and the state. It is  necessary to create an effective and rapidly functioning  mechanism for judicial resolution of economic disputes and, the  main thing, provide for implementation of decisions that are  made.    The essential needs of a rapidly changing economy require  continuous improvement of economic legislation. But it is  necessary to achieve good structure and eliminate  contradictoriness of the legislative system and to get away from  the chaos in the adoption of normative acts.    The following should be included among the legislative acts  subject to adoption in the near future:    --A new civil code.    --On the state budget of the Russian Federation for 1994.    --On the interaction of the budgets of various levels.    --On a change in the country's tax system.    --On a three-year moratorium on making changes to economic  and legal legislation.    --On mechanisms and guarantees of repatriation of the profit  of foreign investors.    --On mandatory auctions when the state grants export  licenses, rights to work deposits of minerals, rights to fulfill  certain state orders and functions, and other property rights.    --On concessions and other kinds of leasing of state land  and  mineral and other resources.    --On state credits (privatization, investment, tax, etc.).    --On economic legal proceedings.    It is necessary to draw up and approve a strict schedule for  the adoption of these laws. Delays are inadmissible--the  president may wait, but the economy will not wait.    The new Civil Code along with the Constitution of Russia  that  was adopted should be a reliable guarantee of the rights of  Russian citizens in all areas, including economic. It is on the  basis of these documents that the rest of the areas of  legislation should be built.    Democratization of economic legislation will be an essential  task. This does not mean to produce more and more restrictions  on the activity of industrialists and entrepreneurs but, on the  contrary, to direct all innovations in economic legislation  toward easing the tax and administrative burden of the commodity  producers.    After changing the tax system it will be necessary to  introduce a moratorium (say, for three years) on new taxes and  increased rates of taxes and deductions currently in effect.  Everyone stands to gain from the introduction of such a  moratorium. A new source of stability will appear in the  country--and, consequently, more of the enterprise's attention  will be devoted to questions of development and not immediate  survival. Additionally, it will be possible to reveal the  weaknesses of the tax system with greater precision after three  years.    It is necessary to increase the effectiveness of laws and  devote more attention to responsibility for their execution.  Democracy turns into chaos if the popular saying "the law is a  drive shaft: whichever way you turn it, it will go," remains in  effect.    All we have to do is change the laws to accommodate  immediate  interests or interpret them at our own discretion to suit  political ambitions--and instability in society will immediately  increase and tension will grow.  <H5>  Relations Between the Center and the Regions </H5>   The provisions of the Federation Treaty on delimitation of  authority have still not been fully realized. "Work with the  territories" frequently becomes a tug-of-war.    The new Constitution clearly defined the functions of the  Center and the regions. In order for these provisions not to  remain merely on paper it is necessary to organize the process  for transferring to components of the Federation functions that  are not assigned to the Federation and resources for fulfilling  them.    The constant conflicts because of transferring taxes to the  Center and funds from the federal budget to the regions are  inadmissible. It is necessary to completely separate the tax  systems of the Federation and its components, granting the  regions the necessary financial resources and tax authority.    It is necessary to combine independence of the components of  the Federation and normal functioning of the vertical executive  structure in performing functions of federal power. To do this,  local organs of federal departments should be created in the  regions. Their functions should be limited to the ones assigned  in the Constitution to the Federation, precluding intervention  in the authority of its components.    The Constitution has strengthened the equality of the  components of the Federation, which means that there should be a  standard approach when granting them subsidies, benefits, etc.  and standard criteria for adopting these decisions (level of  employment, average per capita income, etc.).    The Constitution and the federal laws must be regarded as  the  minimum of rights guaranteed to citizens and enterprises  throughout the entire territory of Russia. Components of the  Federation may use their own resources to expand these rights  without restriction, but in no case may they restrict civil  liberties, social guarantees, or the possibilities of conducting  entrepreneurial activity.  <H5>  Support for Russian Industry </H5>   The need for financial support for domestic industry is  obvious and nobody questions it. Throughout the entire  transition period, state intervention in the economy and  financial support for it will be unavoidable. The entire  question is how to carry out this intervention and provide this  support.    Today immense state investments are being made in the  economy  in such a way as to reinforce not market but antimarket  tendencies.    Mutual offsetting of debts or preferential credit are  dangerous not only because they could produce a new wave of  inflation. What is even worse is that they generate attitudes of  dependency among commodity producers and orient them not toward  market demand but toward passive anticipation of help from the  state.    Indeed, why should an enterprise director be concerned about  studying the market, reprofiling production, and updating the  assortment if it is possible, as usual, to crank out products  that nobody needs, and when the enterprise, its warehouses  crammed full, ends up actually bankrupt, threaten the government  with mass unemployment and social upheaval and have its debts  written off again and be granted new credit?    As a result, products nobody needs continue to be produced  and the problem of nonpayments is renewed from year to year.    The state must help the enterprises provide for product  sales  and not give them an unconditional opportunity to continue to  produce items that nobody buys. To accomplish this it is  necessary to change the direction for granting state funds:  Credit should be extended not to the producer but to the  consumer so that he can buy the products he really needs.    We must especially look into a form of organization of sales  that is widely used in world practice and is almost unknown in  our country. It involves leasing companies which purchase costly  technical equipment from the producer and lease it to the actual  users.    It is precisely in the creation of these companies in all  branches that operate costly technology and equipment that state  credit should be invested. This way we will help update the  fixed capital of the enterprises of these branches and, the main  thing, we will force the producer actually to take consumer  demand into account. Because the leasing company will place an  order only for equipment that is in demand.    This mechanism will make it possible to reveal the group of  producers whose products nobody needs and actually put in motion  a bankruptcy procedure that has been discussed for a long time  without results.    Of course, such market mechanisms as leasing companies  function effectively if they have participating in them not only  state but also private capital, which is vitally interested in  profit. The creation of such companies with mixed capital has  the added advantage that it makes it possible to draw into the  production sphere Russian entrepreneurs who are not yet strong  enough to decide on large-scale investment without the state as  a partner.    We see another means of shifting state support from the  producer to the consumer in the granting of monetary subsidies  directly to the citizens. The first experiment of this kind was  conducted in connection with the rejection of state subsidies  for the production of bread. It should be utilized more widely.    And if an enterprise cannot sell its items, it is necessary  to speak precisely about social aid for its workers and about  targeted and strictly controlled credit for reprofiling, and not  about endless subsidies for the continuation of unnecessary  production. Such outlays are much more justified than the  expenditure of more and more billions on the production of  products of yesterday.    The essence of all these mechanisms is that the state  supports the consumer and he, with his ruble, votes for the  enterprises that are capable of finding their place in a market  economy. Only when we master this will we be able to launch a  structural rearrangement of production on market principles and  create incentives for satisfying the effective demand.    In addition to this the state must assist in the structural  rearrangement of industry, in increasing its ability to compete  and in its profitability, and in reducing expenditures. One of  the areas where this work can be seen is purposeful utilization  of "natural monopolies" that belong to the state--nationwide  transportation, communications, and energy networks.    The establishment of prices and rates for the services of  these monopolies must be strictly controlled and be subordinated  to tasks of the state economic policy. For many goods today the  lion's share of the production costs, sometimes up to 40  percent, is made up of expenditures on transportation (and, for  example, for newspapers--on communications workers).    For the period of stabilization special financial conditions  must be established for state networks of nationwide  significance that are protectionist with regard to Russian  producers. It is necessary to establish lower rates and to  prevent their arbitrary increase by local leaders of the  corresponding services. Thus significant financial aid will be  rendered to all of Russian industry. At the same time it will be  possible to refrain from individual support of enterprises,  which creates unequal conditions for them, and utilize the  released budget funds for maintaining the technical level and  wages and for the development of federal systems of  transportation and communications and energy engineering.  <H5>  Development of Privatization </H5>   The program for privatization of state enterprises was one  of  the few state programs with detailed development and a  well-arranged mechanism for implementation. The year 1994 will  be one for summing up the results of its first  stage--privatization of state enterprises through the use of  privatization checks issued to the population.    The goals of the privatization program are multifaceted.  Among them are political ones--returning to citizens of Russia  their share of the national wealth; social--the formation of a  large segment of private owners; and economic--the reform of  property relations in Russia. The results of the activity of the  government and the course of privatization show that we are  consistently coming closer to our earmarked goals.    At the same time today we are experiencing an ever greater  need to shift from global transformations to solutions to  current problems of the economic reform. Based on this, we  consider it necessary to coordinate issues of privatization with  structural rearrangement of the economy and modernization and  retooling of Russian industry.    Mass check privatization will be completed on 30 June. After  that there should be an increase in the role of other methods,  which are oriented more not toward social ends but toward high  economic effectiveness of the privatized sector. These include,  above all, investment competitions which demand from the buyers  of enterprises unconditional implementation of a program of  investment in the development and modernization of production.    There are also great prospects for the sale of state  property  in installments--through a system of special privatization  credit. This system should open up access to property for those  Russians who are able to organize production but do not have  sufficient initial capital for this--the corps of directors and  professional managers.  <H5>  Continuation of the Land Reform </H5>   An important step in the development of economic  transformations was the decision to remove unjustified  restrictions from buying and selling plots of land and the  formation of the basics of a civilized real estate market. The  president signed the corresponding edict on regulation of land  relations and work was done in the government to improve  individual areas of the functioning of the land market.    At the same time today we have far from a complete package  of  the necessary normative documents on land law. There is a  critical need for an integrated code of laws on land that  establishes the rights and responsibilities of its owners and  delimits authority in regulating land relations at the level of  the Federation. This is one of the most important issues facing  the country which the new Russian parliament can resolve.  Further liberalization of relations involving ownership of the  land and its legislative formulation are necessary not only for  the development of agriculture but also for the development and  the most rapid stabilization of the economy as a whole.    At the same time liberalization of land relations should not  lead to a loss of state control over the land market, especially  the utilization of land for agricultural purposes. It is  necessary to consider the question of introducing the status of  land under federal jurisdiction for some of the agricultural  land that has strategic significance for all of Russia.  <H5>  Reform of the Banking System </H5>   The development of domestic industry will be successful only  if it is based on a solid banking system. Far from everything is  going well in this sphere in our country.    The Central Bank system has not acquired the flexibility  needed under conditions of a market economy. As before there is  domination by all kinds of continuously changing instructions,  letters, and telegrams sent by the Central Bank. It is becoming  increasingly difficult to figure out this pile of them.    Even worse is that the Central Bank's independence  frequently  ends up to be arbitrariness with respect to the commercial banks  and sometimes also with respect to all the population and  enterprises of the country (as was the case during the summer  money exchange).    The work of the Central Bank requires restructuring and  reform, not shock therapy, but extremely cautious reform that  does not disturb the normal operation of the banking system as a  whole. It is necessary to take advantage of all the best that  has been accumulated in world experience in management of the  monetary-credit sphere and in the work and organization of  central banking systems.    As for the development of the domestic banking system, we  still have to determine the limit beyond which protection of  national economic interests becomes patronage for inefficient  structures that ignore the interests of the clients and are  incapable of providing them service at the level of modern  standards.    Protectionist measures must, in the first place, be  carefully  weighed so as not to go beyond the limits actually dictated by  national economic interests and, in the second place, be  combined with increasingly strict requirements on the quality of  the operation of domestic banks so as not to preserve the  backwardness but gradually to bring them up to the real world's  level.  <H5>  Development of Currency Regulation </H5>   Up until recently questions of currency regulation have been  among the most difficult problems of economic policy. The  condition of the Russian economy is fatally affected by such  phenomena as illegal exportation of capital, the diversion of  immense funds for currency speculation rather than production  use, branch and regional lobbying in connection with the receipt  of currency and other foreign economic privileges. The  development of currency control and the regulation and sharp  reduction of benefits and special conditions make up an  essential task.    Stabilization of the foreign currency exchange rate for the  ruble is another one of the most important tasks. The economy is  not yet ready for a fixed rate. But it is necessary to introduce  into practice the establishment of points of reference for  changing the exchange rate for the near future and provide for  their observance through measures of state policy. This will  create a certain stability for industrialists and investors, and  will help to shift immense funds involved in currency  speculations to production use.    Right now we must begin working to prepare for transferring  Russia's foreign trade to ruble accounts. Such conditions for  accounts for foreign trade operations are typical for developed  countries with market economies. As the country's economic  situation stabilizes, this task will be increasingly crucial. We  must purposefully prepare the economic and political conditions  for this decision.    With the introduction of such a system there will be a sharp  increase in the supply of currency on the Russian market, since  the entire volume of export proceeds of Russian enterprises will  pass through it. Moreover, there will be a steady and  significant demand for rubles on the part of foreign buyers of  Russian goods (including raw materials). This not only means an  important step toward convertibility of the ruble but it also  creates preconditions for the ruble's entry into foreign  currency exchanges.    The very concept of foreign currency accounts of enterprises  will disappear. From the very beginning rubles will be  transferred into the exporter's account, and the importer will  also use rubles to pay foreign sellers through his bank for  goods that are purchased.    Such an accounting procedure is an important element in the  system of currency control. It will place a barrier on the path  to illegal exportation of capital abroad and make an essential  contribution to the stabilization of the ruble as a currency  used in the world market, even if it is on a very limited scale  at first.    The task of stabilizing the ruble exchange rate and  introducing it into international settlements should also be a  reference point for the legislative organ when preparing  documents regulating monetary circulation and the monetary  policy of the Russian federation.  <H3>  Protection of National Economic Interests and the New  Foreign Political Doctrine </H3>   Russia's entry into the world market is objectively  predetermined and it has not only economic but also decisive  domestic political significance.    Even today it has been clearly revealed that a considerable  share of Russian enterprises are trying to export their  products. For many of them (for example, high technological  ones) this is the only possibility of surviving under modern  conditions whereby domestic sales have dropped sharply and the  state has no possibility of providing adequate support.    Thus the opening of foreign markets for Russian goods was  predetermined by an objective process, and it directly involves  the interests of tens of thousands of enterprises and millions  of their workers. All these people are real or potential bearers  of the ideology of Russia's entry into the world market. Such  mass support and interest means that Russian goods will  definitely go on to the world market. The only question is  whether this will be sooner or later, in civilized or savage  forms, and because of the government or in spite of it.    With their votes, their work, and their resources these  people and their enterprises are capable of giving real support  to the government that carries out this task. Conversely,  indecisiveness, delays, and especially disregard for this  problem by the government will actively place them in opposition  and force them to seek other channels, bypassing the current  authorities, for integration into the world economy, and also to  rely on other political forces.    Consequently, success in solving foreign political problems  will make an essential contribution to the development of the  domestic political situation. This is one of the factors that  form the social base of the reforms and the reformers, which  determine the credit of confidence and support we have for  conducting our policy.    The solution to the problem of entry into the world market  hinges mainly on inadequate foreign political support.    The reorientation of foreign policy toward priority  partnership with the leading developed countries, which has  taken place in recent years, has certain shortcomings along with  its obvious merits. There has been a sharp reduction of Russia's  presence in traditional foreign markets (for example, the  countries of Eastern Europe and the Near East), and the  potential for cooperation with developing and new industrial  countries (South Korea, Taiwan) is being inadequately utilized.    At the same time, relations between Russia and the West are  developing asymmetrically at the present time. The developed  countries are not at all inclined to allow Russia into  international markets in response to the development of  political cooperation.    Our partners consistently protect the interests of their  producers from Russian competition, and Western countries are  preserving discriminatory measures against Russian goods and  preventing their penetration into their own markets and even  into the markets of "third countries" (an example is the  memorable story of the delivery of rocket engines to India).    The developed countries are applying antidumping measures  against Russian goods and introducing prohibitive duties on our  products (for example, 104 percent on deliveries of ferrosilicon  from Russia to the United States). The quotas assigned to Russia  in many cases are linked to deliveries from the CIS as a whole,  which aggravates relations within the framework of the  Commonwealth because of the distribution of these quotas. And  the amounts of the quotas are frequently ridiculous. According  to the data of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, say,  for sheet metal the quota of the European communities for  Bulgaria is 53,000 tonnes, for Romania--45,000 tonnes, and for  all of the CIS--49,000 tonnes. Italy allows the shipment from  Russia of nine (!) engines, 29 motorcycles, etc.    These political restrictions cannot be removed by purely  economic methods. It is necessary to have a consistent and firm  policy of protection of national economic interests that is  enforced in all foreign political activity. This pertains both  to cooperation with Western states and to the restoration of  mutually advantageous trade and economic ties with the former  socialist countries and to political support for Russia's entry  into the markets of developing and new industrial countries with  competitive and highly technological goods, machines and  equipment, and raw and processed materials.    Thus political support must play a decisive role in the  restoration of Russian exports and their distribution in new  foreign markets. This problem is not being resolved effectively  enough today. It is necessary to adopt and consistently  implement a new foreign political doctrine that protects  Russia's national interests. It is important to find a form in  which foreign policy would reflect in a balanced way both the  political and the economic interests of our country.</p>

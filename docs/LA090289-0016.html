			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MCMAHON RESCUES CHARGERS AT LAST;  </P> <P> BUT TOLLIVER MAY HAVE BROKEN BONE, ANDERSON TALKS IN TROUBLE  </P> <P> Two months ago, the Chargers were a team in search of quarterbacks. For most of  Friday night at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, they were two quarterbacks in  search of a team.  </P> <P> In the end, they found themselves. Charger starter Jim McMahon completed nine  of 17 passes for 144 yards and two touchdowns, including a dramatic four-yard  scoring flip to Quinn Early with no time remaining to give the Chargers a  21-20, come-from-behind victory over the Phoenix Cardinals.  </P> <P> It was McMahon's only play of the second half. He had entered the game only  because rookie Billy Joe Tolliver (13 of 23, 165 yards) injured his left  collarbone scrambling on the previous play. Charger Coach Dan Henning said he  expected X-rays to show that the collarbone is broken. If so, Tolliver will  miss at least six weeks.  </P> <P> The rest of the downside was the normally reliable Charger defense. It defended  the run poorly early on. The Chargers' special teams were mostly horrible all  night. Nevertheless, the Chargers wound up their exhibition season with two  victories in their last three games, a near miss against the defending world  champion 49ers and a landslide of momentum. Phoenix finished 1-3.  </P> <P> The Chargers had begun their comeback when rookie Marion Butts ripped one yard  for a touchdown with 4:23 remaining to cut the lead to six points.  </P> <P> "It was hectic," Henning understated.  </P> <P> Said McMahon: "I react a lot better when I don't have time to think."  </P> <P> McMahon's debut in his new home temporarily shifted the attention away from  rapidly worsening relations between the Chargers and running back Gary  Anderson.  </P> <P> Anderson, 28, led the Chargers in rushing last year and is seeking a contract  estimated in the $1 million-per-year range. The Chargers are offering  considerably less.  </P> <P> Early Friday, a source close to Anderson said Anderson, his wife and his agent  -- Peter Johnson -- were considering "options that had nothing to do with the  Chargers."  </P> <P> Pressed, the source said Johnson and Anderson may inform the Chargers as early  as this weekend that Anderson is prepared to sit out the year if the Chargers  don't trade him to another team in time for the 1989 season.  </P> <P> Pending litigation filed by the NFL Players Assn. against the league has  encouraged Johnson and Anderson to the point that they believe if Anderson sits  out the year, he will become an unrestricted free agent -- one who could sign  with another team for 1990 without that team having to compensate the Chargers.  </P> <P> Johnson works for the International Management Group in Cleveland. IMG  represents athletes in a variety of sports. But the man who oversees all their  football contract negotiations is Ralph Cindrich of Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Cindrich hasn't directly involved himself in the Anderson talks. But he hasn't  liked what he has seen or heard. Contacted by phone Friday, he offered no  encouragement about the Chargers chances of signing Anderson.  </P> <P> "I'm not the best of friends with Steve Ortmayer," Cindrich said of the  Chargers' director of football operations. "I always thought I had a better  rapport with him until this year. To me he (Ortmayer) has been derelict in his  duties. He commits one boner after another."  </P> <P> Ortmayer is already on record as saying Anderson will either play for the  Chargers this year or "not play at all."  </P> <P> Cindrich ticked off a long list of Anderson's statistical accomplishments,  including the 1,119 yards Anderson rushed for last season, third highest in the  AFC. Cindrich also said Anderson should have a higher public profile around the  league.  </P> <P> "Gary Anderson really isn't a big name in the NFL," Cindrich said. "He has to  get the hell out of there (San Diego)."  </P> <P> Cindrich also said IMG recently received a letter from Anderson and his wife,  Ollie, directing IMG to "exercise patience and expertise" in the negotiations."  </P> <P> The Cardinals scored Friday night's first points by exercising patience of  their own in a 12-play, 62-yard drive that ended on a two-yard, play-action  touchdown pass from Gary Hogeboom to tight end Walter Reeves. Reeves beat  strong safety Martin Bayless and inside linebacker Gary Plummer on the  third-and-goal play.  </P> <P> The drive started on the Cardinal 38 after a 32-yard punt by Lewis Colbert  dribbled out of bounds. Lusty boos greeted Colbert's effort; earlier this week,  the Chargers traded former Pro Bowl punter Ralf Mojsiejenko to the Redskins. A  15-yard face mask penalty against Charger defensive back Lester Lyles kept the  Phoenix drive alive on third and 11.  </P> <P> McMahon wasted no time bringing the Chargers right back up the field. On the  very next possession, he found wide receiver Anthony Miller on a post pattern  at the Phoenix 30. Miller bounced off Cardinal defenders Cedric Mack and Lonnie  Young, regained his balance and raced into the end zone to complete a 49-yard  scoring play.  </P> <P> It was McMahon's first touchdown pass as a Charger and wouldn't have been  possible if rookie Butts hadn't gained two yards two plays earlier on a  fourth-and-one from the Charger 44.  </P> <P> Phoenix took a 14-7 lead into the locker room at halftime when Earl Ferrell cut  back against the grain for a five-yard touchdown run with 2:39 left in the  second period.  </P> <P> The score should have been 14-10 after Lyles intercepted a Hogeboom throw and a  28-yard McMahon-Miller pass gave the Chargers a first down at the Cardinal  seven.  </P> <P> But on the last play of the half Chris Bahr's 25-yard field goal attempt hit  the left upright and bounced away. Later in the game, Bahr missed a 43-yarder,  also wide left.  </P> <P> Earlier in the week the Chargers cut kicker Steve DeLine, who has a more  powerful kicking leg. Their explanation: Bahr is more accurate.  </P> <P> The Phoenix advantage grew to 10 points early in the third quarter on Al Del  Greco's 29-yard field goal. Del Greco added a 31-yarder in the fourth period  after the Cardinals blocked a Colbert punt.  </P> <P> Defensive end Burt Grossman, the Chargers' No. 1 draft pick, got credit for  half a sack in the second period. It was Grossman's first game since signing  eight days ago.  </P> <P> Charger linebacker Jim Collins, a starter, pulled his left hamstring in the  first half and didn't return. Offensive lineman Dennis McKnight tore a  quadriceps muscle and may be out for two months.  </P> <P> *BROWNER SUSPENDED  </P> <P> The NFL suspends linebacker Keith Browner for a substance abuse violation.

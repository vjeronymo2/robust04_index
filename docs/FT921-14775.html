			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Leyland DAF sees truck sales 'turning corner' LEYLAND DAF, which has deposed Iveco Ford as the UK truck market leader, says it believes commercial-vehicle sales may be 'turning the corner' after the worst year for truck sales in the UK since 1954. Only 32,154 trucks 'proper' - those weighing more than 3.5 tonnes  - found buyers last year. This is 33.7 per cent less than in 1990 and less than half the level of 1989, when 69,234 were sold. However, according to Mr David Gill, Leyland DAF's truck marketing and sales director, 'all the evidence suggests there will be recovery this year'. Leyland DAF's forecast - echoed by some other manufacturers  - is for a recovery to between 38,000 and 42,000 sales this year. The severity of the slide in the truck industry was reflected in short-time working, job cuts and a widespread plunge into losses. The difficulties were exacerbated by the steepness of the fall in sales. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show the fall in sales to have been the sharpest since the Second World War. Total sales of commercial vehicles, including vans and coaches and buses, were 209,021, down 28.78 per cent on 1990's 293,473. That represents a 43.68 per cent drop on sales in 1989. Statistics for sales last month showed a slight improvement, with a drop of only 12.37 per cent in sales of all commercial vehicles, to 11,288, compared with the previous year's level. The figures showed that the share of the total market taken by imports last year fell to 35.51 per cent from 37.62 per cent in 1990. The sharpest fall in imports was in the sector for small vans, mainly those derived from cars. This is one of the biggest market sectors. The share of importers - led by French carmakers the Peugeot group and Renault - fell by 45 per cent, compared with a market decrease of 31.87 per cent. By far the biggest beneficiary was Ford, whose sales in the sector fell by only 15.14 per cent as new products such as its Fiesta-based Courier van arrived on the market. Ford, whose Transit van range has allowed it to dominate the market for medium-sized vans for many years, lost ground in the sector to Leyland DAF. That followed the decision to switch production to a new version of the Transit in the autumn. However, Ford expects the move to increase market share this year. Even so, it still outsold second-placed Leyland DAF vans by more than three to one. Imports in that sector fell to 40.8 per cent from 44.02 in 1990. The biggest casualty was Nissan, the Japanese manufacturer, whose sales fell by 42.04 per cent. That was partly the result of a long-running row between Nissan and Nissan UK, Mr Octav Botnar's import and distribution organisation. The dispute turned into open warfare and the eventual termination of Nissan UK's franchise. Production changeovers, as Iveco Ford prepared for the launch of its new Eurocargo truck range, were also seen as a possible factor in Leyland DAF's assumption of the truck market leadership after several years of intensely close competition between the two rivals. The worst affected sector of all was that for heavy trucks - those weighing more than 15 tonnes - where sales fell by 34.82 per cent. The sector suffered as replacement demand failed to materialise in the construction and other key truck-using industries. According to Leyland DAF's Mr Gill, however, an increasing number of operators this year will be unable to defer for any longer the replacement of their ageing fleets. Mr Gill said companies would be forced to make 'distress purchases' of vehicles 'which have finally turned their wheels in the air'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Jan-Dec 1991                   Volume   Volume      Share (%)   Share (%)                  (Units)  Change (%)   Jan-Dec 91  Jan-Dec 90 Total Market*    209,021   -28.78       100.00      100.00 Imports           74,222   -32.78        35.51       37.62  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total             63,398   -31.87       100.00      100.00 Imports           11,644   -45.00        17.80       22.06 Ford              28,945   -15.14        44.26       35.54 Vauxhall          18,116   -33.69        27.70       28.46 Rover Group        7,499   -51.33        11.47       16.12 Peugeot (incl.     3,438   -45.83         5.26        6.61 Citroen) Renault            2,514   -39.00         3.84        4.29  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Medium Vans (1.81 -  3.5 tonnes) Total             92,150   -27.45       100.00      100.00 Imports           37,597   -32.75        40.80       44.02 Ford              41,206   -29.87        44.72       46.26 Leyland DAF       13,033   -16.21        14.14       12.25 Mercedes-Benz      5,219   -26.18         5.66        5.57 Renault            5,070   -36.23         5.50        6.26 Peugeot (incl.     5,001   -26.80         5.66        5.57 Citroen &amp; Talbot) Vauxhall           4,287   -35.83         4.65        5.26 Nissan             3,603   -42.04         3.91        4.89  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Trucks (over 3.5 tonnes) Total             32,184   -33.70       100.00      100.00 Imports           13,002   -33.14        40.40       40.06 DAF (Leyland DAF)  7,686   -30.73        23.88       22.86 Iveco Ford         7,555   -39.86        23.47       25.88 Mercedes-Benz      5,219   -32.64        16.37       16.12 Volvo              3,339   -28.52        10.37        9.62 Renault (RTI)      1,711   -41.54         5.32        6.03  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Of which Heavy Trucks (over 15 tonnes) Total             16,118   -34.82       100.00      100.00 DAF (Leyland DAF)  3,671   -34.97        22.78       22.83 Volvo              2,927   -26.99        18.16       16.21 Iveco Ford         2,079   -48.65        12.90       16.37 Mercedes-Benz      1,983   -35.09        12.30       12.35 Scania             1,743   -19.31        10.81        8.74 ERF                1,594   -33.83         9.89        9.74  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *includes buses and light four wheel drive utility vehicles Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and industry estimates.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

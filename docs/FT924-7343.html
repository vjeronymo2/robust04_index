			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Brit Steel Pounds 51m loss as recession deepens - Andrew Baxter considers the figures for the first half THE DEEPENING recession in the world steel market pushed British Steel into a Pounds 51m pre-tax loss for the six months to October 3, and forced the privatised group to pass its interim dividend. The deficit was at the lower end of analysts' expectations, and compared with a Pounds 19m profit last time. The decision not to pay an interim (3p) was taken reluctantly, the company explained, and reflected further recent deterioration in trading conditions and the weak outlook both for demand and prices. As for the final, the company will reconsider the position in June and recommend the 'appropriate' level. In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, this will be no less than 1p (1.5p.) The company warned, that justifying a final significantly higher than 1p will require an improvement in trading prospects, which in turn will depend on prices. The total dividend in 1991-92 was 4.5p. First-half turnover fell from Pounds 2.28bn to Pounds 2.21bn, while the trading loss was Pounds 49m (profit of Pounds 30m). The pre-tax loss was struck after a Pounds 2m exceptional debit comprising redundancy and other rationalisation costs. A Pounds 108m net cash flow outflow, however, on the exceptional items contributed significantly to a Pounds 185m increase in net borrowings to Pounds 196m, compared with Pounds 11m at the end of last year. The net loss was Pounds 48m (Pounds 13m profit), and losses per share were 2.4p. This compared with earnings of 0.65p last time and losses of 1.7p for the full year. Cost reduction and plant rationalisation measures continued during the first half. Employment in the UK fell by a further 3,000 to 41,800 people, due mainly to the closure in June of the Ravenscraig works in Scotland. Overseas employment stayed constant at 4,700. A geographical breakdown of the results showed that the decline in the UK market was the principle reason for the fall in turnover. Domestic sales dropped from Pounds 1.29bn to Pounds 1.14bn. In contrast, turnover in the European Community, excluding the UK, rose from Pounds 595m to Pounds 656m, while US turnover jumped from Pounds 90m to Pounds 105m. Turnover in Asia slipped from Pounds 132m to Pounds 121m. In volume terms, the company sold 5.8m tonnes of products in the first half, up from 5.7m tonnes a year earlier. For all of 1991-92, sales volume was 12.2m tonnes. The company said late last month that it would cut its 'liquid steel make' by up to 20 per cent or 600,000 tonnes in the current quarter, compared with the same quarter last year, to bring production in line with demand.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND AT AFI FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> SUNDAY  </P> <P> Following are The Times' recommendations for today's and Sunday's schedule of  the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival, with  commentary by the film reviewing staff.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 520-2000.  </P> <P> Highly recommended:  </P> <P> "TWISTER"(U.S., 1989; Director: Michael Almereyda; Century Plaza, 4:15 p.m.). A  strange and altogether fascinating comedy from writer-director Almereyda, his  directorial debut. It's about a screw-loose Kansas family, and the cast is  assembled like prize specimens in a zoo. Crispin Glover's performance is one of  the great wacko characterizations in film. (P.R.)  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / People: NatWest If the first big announcement from Derek Wanless (above) as group chief executive of National Westminster Bank is anything to go by the new regime at the top of Britain's second biggest clearing bank may turn out to be less exciting than expected. Tom Frost, Wanless's predecessor, had already announced that Bert Morris, 57, would be replacing Roger Flemington as deputy group chief executive. Wanless has now confirmed Morris's appointment - the only difference is that he takes over immediately rather than at the end of May. In the past NatWest has often operated with two deputy chief executives but it is understood that Morris will be the sole deputy. However, Wanless seems to be biding his time before reshuffling his team in a more substantial way. He himself will retain responsibility for NatWest Markets, which combines the group's corporate, investment banking and trading operations. Meanwhile, Morris, who began his banking career in St Helen's in 1956, retains responsibility for the group's support services. ***** David Gibbs is appointed a director of HAMBROS CURRENCY FUND. ***** Bill Dootson, Peter Botham and John Hobson have been appointed directors of HENRY COOKE LUMSDEN. ***** Helen White, formerly director of business development of GrandMet Foods Europe, is appointed a director of SWISS BANK CORPORATION's corporate finance division. ***** Christopher Kemball, previously head of Dillon, Read's European operations, has joined BARING BROTHERS as a director. ***** Ian Chimes and Craig Walton have been appointed deputy md and marketing director respectively of HENDERSON UNIT TRUST MANAGEMENT. ***** Catherine Johnson has been appointed head of European equity syndicate of JP MORGAN SECURITIES in London. ***** John Breame, Ian Hannam and Andrew Robertson have been appointed directors of ROBERT FLEMING &amp; CO. ***** Peter Spencer has been appointed chief economist of KLEINWORT BENSON; he moves from LEHMAN BROTHERS INTERNATIONAL. ***** Kazuo Asao has been appointed md of YASUDA TRUST EUROPE; he succeeds Yoshio Mikoshiba who is returning to Tokyo. ***** Sir Ian Denholme is retiring as chairman of MURRAY JOHNSTONE HOLDINGS but remains as deputy chairman; he continues as chairman of the Murray Johnstone Investment Trusts. Nicolas McAndrew (below left), md of Murray Johnstone, also succeeds Raymond Johnstone as chairman. ***** Ron Noakes (below right) has been promoted to head of finance and marketing at the AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE CORPORATION.</p>

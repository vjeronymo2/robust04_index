			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;L WATCH;  </P> <P> TOURIST ATTRACTION  </P> <P> While he's in Orange County for the Nixon library opening, President Bush  should look at a tourist attraction of the future. It's the $1.9-million gated  estate in Newport Beach, with two Mercedes out front, where an S&amp;L figure  who claimed he was broke now lives.  </P> <P> Denver developer Bill L. Walters had been a business partner of the President's  son, Neil, before defaulting on a $96-million real estate loan made by the  failed Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. Neil Bush is in hot water  over his role as a Silverado director, for allegedly violating  conflict-of-interest regulations by voting to approve the loans to Walters.  </P> <P> Walters last month testified before the House Banking Committee that he had "a  negative net worth." He may be broke, but a trust in his wife's name bought the  estate in February.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L crisis is a complex mosaic of poor government and business  decisions, economic downturns -- and greed. The paper chase is tedious, but the  public might be spared a bundle with more vigorous investigations now.  </P> <P> With reasonable cause and due process, the government could initiate attachment  proceedings on suspect properties. If an S&amp;L kingpin's wife proved  independently wealthy, fine -- one less case to resolve. But lost time affords  the real crooks more opportunities to hide assets.  </P> <P> Presidents know all about symbols. This estate powerfully suggests the public's  exasperation. Bush should see where a penniless man lives. It costs $800 to cut  the lawn.  </P></p>

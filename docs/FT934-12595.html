			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Falling pound Sir, Geoffrey Howe ('The triumph and tragedy of the Thatcher years', 23/24 October) includes as one of Margaret Thatcher's triumphs 'the remarkable success we achieved against inflation'. As one who chanced to start to draw a non-inflation-proofed pension in 1979, I have often wondered if the pound has ever lost more of its value under any other prime minister.

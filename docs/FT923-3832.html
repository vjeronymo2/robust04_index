			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / People: Cottam takes over at HML The conservative new chairman of Haden MacLellan Holdings could hardly present a greater contrast to Philip Ling, his 46-year-old entrepreneurial predecessor with a penchant for heli-skiing and drag hunting. Former Ernst &amp; Young UK managing partner Harold Cottam, 53, has arrived to 'bring some stability and create a better image in the City', according to Mel Hawley, HMH chief executive. Ling, the consummate 1980s wheeler-dealer, had at the beginning of this year agreed with the board to distance himself from the company he took public just weeks before the 1987 stock market crash, becoming non-executive chairman this April. At that time, it was already envisaged he would resign when the company found a suitable successor, Hawley explains. Among a growing number of non-executive activities, Ling is chairman of the venture capital arm of Invesco MIM. Cottam, who sat in on Tuesday's board meeting to approve the half year figures announced yesterday, explains that the mood of the company has changed - it is focusing more on core activities, and has only made three acquisitions in the past two and a half years. As if to emphasise the break with the past, Cottam has not even met Ling, who did not attend the meeting. Hawley says that Cottam's industrial experience is 'somewhat limited' but his experience of managing the merger between Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young counted for a lot, as did his good City contacts. 'He is a very conservative guy with a very wise head.' Ironically, some of his industrial experience comes from a job with Simon Engineering Consortium Group in Spain in the late 1960s - long before, however, Ling made his disastrous management buy-in bid for Simon Engineering. Although non-executive, Cottam thinks he will be spending 'quite a lot of time restoring confidence and going to see a lot of people'. ***** Niall FitzGerald, the 46-year-old chief of Unilever's detergents' business, has been appointed a non-executive director of the Prudential Corporation, Britain's biggest institutional investor. FitzGerald's appointment comes less than a month after Andrew Teare, English China Clays' chief executive, was appointed to the board and is another sign that the Prudential is intent on bringing in a new generation of younger non-executives as the older ones retire. When FitzGerald takes up his directorship on January 1, the Prudential will have six executive and 10 non-executive directors. Irish-born FitzGerald is one of a group of younger Unilever directors who are regarded as possible candidates for the Unilever chairmanship. He joined the main board in May 1987 and is currently in charge of a radical restructuring of Unilever's detergents. Industry analysts believe that if he makes a success of his latest challenge he will be a contender for the chairmanship of Unilever at some stage. In some respects FitzGerald is not a typical Unilever man. He is more flamboyant and outspoken than many of his colleagues and whereas most of them devote their life to Unilever, he has started to collect outside directorships. As well as the Pru, he also sits on the board of the Bank of Ireland.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> A baseball card that could be worth $100,000 was grabbed from the hands of a  14-year-old Northern California boy who was counting on the rare card to  finance his college education.  </P> <P> Authorities in Contra Costa County said that the 1910 Honus Wagner card, one in  a series that had been distributed in packages of cigarettes, was grabbed from  the youngster by another teen-age boy in West Pittsburg when the victim agreed  to display the card for a photo.  </P> <P> The victim, who was not identified, had acquired the card from his grandfather.  The card was valuable because Wagner had objected to being associated with  cigarettes and had bought and destroyed all but about 90 of the cards.  </P></p>

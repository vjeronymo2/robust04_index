			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> "Peaceable Kingdom" is the best new show on TV this fall. The stories are  heartwarming, fresh, entertaining and devoid of the violence that continually  bombards the tube. The show also displays a positive image of our Los Angeles  Zoo to the rest of the country.  </P> <P> Susan Hancock, North Hollywood  </P></p>

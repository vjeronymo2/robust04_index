			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS AND ETHICS  </P> <P> Neither the media nor the Republican Party are responsible for "Donkeygate."  Rather Wright and Coelho and all of the other Democrats who have shed crocodile  tears over the so-called sleaze of the past few years, while wearing their  mantle of pristine virtue and their holier-than-thou coronet, are solely  responsible.  </P> <P> The media should be proud, as should all citizens, that the First Amendment is  not only intact but works. Keep it up and continue the bipartisan  investigations.  </P> <P> STUART von RATHJEN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

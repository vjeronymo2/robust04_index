			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / ICI grapples with electricity price riddle: How setting the level is more complicated than solving the Rubik cube AT 4 O'CLOCK every afternoon, senior managers at ICI's Runcorn complex start a computer game that takes them well into the evening and produces a forecast for the next day's electricity price. Only when it is over can they determine whether ICI can afford to make chlorine in the next 24 hours. The data is no more accurate than a weather forecast. This unpredictability over the price of the vast quantity of power the complex uses - 1 per cent of all the UK's electricity consumption - has caused ICI to consider quitting its UK chlorine business, putting 7,000 jobs at risk. ICI's protests are echoed by other large-scale electricity users in the steel, glass and cement industries, as well as other chemicals companies. Chlorine is basic to the solvents and plastics sector of the chemicals industry. The chlor-chemicals industry is already under pressure for environmental reasons. Chlorine is dangerous and the regulations for making and using it are tight and getting tighter. ICI has reduced discharges of liquid chlorinated hydrocarbons into the Weston Canal at Runcorn by 80 per cent in the past five years but must reduce them from the present 45 tonnes a year to under 18 tonnes by the mid-1990s. It is allowed to emit 10,000 tonnes of gases into the atmosphere - 20 per cent down on 1987 levels - but these must be reduced to just 700 tonnes in the same period. ICI says it can afford the Pounds 50m needed to meet these targets only if profitability is restored to levels before electricity privatisation. The price ICI pays for electricity may vary unpredictably every half hour - it pays the price bid by the last electricity generating station needed to meet demand for that half-hour slot in the day. If the weather becomes colder and demand for electricity rises, the price may shoot up beyond expectations. Since ICI never knows what it has to pay until after it has consumed the power, it is crucial for managers to second-guess the forecast as closely as possible so they can shut down plant before getting caught out. To complicate forecasting, Britain's 50 power stations can, the next day, put in one of three bid prices for each set of generating equipment. Each station may have as many as four sets, making 12 potential prices from each of them every half hour. A surcharge may also apply: some stations may have to run because distribution problems at any particular moment might mean inadequate local supplies if they did not. Mr Ken Green, commercial manager of ICI's energy policy and purchasing department, says this is the electricity generators' 'open chequebook' on prices. Mr Green, a chartered electrical engineer, is in charge of trying to master Britain's electricity pricing system for ICI, but says the mathematics have so far proved beyond computer-assisted brainpower. 'We are constantly trying to second-guess the workings of a very complicated algorithm,' he says. 'The Rubik Cube was an algorithm. I worked out the rules and could eventually do it in about three minutes. 'I wish I could do the same with the formula for pricing electricity. We have computer programs to help us and still we can't develop any proper logicality.' Mr Bryan Bulloch, power services manager at Runcorn, who has prepared the company's evidence on the issue to two Commons committees, values the chlor-chemicals sector's home and export markets at Pounds 750m a year each. If ICI abandoned chlorine production to foreign competition, the overall impact on the UK balance of trade would be Pounds 1.5bn. Before electricity was privatised, ICI paid about Pounds 20 per megawatt-hour (MWh). Average costs this year will average more than Pounds 31 per MWh. About Pounds 30m of exports have been turned away because ICI cannot afford to run plant long enough to meet demand and profits are Pounds 20m down in spite of rigorous cost-cutting. Under German competition law, ICI cannot divulge how much it pays for electricity for its similar, but smaller scale operations in Wilhelmshaven, northern Germany, but a figure of Pounds 25 per MWH was inadvertently confirmed as approximately right by Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI Chemicals and Polymer, earlier this month. To achieve that, ICI has to guarantee running the plant at 95 per cent capacity to keep its contribution to overall energy demand predictable. It will come off-load in cold weather to help electricity generators cope with surges. Mr Green says similar bargains cannot be struck in Britain. 'We should be able to bring to the negotiating table virtues such as load factor, load-shedding capability, size, long-term commitment and a willingness to take or pay whether we use all the electricity or not. 'But there is no negotiating table. The generators tell us the price and we have to take it or leave it.' The consequences of imposed, variable prices are an engineering nightmare for Mr Bulloch and his colleagues. Mr Bulloch says the government believes that 90 per cent of industrial electricity users are paying less than before privatisation, while big users such as ICI are merely whining. He says any company using less than 10 MW has gained, but the volume discounts for big users - Runcorn's demand is about 250 MW - have disappeared in favour of everyone having to pay the same price at any given time of day. The big users are all in strategic industries. ICI believes discounts should be available for large users once they pass a negotiable threshold, calculated so that even the most heavily discounted price would never be subsidised. Negotiation would match the lowest discounted price to the lowest profitable marginal price available locally, so as not to cause distribution problems. ICI Runcorn is less than five miles from Fiddler's Ferry, a 2,000 MW old-established plant producing cheap electricity from competitively-priced coal. At present, the marginal price of electricity to individual industrial users goes up as national demand rises. ICI's argument is that any large individual user should be encouraged to use more by paying less per unit for increasing volumes once a reasonable threshold has been cleared. This, Mr Bulloch says, is the commercial reality of any normal marketplace. But British bulk electricity markets are not normal. Mr Green says they are not even markets. There is no mutuality of self-interest between suppliers and large consumers, so no incentive to the suppliers - generators and distributors - to give ground as they operate what ICI says is, in effect, a monopoly.</p>

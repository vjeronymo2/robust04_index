			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 3 (AFP)--The son of a former Chinese  provincial police chief was executed for drug trafficking, after  a superior court overturned a more lenient sentence that had  provoked a public outcry, a report said Sunday [3 April]. Quan  Xiaoyong, a member of the railway police force and son of the  former chief of police in the northern province of Gansu, was  sentenced to death and executed after a suspended death sentence  handed down two years ago by an intermediate court was  overturned.    Quan was a leading member of a 17-strong drug trafficking  ring brought to trial in 1992 in the provincial capital of  Lanzhou, the China Prosecution Daily said. While four leaders  of the gang were sentenced to death and executed, Quan received  a suspended death sentence, sparking public accusations of  favouritism because of his family and professional connections,  the newspaper said.    The provincial authorities ordered an investigation into the  case, which took 18 months and resulted in the recent decision  by the province's Superior People's Court to overturn the  original judgement and sentence Quan to death. The same court  also overturned a not-guilty verdict handed down to Li Jian, the  son of a senior Gansu party official, who had been accused of  acting as an accomplice to the gang's activities. The superior  court sentenced Li to six months imprisonment.</p>

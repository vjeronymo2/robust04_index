			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Sarajevo guns set to find new targets: A look at the likely moves to consolidate territory won in other parts of Bosnia Officials from the United Nations, the European Union, the Russian Federation and the US meet in Bonn today to discuss what gains made in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo can be extended to the rest of the republic. But military analysts are pessimistic that diplomats will be able to capitalise on the ceasefire in Sarajevo, let alone react in time to stem the flow of more artillery to eastern Bosnia, halt the fighting between Moslem and Croats in central Bosnia, or lift the siege imposed by Croats on the city of Mostar in the west of the republic. While attention remains focused on Sarajevo, military analysts believe the Serbs in eastern Bosnia, and the Croats in western Bosnia, will speed up their attempts to consolidate their grip over territory they have won in battle. The Bosnian government forces, now backed by a well-trained infantry, will also focus their attention beyond Sarajevo. 'Sarajevo is important for the Bosnian Serbs, but it is not as important as what they want to achieve strategically in the eastern part of the country,' said Mr Charles Dick, head of the UK-based Conflict Studies Research Centre at Sandhurst. Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, has always aimed at linking eastern Bosnia to Serbia proper. The Bosnian Croats have a corresponding goal in western Hercegovina. They may still be able to realise those aims. For instance, Mr Dick and other analysts believe that Bosnian Serb forces, without too many restrictions, can transfer any weapons moved out of the 12-mile zone around Sarajevo to other parts of the country. 'There is nothing to stop them,' a Nato diplomat said. 'The point is that Nato cannot keep declaring a new ultimatum to lift the sieges of Gorazde, Zepa, or Maglaj because it might be seen as bluffing if Serb - and Croat forces - do the minimum to meet any deadline' and the threat is not followed through. Already Bosnian Serb forces are attempting to link up the Serb-held territory of Krajina, in south-western Croatia, with Serbia-proper. This involves cutting a deal with Mr Fikret Abdic, a former Bosnian government minister who broke away from the Bosnian side, and took over the control of Bihac, a Moslem enclave in the north-western corner of Bosnia. It would also involve negotiating a passage through, or around Brcko, on the Croat border. 'If you want to prevent any more killing, and more territorial gains, you have to provide thousands of peace-keepers,' a Nato diplomat said. 'But the omens are not good. General (Sir Michael) Rose (the UN commander in Bosnia) has not even managed to obtain 3,000 extra troops which he requested last week. So what kind of message is that sending out to all three sides?' In the case of Croatia, he added, the government in Zagreb had given no indication it would withdraw its troops from western Hercegovina. 'We applied some kind of pressure. But it has had little affect,' a US military expert said. 'I sometimes wonder do our threats carry clout or not? If not, then there is no reason for the Bosnian government to stop fighting, because, unlike the Croats and Serbs, they have nothing to lose.' That is why any UN follow-up plan to the ceasefire in Sarajevo will be watched closely by all three sides. 'If the roads leading into and out of the city are not placed under UN control, and if the siege is not completely lifted very quickly, we will have squandered what political will we mustered last week,' the Nato diplomat said.</p>

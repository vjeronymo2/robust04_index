			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The Property Market: Revenue from loans, bonds and rights issues down in 1992 A TOTAL of Pounds 2.95bn was raised in property-related loans, bonds and rights issues in 1992, down from Pounds 3.98bn in the previous year, according to Savills, property advisers. Just Pounds 660m of the total was 'new' financing, Pounds 2.16bn was for refinancings and Pounds 130m for housing associations. The most significant component was the Pounds 1.25bn loan that refinanced Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, the developer of the Broadgate office project in the City of London, last November. The amount of debt owed by the property and construction sectors fell by 1 per cent in the last quarter of 1992 to Pounds 53.6bn. The sector's total debt has fallen by Pounds 4.3bn since May 1991. The main reason for the drop in loans was UK retail banks' and US banks' reduced exposure to the sector, which has fallen by about Pounds 450m per quarter - a total of Pounds 2.7bn since May 1991. About 30 banks are now providing finance to the market, of which a quarter are new to the market, says Savills. With few exceptions, they are only prepared to lend to well-let properties with long, unexpired leases and large borrowers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Changes in property values (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Retail       Office     Industrial      All                      Year   Mth   Year   Mth   Year   Mth   Year   Mth                       to     of    to     of    to     of    to     of                       Dec   Dec    Dec   Dec    Dec   Dec    Dec   Dec                        92    92     92    92     92    92     92    92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rental growth        -3.0  -0.5  -16.8  -2.4   -9.5  -1.0   -9.6  -1.2 Capital growth       -2.8  -0.3  -14.2  -1.3   -8.6  -0.9   -8.2  -0.8 Total return          4.8   0.3   -6.1  -0.5    0.7   0.0   -0.1   0.0 Current yield levels  9.0         10.4         11.4         10.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IPD monthly index, Investment Property Databank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOROLA, TOSHIBA FORM JOINT HDTV CHIP VENTURE  </P> <P> Motorola Inc. and Toshiba Corp. have agreed to work together in developing  semiconductor chips for Japan's high-definition television system, a  development that could help Motorola gain an edge over its U.S. competitors in  a market that's expected to be extremely lucrative over the long term.  </P> <P> The venture is also the first in which American and Japanese chip firms have  joined forces to pursue HDTV, a group of technologies that will drastically  improve television picture quality.  </P> <P> HDTV has been the subject of a protracted worldwide battle over technical  standards, and Motorola and Toshiba will be working on chips for the HDTV  system developed by the Japan Broadcasting Corp. That system is now undergoing  a trial in Japan, but the United States will not make a decision on technical  standards for HDTV until 1992.  </P> <P> Though it is certain that the United States will not adopt the Japanese system,  Motorola will still gain expertise from its work with Toshiba -- work that  could prove useful in making parts for American HDTV.  </P> <P> "What they learn will give them a leg up," said Dean McCarron, an analyst with  In-Stat, a Phoenix-based market research firm. "They're not letting an  opportunity slip past."  </P> <P> Motorola and Toshiba will develop components to translate the HDTV broadcast  signal -- which is transmitted in a coded format to accommodate the vast amount  of information needed for HDTV -- into a usable picture.  </P> <P> Motorola already has a joint venture with Toshiba for the development and  production of memory chips. Motorola has long had a far more significant  presence in Japan than other U.S. chip companies, and the company reportedly  plans to build a new, $600-million factory in northern Japan, scheduled for  completion for 1993.  </P></p>

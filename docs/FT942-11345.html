			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Politicians take over where the ballot failed  - Patti Waldmeir on vote swapping in northern Natal Black South Africans, especially in the troubled province of Natal/ KwaZulu, can be forgiven for wondering what elections are all about. Last week they queued for hours to cast their votes in the country's first democratic elections. This week, their political leaders have been trading votes like football cards, openly fixing the result of the poll to try to keep the peace. In Empangeni, centre of the much-disputed voting area of northern Natal, Mr Senzo Mchunu, African National Congress regional secretary, makes no effort to hide what is going on. 'To us, the priority is peace,' says the man who heads the ANC in this stronghold of the rival Inkatha Freedom party. 'Obviously, the elections were not free and fair. There has been rigging, extensive rigging,' he says. (The IFP won 73 per cent of the provincial vote in this area, against 16 per cent for the ANC.) 'But we think it's a very narrow line of thinking to say, just reject the results. That would not resolve anything.' 'Based on the reality in Natal, the ANC should have emerged as the winning party, and whatever deal is made should reflect that. But you must remember these people (IFP) have been told they are winning so any deal you make must make it less shocking to them.' Mr Mchunu hints he would approve a deal which shared voting totals equally between the two parties, whatever the official electoral tally shows. Each would gain some 40 to 45 per cent of the vote with the outgoing National party holding the provincial balance of power. Under South Africa's constitution, they would be forced to share power in the provincial executive in any case, with seats allocated proportionately. 'But there can only be one premier,' and it cannot be the IFP's candidate, Dr Frank Mdlalose, he maintains. Mr Mchunu believes the ANC has found a way to bridge these two positions and is preparing to announce what it is. The Independent Electoral Commission, charged with conducting the poll and certifying its outcome, appears to be holding back the results of the Empangeni count to give the politicians time to do their work. Mr Mchunu has his own complaints about the IEC: 'Chaotic right from head office to the last man; unable to find information which they want; unable to ensure elections are free and fair.' He refers to a confidential ANC report to the IEC detailing voting irregularities in the northern Natal region, which includes lists of ballot boxes improperly marked, sealed, or registered. Mr Mchunu acknowledges there is no way of knowing how many irregularities can be explained by human error. Only in the case of the small number of boxes filled with pre-stacked papers could one confidently assert fraud. Given some 119,000 people voted out of a voting population of 150,000 in the Empangeni area, there is no evidence of massive voter inflation. That does not mean fraud did not take place on a large scale - it simply means with no voter rolls and no record of votes cast, it will be impossible to draw the line between fraud and error. That, in the end, is the real problem: South Africa's electoral process has failed to confer legitimacy on the result. Only politicians can do that now.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPANESE PLAN POLISH CAR PROJECT  </P> <P> Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd. has come up with a new plan to produce compact cars in  Poland, company President Tomonaru Eguchi told reporters in Osaka today.  </P> <P> The plan was presented today to Polish public vehicle production company  Fabryka Samochodow Osobowych.  </P> <P> The Daihatsu plan calls for FSO to assemble 6,000 Daihatsu-designed Charade  cars annually, with components supplied by Daihatsu in Japan. The phased-in  investment will represent no financial difficulties for the Polish firm, said  Daihatsu.  </P> <P> In a previous proposal FSO and Daihatsu had faced difficulty securing loans  from the Japanese government because more than $690 million was required, a  Daihatsu spokesman said.  </P> <P> The Export-Import Bank of Japan is expected to provide financing for this  project, the spokesman said.  </P></p>

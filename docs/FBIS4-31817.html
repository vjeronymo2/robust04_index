			<p>BFN     [Text] Pristina, June 15 (TANJUG)--The review of ethnic  Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija (KosMet), KOHA, confirmed that  the Albanian separatists in this Serbian province spent large  amounts of money in the U.S. to finance anti-Serb campaigns and  appearances in the U.S. media to market their ideas on the  secession of KosMet.    KOHA wrote that Bujar Bukoshi, one of the leaders of the  national minority in KosMet, paid in the second part of last  year to the U.S. public relations firm Rudder Finn 230,141  dollars to arrange for him to meet U.S. officials and to appear  in the media.    The text goes on to assess that the "results of these fat  payments are scant", and in illustration notes that Bukoshi paid  heavily for a five-minute interview on CNN, but that the effect  was small.    A strong separatist movement of part of the ethnic Albanian  minority was active in KosMet for over two decades. It urges  secession of this Serbian province and its joining to the  neighbouring Albania.    The separatists' leadership three years ago  unconstitutionally and illegally proclaimed this Serbian  province as "Republic of Kosovo" and formed illegal organs of  authority thus boycotting the legitimate authorities of the  Republic of Serbia.    Among other things, the secessionists formed their own  illegal "government", headed by self-proclaimed Prime Minister  Bukoshi.    KOHA also revealed that Croatia and the Bosnian Moslem  leadership in Bosnia-Herzegovina too paid Rudder Finn to spread  anti-Serb propaganda.    Of the total amount of money paid to Rudder Finn by the  former Yugoslav Republics of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the Serbian province of KosMet, two-thirds came from the KosMet  Albanians, KOHA claims.    Apart from Rudder Finn, the Albanian separatists, as KOHA  says, engaged and paid for the same type of services also to  U.S. law firm Arnold and Porter.    KOHA adds that the funds for the anti-Serb propaganda  campaign abroad and for covering travel expenses of the ethnic  Albanian separatist leaders were taken from the 3 percent tax on  any transactions the separatists' leadership made their  co-nationals in KosMet pay under threat.    And while the people were having a hard time setting aside  the money for this tax, others were squandering it on sterile  contacts, such as the ones the Rudder Finn arranged, KOHA  concludes.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Nadir 'agrees debts deal' Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive tycoon, yesterday agreed to transfer his Sunzest fruit packaging concern to the north Cyprus government as part payment for his unpaid debts to the breakaway state, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said. Bayrak, the north's state broadcasting authority, said Mr Denktash called Mr Nadir to a cabinet meeting to discuss his debt. Turkey's Anatolian news agency reported earlier that Mr Nadir had submitted a plan which would cut his unpaid debts to the state, which amount to Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.4m). Mr Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot, jumped bail in Britain in 1993 and fled to northern Cyprus rather than face fraud charges stemming from his running of Polly Peck International.</p>

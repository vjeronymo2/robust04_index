			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (5): Imitations abound - UK policies / Britain is one of the world's foremost telecommunications 'laboratories,' THE UK's policies on competition and privatisation in telecommunications are being imitated worldwide, while the fate of new services - particularly the growing price war in the country's cellular mobile industry - are of global significance. It is nearly a decade since the privatisation of British Telecommunications and the licensing of Mercury Communications, a subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless, as a national competitor. C&amp;W, itself privatised only three years previously, was an established operator in the territories of the former British empire, but had previously done little in the UK. Competition got off to a limp start. Using railway lines for the most part, Mercury's network construction proceeded slowly. It made no early bid for the consumer market. Although it rapidly gained a sizeable business clientele - more than half of the City of London's outgoing traffic is now carried by Mercury - concerns about reliability and range of service restricted growth. At home, BT is still a Goliath. It carries around 90 per cent of the UK's telecoms traffic. With the third and final tranche of government shares in BT sold this summer, the only government check on its activities comes from Oftel, the UK's telecommunications regulator. Over the past decade Oftel has contained BT's prices but left it with fat profits, which it is now using to establish itself as a giant abroad - most recently through a Dollars 5.3bn deal giving it 20 per cent of MCI, the second largest US operator, and the lion's share of a joint venture set up by the two companies. However, BT's home base may soon be under siege. Mercury is making a determined bid for the domestic market: as yet it has only 375,000 domestic subscribers (against BT's 20m-plus), but with improved access terms, and new packages enabling people to subscribe without purchasing a special phone, it is growing rapidly. And Mercury is not the only challenger. Two years ago the government ended the BT/Mercury duopoly established in 1984, and guaranteed for the medium term by ministerial assurances given at BT's privatisation. Instead, the government announced its readiness to license new public operators, either building their own networks or retailing services provided over existing networks. Furthermore, it allowed cable companies, with franchises in urban areas, to build combined TV and telephony networks - and to encourage them to do so, it banned BT from offering entertainment services over its existing network for at least ten years. BT deeply resents the ban, and is planning a video-on-demand service to test its extent. But it appears to have had the desired effect: 27 companies, 20 of them North American, are currently building combined TV/telephone networks in 62 conurbations, with licences for another 65. They already have 185,000 customers between them, more than treble the tally a year ago. As for public telecommunications licences, 22 have been granted in the past two years. Most of them are for providers of specialised or regional services, including several overseas companies. But two companies have licences to build national networks: Energis, a subsidiary of the National Grid, the company which operates the national network of high-voltage pylons, is erecting an optical-fibre network on the pylons in barely two years; while Ionica, a private company, is building a radio network. Faced with new competition from all sides, BT's market share is bound to suffer. The key question is whether between them BT and the new operators can grow the market sufficiently to reduce BT's dominance while increasing its turnover and profits. The same question is hanging over the UK's cellular mobile industry, where Vodafone, the world's largest independent cellular operator, and Cellnet, a joint venture between BT and Securicor, are facing pressure on prices for the first time since the launch of their networks in the 1980s. By developed world standards, the UK's take-up of cellular phones is unexceptional, with a take-up rate lower than the US and Scandinavia but higher than most of the EC. Nor is the UK much of a technology testing ground: the GSM standard (adopted for two of its new digital services) is pan-European, while the PCN standard (adopted for the other two) has also been adopted by Germany and looks sets to extend elsewhere. However, the competitive pressures emerging in the UK cellular industry, while still some way short of those in Hong Kong, are more than a match for most of the rest of the world. Until this year, Vodafone and Cellnet carved up the market between them, making profits equal to more than 40 per cent of sales. The launch last month of Mercury One-2-One, the first of two licensed PCN networks, looks set to end that once and for all. One-2-One astonished the industry by offering free local calls to domestic subscribers in the evenings and at week-ends, in a determined bid to put mobile phones on the consumer map for the first time. That came on top of a tariff structure which offered substantial discounts on Vodafone and Cellnet tariffs - albeit limited by the fact that One-2-One's network currently covers only the London area. Despite the marketing hype, for the moment One-2-One will have only a modest appeal to domestic consumers because of the cost of handsets (at least Pounds 250) and monthly subscriptions (between Pounds 12.50 and Pounds 20). But One-2-One has already forced Vodafone and Cellnet to reduce their peak-rate London tariffs by 40 per cent, and to cut low-user tariffs aimed at the domestic market. With Hutchison set to launch another PCN service next spring, and Cellnet due to launch its digital service at the same time, competition will soon be taken to a still higher plane. That, plus the expected fall in digital handset prices, places the mass consumer market perhaps only two or three years away. Given the intensity of competition, it could come sooner in the UK than in most of continental Europe. However, the cellular sector highlights a remarkable paradox in the UK's telecom industry. Its service sector is thriving, but its manufacturing base is non-existent. All its suppliers are overseas companies. The wire-line sector is going the same way, with GPT now the only sizeable indiginous supplier - and GEC, its parent, has sold half of that to Siemens, with the other half generally expected to follow in due course. The British disease - all services, no manufacturing - or a tragic missed opportunity? Either way, the die is cast.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Exact Change' equals failure - Theatre The fact that little happens in Exact Change is exactly the point, for its three characters are all failures. The point is both comic and serious. These three American men were once at high school together and are stuck working together. First (Act One), they fail to run to run a restaurant; then (Act Two) they fail in crime. Botts: 'How did we get here?' Merola: 'Bad luck; poor planning; faulty execution.' Bompkee: 'And shitty ideas.' Much of the time, they abuse each other, either verbally or physically. I am seldom bothered by coarse or obscene words, but for about half the play these three men use bad language so constantly and (worse) so meaninglessly that I took offence. I also spent most of the play disliking all three men intensely - spending time with people who recognise their own failure is a wearying business - and took a dreadful pleasure in their bouts of bashing each other up. The author is the American playwright, David Epstein. That he accurately catches a certain East Coast American type of talk is not in question. But what type of talk is this? We have all heard this kind of American before, because we have encountered it on TV in countless sit-coms. Botts and Bompkee and Merola speak in patterns that are too cute to be real. Even the extent of their failure is cute. They not only fail to rob a toll-booth successfully, they then lock themselves out of the stolen car they used and in which they have left their fingerprints. At several points, however, Epstein means his characters to transcend this kind of cuteness. Mainly this occurs when they talk, with infinite incomprehension, of the opposite sex. Botts: 'What is it about women?' Morelli: 'An alien culture.' They talk of women's perfumes, of their own castration complexes, and of their own violence to women. They are, of course, as much failures with women as elsewhere; indeed, you start to sense that their failure with women is at the root of their own failings. But it is here that the play becomes touching; and only it is here that I found it possible to laugh. The production, directed by Aaron Mullen, takes time to find its feet. At first, Steven O'Shea, as Merola, speaks at too monotonous a volume, and the timing is too pat. But Mike McShane, as Bompkee, and Kevin McNally, as Botts, are remarkably persuasive, and O'Shea eventually rises to their level. My reservations are about the play. I reviewed last week the excellent Birmingham Rep staging of Pinter's Old Times. Because I did not notice the sung passages including anything from 'Smoke gets in your eyes', I assumed that they were omitted. I am reliably informed, however, that in this I was mistaken. My apologies to the actors; and my renewed compliments to the production. Exact Change is at the Lyric, Hammersmith, W6, until December 4. 081-741-0824.</p>

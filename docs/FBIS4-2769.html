			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The central  government has decided to shelve the plan for taxing gains from  stock trading for at least two years, according to a senior  Chinese tax official.    The move came a little more than three months after the  enforcement of the revised tax laws on personal income, which  stipulate that such gains should be taxed.    For quite some time, so rife were the rumors and  speculations  of a possible introduction of the tax that the stock market  plummeted.    "The issue demands a whole set of principles and enforcement  is rather complex," said vice-director of the State  Administration of Taxation (SAT) Li Yonggui here today to the  Beijing press. "Both the share-holding system and stock market  are still in their infant stages. We need time to conduct  research on how and when to introduce the tax.    "This year and the next, gains from stock transactions will  not be taxed," assured Li.    Li said, however, whether or not to introduce the tax will  depend on the research work and the real situation.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow trades in narrow range throughout day Wall Street US SHARE prices traded in a narrow range yesterday as lower bond yields and disappointing economic news pulled market sentiment in opposite directions, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.28 at 3,561.27. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.88 easier at 449.27, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.35 at 709.01. New York SE volume was 253m shares. After Monday's strong start to the week, consolidation was the order of the day on stock markets yesterday. The morning's economic news was bearish in tone - a 0.1 per cent increase in the June index of leading economic indicators was weaker than expected. The report suggested, like most recent data, that the economy is growing, but at an unusually modest rate for normal post-recessionary periods. While the leading indicators report deflated investor sentiment, there was some good news from the fixed-income market, where brightened prospects for the approval of President Bill Clinton's deficit-reduction budget package provided a sharp lift to government bond prices. In late trading the benchmark 30-year issue was still noticeably firmer, and the yield had fallen to 6.52 per cent, close to the lowest level in the bond's history. Unisys firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 10 3/8 in early trading after the company announced a joint venture with Intel, the microchip manufacturer, to develop parallel processing computers. The stock later receded to end Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 10 1/8 . Intel, traded on the Nasdaq market, rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 53 in volume of 2.2m shares. UAL fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 141 1/4 after Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, lowered its rating on the airline stock from 'outperform' to 'buy', citing price reasons. The decline, however, attracted buyers, and by the close UAL had recovered to Dollars 143 3/4 , up Dollars 1 1/4 on the day. Dr Pepper-Seven Up lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 17 3/4 after insurance group Prudential announced it would sell its 20 per cent stake in the drinks group in a secondary offering of 11m shares. Selected cyclical stocks were in demand, including Alcoa, up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 73 1/2 , International Paper, Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 64 5/8 , and Caterpillar, Dollars 1 3/4 ahead at Dollars 79 7/8 . Chiquita Brands eased initially on Monday's late news that the company was cutting its dividend to strengthen its balance sheet, but rallied to end Dollars  1/8 up on balance at Dollars 12 1/2 . On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 29 in volume of 1.6m shares after announcing that it is lowering prices of its Apple PowerBook duo line and several other products. Other technology stocks were also firmer, including new issue Actel, which debuted at Dollars 9 1/2 and closed the day at Dollars 13 1/4 after volume of 4.3m shares. Canada TORONTO rose in moderate trading, the TSE 300 index adding 9.3 at 3,976.5, with advancing issues leading declines by 377 to 318. Volume amounted to 39.8m shares valued at CDollars 381.7m. Eleven of the 14 sub-group indices finished higher, led by mining, which gained 2.5 per cent. The golds index declined 2.2 per cent.</p>

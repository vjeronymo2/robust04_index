			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10,500 SOVIET JEWS ARRIVED IN APRIL, ISRAEL OFFICIAL SAYS  </P> <P> About 10,500 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel in April, the largest monthly figure  since the start of a mass Soviet immigration to the Jewish state last year, an  official said Tuesday.  </P> <P> It was the first time Israel had published a figure for Soviet arrivals since  early March, when such statistics were censored in response to Arab guerrilla  threats to attack immigrants.  </P> <P> Gad Ben Ari, the spokesman for the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, which is  partly responsible for resettling the immigrants, gave the figure for April. He  added that Israel's goal is "to bring the maximum amount of people in the  minimum amount of time."  </P> <P> Before April, the monthly immigration figure for Soviet Jews was between 4,000  and 6,000, Israeli and foreign reports said. In 1989, 12,000 Soviet Jews  settled in Israel, and in 1988 only 2,000.  </P> <P> The relaxation in the censorship of immigration statistics appears to be a  result of pressure from overseas fund-raisers, particularly those in the United  States.  </P> <P> Israeli officials estimate that up to 300,000 Soviet Jews will emigrate to  Israel in the next few years. The influx comes because of a loosening of  immigration procedures in the Soviet Union and tighter U.S. restrictions.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The United Nations says it has moved enough food aid to southern Sudan to  prevent the deaths of thousands of people who faced starvation because farming  there has been disrupted by civil war. James Grant, head of the U.N.'s  Operation Lifeline Sudan, told a news conference in Kenya that 45,000 tons of  food has been rushed to southern Sudan since March. Another 45,000 tons is  expected to be moved in before the end of June. Although this is still 30,000  tons short of the goal, Grant said that "we appear to be in a position to avoid  any massive deaths."  </P></p>

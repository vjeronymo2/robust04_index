			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Manila pressed to extend trade, investment reform MEMBERS of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade yesterday urged the Philippines government to go further in liberalising trade and investment policies which continue to hamper growth. A report by Gatt economists, discussed yesterday by the body's governing council, says economic reforms over the past decade have opened up the Philippines economy and gone some way towards correcting its anti-export, import substitution bias. But import-competing sectors, especially in manufacturing, continue to be protected by trade barriers. Average tariffs have fallen from more than 40 per cent to 25.6 per cent, with a further reduction to 20 per cent planned by 1995. Import restrictions have been removed, export taxes phased out and monopolies in commodity trade abolished. However, tariffs are higher for manufactured goods than for raw materials, while some key products are excluded from import liberalisation. The report is particularly critical of the government's Car Development Programme which promotes the domestic industry. This is backed by restraints on imports of vehicles and components. Gatt notes that, while restrictions on foreign investment have been eased, those that remain continue to deter would-be investors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Next week, Cuba will open a diplomatic mission in  Barbados, which will help promote commercial, cultural, and  sports relations with all eastern Caribbean as part of Cuba's  integration into that region.    Cuba and Barbados established diplomatic relations on 8  December 1992 [as heard], but now the opportunity to establish a  mission in Bridgetown has arisen because of Cuba's closer ties  with the Anglo-Caribbean community, Caricom.    Lazaro Cabezas, Cuba's current ambassador to eastern  Caribbean, stressed that the main objectives of his mission are  to strengthen economic and commercial ties as well as to promote  culture and sports ties. Cabezas represents Cuba in St. Vincent  and the Grenadines, the Bahamas, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and  Tobago. The only countries in that region yet to formalize  diplomatic ties with Cuba are Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and  Antigua and Barbuda.</p>

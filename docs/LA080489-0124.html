			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW $3.4-BILLION BID FOR BRITISH ELECTRONICS GIANT  </P> <P> General Electric Co. of Britain and Siemens AG of West Germany on Thursday made  a fresh $3.4-billion bid for Plessey PLC and quickly boosted their stake in the  British electronics company to 29.9%.  </P> <P> GEC is not related to the similarly named U.S. company.  </P> <P> Sources said the joint bidders spent $495 million snapping up Plessey stock,  bringing their holdings to the maximum allowed under British takeover rules.  </P> <P> Plessey rapidly rejected the offer as "totally inadequate," saying the  electronics giants had made "a major price miscalculation."  </P> <P> Analysts conceded that the price was at the low end of Plessey's recent trading  range but noted that the joint bidders were likely to be successful.  </P> <P> The $4.46-a-share offer came one day after the British government announced an  agreement with the bidders on conditions for renewing their bid for Plessey.  </P> <P> The new offer replaced the original $2.8-billion bid that GEC and Siemens  launched in November. That bid automatically lapsed in January when the  government decided to investigate what impact such a combination would have on  competition within Britain's electronics industry.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELER'S DIARY: TAKING A TRIP TO THE RESORT LAND OF YOUR DREAMS  </P> <P> If most travelers are given a choice they would take off for a dream world that  exists beyond the daily workaday life and beyond the borders of an ordinary  holiday.  </P> <P> In an effort to meet those desires, developers -- stretched from Walt Disney's  "Imagineers" in Florida and in California to the far-out dreamers in Hawaii --  have ready-to-serve realities.  </P> <P> Americans are taking about 400-million trips a year, with vacation excursions  accounting for a 16% rise in the last five years and resort travel jumping 5%  every year.  </P> <P> Hyatt, which has 32 resorts around the world, expects to spend $3 billion in  the next five years, putting up extravagant shelters at Wailea and on Kauai in  Hawaii; in Aruba; at Beaver Creek, Colo., and at the new resort complex at Nusa  Dua in Bali, where former President Reagan and Nancy stayed.  </P> <P> Hyatt has attached the word "fantasy" to these resorts, and none is more of a  dream world than the $360-million, 1,241-room extravaganza it operates at  Waikoloa on the island of Hawaii.  </P> <P> The resort, which is traversed by a fleet of launches as well as by a tubular  tram, is a product of the quintessential fantasy fancier Christopher Hemmeter,  who has another playland called Kauai Lagoons, managed by Westin.  </P> <P> Occupancy at the Waikoloa fantasy, a month after the September opening, ran 15  points over the industry average. It is often sold out on weekends and fantasy  fanciers can spend up to $1,000 a couple a night.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drive a Race Car  </P> <P> Among the offerings by the fantasy desk there are learning how to drive a race  car; holding a private dinner party at Hulihee Palace, a landmark of Hawaii's  monarchy days (printed personalized menus included); a helicopter picnic at the  edge of a 300-foot cliff; spending a day as a Hawaiian cowboy learning how to  herd sheep on a motorcycle or a horse.  </P> <P> Then one can have dinner for two at a secluded beach reached by a 45-foot  sailboat chartered just for you, and joining the dolphins for a play period  after learning how to "talk" to them and give hand signals. That little number  costs $55 for adults, $45 for children.  </P> <P> On the books in Las Vegas is a $1.2-billion resort called Pharaoh's Kingdom. It  will have rooms for 5,000, a gaming area that measures 280,000 square feet, a  convention center and a $100-million spa.  </P> <P> But that's only for starters. In the middle of the desert they'll create a  jungle-fringed lagoon with its own beach, an Egyptian city as it may have  appeared in Tut's time -- but underwater, this time -- and an underwater  seafood restaurant. Add to all that an amusement park put together by Disney.  </P> <P> Children, to be sure, are allowed to have fantasies too. In the middle of  Indianapolis the old railroad station has vintage railroad cars that have been  rebuilt as hotel suites -- two to a car. The train car suites occupy 13 Pullman  car sleepers all resting on their original tracks.  </P> <P> Linblad's tours have had their Antarctic customers swimming in the seas at the  bottom of the world. Try that for dinner-party conversation.  </P> <P> Or tell about Finnair's eight-day excursions to Lapland beyond the Arctic  Circle -- snowmobiling to Lapp villages or living through the nightless summer  nights and dining in a tepee, with visits to Helsinki and Stockholm and  free-of-visa sailings to Leningrad.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fantasy Weekends  </P> <P> For those with little time but big dreams there are even fantasy weekends. The  Hilton at Short Hills, N.J., runs a 24-karat weekend that starts when a  chauffeur picks you up at Newark Airport, then offers a bottle of Dom Perignon  champagne in the limousine.  </P> <P> A dozen roses await in the deluxe suite, where a chef and serenading violinist  attend the couple at dinner in the suite.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gift Certificate  </P> <P> A choice of Japanese or Swedish massages awaits, as does a $100 gift  certificate for shopping at a nearby mall. All that for $1,500.  </P> <P> Last year the Grand Hyatt in New York City offered -- steady now -- a $10,000  weekend . . . without air fare.  </P> <P> It included the presidential suite, chauffeurs and limousines, caviar and a  continuous flow of champagne, as well as tickets to "Phantom of the Opera," a  limo to the theater, Regine's for dinner and over to Christie's to get measured  for a mink. Yes, madame got to keep the coat. There were two takers.  </P></p>

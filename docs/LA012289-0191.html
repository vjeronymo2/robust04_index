			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPERFECTIONS  </P> <P> Jack Mathews' sneaks article goofed too. In "Fat Man and Little Boy," Paul  Newman plays Col. Leslie Groves -- not Robert Oppenheimer. And Larry Peerce,  the director of "Wired," did not also direct "Country." That was Richard  Pearce.  </P></p>

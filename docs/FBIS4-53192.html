			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday  reaffirmed Thailand's policy of non-intervention in Cambodia's  internal affairs, saying Thailand had no right to tell anyone  what to do.    "Thailand never interferes in the internal affairs of  another  country," he said.    "The Cambodian request for arms assistance is a matter  concerning only the donors and the recipients. Thailand cannot  interfere or get involved."    Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh said on Monday  that Bangkok's opposition to overseas military aid for his  government was hypocritical and amounted to unacceptable  interference.    Cambodian leaders have repeatedly accused Thailand of aiding  the Khmer Rouge [KR] Through trade and by providing a safe haven  on its soil. Thai authorities however, have denied helping the  guerrillas.    "When they (government troops) lose (on the battlefield),  they always find a scapegoat or someone to blame," the Foreign  Minister said in response to the Cambodian government  allegations against Thailand.    Foreign Ministry Director-General of East Asian Affairs  Department, Don Pramutwinai, pointed out that Thailand did not  object to the foreign supply of arms to the Phnom Penh  government, as it had only expressed its opinion and goodwill to  see lasting peace in Cambodia.    "We just expressed our feelings as a neighboring country  which has always been affected by the fighting in Cambodia. The  provision of arms by outsiders would prolong the conflict and  would absolutely not bring peace to that country," Mr Don said.    Prince Ranariddh said Foreign Minister Norodom Sirivut had  met the ambassadors of the United States, France, Britain and  other countries to officially ask for military assistance to  fight the Khmer Rouge.    Defense Minister Wichit Sukmak commented that arms  assistance  was "the least appropriate thing" for the Paris Peace agreement  signatories to conduct.    His deputy minister Sombat Rotphothong said whoever wanted  to  assist Cambodia should consider whether that assistance would  bring about peace in the country.    Maj-Gen Sombat noted that the solution to Cambodian problems  would only be reached through political means, not military  support, "otherwise the Cambodian people would be the ones who  suffer most."    Gen Wichit reiterated Thailand's firm stand to see national  reconciliation in Cambodia and the hope that the conflict would  be settled through peaceful means.    "If the fighting continues, the repercussions on Thailand  could not be avoided for we share a common border. We have no  involvement but are burdened with such negative results," he  said.    Asked if foreign military assistance would violate the 1991  peace agreement, Gen Wichit said such was the case because the  accord aimed at reducing and controlling arms in Cambodia.    "If there is still military support to one particular  faction, the fighting will be prolonged and never end," Gen  Wichit said.    Meanwhile, Cambodian ambassador-designate to Bangkok Roland  Eng was yesterday invited by the Foreign Ministry to discuss the  invitation extended to Cambodia to attend the ASEAN Regional  Forum (ARF) scheduled for Bangkok in July.    Director-General Don quoted Mr Eng as expressing interest in  participating in the meeting. However, Cambodia this year could  not immediately join as they first need to have access to the  Treaty of Amity and Cooperation of the Southeast Asian nations  and hold observer status.    Mr Eng was also quoted as saying that he would take up his  position in Bangkok soon.    He told reporters after a 30-minute discussion with Mr Don  that he believed Thailand would want to see roundtable peace  talks held as soon as possible and the Cambodian government was  trying its best to organize such a meeting.</p>

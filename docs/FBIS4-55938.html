			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- The United States is  not interested in drawing "new dividing lines" in Europe but if  there are complications in the developments of Eastern Europe,  Slovakia will become part of West European security structures,  Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis told reporters on his return  from the United States.    "The key question is how Ukraine now develops: whether it  will become federalized or draw closer to the Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS)," Kanis said.    Commenting on NATO's offer of special status to Russia in  the  Partnership for Peace program, allowing it consultation on  European security issues, he said, "Russia as a Eurasian nuclear  superpower cannot have the same status as the other countries."    Slovakia will submit a presentation document -- providing  the  basis for an individual program of cooperation with NATO -- on  May 25 at a session of the North Atlantic Council for  Cooperation in Brussels. The document has first to be approved  by the Slovak government on Tuesday, along with the new national  defense doctrine.    Kanis said the United States had appreciated the fact that  the document had been prepared through broad consultation. The  Slovak side, he said, had had consultations in Washington, in  Garmisch- Partenkirchen at the Marshall Institute and also with  German Defense Minister Volker Ruhe.    Kanis said it was symbolic that the government would debate  the presentation document and the new defense doctrine at the  same time. The previous cabinet, headed by Vladimir Meciar,  approved the Slovak defense doctrine at the beginning of the  year. The decision to prepare a new doctrine was taken, Kanis  said, so that those who did not agree with opinions of former  Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak could also contribute.</p>

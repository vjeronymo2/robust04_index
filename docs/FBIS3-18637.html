			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Silvio Berlusconi, chairman of the Forza </F> Italia party, by correspondent Anne Sinclair in Milan on 4 March  -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Sinclair] Good evening. Italy will be going to  the polls in three weeks' time. It is going through an  incredible period. [passage omitted] Silvio Berlusconi, good  evening.    [Berlusconi] Good evening to you.    [Sinclair] We are recording this program on Friday evening  [4  March] in Milan because you will be campaigning throughout the  country tomorrow and on Sunday. [passage omitted]    [Sinclair] If you come to power, do you intend to sell your  group? Will such private interests be compatible with the  responsibilities of a prime minister, a European prime minister?    [Berlusconi] Is TF1 interested in buying us up? [laughs]    [Sinclair] I don't think so. This is a serious question. Is  it possible to be a prime minister and to have so many private  interests?    [Berlusconi] It must be pointed out that, if we, as a  political party, are responsible for setting up a government, it  is obvious that it will not be possible to submit to my judgment  or ask me to intervene in any problem likely to concern my group  directly or indirectly.    [Sinclair] I did not mean the daily management of your  group.  It is obvious that if you are the prime minister, you will not  manage Fininvest, your group, directly. My question was a  question in principle: Is it possible today to be a major  private entrepreneur, to have one's own private capital and  govern a leading country?    [Berlusconi] There have already been precedents. I know what  is happening in the United States, for example. There, it is  provided by law that, when someone has responsibilities within a  government, political responsibilities, this person must resign  from all posts in their group and distance themselves from the  decisions regarding the group. I think that we may go in that  direction. I also believe that we may sell most or all of the  group's stakes if need be. But it is a prerequisite for me to  be given responsibilities within the government, really.  [passage omitted]    [Sinclair] Earlier you mentioned the National Alliance --  everyone has adopted new names for these elections -- it was  called the MSI [Italian Social Movement] not so long ago and  they were known as Neo-Fascists. Its leader, Gianfranco Fini,  who lost in the last Rome elections -- you gave him your support  at the time -- is calling himself a post-Fascist. Isn't it a  problem to be allied with a party in which Alessandra Mussolini  is invoking her grandfather, a party that put cassettes of the  Duce on sale at its last meeting? Didn't you demand a public  renunciation from them?    [Berlusconi] This does not correspond to reality.  Adversaries gave this picture of this party.    [Sinclair] Bossi himself said that Fini was a Fascist.    [Berlusconi] It was an election speech, it must be  understood  that he needs to reassure his supporters, to find other  positions and an identity. I believe that the French must be  told that Mr. Fini is no more on the right than Mr. Chirac is in  France. [passage omitted]    [Sinclair] The former Yugoslavia has a frontier with Italy,  so it is a subject that is of great concern to you, and we don't  know at all what you think about it. I suppose that like all  Europeans you supported the ultimatum?    [Berlusconi] Certainly. I would only say that we waited too  long. There was a degree of over-caution in Europe about  intervening like this and about setting the ultimatum. I think  France was right, and Italy too, but we should have done it  earlier.    [Sinclair] General Cot, who commands the UN forces  throughout  the former Yugoslavia, is demanding to be sent extra troops  urgently, because they not only have to act as buffer between  belligerents, but also to occupy and guard the protected zones.    [Berlusconi] I think Europe should take on more  responsibility here, because today we have a situation that is  somewhat dangerous, with America supporting the Croat-Muslim  confederation, and Russia supporting Serbia. We have let two  non-European countries into the Mediterranean, allowed them to  get involved in a problem that affects us, a problem that  belongs to us. I think Europe should in the future be more  involved, and make more resolute interventions.    [Sinclair] If you head the government tomorrow, you would  take the initiative on this?    [Berlusconi] I have said several times that all the foreign  ministers should be brought together to discuss this burning  question.    [Sinclair] That is often done.    [Berlusconi] Yes, but permanently. To make decisions with  more courage.    [Sinclair] Unfortunately, Europe does not yet have a foreign  policy nor a defense policy. You are a convinced European, a  convinced Maastricht man. You think that is the right way  forward?    [Berlusconi] Certainly. I am convinced that Europe also has  to be enlarged and opened up to all the countries of East Europe.    [Sinclair] Opened up to all the countries of East Europe,  but  aren't you afraid that too great an economic disparity might  drive a wedge through the homogeneity of the European Twelve?    [Berlusconi] No, we have systems to give the countries of  the  Treaty of Rome greater weight. But I think that if Europe wants  to face up to the other world powers, it must be strong and be  truly representative of European geography. [passage omitted]</p>

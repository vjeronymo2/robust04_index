			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> DAVIS AND STEELERS' NOLL GO WAY BACK  </P> <P> Al Davis and Pittsburgh Steeler Coach Chuck Noll were assistant coaches with  the San Diego Chargers in 1960-62. Noll said Friday that although he and Davis  remain friends, he hadn't spoken with the Raider owner recently.  </P> <P> How does Noll remember the Raider-Steeler rivalry of the 1970s? "They were  very, very physical," he said. "I don't expect this one (Sunday at the  Coliseum) to be any less."  </P> <P> Joe Walton, fired as coach of the New York Jets at the end of last season, was  hired as the Steelers' offensive coordinator to revamp the offense, which  ranked last in the NFL last season. But the Steelers have struggled this  season, failing to score an offensive touchdown in two games.  </P> <P> "Until we quit making mistakes, it wouldn't matter if we were playing the  YMCA," quarterback Bubby Brister said.

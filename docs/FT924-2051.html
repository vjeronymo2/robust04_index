			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Protectionist wolf in sheep's clothing: The increasing use of anti-dumping actions could undermine the benefits of successful trade negotiations After years of tortuous negotiations, the prospect of a successful completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks has raised hopes of substantial gains in international commerce. But trade experts have become increasingly concerned that anti-dumping actions could undermine the benefits of an agreement. Such concerns are based on fears that increasing use of anti-dumping actions  -duties and fines against alleged sales of products at below-cost prices - represents a creeping protectionism which is raising new barriers to trade. At present, dumping is dealt with under a special code in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which calls for complainants to report dumping actions, and deals with disputes arising when exporters challenge a dumping duty. Countries which have been frequent victims of dumping actions, such as Japan, have become increasingly anxious for international curbs on what they regard as harassment by the EC and the US. Evidence of the growing protectionism behind anti-dumping actions comes in a forthcoming study by the World Bank. According to the report, average tariffs in the entire US manufacturing sector would be 23 per cent today - compared with a nominal level of 6 per cent - if they were adjusted to account for the cost of dumping duties on imported steel, textiles and cars, the industries most affected. 'We appear through dumping actions to have rolled back about half of the gains of the 45-year Gatt process,' says Mr Michael Finger at the World Bank. When the Gatt was set up in 1947, tariffs averaged between 40 and 50 per cent. 'Anti-dumping actions are Smoot-Hawley in slow motion,' a leading Washington trade lawyer said last week, referring to the controversial protectionist law passed in the US in 1930, which played a critical part in fomenting a tit-for-tat trade war that took the world into the Great Depression. The current fears result from a proliferation of anti-dumping measures. The decision earlier this month by the US to impose punitive fines on steel imports from the European Community, and the EC's own imposition of punitive duties on eastern European steel exporters, are the latest incidents in an accelerating trend. The number of anti-dumping actions in international markets has risen from 96 in the year to June 1990 to 237 in the year to this June. The number of countries using the measures is also rising. Australia overtook the US last year as the biggest user of anti-dumping actions, while Mexico for the first time launched more actions than the EC. Developing countries have now brought a total of 162 actions, all of them since 1985. At the same time, the range of products affected by anti-dumping duties has grown. In the EC alone products affected range from ethanol, cement and aspirin to computers, fork-lift trucks and flowers. Expansion of these measures is partly the result of the reduction in tariff barriers. In the US and Europe, industries ranging from cars to electronics have found it steadily harder to compete against foreign manufacturers as tariff walls have fallen. Recession has exacerbated the effects of foreign competition, fuelling calls for protection from imports. The previous recession, of 1982-84, also prompted a rise in anti-dumping activity; the costs of such action still weigh heavily on several industries, notably chemicals. Mr Michael Davenport, a former European Commission economist, believes governments also use anti-dumping actions as a means of promoting certain industries. 'Anti-dumping policy in the EC seems now to be used covertly as industrial policy,' he says. Supporters of anti-dumping actions from within industry and government argue that the measures are necessary to prevent unfair market practices. 'Anti-dumping actions are a blunt instrument, and don't always follow the markets. But in a global economy full of distortions, they are the only recourse industry has,' argues Mr Sean Mackle of the Chemical Industries Association. But the ways in which governments determine what constitutes dumping generally stack the cards against exporters and are open to abuse. When the US Commerce Department investigates a charge of dumping, it uses an arbitrary profit margin of 8 per cent to determine whether the price of the exporter's products is 'fair'. This margin is set despite the fact that profits before income taxes for all US companies average 6 per cent, according to calculations by the International Trade Commission in the US. In 1989, the Court of International Trade in the US complained that the Department of Commerce's methods of comparing prices results in 'a loss of reasonable fairness'. All but 5 per cent of the department's investigations result in a finding of dumping - penalising more than 3,000 foreign companies since 1980. Controversial findings abound. China has been found guilty of dumping manhole covers after a comparison with production prices in Belgium, Canada, France and Japan unsurprisingly showed the Chinese products were cheaper. Hong Kong, a transparent and highly competitive economy, without subsidies, has been charged with dumping sweaters and photograph albums. In 1989, electronics group Matsushita of Japan abandoned its defence against claims it was dumping telephone systems in the US when officials demanded on a Friday afternoon that it translate 3,000 pages of Japanese financial documents into English for presentation to investigators by the following Monday. For exporters to Europe, EC actions may appear equally capricious, though fewer than a quarter of investigations over the past decade have resulted in duties being charged. Instead, the EC appears to prefer 'voluntary' restraint agreements by exporters. More than half of all cases have led to 'special undertakings' under which importers agree to raise prices. Many of the others are referred to as 'investigations which have been terminated for other reasons'. This usually means that informal import restrictions were agreed. Nor is there any effort in Brussels or Washington to discover whether 'dumping' is helpful or damaging. As a recent IMF report complains, it is often 'not low prices abroad, but high prices at home, that should be objected to'. US steel users have been quick to protest that the duties announced this month, which range as high as 58 per cent, will raise their costs and damage their competitiveness. Britain's National Consumer Council has calculated that in consumer electronics alone, the cost to EC consumers of Community anti-dumping measures is Pounds 1.17bn a year. The draft Uruguay Round agreement is intended to spur anti-dumping reform, but economists say the text is largely copied from existing US and EC law - the text that provides a framework for abuse. Without further toughening of anti-dumping law, any trade gains might prove illusory.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  ANTI-DUMPING - CREEPING PROTECTIONISM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Anti-dumping and         Jan 80                  July to June countervailing             to     ------------------------------------- duty cases               Jun 80   80-81   81-82   82-83   83-84   84-85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia                  36      61       54     71      70      63 Canada                     26      48       64     34      26      35 EC                         17      37       39     26      33      34 US                         37      24       51     19      46      61 Other developed   countries                 1       3        2      0       1       0 Developing   countries                 0       0        0      0       0       0 TOTAL                     117     173      210    150     176     193  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Anti-dumping and                  July to June                  Jan 91 countervailing       ----------------------------------------     to duty cases           85-86  86-87  87-88  88-89  89-90  90-91   Jun 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia             54     40      20     19     23    46      76 Canada                27     24      20     14     15    12      16 EC                    23     17      30     29     15    15      23 US                    63     41      31     25     24    52      62 Other developed   countries            2      5       9     12      5     9      21 Developing   countries            3      4      13     14     14    41      39 TOTAL                172    131     123    113     96   175     237  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Gatt  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Camdev enters black Camdev, the surviving company from the 1991-92 collapse and restructuring of Mr Robert Campeau's property and US retailing empire, has posted its first quarterly profit. Camdev remains a substantial owner of office buildings and land in Ottawa and Toronto. It reported net profit of CDollars 237,000 (USDollars 170,921), or 4 cents a share, for the three months ended April 30, against a loss of CDollars 211,000, or 3 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were little changed at CDollars 20m. However, chairman Mr Stanley Hartt warned the profit was mainly due to a CDollars 1.5m dividend received from a minority-owned California supermarket chain. He said the chain needed to reinvest its cash, and Camdev hoped to sell its 12.8 per cent interest. For the year ended January 1994, Camdev lost CDollars 1.5m, or 24 cents, against a loss of CDollars 13.7m, or CDollars 2.16, a year earlier. Mr Hartt said Camdev wanted to expand its property management and development activities through a new subsidiary, Finreal Properties.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["`Internationalization' To Sell Nation's Soul and </F> Interests" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  brands the "internationalization" hastened by the traitor Kim  Yong-sam as a treacherous act to sell the nation's interests to  outside forces and further reduce South Korea to their colony  and theater of rampage.    The paper in a by-lined article says:    The traitor Kim Yong-sam hurriedly announced a "strategy of  internationalization" in November last year as soon as he opened  the rice market. It was a crafty ruse to lull the people's  protest and criticism against his treacherous rice market  opening.    He intends to curry favour with his U.S. master through his  full compliance with the master's demand and prolong his power  with the backing of the master in disregard of the dignity of  the nation and the interests of the people. The  "internationalization" is a product of his despicable flunkeyist  and treacherous scheme to justify the U.S. domination and  plunder and prolong his remaining days under the patronage of  outside forces.    The "internationalization" is aimed at bartering away the  nation's soul and interests to outside forces and reducing South  Korea to an "international prostitute."    Under the veil of "internationalization," the traitor Kim  Yong- sam has removed or eased the nominal restrictions on the  infiltration of foreign capital into South Korea, leaving South  Korea to the tender mercy of foreign monopolies and adapting  everything in South Korea to foreign fashion.    The "internationalization" scheme of the traitor is a  treacherous act to induce bigger outside forces into South  Korea, fatten comprador capital, extort the workers, farmers and  other working people and reduce them to slaves to outside forces.</p>

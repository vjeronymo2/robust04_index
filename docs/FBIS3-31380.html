This is Russia's stand set forth by Russian  Ambassador Aleksandr Avdeyev at a meeting with National Assembly  Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov. Mr. Avdeyev told journalists that  he raised the issue of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Russia's stand on NATO's ultimatum to the warring sides. The UN  Security Council has authorized NATO to use force only if UN  troops are attacked, Mr. Avdeyev said. The tragedy in Sarajevo  did not affect NATO troops but nevertheless the NATO Council  issued an ultimatum to the warring sides and threatened with air  strikes. If air strikes are to be used then it is necessary for  the UN Security Council to extend a new mandate to NATO.  Russia's stand is that in principle the possibility of air  strikes should not be excluded. [passage omitted]</p>

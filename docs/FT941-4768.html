			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Norway unflustered by collapse of talks Norway yesterday appeared unflustered by the hiatus in its fraught negotiations on terms for entry to the European Union as the government presented the wrangles within the EU on the talks as evidence that it was driving a good deal for Oslo, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the Norwegian fisheries minister - given a virtual veto on the country's entry terms by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland - said he would recommend acceptance of a proposed deal blocked only by Spain when the talks stalled in Brussels. 'If Spain accepts the proposed solution on fish already accepted by the 11 other EU members and Norway, I will say yes to membership and recommend others to do the same,' said Mr Olsen formerly a staunch opponent of Norwegian entry to the union. In Stockholm, Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, said he was not concerned by the delay in Brussels. 'This is not a breakdown in negotiations, but a one week delay. There is no reason to believe Sweden's entry will be delayed,' he said.</p>

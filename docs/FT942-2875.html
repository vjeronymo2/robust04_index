			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Ashdown plans frontbench reshuffle Mr Paddy Ashdown is planning a shake-up of the Liberal Democrat frontbench team as part of a strategy to maintain the party's profile after its disappointing performance in the European elections. The aim is to sharpen the presentation of policies to counter concerns that the party's distinctive identity is threatened by Labour's expected choice of the moderate Mr Tony Blair as leader. In particular, Mr Ashdown is keen to develop a more distinctive economic policy, emphasising the Liberal Democrats' commitment to enterprise and free markets. Under the reshuffle, Mr Alan Beith is likely to move from economics to another portfolio. Alternatively, Mr Ashdown might split the portfolio and appoint another spokesman alongside Mr Beith. Mr Menzies Campbell is seen by friends as the strongest candidate for a higher-profile post. Among others expected to be given a more important role are Mr Charles Kennedy, who stands down this year as president of the party, and Mr Matthew Taylor, the campaigns co-ordinator. Mr Ashdown has rejected suggestions that the European elections - in which the party won its first two seats in the Strasbourg assembly but saw its share of the vote fall to 16 per cent - marked the beginning of a shift to Labour of the anti-Tory vote. But he has told colleagues that the party must now respond to the threat posed by Mr Blair's promise to drive forward the modernisation of the Labour party by refining its own message to the voters.</p>

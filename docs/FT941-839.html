			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (2): Capacity crunch looms - Employers' liability Employers' liability (EL) used to be seen as a relatively easy class of risk to manage - for insurers and industry. But since the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988, which sent a tidal wave of claims through the market, businesses are finding EL protection increasingly expensive and often difficult to place. As a result, a radical shake-up in the way EL risk is managed and insured is now under way. If Piper Alpha shocked direct writers and reinsurers into reducing their exposure to EL insurance business, a steady increase in the cost of claims over the past 20 years had already become a growing concern for EL insurers such as Eagle Star. The leading UK EL underwriter has worked out that the average cost of EL claims has risen by 15 times in the past two decades and is still growing. Against a background of 800 per cent inflation over the same period, claims for total disablement have risen by 1,500 per cent (from an average of Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 750,000) and claims for minor injuries increased 1,250 per cent (from Pounds 100 to Pounds 1,250). Besides injury claims, losses incurred by insurers from occupational disease claims have also grown and now represent about 50 per cent of all EL claims, compared to less than 20 per cent 10 years ago. In addition to the relentless march of claims in 'traditional' categories, such as deafness or loss of limb, new heads of claim emanating from white-collar employees are adding to insurers' woes. Repetitive strain injuries, stress and the effects of passive smoking are rated the claims of the future as trade unions find success, if not with judge and jury, then in out-of-court settlements. In the face of such formidable claims attrition, insurers have been led by those reinsurers which remain in the market to increase rates and limit the scope of cover offered businesses. Rate increases of 30 per cent annually are now commonplace and as much as 100 per cent, not unusual. Furthermore, for the first time, industry risk managers approach their EL renewals this year with limits attached to their policies. By law, a company must purchase a minimum of Pounds 2m - but from January 1, 1995, a limit of Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m per policy is likely to be imposed by insurers, instead of the unlimited cover companies have traditionally enjoyed. The situation will be further complicated if the government raises the statutory minimum level of cover, as some observers expect it to soon. But worries in industry run even deeper: 'The limit of indemnity is a red herring really,' says Ray Mattholie, risk manager at telecommunications giant BT and head of the AIRMIC working group into EL. 'There are not so many companies which need to worry about catastrophic exposures. The cap is simply a symptom of the shrinking market for EL cover: there is just no interest in writing new business in the market,' he says. It is this lack of availability, especially to non-manufacturing businesses, which will lead to changes in the way EL protections are organised, according to Mr Mattholie. Fundamental changes to the basis on which cover is underwritten, away from occurrence to claims made, to reduce the 'long tail' of policies, for example, would require a change in the law governing employers' liability. Similarly, companies increasing their retention of exposure could be contravening existing law which stipulates the amount of cover a company must purchase. 'More companies employ alternative risk financing than you might think and it is a nonsense that they have to hide it away,' says Mr Mattholie. 'Some of these companies are more viable than their insurers.' An even more radical solution being proposed by some risk managers is the adoption of a US workers' compensation type of scheme in the UK. In the US, awards are made through a standard 'no-fault' procedure of fixed benefit levels and not through the courts. Premium rating for EL plans have to be approved by the individual states, which are responsible for overseeing their own systems. Eagle Star's Derek Howie, assistant liability manager, is not convinced: 'To follow the American lead would be to introduce an expensive problem for UK industry,' he says, pointing to the difficulties the US system is facing. Mr Howie concedes that the UK Act could be looked at again to accommodate the element of 'self-insurance' which some companies require - the use of large deductibles or a captive, for example - but stresses that the Act is designed to protect employees: 'There is nothing fundamentally wrong with English common law - the present system works well - what is needed is a board-led assault on the appalling accident rate in our companies.' But brokers are bringing some risk engineering to bear on EL problems. Risk sharing is advocated by Ron Hayes, director of international risk management at Bowring Marsh &amp; McLennan, because it encourages insurers to make cover available and without exclusion. Larger clients are increasingly using their captives to insure part of their EL risk, Mr Hayes says. The insurer issues policies providing for full cover but reinsures 'predictable' losses to the company's captive. Even smaller companies should find that taking a sizeable deductible produces savings. Assigning the deductible to operating companies will concentrate managers' minds on properly managing EL risk, Mr Hayes adds. Sedgwick UK has introduced an EL risk auditing service which it says helps reduce incidents and claims. It charges a set fee to analyse previous claims, assess the risks a company is exposed to, design a risk management plan to reduce them and negotiate a premium based on the improved risk exposure. Self-financing deals allow a risk manager to take control of the EL programme but do not always assure great premium savings, warns Sedgwick UK's casualty director James Hopper.</p>

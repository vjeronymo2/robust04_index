			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Letter: Shareholders, management and the need for greater regulation Sir, There is a flaw in the argument of Dr Maurice Gillibrand's letter (March 3) which attacks Sir Owen Green's contribution to the debate at the conference of the National Association of Pension Funds. Dr Gillibrand's thesis is that shareholders should consider themselves the owners of companies, and he cites in evidence 'the unrestrained action of directors in Guinness, Polly Peck and Maxwell Communication'. He overlooks the fact that Messrs Asil Nadir and Robert Maxwell could rely on their power as shareholders, not their power as directors, to have their will of their companies. They were exercising to the extreme the doctrine that shareholders own the business. Sir Owen is quoted as saying that shareholders would be better regarded as freeholder landlords than owners of public companies. Freeholder landlords have the right to ensure the preservation of their property, and leasehold tenants do what they will within this limitation. Similarly, we must surely recognise that shareholders (as well as directors) have limited rights and cannot do what they will with the company. Increased statutory regulation seems to be rejected by Dr Gillibrand, in favour of 'an improved relationship between management and shareholders'. As an ex-member of Robert Maxwell's staff, who feels badly let down by the failure of the law, regulatory bodies and institutions to protect my pension, I do not believe we should wait for such a loosely defined utopia. Shareholders and management are often controlled by the same individuals; in public companies at least their selfish interests must be subject to greater regulation - and urgently.

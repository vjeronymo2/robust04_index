			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Brown's delegation signs China deals A US trade mission to China, headed by Mr Ron Brown, the Commerce Secretary, signed contracts yesterday for almost Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) in power, telecommunications and computer equipment in what US officials say will be part of Dollars 3bn in new deals announced this week. Mr Brown, who has led similar trade campaigns in Latin America and Africa, said his delegation was vying for more than Dollars 25bn in infrastructure, aviation, auto-assembly and airport construction projects in China over the next few years. His entourage includes 24 executives of US companies. 'With almost a quarter of a trillion (thousand billion) dollars in infrastructure projects in the pipeline, we intend to compete in this market and we intend to win,' Mr Brown said in a breakfast speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. During the second day of his week-long visit to China and Hong Kong, Mr Brown raised trade and economic issues with prime minister Li Peng, setting the tone for future relations, a US official said. In a briefing for reporters, the official pledged that the US would become 'increasingly aggressive' in matching concessionary financing to compete with Germany, France and Japan for the booming Chinese market. The delegation includes officials from the US Export-Import Bank, senior trade officials and the US executive director from the Asian Development Bank. Mr Brown had suggested that the mission would herald a 'new era in US-China relations'. Under a contract valued at Dollars 140m and financed primarily with government loans, Westinghouse Corporation will provide two 350-megawatts steam-turbine generators and related equipment for the a power plant in Jiangsu province, in eastern China. Pitney Bowes signed a Dollars 20m agreement to sell equipment for modernising and automating China's network of 55,000 post offices. Pitney Bowes equipment will be distributed by its Chinese partner Zhongyu, a postal code and information company, established under the government's postal system. In a third contract International Business Machines agreed to sell Dollars 20m in software and hardware for automated teller machines, electronic data information and global information infrastructure.</p>

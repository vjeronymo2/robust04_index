			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Channel 5 details VCR retuning fees THE army of video recorder retuners needed to make the Channel 5 commercial television station possible are going to be paid by results - at a basic fee of Pounds 1.50 a home. The details of how Channel Five Holdings, the only bidder for the Channel 5 licence, plans to visit every home in London and then in other cities are spelt out in the full application document, published yesterday. It will be the biggest door-to-door operation since homes were converted to natural gas in the 1960s. The retuning of VCRs and other electronic equipment is necessary because the Channel 5 signal will cause interference. The consortium, led by Thames Television, plans to put more than 2,000 retuners each in charge of 2,000 homes in their area. After training, the contracted workforce will be responsible for retuning as many as possible of their designated homes in a five-month period before Channel 5 transmission begins. In addition to the basic payment of Pounds 1.50 a home, there will be bonuses of 40p if 90 per cent of the work is completed before transmissions begin. After broadcasts have started, bonuses can be earned by the speed of response to complaints of interference. In a field trial in the Harrow area of London, retuning took an average of 10 minutes from arriving on the doorstep. In 10 working days, 61 per cent of the 725 households involved were successfully retuned without any publicity or prearranged appointments. Thorn UK Rentals will be responsible for recruiting and training the main retuning workforce.</p>

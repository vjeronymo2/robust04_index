			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 179(a) sets up two distinct sanction clocks. The Act states that if the State does not correct the deficiency within 18 months after a finding, one of the two available sanctions shall apply, as selected by the Administrator. It then provides that if the deficiency has not been corrected within 6 months thereafter, then both available sanctions shall apply. The EPA interprets this to mean that the second sanction always follows 6 months from the actual application of first, regardless of whether this would cause the application of the second sanction to be delayed beyond 24 months from the date of the finding. Therefore, on September 6, 1994 the offset sanction shall apply on any area(s) for which an 18-month sanction clock has elapsed and EPA has not determined that the State has not corrected the deficiency. Both sanctions shall then apply 6 months from that date if EPA has not determined the deficiency has been corrected by then.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA intends to notify States of the application and removal of section 179 mandatory sanctions (as provided for in &sect;52.31(d) of this rule) before they apply. In addition, in its actions on submittals received after a section 179(a) finding, EPA will indicate what the effect of its action is on the sanctions clock and sanctions application. The following discussion explains how this will occur, first providing the examples where, prior to 18 months, EPA finally determines whether the State has corrected the deficiency prompting the finding, and then providing examples where EPA finally determines the deficiency has been corrected after month 18.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the cases where, prior to 18 months, EPA completes its action determining that the State has corrected the section 179(a) deficiency, sanctions would not apply. The following two examples address instances in which EPA finally determines within 18 months of the finding that started the sanctions clock whether the State has corrected the deficiency and how EPA's action finding the State corrected the deficiency affects the sanction clock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case where, within 18 months following a finding of nonsubmittal or incompleteness, EPA determines whether a State's SIP submittal corrects the deficiency prompting the finding (i.e., is complete or incomplete), EPA will inform the State of whether the sanctions clock is stopped when it sends the completeness or incompleteness letter to the State. If the SIP submittal is incomplete, then the letter will indicate that the sanctions clock continues and that automatic sanctions will apply as prescribed by this rule. If the SIP submittal is complete, then the letter will indicate that the sanctions clock started by the prior finding of failure to submit or incompleteness permanently stops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case where, within 18 months following a SIP disapproval or finding of nonimplementation, EPA determines whether the State has corrected the deficiency prompting the finding (i.e., whether the SIP is approvable or whether the nonimplementation deficiency has been corrected), EPA will indicate whether the sanctions clock is stopped when it takes final rulemaking action on the SIP. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If EPA finally disapproves the SIP or finally determines that the nonimplementation deficiency has not been corrected, then the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  action will indicate that the sanctions clock continues and that automatic sanctions will apply as prescribed by this rule. If EPA finally approves the SIP or finally determines that the nonimplementation deficiency has been corrected, then the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  action will indicate that the sanctions clock started by the prior disapproval or finding of nonimplementation permanently stops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above in section II.B.1., proposed approval (or a proposal that the nonimplementation deficiency had been corrected) following a SIP disapproval or nonimplementation finding has the effect of deferring and/or staying the application of sanctions. In this case, though, such proposal action would not have a deferral and/or staying effect because it is assumed (for the purposes of this example) that EPA completes final rulemaking action on the SIP within 18 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following examples address how, following the section 179(a) findings, the States will be kept informed when EPA's actions on revised SIP's are not completed within 18 months of the finding's deficiency. As provided in this rule at &sect;52.31(d)(1) through (4), in explaining how the States will be kept informed, these examples address sanction removal, as well as sanction deferral and staying.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Vodafone The sound of chirruping cellular phones is a sure if irritating sign of economic spring, and Vodafone's most recent connection figures seem to confirm that winter is over. New subscribers have been joining the network at an accelerating rate, both to the new Low Call tariff structure and at the traditional business rates. The low rate of migration from business to Low Call is also encouraging. Some 30-40 per cent of its customers would be better off on Low Call: less than 10 per cent have transferred. That lack of price sensitivity could be important as the market becomes more competitive. Mercury is about to launch its mass market mobile system within the M25 at prices significantly below the existing cellular operators. Tactically it makes sense for Vodafone to cede market share to the new entrant until it has much wider coverage. If Low Call is any guide, the erosion may be slow, so Vodafone's high margins may survive for some time. Market growth from economic recovery may also help keep earnings moving. For longer-term protection Vodafone has been reinvesting its surplus cash flow in overseas licences. The key to profits in all these markets, however, will be the rate at which the price of technology - and hence capital expenditure on new networks - falls, balanced against restrictions on new entrants and the conservatism of consumers. Vodafone is winning the short-term battle with consumers. Whether that will be enough to prevent the kind of carnage collapsing prices have caused in the personal computer market remains to be seen.</p>

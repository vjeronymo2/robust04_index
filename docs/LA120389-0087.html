			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> IS WORLD READY FOR GERMANY?  </P> <P> The cautious chancellor of West Germany, Helmut Kohl, has just caught his  countrymen by surprise with an uncharacteristically bold proposal:  Reunification, by-the-numbers -- 10 points that will give us one Germany, one  more time.  </P> <P> And now we know for sure that what just months ago was unthinkable is now  unstoppable.  </P> <P> America's conservatives love it -- after all, anything that hurts Soviet  communism has got to be good. Patrick Buchanan, my frequent sparring colleague  on Cable News Network, champions reunification, asking: "What precisely are we  afraid of? . . . Was not a free, united Germany what we fought for in World War  II?"  </P> <P> Not the way I recall it. And not the way many sincere Germans recall it. They,  too, understand the lessons of the history they've either lived or read. And  they, too, seem concerned that a significant minority of their countrymen  hasn't learned this lesson and perhaps never will. They were troubled by the  results of a survey of 2,200 Germans published in Der Spiegel magazine last  April. Asked to rate Adolf Hitler on a numerical scale (ranging from very  negative to neutral to very positive), a frightening 26% replied that they were  neutral or positive about Der Fuhrer. And 43% answered there was both "good and  bad" to say about the Nazis.  </P> <P> No wonder that, in the same survey, 44% of Germans said they didn't favor  reunification -- it would mean one nation of 78 million Germans with one army  650,000 strong. History, a discipline that may have eluded Pat Buchanan, is  clearly on the minds of Germans these days.  </P></p>

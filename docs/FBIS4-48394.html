			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Ministers met today to examine  economic issues, within the framework of the economic and social  program. The meeting, chaired by President of the Republic Jose  Eduardo dos Santos, approved all examined documents on economic  issues.    The documents, which were approved with amendments, include  the revision of economic legislation, which is viewed as a  priority in the readjustment of the government's economic  program. The Council of Ministers also examined the law on  foreign investment, which aims at creating incentives to attract  foreign capital. It also examined the privatization law and the  public investment program. What does the government intend to  achieve with all these documents, which are to be submitted to  the National Assembly? Sabino Ferraz, Council of Ministers  deputy secretary explains:    [Begin recording] [Ferraz] The government intends to achieve  different objectives depending on the law in question. For  example, the law on public and private sectors is aimed at  broadening participation of the private sector in the national  economic activity. The law on foreign investment is aimed at  improving the foreign investment code to attract foreign capital  to Angola. The law on privatization is aimed at increasing  private investment in national economic activity. It is also  aimed at increasing the participation of private agents in  economic activity, thus reducing state participation. It is  therefore important to note that all legal privatization carried  out so far will be respected.    [Unidentified reporter] Are these incentives valid during  this period of war or after the war?    [Ferraz] Well, we have to think about the present moment,  the  present situation of war we are experiencing. After the war, we  can think about other kinds of incentives. The draft law takes  this into account. [end recording]</p>

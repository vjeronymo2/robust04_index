			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wajih Abu-Dhikri: "Regarding the Arab Boycott: </F> U.S. Commerce Secretary Puts the Cart Before the Horse"]    [Text] In his important interview with senior writer Sa'id  Sunbul, U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown discussed the Arab  boycott [of Israel]. He said: We in the United States are  against the policy of boycott in general. It is part of my  responsibility during this tour to call for an end to this type  of boycott, which has harmed U.S. companies. During my visit, I  have sensed many positive signs for now, he added. The U.S.  secretary gave several examples of Arab-Israeli cooperation. He  noted that he had obtained a promise from Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to refer the issue of ending  the boycott to the Arab foreign ministers!    The U.S. secretary, as I understand from his important  interview with Sunbul, has come to the region to terminate the  Arab boycott of Israel. I know he may achieve some progress  toward this "termination," but he needs to answer an important  question: Do we end the boycott before or after a comprehensive  peace? Lifting the boycott before peace is achieved deprives  the Arabs of one of the important elements of pressure backing  up the Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese negotiators. Thus, the  U.S. secretary is putting the cart before the horse.    I know the decisions of the boycott bureau in Damascus are  not honored by most Arab states because they are not based on  logical foundations. I also know that some Arab states have  turned a blind eye to the boycott of Israel and started making  deals, albeit secretly, with it. I know that Israel's exports  to the Arab countries are rising and that more Arab delegations  have been visiting Israel, both openly and in secret, following  the Gaza-Jericho Agreement. But the boycott was one of the  weapons used by the Arab negotiators in the battle for peace. I  appeal to the Arab League secretary general to restate the Arab  League Council's decision that the boycott must not be lifted  before a comprehensive peace is achieved.    Regarding the Middle East market, the U.S. secretary said  that some believe this market is an "Israeli-U.S conspiracy" the  purpose of which is to swallow Arab markets. The secretary  added: Certainly, the long years of tension and hostility have  created mistrust, resulting in several conspiracy theories that  have no foundation. He added: The motives of these theories  could be understood, but there is no conspiracy!    In response to the U.S. secretary's remarks, I repeat what  Israel has stated more than once regarding its views on this  market:    1. The Suez Canal could be canceled out by building a  "competitive" canal from Elat on the Gulf of Aqabah to the  Mediterranean.    2. A pipeline could be built to convey Arab oil from its  sources in the Gulf to an Israeli port, thus harming both Egypt  and Syria [who have similar pipelines].    3. A phosphate industry in cooperation with Egypt could be  established, undermining industry in Jordan.    There must be more, Mr. Secretary, that has not been  declared! The strange thing about Israel's views on the Middle  East market is that they seek to set up alternative industries  to those in Arab states, which are of the utmost importance to  these countries. For example, Israel is thinking of building an  alternative to the Suez Canal, Sumed [Suez-Mediterranean  Pipeline], and the Egyptian and Jordanian phosphate industries.  Even in space, Israel fought Egypt so that it would have no  place [in satellite transmission].    So, Israeli thinking, at least on the Middle East market, is  conspiratorial, despite what U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald  Brown has stated.</p>

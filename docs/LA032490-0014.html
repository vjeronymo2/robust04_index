			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> S&amp;L Cuts Capital Needs: Glenfed Inc., the parent of Glendale Federal Bank,  said it improved its capital position by paying another party to cover  potential losses on $1 billion worth of home loans that it sold to investors.  </P> <P> As a result of the move, Glenfed said it now needs about $24 million less  capital to meet tougher new federal standards for S&amp;Ls. The capital  standards are designed to force S&amp;Ls to have a cushion against losses.  Glenfed declined to reveal the terms of the deal or name the other party.  Glenfed had assets of $25.26 billion as of Dec. 31.  </P></p>

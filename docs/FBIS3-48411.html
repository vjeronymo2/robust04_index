Prime Minister Mahathir offered to share  Malaysia's experience in privatization to assist Albania in  developing its free trade zone. Albania has also embarked on a  privitization program of its state-owned enterprises.    According to Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi,  during the two-hour meeting at the Prime Minister's Department,  President Berisha extended an invitation to Defense Minister  Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak to visit Albania. The aim is to let  him study the possibility of promoting bilateral defense  cooperation.    Responding to a newsmen's question on whether or not  Malaysia  will use Albania as a gateway for exports of its goods to other  parts of Europe, Datuk Abdullah said:    [Begin Abdullah Ahmad Badawi recording] First, we must study  in detail the taxation system in that country and if we think  that it is suitable and can serve our purposes, perhaps we can  use Albania as a gateway for our goods to enter the European  markets. [end recording]    In another development, Malaysia and Albania today signed  five agreements to promote closer ties between the two  countries. The agreements include trade cooperation; investment  guarantees; avoidance of double taxation; and cooperation on  economy, science, and technology. The signing ceremony was  witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir and the  Albanian president, Dr. Sali Berisha, who is on a four-day visit  to Malaysia.</p>

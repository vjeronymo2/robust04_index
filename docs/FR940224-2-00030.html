			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today the Navy faces the necessity of downsizing the fleet to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent that was not envisioned before the end of the Cold War.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the next few years a number of major surface combatants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including nuclear powered cruisers, will be removed from service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some LOS ANGELES Class submarines are scheduled for removal from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service. Eventually, the Navy will also need to decommission OHIO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class submarines. These classes of nuclear powered ships were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in the 1984 Environmental Impact Statement. The total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of cruiser, OHIO, and LOS ANGELES Class reactor compartments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is approximately 100. The purpose of this Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statement will be to assess the potential environmental impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposing of defueled reactor compartments from nuclear powered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cruisers and the LOS ANGELES and OHIO Class submarines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Description of Alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Preferred Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the common design characteristics of the reactor plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and their reactor compartments, the method currently being used by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington to dispose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submarine reactor compartments is the preferred alternative for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal of the defueled cruiser, OHIO and LOS ANGELES Class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor plants. Briefly, this alternative would involve draining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the piping systems, tanks, vessels, and other components to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum extent practical, sealing the radioactive systems, removing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reactor compartment and sealing it to provide a high integrity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> welded steel package, and transporting the package first by barge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up the Columbia River and then a short distance over land to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Energy's low level radioactive waste burial grounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at Hanford, Washington. The reactor compartment packages would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed in a trench, backfilled with earth, and covered by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engineered cap to minimize future water infiltration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

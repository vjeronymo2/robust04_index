			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: WEDDING BELLS  </P> <P> Sajak Buys W-E-D: The host of "Wheel of Fortune" and CBS's late-night talk show  has a new role: husband.  </P> <P> Pat Sajak, 42, married Lesly Brown, 24, in a private service late on New Year's  Eve in Annapolis, Md. The Baltimore Sun reports the newlyweds ducked in a side  door of St. Mary's Catholic Church to avoid about two dozen onlookers, and --  after a service featuring a 25-piece orchestra -- left with similar stealth.  Sajak fans waiting in the rain outside the church were mollified, however, by a  glimpse of Vanna White, Sajak's "Wheel of Fortune" co-star. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

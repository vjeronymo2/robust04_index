			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (18): High hopes for Budget relief - The campaign to abolish Special Car Tax THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on car prices, which has just been published, did not consider in fine detail justification for the Special Car Tax (SCT), a tax which adds the nominal 10 per cent to new car prices, plus VAT at 17.5 per cent. The motor industry has long been campaigning for the abolition of the SCT, arguing that a reduction in showroom prices by nearly 12 per cent would cause a beneficial chain reaction - it would boost demand which, in turn, would boost British industry, generate jobs and perhaps even result in a stronger indigenous motor industry which could then bolster the country's balance of payments by increasing exports. For years successive chancellors have ignored the motor industry's pleas. Yet now there is a real possibility that the SCT may go. The government, shocked by the detrimental effects of recent budgets on the motor industry - sales of new cars in 1991 were down 20 per cent to the lowest level for nine years - is listening with a keener ear than ever before to industry. Treasury Minister Gillian Shephard, for example, has held two meetings with senior motor industry executives in the past month and has pledged that 'very careful consideration' would be given to their views. Sir Hal Miller, director of the SMMT who was present at those meetings, said of Special Car Tax: 'We have been asking for its removal for the past three or four years. The car is the only comparable product that is burdened with this extra 10 per cent tax and its removal would certainly give the industry a much-needed boost.' The SMMT claims that elimination of the SCT and a shift of taxation from the owner to the user of the car by increasing the duty on petrol, would result in a rise of only 15 pence a gallon. And should the increase be phased in over two successive budgets, the burden to the motorist would hardly be noticed, given the volatility of fuel prices. Simon Foster, managing director of Toyota (GB), also argues strongly for the removal of SCT, pointing out that for importers from outside the EC the total tax burden is even worse. Imports from Japan and the US attract 10 per cent tax on their landed value, then SCT is imposed, and then VAT on top of all that. 'It comes out at around 34 per cent, which is a staggering level of tax to pay on any product,' he said. He also made the point that at a time when governments were supposedly encouraging consumers to choose greener products, and manufacturers to offer more environmentally-sound cars fitted with high-cost catalytic converters, electronic management systems and the like, it makes no sense for the UK government to push those products outside many people's price range. He estimates that removal of SCT would not only increase the new car market by between 5 and 10 per cent 'which would be of enormous benefit to the industry', but would also encourage more motorists to buy newer, more fuel-efficient and cleaner cars. However, a strong word of caution comes from Roger Macey, chairman of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA). Though like others in the motor industry he wants to see SCT removed, he insists that it must be done on a phased basis. He estimates that if new car prices come down by some 12 per cent then overnight Pounds 1bn will be wiped off the residual values of Britain's used cars - disastrous not only for the leading leasing and rental companies who would see their inventory values slashed, but also for private companies running their own fleets. 'These dramatic losses would undoubtedly drive many companies out of business and the knock-on effect on the rest of the motor industry would be enormous. Quite apart from anything else, with tens, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of cars controlled by receivers, a period of great disruption would follow,' he said. 'While the long-term benefit of the removal of Special Car Tax is in everybody's interest, it has to be phased out gradually.'</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Japan's hard choices The foreign exchange markets seem to have decided that the forthcoming G7 meeting will push for a further appreciation of the yen. In part, that follows from weekend comments by the US treasury secretary, Lloyd Bentsen. But it also seems to fit with wider concerns about the size of Japan's trade surplus. Most G7 members - including apparently the Japanese - think a higher yen is the best way naturally to curb Japanese exports and promote imports. It is by no means certain, however, that G7 members are really prepared to take the necessary action to force the yen higher. It is inconceivable, for example, that the Bank of Japan will increase official interest rates so soon after lowering them. Further fiscal packages to stimulate the economy are more likely, but their timing and size are unclear. Fear of higher budget deficits within the Ministry of Finance may limit the scope of tax cuts and even a substantial fiscal loosening may not be enough to stop scared Japanese salarymen squirreling money away. On the other side, the Bundesbank, having resisted French calls for lower rates for so long, is unlikely to give in to Japanese blandishments. Mr Alan Greenspan also has his own domestic agenda which may not include lower interest rates in the near term. Besides, it is far from clear that the Japanese economy is in any fit state to take the pain which its exporting manufacturers would suffer. With the hole in balance sheets large and earnings already low, the stock market would look even more vulnerable. Given that the likely alternative is the threat of trade sanctions, the Japanese financial system is in a tough spot.</p>

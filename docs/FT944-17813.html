			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Storehouse Retailers' share prices have fallen back sharply in the past few weeks, primarily in response to higher UK interest rates. But the outlook is not wholly dismal, especially for those companies still with scope for restructuring. Next and Sears have both recently reported strong interim profits growth. Yesterday Storehouse gave a highly positive trading statement. Storehouse detailed plans for increases in selling space at Bhs, hinted at large benefits to be extracted from the re-engineering of the supply chain, and signalled a sharp increase in capital expenditure. It also said that sales growth would reach an annual rate of 7 per cent for the first half, up from 5 per cent in the first quarter. Even if the sales growth was to some extent triggered by aggressive advertising, the City was impressed and the shares rose against the market. There is much to be impressed about. Storehouse's strategy looks correct; its concentration on Bhs and Mothercare leaves the group well-focused. The earnings recovery is in full swing. Operating margins at Bhs seem set to rise from 3.5 per cent in 1993 to around 10 per cent next year. There is also scope for rolling-out the revamped Bhs formula further. The danger is that management may fall into the retailing trap of over-zealous expansion. The shares are rated in line with the retail sector, if Marks &amp; Spencer is excluded. That is high enough till it becomes clear whether Storehouse can sustain its success.</p>

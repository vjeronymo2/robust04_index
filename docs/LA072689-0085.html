			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY PICKED IN TRIAL OF ALLEGED DRUG KINGPIN  </P> <P> Amid unusually heavy security in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, seven men  and five women were selected Tuesday as jurors in the trial of Juan Ramon Matta  Ballesteros, a 44-year-old Honduran accused of running a massive cocaine ring.  </P> <P> Judge Pamela A. Rymer scheduled opening arguments for Thursday morning in the  trial, expected to last a month.  </P> <P> Matta, a reputed billionaire, was accused in a 1985 indictment with heading a  cocaine trafficking organization that, in one seven-month period alone, moved  into the United States about 1,000 kilograms of cocaine, valued at $70 million.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors Jimmy Gurule and Manuel Medrano's contention that Matta  controlled the operation is based on ledgers that were seized at the Oakwood  Garden apartment complex in Van Nuys on Sept. 21, 1981.  </P> <P> According to the indictment, 114 pounds of cocaine and $1.9 million in cash  were seized. At the time, this was the largest seizure of cocaine and cash in  California history.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Indictment  </P> <P> Matta also stands accused in a second federal indictment of directing a  multimillion-dollar drug importation and distribution network headquartered in  Colombia that was responsible for importing hundreds of kilograms of cocaine  into the United States between 1983 and 1985.  </P> <P> It is anticipated that a trial on those charges will be held later this year or  next year.  </P> <P> People seeking to enter Rymer's courtroom Tuesday had to pass through a  specially installed metal detector, in addition to the one that all those  entering the federal courthouse must go through. Additionally, armed deputy  U.S. marshals have been present the last two days in anticipation of the trial.  </P> <P> Wearing a brown suit and a red necktie, Matta sat quietly next to an  interpreter while jurors were being chosen by the prosecutors and his defense  attorney, Martin Stolar of New York City.  </P> <P> Matta was arrested aboard a U.S.-bound plane in April, 1988, after he was  whisked out of his native country and taken to the Dominican Republic by  Honduran officials, who had been prodded by the U.S. government for assistance  on the case for more than a year. The arrest precipitated several days of  rioting and demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy in Honduras, which has  a clause in its constitution prohibiting extradition of its citizens.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Escape From U.S. Prison  </P> <P> Federal marshals said the basis of its jurisdiction over Matta was a warrant  for his escape from Eglin Federal Prison Camp in Florida in 1971, where he had  been held on charges of entering this country on a false passport.  </P> <P> The arrest came only one day after Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) had criticized  the approach of Honduran officials to drug problems, asserting that Matta was  living in luxury there while there were multiple charges pending against him in  this country.  </P> <P> Matta had been living in Honduras for two years after escaping from a prison  hospital in Colombia, where he was being held on drug charges. He has been  described as one of the most important links between Colombia's Medellin cartel  and Mexican smugglers who transport drugs into the United States.  </P></p>

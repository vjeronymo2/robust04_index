Have the US, Germany, Switzerland and many other  countries unnecessarily forced changes on their industries and  consumers in the name of ecology? Yes, according to the  Phosphate Report [note] published today by Landbank, an  environmental consultancy.    The report is a life-cycle study which examines the  environmental impact of two kinds of detergents, phosphate-based  and zeolite-based. Such studies try to take into account every  aspect of the production and use of a product from raw material  extraction to waste disposal.    Phosphates have been blamed for high levels of nutrients in  rivers and lakes that lead to the dominance of algae over other  life forms. Many countries have banned detergent phosphates as  a result and encouraged a switch to zeolites.    But the report concludes that there is virtually no  difference between the environmental effect of the two types of  detergent, if all aspects of production and consumption are  taken into account.    It is a conclusion that might have been expected, given that  the report was sponsored by UK phosphate manufacturer Albright  and Wilson, owned by the Tenneco industrial group of the U.S.    But the two authors insist that they have been independent  and objective. Their credentials help: one is Bryn Jones, once  director of lobby group Greenpeace, the other is Bob Wilson,  formerly a senior lecturer in statistics.    They also claim that their report breaks new ground in thc  controversial area of life-cycle analysis, a technique notorious  for producing disagreements among experts.    They pin their hopes on the Delphi Technique to iron out  these differences. This method requires a panel of experts to  give their views by completing an anonymous questionnaire. The  results are summarised and fed back to the panel.    The panel members are invited to reconsider their position,  or give arguments about why they are right. These arguments are  then distributed to the panel again. The process remains  anonymous and can be repeated until a consensus is achieved or  irreconcilable positions established.    For the Phosphate Report, the panel assessed the  environmental impact of 39 products generated by the likes of  phosphate mining, road transport of materials and electricity  generation for manufacturing plants.    Each expert gave a score for the environmental impact of  each  pollutant generated during the life cycle of the two types of  detergent.    When the scores were added up, phosphate detergents scored  107 environmental impact points, and zeolite detergents 110  points. Jones gives the error as 10 per cent.    This alone should bolster the case against banning  phosphates  but the report is not finished yet. In its final section, the  authors argue that it is much easier to take phosphates than  zeolites out of waste water.    Sweden already strips phosphates out of waste water and has  banned advertisements that claim that zeolites are greener.    There are signs of a rethink in Switzerland, where detergent  phosphates were banned in 1986 and phosphate-stripping plants  built to protect lakes. The report quotes Ulrich Zimmerman,  head of water quality for the Zurich Water Authority, calling  for the ban on detergent phosphates to be revoked on the grounds  that it has failed to improve water quality.    The report concludes with several recommendations ranging  from a call for zeolite detergent manufacturers to abandon  eco-friendly labels to a suggestion that wind power be used to  supplement electricity supplies at Albright and Wilson's  phosphate plant on the Cumbrian coast.    Of at least as much interest to consumers is the finding  that  phosphates are better cleansers: almost 1.5 times as much  zeolite detergent is needed to produce the same cleaning effect.    Swiss consumers have discovered this already. Their  increased consumption of zeolite detergents, specialist stain  removers and water softening machines may have been behind a  rise in foaming at water treatment works, the report claims.

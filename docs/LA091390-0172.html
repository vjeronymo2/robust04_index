			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BITES  </P> <P> The following are capsule reviews of some of the better restaurants recently  visited by our critics:  </P> <P> The Sportsman Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge is a throwback to the 1950s and  '60s when it was one of the "special occasion" restaurants in Ventura. Although  its prices might have changed with the times, the quality of its steaks and  chops has not. The Sportsman is at 50 S. California St., Ventura, 643-2851.  Open 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Monday-Friday, 11 a.m.-11 p.m. Saturday, 9 a.m.-2 p.m. for  breakfast and lunch on Sunday, 5 p.m.-10 p.m. for dinner. Lunch for two, food  only, $12-$20. Dinner for two, food only, $25-$46.  </P> <P> The owners of Jag's India House call their Northern Indian cooking "royal Mogul  cuisine." The hot fresh breads alone are worth the trip to the restaurant.  There are dozens of versions of curries, from a fabulous shrimp masala to a  lamb rogan josh. Jag's India House, 860 Hampshire, Suite U, Westlake Village,  (805) 373-6266. Lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday-Friday; dinner 5:30-10  p.m. Tuesday-Sunday. Wine and Beer. Parking lot. MasterCard and Visa. Dinner  for two, food only, $30-$50.  </P> <P> MK's is hot and cold. Hot in that it's frequently packed, cool as an oasis on a  summer afternoon. Some dishes are very, very good, notably the seafood Vera  Cruz and the "grazing platter" of grilled vegetables, grains, soft cheese,  chutney and salsa. The bread is great, and when it is dessert time you'll go  far before finding a better apricot cobbler. MK's is at 139 Ojai Ave., Ojai,  640-8001. Breakfast 8-11 a.m. Monday, Wednesday-Friday; until noon  Saturday-Sunday. Lunch 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday-Friday; noon-2:30  p.m. Saturday-Sunday. Dinner 5-10 p.m. Wednesday-Monday. Meal for two, food  only, $26-$58.  </P> <P> Downey's is expensive, and sometimes it's worth it. The duck, no matter how  prepared, is excellent. Add some of Downey's outstanding appetizers, such as  the grilled squab, and flawless desserts, the Belgian chocolate marquis, for  example, and you'll avoid the pitfalls -- overcooked fish and undistinguished  beef and lamb dishes. Downey's is at 1305 State St., Santa Barbara, (805)  966-5006. Dinner Tuesday to Sunday from 5:3O p.m. Dinner for two, food only,  $65 to $80.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Roman Herzog by Branka </F> Trivic in Karlsruhe on 21 May: "The Nation Is Something Else,  Though"]    [Text] The election of the German president cost the  taxpayers in Germany 2.5 million German marks (per diem  payments, travel expenses, accommodation etc.), but in spite of  that German citizens did not get the president they wanted: Mr.  Johannes Rau, the Social Democratic Party candidate. According  to the latest opinion poll carried out by DER SPIEGEL magazine,  Rau was supported by 54 percent of poll repondents, and Herzog  by only 20 percent.    This was the price paid for the indirect presidential  election, sanctioned by the German Basic Law of 1949. This  solution was chosen because of the negative experience with the  Weimar Republic, when Paul von Hindenburg, who was elected  president by a plebiscite, made use of his right and appointed  Adolf Hitler chancellor, thus legalizing the rise of National  Socialism. Anxious because of this experience, the authors of  the present constitution decided that all future presidents be  elected by the indirect method. On behalf of the German  population of 80-million, the German president was elected by  1324 delegates on 23 May 1994. Half of them were Bundestag  members, and the other half were delegates from the 16 regional  parliaments and independent representatives from public and  cultural life.    Roman Herzog, the 60-year-old president of the Federal  Constitutional Court, was elected by simple majority after a  seven-hour voting procedure, since he failed to achieve the  absolute majority in the first two election rounds. He obtained  696 votes, which was more than his rival Johannes Rau, who  obtained 605 votes. It was necessary that he obtain at least  eight votes more than 663 in order not to depend on the votes by  rightist radical party members (Republican Party). The new  German president won the election owing to the liberal party  (FDP [Free Democratic Party]), which, as it was predicted,  decided to support the Christian Democrat candidate in the third  election round, thus confirming its decision to remain in the  ruling coalition. The interview with the first president of the  united Germany was held in Karlsruhe, two days before the  election meeting [21 May 1994]. Roman Herzog was relaxed and  said with self-irony that he would have to write a speech the  following day just in case the worse thing happened -- if he was  elected president. Taking "this worst possibility" as probable  we asked Mr. Herzog the first question.    [Trivic] How does a man who will replace the already  legendary Richard von Weizsaecker feel?    [Herzog] I have to tell you that it is exceptionally  difficult to replace such a personality as Mr. Richard von  Weizsaecker. It is hard to believe than anyone could be as  successful as Mr. von Weizsaecker, let alone be better. For  this reason, it is a big challenge, too. I cooperated with Mr.  von Weizsaecker for a long time and I can say that there will be  no significant differences between us, as far as both domestic  and foreign affairs are concerned. There will be no change in  this respect.  <H5>  The Term of Office of the "Republicanized Monarch" </H5>   [Trivic] What will be the main tasks of the new president?    [Herzog] He has to contribute to the new political  constellation in Europe and in the world, which we have had for  several years already. Germany, and not only Germany, but the  whole of Europe has not yet processed the collapse of the Soviet  Union and the Warsaw bloc. Until several years ago everybody  thought in terms of two political blocs, in terms of a ping-pong  play between these two blocs, these two hemispheres. Now, we  must establish direct contacts with the newly established  countries in Central and East Europe. This requires from us in  Germany to develop a new foreign policy culture. The president  will have to make a considerable contribution to these issues.  One of the main functions of the president will be to make  centrifugal forces, which traditionally belong to a pluralistic  and democratic society, less powerful than centripetal. The  Bundestag should remain the center of various social and  political interests, but at the same time there must be  organizations and institutions which will enable a minimum of  unity. These institutions are the president of the republic and  the Constitutional Court.    The president has had more responsibility since Germany  became united; he has had to influence the feeling of solidarity  in western Germany because the eastern part of the country has  to develop. The president must explain to the citizens in the  western part that it was only historical circumstances which  affected the development of the eastern part of Germany, for  which reason they need help now. We should not treat them as a  burden, which happens sometimes.    [Trivic] The powers of the German president are not large.    [Herzog] This is true. If we wanted to broaden them, the  constitution should be changed.    [Trivic] Do you think that the indirect election method is  democratic enough?    [Herzog] If you want a powerful presidential function, as is  the case in the United States or in France, for example, the  president should be elected according to the direct electoral  method. If you, on the other hand, want a weak presidential  function, as is the case in Germany, there is no reason why he  should not be elected indirectly. The Italian or German  president is something like a "republicanized monarch," with a  limited term of office, of course.  <H5>  Adenauer's Children's Loyalty </H5>   [Trivic] Some European countries are afraid of the new,  united Germany. Are these fears irrational?    [Herzog] Yes, this can be heard very often, but I have heard  other things, too, such as expectations from East and Central  Europe -- which are, admittedly, expressed with much caution --  that Germany should solve all their problems. There is a  tendency in East European countries to become closer to Germany,  even to the extent that they give the impression of an area of  German hegemony. One of the German foreign policy tasks has been  and will be to avoid such a development. It must be pointed out  that Germany alone cannot finance the reconstruction of Central  and East Europe, because it has its own eastern part. It is  only natural that help must be offered to East Europe, but this  must be done on the European level. England and France, West  Europe in general, must create a bridge toward Central and East  Europe in order to support economic reforms and growth. Germany  must not express any hegemonistic tendencies toward this area;  what is more, it must not allow such an impression to be created  anywhere, because this would spoil the relations Germany has  been creating in Europe for over 40 years. We must always  remember that relations between Germany and France have been  normal for only 40 years now, and that it is a real wonder of  this century that the almost archetypal animosity between these  two countries was overcome. This must not be put at stake. I  believe in the future Germany integrated into Europe. If this  has functioned for the past 40 years, why should it not function  also in the future?    [Trivic] There are people who claim, however, that Helmut  Kohl is the last German chancellor of European orientation, that  all of his followers will choose a strictly national platform.  What do you think about this?    [Herzog] I do not agree with such statements. Adenauer's  children and grandchildren remained loyal to his political  vision. I think that also his great-grandchildren will persevere  on that road. Adenauer's ideas have to be repeated and proven  again and again, though.    [Trivic] Many people warn of an increasingly stronger  neo-Nazi movement and rightist extremism.    [Herzog] This requires a very careful analysis.  Representatives of rightist extremism, predominantly Nazis of  old attitudes, were excluded from the public political scene a  long time ago. In the meantime new generations have appeared.  After half a century the taboo against National Socialism and  its stigmatization have weakened so that there are certain  groups of young people with such ideas, who have now appeared on  the political scene. They make public appearances and this  creates the impression that they are very powerful. I think,  however, that this is only the matter of an improved acoustics,  if I may say so. I do not agree with the statement that this is  a significant shift of political powers in Germany toward the  political right. The problem lies in several "dreamers" who  would like to return Germany to Bismarck's politics. As far as  criminals and terrorists who kill people, burn houses, and  attack asylum-seekers are concerned, we have to be merciless;  all means allowed in a constitutional state must be applied.    [Trivic] You once said that the opinion that all Germans are  of the same blood is a historical error. How do you define the  German nation?    [Herzog] It is an old question how to define a nation.  There is one nation in Europe which has had the fewest problems  with this issue -- the French. They had first created their  state so that their nation could develop within its borders.  The German national consciousness was created as late as in  early 19th century. A German state had not existed at that  time. A nation is naturally defined by the element of a common  language, but Switzerland is proof that this criterion does not  have to be fulfilled. There are elements of common history and  tradition, but Germany is proof that neither these elements have  to be fulfilled. Beginning with the Reformation, the German  population proved its nationality through mutual wars. A common  origin as an element of the nation cannot be overvalued, either.  If you look at the roots of all Germanic peoples, you will see  that one third of them are "germanized" Celts, and that one  fourth, and perhaps more, have Slavic roots. The feeling that  you belong to one nation does not necessarily have something to  do with the same origin and the same blood. I am really not  fond of these criteria. It is neither true that all members of  a nation must have the same mental characteristics. There is the  prejudice in Germany, too, that all German people have to think  and feel in the same way, which is absurd since they have never  been equalized. Different geographic origins which enable  different influences have, for example, determined that a German  from the province of North Rhine-Westphalia is influenced by  France, someone from Hamburg by Scandinavia and England, and a  Bavarian by Italy, Austria, and the European East. This has  caused many difficulties throughout history, but I see these  differences as a big chance.    The things which are now going on in Central and  southeastern Europe, the discovery of major problems, such as  "Who am I and where do I come from?" etc., and the fall into  categories inappropriate to our time sound really threatening  after having known the tradition of internationalism for several  decades. It is difficult to speak about the notion of state  sovereignty in a classical way in a modern, integrated, and  interdependent world. That is why I think that it will take a  long time to solve these problems.  <H5>  Living With a "Surplus of Sensitivity" </H5>   [Trivic] Do you think that Germany, because of its neo-Nazi  and extremist groups, makes a worse impression abroad than  France, for example, although there are nationalist and  extremist provocations there, too?    [Herzog] This is understandable. The horror caused by the  Nazi regime cannot be forgotten within one generation only. I  have much understanding for the bad impression Germany makes  abroad, but I think that these things will be sorted out, too.  When there are provocations by rightist extremists in France,  they are not connected to the Holocaust of 6 million Jews. We  have to live with our past, although our children have no  responsibility for it. I was 11 at the end of war. My children  cannot be blamed for something which happened 50 years ago, but  the German people have to learn how to live with this "surplus  of sensitivity" toward them. This is perhaps good for our own  "political hygiene." It can always be claimed that the Nazi  catastrophe could have happened in some other country, too, but  there is a significant difference -- this happened to us, and  not to somebody else.    [Trivic] How would you comment on the Balkan crisis and the  role of Germany there?    [Herzog] Unfortunately, I still cannot see a reasonable  solution to the Balkan crisis. I think that a joint NATO and UN  military intervention would only make things worse.    I would not like to see German troops in the Balkans because  of the negative historical mortgage we have in that area. As  far as the position of Germany within NATO and its role in the  Balkan crisis are concerned, this is a very contradictory issue.  On the one hand, there is understanding for German restraint  from participation in an intervention, but Germany is, on the  other hand, reproached for not fulfilling its obligations like  other NATO members must fulfill them. It is even reproached for  enjoying certain privileges. I hope that a political solution  will be found, although the fact that it has not been found yet  casts a shadow on that hope.</p>

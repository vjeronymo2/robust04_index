			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Act fast or miss the BES Investors still choosing between business expansion schemes should be wary of being caught by the end-December deadline. The Inland Revenue says that for an investment to qualify for tax relief, the shareholding must be entered on the company's register of members on or before December 31. Investors who leave things to the last minute will depend on the efficiency of the sponsors to ensure this is done. But since the amount raised has accelerated in the past week, it suggests there are still many investors. Industry analyst BESt Investment said Pounds 70m was raised last week and Pounds 35m the week before. It estimated yesterday that arranged exit schemes worth Pounds 120m were still available, of which Pounds 80m were top quality. It could be safer to send your cheque by courier or express service. Best BES Advice, published by the Allenbridge Group, suggests checking first if the issue has raised its minimum subscription: 'If an issue fails to reach its minimum subscription, it will be unable to issue shares. By the time you are notified, it may be too late to invest elsewhere in the BES market.' Some sponsors have made special arrangements and many are keeping their offices open this weekend. Johnson Fry will take telephone bookings up to noon on December 31 but chairman Charles Fry expects all issues to be sold out by then. The company launched its second Mortgage Express Super Growth scheme on Thursday and had raised Pounds 2.5m of the Pounds 10m issue by yesterday lunchtime. The contracted exit price of 120p after five years for every 100p invested equates to an annual return of 14.49 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer investing at the 99p subscription price up to December 23. The scheme will acquire mostly repossessed properties from Mortgage Express, a subsidiary of the TSB Bank, which is to fulfil the buy-back obligations of Mortgage Express if ME does not. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000. MMI is running a BES collection service for investors in its schemes from December 23 until December 30. This is available to those investing at least Pounds 5,000. Close Brothers is also running a BES hotline. Bristol Residences Companies, sponsored by Hodgson Martin, will finance accommodation to be let on assured tenancies to students and staff of the University of Bristol. The fixed exit price is 122p, equating to 14.3 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.

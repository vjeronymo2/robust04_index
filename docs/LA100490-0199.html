			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOLL FAILS TO MAKE IT OUT OF THE CRIB;  </P> <P> TOYS: CHEERFUL TEARFUL, THOUGH BELOVED BY BUYERS, COULD NOT BE MANUFACTURED IN  TIME FOR THE CHRISTMAS SEASON.  </P> <P> As toy companies go, Curiosity Products had gotten off to an enviable start.  </P> <P> It had a blue-ribbon board of directors to watch over the creation of a  high-tech baby doll -- Cheerful Tearful, which uses a computer chip to laugh,  coo, cry or wet. The toy was the hit of the New York toy fair, garnering $15  million in orders. And it got spots in Sears, Roebuck and J.C. Penney's  Christmas catalogues.  </P> <P> What's happened since then has been enough to make Cheerful Tearful cry and  cry. The dolls cannot be produced in time for the crucial Christmas season, and  probably won't be delivered until March. The president has resigned. The  company is being renamed and restructured and it is being sued for not paying  its rent.  </P> <P> The dream of bringing the new doll to market in time for Christmas went awry  because of a lack of financing, said Joseph Whitaker, Curiosity senior vice  president.  </P> <P> "In today's money-raising marketplace, money had gotten pretty tight for some  obvious reasons," he said, referring to the nationwide slump in retail sales.  "It made the job (of raising investment money) extremely difficult."  </P> <P> While Whitaker and Curiosity Chairman Joseph Delaney predict that the  reorganized company will come back strong next year, the turn of events  represents a steep slide from the early pronouncements of the new company about  its cutting-edge toy.  </P> <P> Cheerful Tearful performs some human functions just like some other baby dolls.  But the secret that brought so much notice to the new doll was a computer  microchip that can change the doll's emotions at random.  </P> <P> The doll was promoted as catering to the nurturing instinct in children,  beckoning them to play. In addition, the doll was designed to set a new  standard in realism. Among its innovations was that it would lower its  eyelashes.  </P> <P> And Curiosity had a star-studded board, including Mattel Inc. founder Elliot  Handler, former CBS Chairman Arthur Taylor and Western Digital Corp. Chairman  Roger Johnson. With such clout, the toy seemed certain to turn heads.  </P> <P> It did. When Curiosity executives took a prototype of the doll to the American  International Toy Fair in New York last February, they said potential buyers  were standing four-deep to get a look.  </P> <P> The doll was featured on the cover of the Playthings trade magazine in May. By  summer, the company had racked up a respectable $15 million in orders. Toys R  Us alone ordered 150,000, with a spokeswoman saying, "We expect her to do  well."  </P> <P> But the trouble struck over the summer. As the retail environment slowed and  concerns about the economy grew, the new company was unable to come up with the  money to get the doll manufactured, Delaney said. To make store shelves for  Christmas, the doll had to begin coming off the production line in August.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the doll was displayed in the Sears Christmas "Wish Book" catalogue,  retailing for $37.77, and in the J.C. Penney Christmas catalogue. "The J.C.  Penney buyer told me the first week the doll was in the catalogue, it was the  third best-selling doll" behind two nationally advertised models, Delaney said.  </P> <P> But J.C. Penney spokesman Duncan Muir said orders were not that strong. And he  said that people calling to order the doll are told that it will not be  available for Christmas and that order takers recommend another doll.  </P> <P> Muir said toys in the catalogue are occasionally unavailable, but "we obviously  can't allow that to happen very often."  </P> <P> The man who thought up the idea of creating a new toy company while walking his  two Airedales one day, John Lynch, abruptly resigned as president in August.  Reached at his Irvine home recently, Lynch demurred on why he left the company.  </P> <P> "It was just a whole bunch of reasons," he said.  </P> <P> He also would not comment about the dispute on rent for the company's offices.  The landlord sued Curiosity in August for $10,044 in back rent. The landlord's  lawyer said Curiosity "never really moved in" to the Newport Beach offices,  which were rented for $3,348 a month.  </P> <P> Delaney said that in the wake of Curiosity's problems, he is folding the toy  maker into the financial holding company that he founded, American Patriots  Inc. The holding company was a secured creditor of Curiosity and is owed more  than $1 million.  </P> <P> Delaney said he believes that the company will be able to retain most of its  customers for the Cheerful Tearful doll next year and will introduce other  products as well.  </P> <P> Since the doll has not been advertised on television, Delaney said he does not  think that children will be disappointed about not being able to receive it in  time for Christmas. "Most little girls won't know about this," he said.  </P> <P> And he expressed confidence that the toy maker will be back. "I think it will  just make more demand for it next year," he said about recent disappointing  events. "This sort of things happens."  </P></p>

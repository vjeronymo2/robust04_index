			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Branson ready to launch non-profit bid for lottery Mr Richard Branson is to launch a bid to run the National Lottery on a non-profit making basis. Mr Branson has been working for some time on a plan for a commercial operating company which would hand profits to a charitable foundation. He has always emphasised that he would only bid against rivals such as The Great British Lottery Company and Camelot to run the multi-billion-pound lottery if he was certain he could offer a wholly commercial package. Mr Branson's company will be the only one of the eight interested parties identified so far which will be bidding on a non-profit basis. Mr Branson declined to comment yesterday, although an announcement is expected next week. He has always made it clear that he believes the lottery should devote all its profits to good causes. The lottery is designed to raise money for five 'good causes' in equal proportions - the arts, charities, the national heritage, a millennium fund and sport. The British proposal to hand the running of a national lottery entirely to the private sector is unusual by international standards. The Lottery Promotion Company, a lobbying group, argued recently: 'The government believes that the lottery will only achieve its full potential income if commercial profit is the motive of its operators, when a charitable basis for the operating company might yield more money and more enlightenment for the nation.' Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the National Lottery, will publish the final version of the invitation to apply and the draft licence the week after next. Meanwhile, the winner of broadcasting rights to the National Lottery will face a problem over television coverage. Most bidders have assumed that one of the main marketing tools in establishing the lottery will be a weekly prime-time television programme, which would build up to the draw for the multi-million-pound prizewinners. The Independent Television Commission has warned the National Heritage Department that under existing rules such a programme would be impossible on ITV or Channel 4. The ITC view is that the lottery is a commercial product and that a programme entirely devoted to the subject would amount to product placement, which would be ruled out by the 1990 Broadcasting Act. The BBC said yesterday that it was keen to carry information on the National Lottery as a public service.</p>

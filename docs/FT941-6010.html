			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Shares in two leading US banks hit by loss report Shares in Bankers Trust and J. P. Morgan, two of the most active US commercial banks in the financial markets, fell sharply yesterday amid rumours they had taken big trading losses. Bankers Trust, which is more reliant on derivatives trading than any other commercial bank, was forced to put out a statement after reports spread that it had been hit by large losses on derivatives. The bank said that its 'operations thus far in 1994 have been profitable,' although it refused to elaborate. This statement failed to reassure the stock market, and Bankers Trust's shares lost Dollars 2 3/8 , to close at Dollars 78 3/4 in New York yesterday. In the first quarter last year the bank made after-tax profits of Dollars 230m. J. P. Morgan was also said to have lost heavily in the derivatives markets, and in the Latin American debt market. The bank refused to respond to the rumours. 'Our standard practice is to not comment on our results until the end of the quarter,' Morgan said. The bank is understood to have taken losses on Latin American debt, where it is one of the biggest dealers, but these are thought not to have been significant. Morgan's shares closed down Dollars 1 at Dollars 66 1/2 . Rumours of big trading losses at several banks have swirled around the financial markets for several weeks, prompted by volatile conditions following the Federal Reserve's move to edge US interest rates a quarter of a percentage point higher. While most traders claimed to have been prepared for some movement in US rates, the subsequent fall in European bond markets has taken many by surprise. Many banks had predicted a continuing rise in European bond prices in the first half of this year. Also, the US dollar's fall against the yen - the cause of the Dollars 600m loss admitted to last week by Mr George Soros' Quantum funds group  - had not been expected at many trading banks. There had been a widespread belief that, once US interest rates started to rise, the dollar would follow. Goldman Sachs, another bank said to have taken big losses in European bond markets, was forced to put out a statement denying the reports last month. Even if losses prove less severe than some of the wilder speculation suggests, banks are unlikely to be able to sustain the sort of trading profits made last year, when the biggest bond and stock markets were moving higher in tandem.</p>

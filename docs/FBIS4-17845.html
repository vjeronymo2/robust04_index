			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr -- If the Russian military needs to  hold tactical exercises in the interests of boosting the combat  readiness of the troops, it should be allowed to hold them.  Politicians should react calmly to what the military do in the  interests of enhancing combat training. This is the opinion of  Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko.    Today in an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS  correspondent he stressed that every politician should strive to  enhance the army's combat readiness and for this every means is  important, including the possibility of cooperating with another  army. That is why he believes it is expedient to hold  Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises at the Totsk training  ground in Orenburg oblast.    Answering to those opposing the exercises, who are indignant  that "Yankee feet should step" on Russian soil, Vladimir  Shumeyko said that in this case "not an aggressor, but an ally  is stepping on our soil."</p>

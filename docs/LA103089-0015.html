			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HILLIARD CARRIES SAINTS PAST THE FALCONS, 20-13  </P> <P> Dalton Hilliard didn't want to get fancy.  </P> <P> He just wanted to do his job.  </P> <P> Hilliard accounted for 190 yards of offense and two touchdowns Sunday, his  second touchdown coming a one-yard run with 2:12 to play, giving the New  Orleans Saints a 20-13 victory over the Atlanta Falcons.  </P> <P> Saints offensive tackle Stan Brock went to congratulate Hilliard after the  game.  </P> <P> "He told me, 'Hey, man, it's my job to get it in the end zone.' He didn't want  any of that," Brock said.  </P> <P> Hilliard rushed for 93 yards in 25 carries and caught seven passes for 97  yards.  </P> <P> "The guys up front gave me the option to go inside or out," Hilliard said. "The  blocking was great."  </P> <P> Saints linebacker Pat Swilling sacked the Falcons' Chris Miller three times and  forced two fumbles, both turnovers ending Atlanta scoring threats and helping  the Saints to their third consecutive victory after four losses in a row.  </P> <P> "The big difference now is that everybody's making plays," Swilling said.  "We're just trying to win some ball games and get back into the race."  </P> <P> The Saints improved to 4-4, while Atlanta fell to 2-6.  </P> <P> Saints scores came on a 21-yard pass from Bobby Hebert to Hilliard, the rushing  touchdown by Hilliard and two field goals by Morten Andersen, one from 32 yards  and one from 44.  </P> <P> Malcolm Tyler blocked a 23-yard attempt in the fourth quarter when holder John  Fourcade gave Andersen a poor set.  </P> <P> All of Atlanta's scoring came in the second half.  </P> <P> The Falcons' Shawn Collins caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from Miller, and  Paul McFadden kicked field goals of 41 yards and 48 yards, his longest of the  season. The field goal tied the game at 13-13 with 4:06 left in the game.  </P></p>

Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BLIND BOY GETTING TO BE DEEJAY  </P> <P> A 10-year-old blind boy will get to fulfill his dream of being a disc jockey  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Joe Milam of High Point, N.C., will co-host the morning show on station WMAG  with regular Bill Flynn, an appearance arranged after Flynn heard about how Joe  put on a make-believe radio show at home. "I was touched by Joe's story and  remembered how I used to pretend to do a radio show by faking it at home,"  Flynn said. "Now I just fake it at work." The station plans to let Joe run free  by playing records, doing interviews and introducing the weather.  </P></p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wates City disappoints with Pounds 0.1m Wates City of London Properties, the development and investment group, disappointed the stock market yesterday despite increasing optimism on City office prices. Even though the company announced a return to the black in the year ended December 31, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 113,000 against a loss of Pounds 74.9m (after write-downs of Pounds 71.9m on property valuations last time), the share price still fell 8 1/2 p to 87 1/2 p. Disappointment focused on a further property provision of Pounds 2.7m in 1993, and on Wates' net asset value per share of 72.8p, an increase of only 0.4p. However, Wates has substantially strengthened its balance sheet through a rights issue and property disposals. Total borrowings fell by 38 per cent to Pounds 56.2m. There were reduced losses per share last year of 0.71p (59.26p).</p>

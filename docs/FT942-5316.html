			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Delors faces fight for 'Union bonds' Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, faces a test of strength with the UK and Germany today over his plan to launch 'Union bonds' to finance trans-European networks, the multi-billion dollar rail, road, and telecoms infrastructure projects. Amid strong scepticism in Bonn and London, EU finance ministers will consider revised proposals for the European Commission to borrow on the capital markets to help fund the networks, which Mr Delors argues are vital for improving competitiveness and creating jobs. Ministers meeting in Luxembourg will also discuss how to improve labour market flexibility and tackle unemployment, now nearing 18m. A row would damage prospects for the European summit in Corfu on June 24, which is already threatened with a showdown over who should succeed Mr Delors as head of the Commission. Some diplomats in Brussels are predicting a stormy session today between Mr Delors and the finance ministers, notably Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer. Last month, Mr Delors railed against a German plan to set up an independent panel of experts to examine whether Brussels legislation is damaging efforts to improve European competitiveness. Mr Clarke, anxious to build bridges with Bonn, strongly supported the German deregulation plan, which has won lukewarm backing from France. However, Mr Delors is under pressure not to provoke a second confrontation with the finance ministers. With short-term interest rates falling, German monetary policy slackening and recovery clearly under way, senior Brussels officials argue that the prospects for a successful summit are the best in two years. Aides to Mr Delors suggested that he might decide to shelve his financing plan for the trans-European networks until the Essen summit in December, his last appearance as Commission president. But he remains convinced that the private sector and the European Investment Bank alone cannot finance the multi-billion dollar projects - hence the Commission's plan last week for financing a Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.85bn) alleged funding gap for 10 infrastructure projects. 'The Commission's paper has reawakened some spectres we though had been already killed off,' a UK official said. Another diplomat added: 'We remain extremely sceptical, as do the Germans among others, about the need for this. At the moment we are not persuaded that there is a funding gap.'</p>

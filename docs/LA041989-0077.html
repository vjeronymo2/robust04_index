			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> NASA rolled out a full-scale model of its next generation space shuttle. The  115-foot mock-up of the planned Shuttle-C, an unmanned, cargo-carrying shuttle,  was put together in a hanger at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,  Ala., for about $500,000, officials said. The National Aeronautics and Space  Administration hopes to get the first funds for a $1.5-billion Shuttle-C  development program in its fiscal 1991 budget. As proposed by Marshall  engineers, Shuttle-C would be a wingless version of the existing space  shuttles. Shuttle-C would weigh less than half as much as the manned orbiters,  but could carry payloads three times as heavy. Unlike its manned counterparts,  Shuttle-C could not be reused.  </P></p>

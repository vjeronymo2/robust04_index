			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Firepower sought for future attacks THE Conservatives' immed-iate attack on Labour's manifesto was in the form of a new poster, showing a red-covered document called 'Labour manifesto' dropping on a doormat beneath the slogan 'Oh no, it's a tax demand.' Unveiling the poster, which will be on display at 3,000 sites across the country, Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, called Labour's plans a 'millstone mani-festo'. 'It charts the failures of the past, not the opportunities of the future . . . out of touch, out of date and out of order,' he said. For Labour, the main thrust of attack on the Tories' manifesto will be the idea of 'same-again Conservatives' expressed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, and the claim that the document does not address the current economic difficulties. 'It is old, it is the rehashing of policies that have already failed,' Mr Kinnock said, calling the manifesto 'an excuse for the past'. 'There are a few policies that have been lifted from Labour's proposals but there is nothing in there to get the economy going', Mr Kinnock added. Each of the two main parties, however, will also use particular elements of its opponent's manifesto for ammunition in the days ahead. Each party must have been slightly relieved that there were few surprises in the other's plans, and is already saying that the other has produced no new ideas, and has failed to close off damaging lines of attack. 'Few foxes have been shot,' was the comment from one Tory aide. Two specific areas already highlighted for targetting by Tory officials, beyond the cost of Labour's programme, are the future of privatised industries and Labour's defence policy. Even without the scope for confusion between 'public control' and 'public ownership' of the water industry and the national grid, the Conservatives will exploit the increased regulation planned. They will claim that this could extend to other privatised utilities, hitting share prices. As for defence, the Tories are confident that the Labour manifesto's broad commitment to keeping nuclear weapons and providing 'whatever resources are needed' for conventional defence will not last the campaign. For its part, Labour will target the Tories' commitment to further privatisation in British Coal and in British Rail, and the continuing commitment to the national health service reforms. Otherwise, it is the absences that will feature in Labour's attack. Chief among these will be the failure to rule out a broadening of the base for value added tax - a claim that Labour has made consistently over recent months. The party will also highlight the lack of a Conservative programme of constitutional reform, and of a policy for industry.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Karsten Voigt, SPD foreign policy spokesman, </F> by Wolfgang Gast; place and date not given: "`Military Aid Is  Obsolete Anyhow'"]    [Text] [Gast] Mr. Voigt, the government wants to conclude  an agreement with Turkey that rules out the use of the death  penalty and torture on deported Kurds. Is such an agreement  possible?    [Voigt] Foreign citizens violating laws in Germany must  expect to be punished or deported. But they must, of course,  not be deported if there is a danger that they face a death  sentence or torture.    [Gast] This is exactly what the agreement should prevent.    [Voigt] In the last instance, the decision will be made by  German courts. I cannot imagine them only considering the  contents of such an agreement, but they will take into account  what these people are actually going to face in Turkey.    [Gast] The reason for the Kurdish protests in the FRG is  oppression in Turkey. The Turkish Government has been receiving  military aid from the Federal Government for years. What are  the government's possibilities of stopping military aid and thus  pressing Turkey to improve the situation of the Kurds?    [Voigt] The military aid that the government offered several  NATO partners during the time of the Cold War is obsolete and no  longer justifiable. This goes for Turkey, as well as for Greece  and Portugal. I very much doubt whether stopping arms supplies  is enough to get Turkey to change its treatment of the Kurds,  which is primarily motivated by domestic policy considerations.  Supplying arms is obsolete in foreign policy terms anyhow;  apart from that, it cannot be justified in terms of human  rights. Turkey's policy toward the Kurds will not change unless  the government and population realize that this course leads to  a dead end. They will realize that the Kurdish problem cannot  be solved by military means and that the operations in southeast  Anatolia ruin the country economically. The totally  unacceptable military operations against the Kurds have  increased pressure from outside and aggravated the economic  crisis in the country. Nevertheless, the parties advocating  particularly drastic measures gained votes in the recent  elections. That is why one has to acknowledge quite  realistically that pressure from outside cannot replace the  learning process that must gain ground in the country --  realizing that the Kurds problem cannot be solved by military  means.    [Gast] But, irrespective of that, the Federal Government has  to make sure that the arms it supplies are not used in internal  conflicts.    [Voigt] This is a promise that the Turkish Government has  given the Federal Government already....    [Gast] ...and which it does not keep.    [Voigt] This is a dilemma the government faces, because it  advocates arms supplies and relies on this promise. We have  been opposed to such supplies for years.</p>

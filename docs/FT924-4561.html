			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Stock Exchange to monitor action on corporate code BRITISH quoted companies will next year be required by the Stock Exchange to show whether they are complying with a code of corporate governance. The move was confirmed yesterday at the launch of the Cadbury committee's final report. The committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, will also require a company's auditors to scrutinise for accuracy many of the details in the statement of compliance. The code says some non-executives should be independent of management, appointed for specified terms and selected through a formal process. The code also says directors' service contracts should not exceed three years without shareholder approval and all their emoluments should be clearly disclosed. Their pay should be subject to review by a remuneration committee dominated by non-executives. Boards should have an audit committee, report on the effectiveness of internal controls and state whether the business is a going concern. Sir Adrian said: 'Boards must be free to drive their companies forward, but to exercise that freedom within a framework of effective accountability.' He said the code was based on two planks. One was the need for disclosure so all those with an interest in a company had the information they needed to exercise their rights and responsibilities; the second was for checks and balances to guard against undue concentrations of power in the boardroom. Institutional investors are expected to apply pressure to bring about reform. 'We are relying on market forces to turn our recommendations into action,' Sir Adrian said. He expected the share price of those companies which complied to improve, if only in response to the recommended strengthening of internal controls. The Cadbury report updates a draft issued by the committee last May, and has been amended following substantial public debate and submissions from 225 organisations and individuals. The committee has strengthened the tone of the document, and clarified its view that non-executive directors should work as part of a unitary board with the executives. It has diluted from the draft its recommendation that the role of chairman and chief executive should be separated and that there should be a senior non-executive director formally representing shareholders' interests. The report calls for amended legislation to limit directors' service contracts to three years without shareholder approval; to show clearly the audit and non-audit fees received by a company's auditor; and to extend to auditors of all companies the protection to report fraud currently in place for regulated industries. The Stock Exchange's continuing listing rules will require companies to provide a statement showing they are complying with the code - or highlighting areas and reasons where they do not - in their annual reports from June 30 next year.

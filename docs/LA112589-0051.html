It also amended the  General Plan and approved the design and tentative tract map proposed by D  &amp; D development and developer Johnny Johnson.  </P> <P> If the group is able to gather 1,413 signatures of registered voters by Dec. 6,  the council would have to either repeal the decisions or put them on the April  ballot.  </P></p>

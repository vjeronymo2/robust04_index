			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO 23 June editorial: "Earnestly Implementing </F> State Industrial Policy"]    [Text] Beijing, 22 Jun (XINHUA) -- The "Outline of State  Industrial Policy in the Nineties" recently promulgated by the  State Council is carried in today's edition of this newspaper.  The "Outline" is an important document guiding our country's  work in making industrial policy, as well as a major policy  basis for readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure at  present and for some time to come. Earnestly fulfilling the  demands outlined in the document will play a very important role  in promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy national development.    Industrial policy is an important means by which the state  tightens and improves macroeconomic regulation and control,  readjusts and optimizes the industrial structure, brings about  qualitative improvements in industry, and rationally distributes  resources over the long term. The State Council promulgated the  "Decision of the State Council on the Gist of Current Industrial  Policy" in March of 1989. The "Decision" played a positive role  in controlling inflation, in establishing a normal industrial  development order, and in increasing the supply of essential  goods. Our country's reform, opening up, and modernization have  entered a new stage of vigorous development since the beginning  of the nineties, especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping  delivered his important talks in early 1992 and the 14th CPC  National Congress. Our national economy has grown rapidly, and  both the pattern of domestic demand and the international  economic environment have undergone significant changes. To  meet the requirements of economic development in the new  situation, the State Council formulated the "Outline of State  Industrial Policy in the Nineties," in which it clearly  specified the major principles for readjusting and optimizing  the industrial structure, priorities in industrial development,  and the safeguard policies to be implemented in coordination,  with a view to effectively steering our national economy toward  realizing the second-step strategic objective of national  economic and social development.    Our country is currently in a crucial period of accelerating  the establishment of a socialist market economic structure.  During the process of establishing a new structure, the market  should be allowed to play a fundamental role in distributing  resources while the state should tighten macroeconomic  regulation and control and provide guidance for the rational  distribution of resources over the long term. Industrial policy  is at the core of long-term development policy. The tangible  achievements scored by the economically developed countries in  the world, especially by a great many Asian countries and  regions, have corroborated the important role played by  industrial policy. Our country is establishing a socialist  market economic structure as its industrial structure is  undergoing significant changes. This requires the government to  formulate rational and farsighted structural policy and to guide  economic development on its own initiative so as to avert  haphazard production and investment activities and improve  macroeconomic returns and economic performance.    Based on an in-depth analysis of the trends of change in our  country's industrial structure, in accordance with the objective  laws governing the process of industrialization and  modernization, the "Outline" clearly specifies the main  direction and aspects of our country's industrial restructuring  during the nineties; that is, continuously strengthening the  status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy,  developing the rural economy in an all-around way, vigorously  beefing up basic industries, striving to relieve the strain  posed by the slow development of basic industries and  infrastructure, accelerating the development of mainstay  industries to promote overall national economic development,  rationally restructuring foreign trade, sharpening the  competitive edge of our industries in the international market,  quickening the pace of developing industries using new and high  technology, supporting the development of new industries and  products, and continuing to develop tertiary industry  energetically. Moreover, efforts should be made to optimize the  industrial organizational structure and to improve industrial  technological levels so as to render the industrial pattern more  rational. All in all, the "Outline" fully outlines the general  trend and pattern of our country's industrial development and  clearly sets forth the major principles and policies for  readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure.    The "Outline," a document providing guidance on industrial  policy work, sets forth general requirements which must be  fulfilled one by one through specific policies. So far, the  State Council has promulgated the "Industrial Policy for the Car  Industry," which specifically sets the goal of developing this  key industry and explains its industrial organization,  technology, distribution, and foreign investment and trade  policies. This specific industrial policy has begun to be  implemented. The State Council has also promulgated criteria of  economic scale for investment and construction on a number of  important products to achieve economies of scale in these  industries and increase their competitiveness. Pursuant to the  requirements of the "Outline," the State Council will formulate  one by one additional specific industrial policies on transport,  telecommunications, construction, electronics, machine-building,  petrochemical, foreign investment, trade, technology, and  industrial reorganization to fulfill what is required in the  "Outline."    The "Outline" also specifies procedures for formulating  industrial policy and the method of implementing it. This  provides an important guarantee ensuring that industrial policy  is scientific, authoritative, and effective in implementation  and helps move the work of formulating industrial policy closer  to standardization and establishing it on an institutional and  legal basis. The "Outline" specifically calls for the  establishment of systems of decisionmaking, work procedures,  examination and approval, logistic support, supervision and  inspection, and evaluation of the state's industrial policy.  These systems, which will be established in line with the usual  practice of a market economy, with due attention to bringing  into play the initiatives of all quarters, will greatly raise  the government's work efficiency in formulating and implementing  industrial policy.    Once state industrial policy is formulated, the important  thing is implementation. From our countries' experience in  formulating industrial policy, and in light of the fairly  successful foreign practice in implementing industrial policy,  it is crucial that the following four links be grasped well for  the implementation of the "Outline": First, all departments and  localities must organize a drive to earnestly study and  publicize the "Outline" so that state industrial policy is  extensively understood and recognized. It is necessary to study  and understand what the "Outline" requires and enhance our  consciousness in implementing it from the perspective of quickly  and successfully pushing forward the development of the entire  economy and establishing a socialist market economic structure.  Second, it is necessary to stress coordination and consistency  between state industrial policies and other economic policies.  Effective implementation of industrial policies requires  effective coordination of other economic policies, particularly  on financial, banking, taxation, price, foreign trade, and  foreign investment. Departments of planning, finance, banking,  taxation, customs, stock supervision, administration for  industry and commerce, and state-owned property management, as  well as relevant specialized departments and local governments  should appropriately adjust their policy measures within their  jurisdiction and implement effective logistic support systems in  accordance with the general requirements of the "Outline" to  ensure their coordinated functioning in line with the state's  general industrial policy. Third, it is necessary to handle well  the relationship between implementing state industrial policy  and bringing into play the market mechanism. In implementing  industrial policy, it is necessary to pay attention to bringing  into play the role of market mechanism and, under the state's  macroeconomic regulation and control, bring into full play the  basic role of the market in the allocation of resources to  ensure the realization of the goal of structural adjustment. It  is necessary to use economic means and legal measures to provide  guidance and carry out coordination. Fourth, it is necessary to  handle well the relationship between partial and overall  interests. The "Outline" requires that local governments at the  provincial level specifically study the formulation of  implementing measures in light of local realities. In enacting  implementation measures, provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities should stress bringing into play their relative  strong points while taking into consideration the state's  overall interests and avoid the tendency to consider partial  interests alone to the neglect of overall interests. In  developing local economies, governments at all levels should  earnestly and consciously implement state industrial policy. In  the case of industries supported by state industrial policy,  they can develop them in light of local realities and in line  with national distribution arrangements. In the case of  industries incompatible with state industrial policies, they  should consciously follow state industrial policy and refrain  from violating them; otherwise, they will affect national  economic development and at the same time cause economic losses  to the localities. Only by so doing can we promote sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the economy which, in the  final analysis, will help bring about effective growth of the  local economy.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Bribes in the PAMI"] </F>   [Text] It was with more indignation than surprise that the  community received the news of the arrests of National Institute  of Social Services for Retirees and Pensioners contractors who  provide services under the Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan  (PAMI). The arrests came as the contractors were handing over  considerable sums of money, presumably intended--according to  the accusation that led to criminal charges--as payment of  bribes to administrative officials in the system for the  privilege of being service providers and getting patients.    It is public knowledge that Councilman Anibal Ibarra of the  capital was able to witness the handoff and then made the  accusation before the judge. Though the judge does not yet think  he has solid grounds to order the prosecution of the suspects,  he has in his hands a case that should be pursued until no stone  is left unturned.    More or less vague and sweeping insinuations and suspicions  are commonplace when it comes to the funds managed by various  public agencies, and the existence of widespread administrative  corruption in government is, unfortunately, a fact of life in  Argentine society that is as unprovable as it is irremediable.  To be sure, there are few opportunities to record a concrete,  verifiable incident in the presence of a judge, and this is  probably what has made the PAMI case so special.    But even if the fact were irrefutably proven and a trial  were  to be conducted, that would say nothing about the true nature of  these payments, their ultimate destination, or the goods and  services received or to be received in exchange for them. That,  precisely, is what the courts must clear up and what public  opinion must discover. The public has viewed this case as the  key that will unlock the door to finally expose the corruption  and punish the perpetrators of the crimes that have been  committed.    In this regard, the episode appears to have been unduly  publicized because of the upcoming elections, even though it is  of such singular importance that it should be protected from  political grandstanding and be handled according to strict  judicial guidelines.    No matter what the investigation reveals, however, the  leadership of the agency involved bears some responsibility,  whether it is proven that they were directly involved in the  incident or that there were administrative shortcomings or lax  controls. Furthermore, some serious ethical questions come to  mind, since what is at stake are the funds that the community  has allocated for meeting the needs of its weakest members,  those who generally are most in need of medical care. No matter  who is lining his pockets and stealing some of the funds that  the workers and their employers have contributed to the PAMI, no  matter what mechanism is used, substantial harm is being done to  the system, and of course, to those who turn to it when they  need assistance.    After the initial accusation was made, implicating providers  of psychiatric services and prompting a judicial investigation,  other allegations were made against various entities for  overcharging, billing for services that were never rendered,  paying bribes, etc. Now the charges involve geriatric and dental  facilities and clinics and sanatoriums all over the country, and  they must be investigated as well. The situation has gotten even  more complicated with Ibarra's new claim that he has been  subjected to threats and a bribery attempt.    The PAMI budget is more than 2 billion pesos a year, which  can give rise to a lot of temptations. It is imperative that the  judicial investigation be carried out to the fullest extent,  without political interference of any sort, to shed light on the  medical and administrative management of cases, the use of  resources, and the mechanisms for contracting services for  retirees. And not just for the sake of efficiency and honesty,  but also because we have a moral obligation to the elderly, to  whom society is still indebted.</p>

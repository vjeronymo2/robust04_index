Ambassador Georgiy Kunadze and four other Russian Embassy  officials sailed to the scene of the sinking of two Russian gun  boats near Sowolmi-do Island aboard a maritime police patrol  ship at 2 pm to observe the service.    The two Russian ships, 6,500-ton Variak and 1,200-ton  Koryeth, were sunk in a battle with six Japanese warships on  Feb. 9, 1904, one day after the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese  war.    The Russian vessels were in the Inchon harbor at that time  to  protect the Russian legation in Seoul.    Sixty-four wounded sailors of the two ships were evacuated  to  nearby English, French and Italian vessels. But, the remainders  went down with their vessels as they sank their ships rather  than to surrender to the Japanese.    Earlier in the day, Ambassador Kunadze and his party called  at the Inchon City Hall and discussed with Mayor Choe Ki-son  ways to promote exchanges and cooperation between Inchon and  Russian cities.</p>

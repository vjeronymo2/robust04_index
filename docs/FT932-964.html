			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Kelt Energy gets exceptional boost EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS helped Kelt Energy, the oil exploration and production group, report pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.68m for the 12 months to March 31, against Pounds 163,000 last time. The outcome reflected refunds of Pounds 3m from the Carless pension scheme, which Kelt took over in 1988, and a release of provisions from the US. Operating profits increased 29 per cent to Pounds 2.97m (Pounds 2.31m) as production rose 42 per cent to 5,340 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Mr Hubert Perrodo, chairman, said he expected production to double to 10,000 b/d by the end of the year. Mr Perrodo has a 75 per cent stake in the company following its restructuring two years ago when a group of banks took over some of its exploration and production assets in return for writing off its debt. Since then, Kelt has built a niche in the oil industry by looking to take over marginal assets from large oil companies and cutting costs in order to make them profitable. It has taken over an oilfield in Gabon, cutting operating costs from Dollars 18m a year to Dollars 11.2m (Pounds 7.4m); production is running at 8,000 b/d.</p>

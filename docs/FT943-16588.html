			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Working Life: Expats beware - Finance If you are a UK expatriate, you are entitled to receive gross interest from your UK bank and building society after completing a form to declare your non-resident status. But the ability to receive gross income does not mean it is tax-exempt, since most UK sources of income are taxable. The interest can only be excluded from liability to tax under extra-statutory concession Bl3 but this involves considerable restrictions. Donald Elkin, director of Wilfred T Fry Ltd, of Worthing, West Sussex, points out that any interest you receive during 'broken' years of departure from and arrival in the UK, will be fully taxable. Moreover, in intervening years of non-residence, allowances will be set off against the gross paid interest you thought was exempt. If the interest is your only UK income, these will not be a problem. But if you have other sources, such as a pension or are renting out property, Elkin says you stand to suffer an unnecessary loss: 'Suppose, for example, that while non-resident you receive UK letting profits of Pounds 3,400 per annum and gross paid building society interest of Pounds 3,000. You might well have assumed you would have no tax liability, the Pounds 3,000 interest being exempt and the Pounds 3,400 letting profit fully covered by your Pounds 3,445 personal allowance. In fact, that allowance will be set off first against the interest, leaving only Pounds 445 to reduce the liability on the letting profit. You would, therefore, have to pay tax on Pounds 2,955 (Pounds 3,400 minus Pounds 445) which at 25 per cent equals Pounds 738.75.' Fortunately, this is a problem from which it is easy to escape simply by transferring your account outside the UK. But it is always worth taking tax advice before doing so. Most UK banks and many building societies have offshore branches in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. But remember the UK's Deposit Protection Scheme for banks and building societies does not operate outside mainland Britain, so it is important to stick to reputable depositors. Of the three main offshore islands, only the Isle of Man has a comparable scheme, which protects up to 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. If you are with a building society, the Building Societies Act requires all the liabilities of a subsidiary to be guaranteed by the UK parent.</p>

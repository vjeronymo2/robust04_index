			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1989 LOS ANGELES TIMES ALL-STARS;  </P> <P> LAKEWOOD, DOMINGUEZ AND MILLIKAN EACH PLACE 2 ON BOYS ALL-SOUTH COAST TEAM  </P> <P> The boys 1989 Times All-South Coast High School Basketball Team, composed of  talented all-around veteran players who know how to win, is a coach's dream.  </P> <P> CIF Southern Section champions Dominguez and Millikan each placed two players  on the team, as did Moore League champion Lakewood.  </P> <P> Xavier Edison and DiJon Bernard led Dominguez to the Southern Regional finals  of the state tournament.  </P> <P> From Millikan are forward Jeep Jensen and guard Terry Hilliard, and from  Lakewood are Brian Camper, the Moore League's most valuable player, and his  cousin, Victor Camper.  </P> <P> Zachary Allison of Centennial, Russell May of Mayfair, David Mitchell of Jordan  and Earnest Killum of Lynwood round out the team.  </P> <P> Killum, the only junior on the team, is its top scorer. He averaged just under  30 points a game.  </P> <P> Bernard, the Campers and May made the team last year.  </P> <P> The All-South Coast team:  </P> <P> Brian Camper, Lakewood -- The MVP of the Moore League, Camper averaged 20.3  points a game. "His biggest attribute is his all-around game," Lakewood Coach  Tim Sweeney said of Brian, who can shoot, rebound and pass. "He's not a Dr. J  flashy type player, he's more of an overall blue-collar fundamental player."  Camper has signed with Arizona State.  </P> <P> Victor Camper, Lakewood -- Brian's cousin, he averaged 13 points and was a real  force inside with seven or eight rebounds a game. "There's probably not a  stronger inside player in the CIF," Sweeney said of the 6-8, 230-pound center  who is headed for Lamar University in Beaumont, Tex.  </P> <P> DiJon Bernard, Dominguez -- The Dons' point guard, he averaged 13.8 points, but  on a less-balanced team could easily have averaged 20. A great shooter who  scored 27 points in a playoff game, he also led the Dons in assists and was a  leader on defense.  </P> <P> Xavier Edison, Dominguez -- Relentlessness is what marked this 6-4 senior  forward, according to Dons Coach Russell Otis. "He's hard-nosed, is a great  defender and gives 110% every time he steps on the floor," Otis said. Edison  averaged 14 points and 10.6 rebounds a game for the 26-5 Dons.  </P> <P> David Mitchell, Jordan -- A left-handed player, this 6-3 senior guard averaged  18.3 points a game and made All-Moore League. He is a good jumper, passer,  long-range shooter -- and student. He scored 38 points against Sunny Hills in  the El Dorado Tournament.  </P> <P> Earnest Killum, Lynwood -- Displaying great shooting range, he averaged 29.8  points a game. "The kids all respect him and look up to him," Lynwood Coach  Bill Notley said of his junior co-captain. "He has a good temperament, he is  not up one day and down the other." Killum has been contacted by about 100  colleges. "He is a great jumper who will play off-guard in college," Notley  said.  </P> <P> Jeep Jensen, Millikan -- An All-Moore League forward on the Southern Section  5-AA champion Rams, this left-hander averaged 13.5 points and eight rebounds a  game. Very intelligent, Jensen plays hard, likes to shoot outside but can also  score inside. He had 26 points against Loyola in the second round of CIF  playoffs and 21 against Saddleback in the championship game. He also was one of  the Rams' best defensive players.  </P> <P> Terry Hilliard, Millikan -- A solid guard with Division I college potential,  Hilliard averaged 14.6 points a game and probably was the Moore League's best  point guard. Not flashy, he does a workmanlike job with good quickness and a  good jump shot. He was a leader on a championship team, and scored 26 points  against St. Monica in the playoff semifinals. Like Jensen, he is left-handed  and all-league.  </P> <P> Russell May, Mayfair -- A very aggressive 6-6 center with good post moves and a  soft outside shooting touch, he averaged 24 points and 16 rebounds a game and  made the all-Suburban League team for the second straight year. "A great kid  with good grades . . . a perfect gentleman," Mayfair Coach Joe Tereschuk said.  He may play at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Zachary Allison, Centennial -- A 6-3 left-handed guard, he loved to penetrate  into the lane for a 12-foot jump shot. He averaged 18.6 points, 6.7 assists and  6.3 rebounds a game and was the MVP of the Ocean League. "It's very difficult  to stop him from penetrating," Apaches Coach Willie Emanuel said of Allison,  who also is accurate from 3-point range.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1989 ALL-STARS  </P> <P> The all-star boys and girls teams, each consisting of 10 members, their coaches  and parents will be guests of The Times at 9 a.m. Sunday, April 2, at the  annual Times High School Basketball Awards Brunch where all-stars teams from 12  circulation areas will be honored at the Anaheim Hilton. The featured speaker  will be George Yardley, a former All-American at Stanford University, who went  on to become the first player ever to score more than 2,000 points in an NBA  season. The players and the coaches of the year from each area will be  announced.  </P> <P> The teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches, who are asked to  fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents, plus the  observations of college scouts and sportswriters. Each player will recieve the  traditional Times golden basketball plaque and award certificate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Brian Camper  </P> <P> School: Lakewood  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-4  </P> <P> Average: 20.3  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Victor Camper  </P> <P> School: Lakewood  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-8  </P> <P> Average: 13.0  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: DiJon Bernard  </P> <P> School: Dominguez  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-3  </P> <P> Average: 13.8  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Xavier Edison  </P> <P> School: Dominguez  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-4  </P> <P> Average: 14.0  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: David Mitchell  </P> <P> School: Jordan  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-3  </P> <P> Average: 18.3  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Earnest Killum  </P> <P> School: Lynwood  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Height: 6-3  </P> <P> Average: 29.8  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Jeep Jensen  </P> <P> School: Millikan  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-6  </P> <P> Average: 13.5  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Terry Hilliard  </P> <P> School: Millikan  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-2  </P> <P> Average: 14.6  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Russell May  </P> <P> School: Mayfair  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-6  </P> <P> Average: 24.0  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Zachary Allison  </P> <P> School: Centennial  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-2  </P> <P> Average: 18.6  </P></p>

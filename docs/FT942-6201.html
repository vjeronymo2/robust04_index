			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / European Elections: Edgy Tory walks along a thin tightrope Sir Christopher Prout has a slightly edgy look as he sits each morning on the platform at Conservative Central Office to be quizzed by the media about next month's European elections. Friends of the MEP, who leads the Tory group in the Strasbourg assembly, say his demeanour betrays nothing more than his usual, pleasantly self-effacing disposition. Political opponents judge that Sir Christopher, a committed European in a party torn by internal divisions, is deeply embarrassed by the government's negative campaigning. Whatever the truth, he is walking the thinnest of tightropes. His strongly pro-European instincts sit distinctly uneasily beside Mr John Major's judgment that the Tories' best chance of avoiding annihilation on June 9 is to pitch for the chauvinist vote. Sir Christopher plays the game skilfully. A flick through his speeches during 15 years in the European parliament leaves no doubt where he stands. He does not advocate the monolithic superstate the government professes to be battling against. But he is happy with words such as 'federal', with the ambition of a single currency and the concept of more majority voting in the Council of Ministers. He insists relations between the 32-strong group of Tory MEPs and the government have improved since the disastrous 1989 election when the MEPs were driven to revolt by Baroness Thatcher's campaign against a 'diet of Brussels'. Not all colleagues are so sure. One Tory MEP was recently overheard contrasting the government's attitude to its MEPs with its approach to the IRA: ministers were at least prepared to talk to the terrorists. Sir Christopher stresses that he regards the national veto so vigorously defended by Mr Major as vital in the areas of foreign policy and taxation. Transfer of authority on those issues to Brussels would 'erode the sovereignty of the state and the sovereignty of Westminster'. But, parting company with the likes of Mr Michael Portillo and others on the Tory Euro-sceptic right, he added: 'It has always been my personal view that it is possible to have a single currency without undermining national sovereignty.' Sir Christopher reinforces the point with a reference to the Victorian past, when the currency was fixed to the gold standard: 'No-one imagined then that the supply of money was not a fit matter to be left to the Bank (of England).' He is keen also to see the powers of the European parliament increased. Its present authority to sack the European Commission in its entirety should be extended to allow it to dismiss individual members of the executive, he believes. The assembly's powers of co-decision with the Council of Ministers should apply in all areas where there is majority voting: 'It is important to have a fuller democratic blocking mechanism.' He takes issue with those in his party who believe that Britain's main task over the next few years will be resisting the centralist juggernaut. Although he does not fear economic and monetary union, he believes the momentum has been lost. 'My view is that the time for a single currency has probably come and gone.' Instead: 'The big problem that Europe is going to face in the medium term is not centralisation. It is nationalism.' He distinguishes between benign patriotism and malign nationalism: 'I am quite fearful about the nationalism that feeds on enemies.' Stressing that the EU must quickly enlarge eastwards, he warns that Germany and Russia might otherwise divide up the former communist bloc countries of central and eastern Europe into national spheres of interest. That last happened in the late 1930s. The way to stop history repeating itself is to build on the model provided by the EU's precursor - the European Coal and Steel Community  - and to begin now the process of drawing in the former communist bloc countries. It all sounds sensible stuff. But sadly it is not the message Mr Major thinks will persuade disgruntled Tory voters to turn out and support the party on June 9. Better to tell them that the government will fight off the bureaucrats of Brussels while the opposition parties run up the white flag. For his part Sir Christopher has a reasonable chance of holding on to the Herefordshire and Shropshire constituency against a threat from both the Liberal Democrats and Labour. Many of his colleagues will not be so lucky.</p>

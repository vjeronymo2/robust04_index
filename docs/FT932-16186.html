			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Management: A boost to rev up the engine - Technology has cut the time it takes T&amp;N to fill customer orders Alister McWilliam's engineers at a factory overlooking Bradford, West Yorkshire, have come a long way since 1989. Then it took them 26 weeks from a customer's first inquiry to develop, make, test and deliver a new design of automotive engine piston. Within two years they had more than halved the 'time-to- market' cycle of their company, AEPP Automotive. By the end of 1993 it will have been halved again, from 12 to six weeks. 'None of our competitors can touch that,' McWilliam claims. 'We've taken a leap past the Germans.' That gives AEPP a global lead, since its two main rivals for the supply of pistons to the world's car makers are both German - one with a smaller and declining market share, the other still just ahead of the UK company. Since Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, Nissan and the rest are almost all sub-contracting much more piston design and manufacture as they rush to shorten their own 'time-to-market' for new cars, AEPP's breakthrough promises a sharp rise in its sales, even before the current automotive slump is over. In stark contrast with most of British manufacturing industry, that surge is already under way. Last month Bradford's manufacturing team, under director Peter Marchant, brought into operation a fourth high-volume production line to help meet the demand from Opel, the German GM offshoot. As from January, Bradford has been the single-source supplier of pistons for the 1.6 litre engines used in Opel's top-selling models, the Astra and Vectra (Vauxhall Cavalier in Britain). This has involved Opel cutting off its previous German supplier. Two years ago Bradford installed a similar production line to help meet rising demand from Ford of Europe. As a result, the value of Bradford's car piston sales is already accelerating - by a projected 16 per cent this year - having stagnated in 1992. A 20 per cent rise is projected for 1994, taking AEPP Automotive's total sales to Pounds 72m. With unit prices falling, the surge in volume has been much sharper. How has Bradford done it? 'The main driver of our success has been technology. Ten years ago, we wouldn't have got a German auto engineer to even look at us,' says McWilliam. 'Now we're seen as offering not just high-quality volume manufacture, but also innovation,' says Bob Bates, who last summer took over the top seat at Bradford when McWilliam moved up to head all the piston products of the parent company, T&amp;N. Their claims are borne out by a senior GM Europe purchasing manager who, from his base at Opel's headquarters outside Frankfurt, was instrumental in taking the single-sourcing decision. 'The most interesting thing about T&amp;N, aside from its overall engineering and development capability, is that it's the only group in the world that can do us pistons plus the pins and rings for them,' says the executive. 'Everyone else can develop and make only one of the three.' Bradford's success is the main factor behind T&amp;N's rise over the past decade from number four in the world piston league to its position close behind the market leader, Mahle. For much of its innovation - in products, in manufacture and in design processes - Bradford must thank its relationship with T&amp;N's corporate research and development centre at Cawston in Warwickshire, 130 miles to the south. (Cawston's role within the T&amp;N group was examined in the previous article in this series.) One of the key product innovations to come out of Cawston has been a patented way of reducing friction in bearings; when applied to pistons, it cuts fuel consumption significantly. But McWilliam says that 'probably the single most significant factor in changing our stature' - and in slashing Bradford's time to market - has been a computer-based design and analysis process called Rapier (Rapid Analysis of Products by Integrated Engineering Routines). Developed at Cawston in close collaboration with Bradford, it has been built up steadily to incorporate a string of key features. They include 'failure mode effect analysis' which allows engineers to predict problems in both manufacture and product performance and to analyse them before they occur. This has raised design and production quality sharply and has cut development costs by minimising expensive and time-consuming engine tests. For the past few months, this process has been linked directly into manufacture, through the automated development and production of the machine tool dies needed to make the piston in the factory. Die-making is now organised as part of product engineering, not manufacture. In parallel with the Cawston-based innovations have come several generated by Bradford itself, which spends between 6 and 8 per cent of its sales on development. Much of this goes on the application of Cawston's work to specific products and on piston testing, but Bradford has also pioneered new products, manufacturing techniques and even a special aluminium alloy which helps reduce gas emissions from pistons by 10 per cent. The closeness of Bradford's engineers to their customers was taken a step further last year with the merger of the previously separate engineering and marketing departments under one director, Brian Ruddy. He has broken this organisation into a series of 'customer focus' teams and task forces. 'Putting the different disciplines together is already increasing the engineers' commercial and financial awareness,' he says. Production engineers are still organised separately, although for the past year McWilliam says they and Ruddy's staff 'have been working hard at simultaneous engineering'. With the exception of Bradford's innovation and speed, Bob Bates stresses that 'we're not really 'world class' yet'. He has set a two-year target of a 10-fold increase in 'right first time' quality, and a 20 per cent rise in total productivity - including capital as well as labour. As part of this, jobs at Bradford will continue to shrink. A decade ago its labour force totalled 1,570. It is now about 950, the latest cut being 100 people since last November. Beyond that, Bates says: 'We've got a lot of work to do on culture change and organisational effectiveness. We're not here to make products, but money.' This concludes a series on R&amp;D management at T&amp;N. Previous articles appeared on March 12 and 17.</p>

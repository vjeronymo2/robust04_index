			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Claims by relatives MY HUSBAND and I are joint tenants of our house and I wish to convert it into a tenants-in-common ownership. In the event of my husband pre-deceasing me and not leaving a will, would relatives have a claim on his share of the house and in what proportion? We have a married daughter. I have brothers and sisters and nephews. My husband has one sister - who is well provided-for - and two nieces. If I die first, would my daughter be able to claim on my husband's property? We note that you wish to change the ownership of your house from a joint tenancy into tenants-in-common so that you can leave your share of the house as you wish. If your husband does not make a will, then your estate would be left in accordance with the rules of intestacy. These provide that the first Pounds 75,000 and any personal possessions would pass to you, and the balance held as to 50 per cent by way of a life interest for you and 50 per cent for your married daughter. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in thses columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

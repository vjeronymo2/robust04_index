			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By K. C. Huang and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] San Salvador [words indistinct] Armando Calderon  Sol assumes office, ROC [Republic of China] Ambassador Andrew J.  P. Shen said Tuesday [31 May].    "The ROC and El Salvador have enjoyed long-term friendly  ties  and this relationship is not expected to change under Calderon's  leadership," Shen told the CNA in an interview.    During his visit to Taipei last October, Shen said, Calderon  assured senior ROC officials that he will strengthen cooperation  with the ROC and support Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations  if he wins the presidential election.    "Calderon was pleased when I told him recently that Premier  Lien Chan would attend his inauguration," Shen noted. Lien, who  served as ROC ambassador to El Salvador in the 1970s, is an old  friend of Calderon.    Lien, heading a 21-member entourage, will arrive in San  Salvador Tuesday night to attend the inaugural ceremony  scheduled for Wednesday.    After a 12-year civil war, Shen said, the Central American  country badly needs international assistance to rebuild its  battered economy.    El Salvador provides many incentives, including a 10-year  tax  holiday, to attract foreign investors, Shen noted. "I hope more  Taiwan businessmen can invest here to help boost this country's  economic development."    Shen said Taiwan companies can use El Salvador as a gateway  to the North American market because the United States imposes  no quota restrictions on Salvadoran products. El Salvador has  also joined with Guatemala and Honduras to sign a "free trade  agreement" with Mexico to allow freer flow of commodities in the  region.    There are some 10 Taiwan-owned companies in El Salvador,  mainly producing garments for export.    Shen said there is still ample room for Taiwan-Salvadoran  trade to grow. Taiwan exported US$20.7 million worth of goods  to El Salvador in 1992, while importing US$50 million worth of  Salvadoran products.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERMAN UNIFICATION AND WORLD PEACE  </P> <P> My overwhelming reaction when I read Jeff Douthwaite's letter (Feb. 9) was  sadness. It's a shame that anyone has to harbor such irrational fears.  </P> <P> To suggest that a reunified Germany would somehow be a military threat (or any  kind of threat) to the rest of Europe in 1990 ignores present reality in favor  of history.  </P> <P> The Germany of 1914 had no tradition of democracy, but was ruled by the iron  hand of the kaiser. And Hitler only had to kick the legs out from under the  weak-kneed Weimar Republic, taking advantage of a decade of economic ruin.  </P> <P> Contrast that with today's Federal Republic of Germany. The FRG is one of the  most prosperous of the Western nations and has a two-generation-long tradition  of democracy. What happened in 1933 is a virtual impossibility today. To  suggest that Germans instinctively turn into militaristic aggressors whenever  their country is unified borders on racism.  </P> <P> There would be no need to impose a limit on Germany's military. With no  appreciable threat left in the east, one would be hard-pressed to convince the  Germans to fork up any cash for guns instead of butter. If Germany is going to  do any conquering, united or not, it will be the field of economics, not the  field of battle.  </P> <P> PAUL McELLIGOTT  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

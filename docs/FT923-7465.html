			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Repsol registers static profits REPSOL, the Spanish state-controlled energy conglomerate, yesterday reported practically static profits for the first half of 1992, an effort it considered 'extremely positive' considering the dire straits of some of its larger rivals in the oil industry. Net profits for the first six months, Repsol said, were Pta40.6bn (Dollars 4.3bn). The company said it had been able to hold profits steady in spite of falls of 50 per cent in margins at its oil refining and petrochemicals operations. This had been helped by a sharp increase in operating profits in Repsol's gas distribution businesses, from Pta7.3bn in the first six months of last year to Pta9.3bn; a 102 per cent increase in operating profits in exploration and production to Pta10.2bn; and slow cost growth helped by the loss of some 1,000 jobs in the first half. This should encourage Repsol to continue with a cautious policy of opening itself up to wider share ownership. More than 30 per cent of the group is owned outside of the state and Repsol recently completed a very successful convertible bond offering.</p>

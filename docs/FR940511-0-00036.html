			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority of the Secretary to designate national marine sanctuaries and administer the other provisions of the Act has been delegated to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere by DOC Organization Order 10&hyph;15, section 3.01(z), January 11, 1988. The authority to administer the other provisions of the Act has been re-delegated to the Assistant Administrator of NOAA for Ocean Services and Coastal Zone Management by NOAA Circular 83&hyph;38, Directive 05&hyph;50, September 21, 1983, as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coastal and ocean waters off the Olympic Coast were recognized for their high natural resource and human use values and placed on the National Marine Sanctuary Program Site Evaluation List (SEL) in August of 1983 (48 FR 35568). In 1988, Congress reauthorized and amended the Act and directed the Secretary to designate the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (Pub. L. 100&hyph;627, section 205(a)). In report language accompanying this legislation, Congress noted that the Olympic Coast possesses a unique and nationally significant collection of flora and fauna, and that adjacency of the area to the Olympic National Park merits the designation of this area as a national marine sanctuary (H. Rep. No. 4210, 100th Cong., 1st. Sess., 1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NOAA held four scoping meetings in Washington State April 10&hyph;13, 1989, to solicit public comments on the designation: Aberdeen on April 10, Port Angeles on April 11, Forks on April 12, and Seattle on April 13 (45 FR 10398, March 13, 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 20, 1991, NOAA published a proposed Designation Document and proposed implementing regulations and announced the availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Management Plan (DEIS/MP) (56 FR 47836). Public hearings to receive comments on the proposed designation, proposed regulations, and DEIS/MP were held on November 6th in Port Angeles, November 7th in Seattle, November 12th in Olympia, November 13th in Aberdeen, November 14th in Seaview, and November 20th in Washington DC. On November 14th, 1991, the period for submitting public comments was extended from November 27th, 1991 to December 13th, 1991 pursuant to requests from the State of Washington and the coastal counties (56 FR 57869). All comments received by NOAA in response to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice and at the public hearings were considered and, where appropriate, incorporated in the final regulations and FEIS/MP. A summary of the comments on the proposed regulations and the regulatory elements of the DEIS/MP and NOAA's responses to them follow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Comments and Responses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Issue: Boundaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Boundary Alternative 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA should choose boundary alternative 1 because: (1) it contains most of the unique ecological features off the Washington Coast; (2) NOAA can offer greater protection to the coastal features than the resources further offshore in the event of a spill of hazardous materials; and (3) vessel traffic would be least affected, thereby ensuring safer seas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA disagrees. Boundary alternative 1 contains most of the ecological features visible above the sea surface. However, a marine sanctuary should encompass a discrete ecological unit with definable boundaries (16 U.S.C. 1433 (b)(1)(F)). The marine mammals and seabirds that transit the waters off the Olympic Peninsula and colonize the offshore rocks and islands forage in the rich waters and benthic communities over and on the continental shelf. The shelf is broad off the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The seaward extent of the shelf coupled with the upwelling produced from the Juan de Fuca Canyon are the physical parameters that support the food chain from the plankton to the marine mammals and seabirds. The offshore rocks and intertidal communities are only one habitat within the marine ecosystem off the Olympic Coast. Therefore, the marine sanctuary should encompass the ecologically significant offshore waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to NOAA's ability to protect the offshore waters in the event of a spill, NOAA agrees that there is little that can be done once a spill has occurred. The high seas would most likely render response capabilities ineffective. However, NOAA will coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard, the Washington State Office of Marine Safety, and the coastal tribes to ensure that there is an adequate response capability for the coastal waters, intertidal regions, and beaches along the sanctuary including seabird and marine mammal rescue capabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Extension of the Sanctuary boundary to the shelf edge provides a buffer area for protecting the coastal resources. NOAA is working with the U.S. Coast Guard to develop a proposal for an Area to be Avoided (ATBA) from the shoreward boundary to 25 nautical miles offshore of the Olympic Peninsula. This ATBA is designed to provide sufficient time to respond to a vessel that loses power off the Olympic Peninsula. The ATBA is compatible with many of the existing voluntarily adhered to traffic patterns along the coast and thus adds only minimal time and distance to transits between the Strait of Juan de Fuca and destinations to the south.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Boundary Alternative 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA should choose boundary alternative 2 as the preferred alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NOAA disagrees for the same reasons stated in response to the previous comment. The seaward extent of boundary alternative 2, which approximates the 50 fathom isobath, has no relation to the seaward extent of the coastal ecosystem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

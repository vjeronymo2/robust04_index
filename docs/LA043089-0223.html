			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEETING IN DORNAN'S OFFICE ON ABORTION  </P> <P> I read Carol Gentry's letter to the editor (April 23) regarding her recent  visit to Rep. Robert K. Dornan's office and, as a participant in that meeting,  felt compelled to respond.  </P> <P> Dornan's leading role in the pro-life movement is well known. Nevertheless, it  is his policy to always make time for those holding opposing views on any  issue. That is why, in his absence that day, the congressman directed me to  meet with representatives from the National Organization for Women, the  National Abortion Rights League and Planned Parenthood during their recent trip  to Washington. Dr. Jerry Gideon sat in as well, since we both handle this issue  for Congressman Dornan.  </P> <P> Abortion is perhaps the most difficult issue for those with opposing views to  find common ground on which to agree. For a brief period of time there were  multiple discussions taking place. I think it is unfair to say that any  individual was being "rude" or "loudly pontificated." It was simply a spirited  discussion between two opposing sides -- something Gentry is very familiar with  as a former Democratic candidate for Congress.  </P> <P> Gideon and I tried to make the point that the issue of abortion is not a matter  of "choice" but of taking responsibility for conceiving a human being. Killing  a child is not and can never be a matter of choice or convenience. Both sides  know well that 99% of all abortions performed are for convenience and not to  protect the life of the mother.  </P> <P> In response to a question concerning abortions, Jerry responded that he  believes that many women become emotional and physical victims after having an  abortion. However, he stated quite clearly that the congressman does not  believe that the woman should be treated as a "criminal." He added that when  and if abortion becomes illegal there should be stiff criminal penalties for  the physician only.  </P> <P> I am sorry that the representatives of Planned Parenthood, the Abortion Rights  League and NOW left the office with such a negative opinion. That was not the  case when Planned Parenthood representatives met with Dornan last year and sent  him a follow up letter of appreciation for that meeting. I fear, however, that  in this instance these representatives are attempting, with their complaints,  to make our disagreement on this critical issues purely gender-based. Women  across the country are the power behind the pro-life movement just as they were  in successfully stopping passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.  </P> <P> Any attempt to dismiss the pro-life movement as rooted in chauvinism and  Victorian male-centered thought is not only seriously misguided but an act of  evasion from the real issue in this debate -- protecting innocent life.  </P> <P> MARGARET A. FOGARTY  </P> <P> Washington  </P> <P>  Fogarty manages Dornan's office in Washington.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The president of the lower chamber is allegedly one  of those responsible for the crisis which has been raging in the  country for over two years; he should at least have the heart to  admit it instead of trying to hang the responsibilty on others,  according to Deputy Fignole Jean-Louis, the president of the  National Front for Change and Democracy. The deputy says that  the appointment of a new prime minister will change nothing in  the current situation.    [Begin Jean-Louis recording] We think that Monde... [pauses]  We think that Deputy Monde contradicted himself. He should have  said instead... [pauses] He should be courageous enough to say  if the country has reached such a situation, he is one of those  who are responsible for the misfortune of the Haitian people,  for the (?heartbreaks) and the chronic miseries the Haitian  people are experiencing now because on 7 October [1991]....  [pauses] We know what happened here.    As for us, we could not enter the Senate, only Radio  Nationale and Television Nationale d'Haiti had the right to  enter on that day. What happened? After a vote favoring Article  148, which was ready to be sent to President Aristide in  Venezuela so he could choose a prime minister, which all  diplomats pretended to approve, Monde was the first one who set  up a scenario and came up with a piece of paper in his pocket  under the pretext that he had been arrested outside the  parliament. They began establishing the de facto governments on  the basis of a piece of paper upon which no parliamentarian cast  a vote. The current situation of the country is a consequence  of the successive de facto governments. So, he should be  courageous enough to say that we in the FNCD are not responsible  for this situation because since the beginning of the crisis we  said no, we do not agree with this matter of a coup d'etat  because the government was elected, and it was up to the people  to take a measure if they were not satisfied with the  government.

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LATINO DOCTORS  </P> <P> This is regarding "A Bitter Pill" (Dec. 13), about Mexican-trained  professionals, specifically medical doctors. It is a shame that these fine  people have to beg to work for manual labor positions due to the existing  "racial prejudice" mentality of Orange County.  </P> <P> That does not speak well of our county, considering its wealth and the  population being mostly of Latino descent. It is interesting to note that when  Civil Rights Commissioner Phil Montez goes to audit universities on their  "affirmative action" programs that the school administrators always claim that  there are "not any qualified minorities to fill existing positions." Of course,  that is not true, but school administrators just don't have the backbone to do  the right thing and hire from the local Latino community.  </P> <P> JAIME B. VEGA, Santa Ana  </P></p>

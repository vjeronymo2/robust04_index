			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peruvian minerals trader bought by Brazilians BRAZILIAN investors have acquired Minpeco USA, the North-American arm of Peruvian state-owned minerals trader Minpeco. The company was sold by auction on Monday at the Lima stock exchange. The sole bidder was Mercantile Industrial Inga, which has a long-established trading relationship in zinc metal and concentrates with Minpeco USA. Inga is associated with Ralbir, an investment group with Brazilian and Uruguayan capital. Minpeco USA went for Dollars 4.1m, the rock-bottom price acceptable to the parent company and the precise amount of the debt that it had to clear with its traditionally profitable US subsidiary. Last year Minpeco USA sold about Dollars 400m of minerals and turned in a modest profit of about Dollars 320,000. Mr Peter Warner, spokesman for Inga in Lima, said Minpeco had a 'fine reputation' and there were no plans to change the company name. 'Minpeco's strength is on the west coast of Latin America while ours is on the east coast, so there's a nice fit,' he said.</p>

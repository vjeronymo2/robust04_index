			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / R-R set to hold ballot on strike ENGINEERS AND technicians at Rolls-Royce's Bristol plant are set to ballot on strike action today over threatened compulsory redundancies, Diane Summers writes. MSF, the general technical union, said about 300 employees had volunteered for redundancy. But the company needed to shed a further 700 by March 26, after which redundancies would be compulsory. The ballot is due to follow a lobby of senior management and a rally of workers. Mr Alistair Fraser, a union official at the Bristol plant, said: 'It is madness that Rolls-Royce are considering throwing skilled engineers and technicians on to the dole when all the indications are that there will be an upturn in the world aerospace market. We will not pay the price of their mismanagement of the company and will resist compulsory redundancies at any cost. If this means a strike, then a strike it will be.' Rolls-Royce has cut 12,000 jobs in the past two years and plans a further cut of 5,000 jobs by the end of 1994. It has said the decline in military orders and turmoil in the world airline industry have forced a restructuring.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Observer: Wygod's treasure Meanwhile, another financier worth watching is Martin Wygod, who last week pulled off the Dollars 6bn sale of his nine-year-old company, Medco, to US drugs giant Merck. Wygod has done a good job building Medco into a market leader and deserves the near Dollars 100m he will collect on his shares in Medco. But should he also get a special finders fee? Back in 1984, it seems, his fellow directors agreed that Wygod would get 2 per cent of the consideration if the company were ever sold (they later cut this to 1 per cent.) Such fees are standard among private companies in the US, but less common in public ones. Wygod's nice little earner has already caught the attention of the United Shareholders Association pressure group, and it would be surprising if it did not attract a law suit from a disgruntled shareholder focussing on possible conflicts of interest. The fact that Wygod has agreed to reinvest the fee in Merck shares is not good enough.</p>

He said this when he  received four Indonesian journalists, one of whom was Nasir  Tamara from REPUBLIKA, at his office in Tel Aviv, Israel last  Monday evening. According to Rabin, there has been no official  timetable for mutual recognition and diplomatic relations.  However, he added that the two nations could first get to know  each other before establishing diplomatic relations.    "As Israeli prime minister, I hope that the establishment of  diplomatic relations will be realized as soon as possible.  However, we know that all this will be a long process and will  depend on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as well," said  Rabin.    Rabin believed that "the way to peace between Israel and the  Arabs is also through a rapproachement between Israel and the  Islamic World. Thus, support from Indonesia as a country which  has the largest Islamic population in the world will be very  important and crucial." Rabin said that he and President  Suharto "agreed to gradually create conditions -- business  relations, as an example -- to pave the way for better  relations" when he visited Jakarta some time ago. Rabin once  again reiterated that Israel "wants to coexist peacefully with  the Palestinians."    While the PLO has recognized the existence of Israel, Israel  itself has refused to recognize the existence of Palestine.  Khalid Mawardi, head of the Political Department of the  Nahdlatul Ulama [Association of Muslim Scholars] Central  Executive Committee, regarded the Israeli-PLO agreement signed  in Washington last year as an initial step and said the  agreement cannot strongly justify the establishment of  diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Israel.    According to Khalid, Israel remains a colonizer as long as  the Jewish state does not quit all Arab territories -- the West  Bank, Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, southern Lebanon, and the  Gaza Strip -- which it occupied during and after the 1967 war.    A similar reaction came from Sumargono, chairman of the  Indonesian Committee for Solidarity with the Islamic World.  "Israel is an aggressor as long as it continues to occupy Arab  territories. As this continues, it would be improper to have  diplomatic relations with Israel," he said. According to  Sumargono, Indonesian Muslims are not psychologically ready for  such relations. "There could be upheavals if this is done. The  Muslims are deeply injured over Israel's current brutal acts  against the Palestinians."    Mr. Riza Sihbudi, political observer from the Indonesian  Institute of Sciences and senior lecturer at the Department of  International Relations at the Faculty of Social and Political  Sciences of the University of Indonesia, said the establishment  of diplomatic relations with Israel is a sensitive issue. "We  must be careful. We must truly think about their advantages and  disadvantages," said Riza, the author of a book entitled "The  Middle East, Islamic World, and American Hegemony."</p>

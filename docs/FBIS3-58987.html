Loeschnak hopes that the judiciary will be able  to present an "intermediate result" for a bill of indictment by  the end of the month. The interior minister considers it a  proven fact that the attacks were carried out by "perpetrators  completely familiar with the right-wing scene in Austria, and  clearly xenophobic."    He believes that the suggestion by Joerg Haider, chairman of  the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], that by investigating the  right-wing scene the authorities were following a "dead-end  road," can only be explained by the fact that this is  "unpleasant" for Haider. After all, Horst Jakob Rosenkranz, the  husband of Lower Austrian FPOe deputy Barbara Rosenkranz, "was  clearly recognizable" on a video together with one of the  suspects.    This statement led to furious protests among the FPOe.  Haider described Loeschnak's attacks as "unjustified." He  stresed that, together with the ORF, Loeschnak is attempting to  disparage the whole FPOe.    Loeschnak admitted that government forces were "surprised"  at  the strength of the right-wing extremist scene. [passage  omitted]</p>

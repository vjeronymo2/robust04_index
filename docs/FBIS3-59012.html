The two mainly discussed the  conditions of application of Community aid to the organization  and, in particular, the appropriation of ECU500 million decided  by member states immediately after the signing of the Treaty of  Washington in September between Israel and the PLO. Mr. 'Arafat  has announced that an estimated budget will be brought to the  Community's knowledge and that of other donors in order to  enable them to determine the cost of installation of the  Palestinian authorities in the occupied territories and in the  first phase in Gaza and Jericho. Mr. Marin recalled the  priorities laid down by member states in the use of Community  aid, especially toward social sectors: education, health and  training. A Palestinian delegation of experts will be in  Brussels, probably in February, for more in-depth talks on this  matter.</p>

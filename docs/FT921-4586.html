			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Election win 'will spark UK share rise' THE stock market would rise from current levels by the year-end whether Labour or the Conservative party formed the next government, according to research from stockbrokers James Capel. However, the report says a hung parliament would leave the FT-SE 100 index around the 2,400 level because of the ensuing political and economic uncertainty Initially, the report suggests, a Labour victory would be greeted by a 10 per cent sell-off while a Conservative win would trigger a similar rise. However, by the year-end the FT-SE would have risen to about 2,750 after a Labour win, only 250 below the level it would attain if the Conservatives were returned. The research, based on replies from 105 of the largest companies in the FTA All-Share Index, throws up a strikingly different view of the likely election outcome from recent opinion polls. More than half the respondents said they thought the Conservatives would be returned, 32 per cent forecast a hung Parliament and only 6 per cent expected Labour to form the next government. An overwhelming 86 per cent of respondents believed that a Labour victory would be bad for the economy. However, only 63 per cent believed a Labour victory would be bad for their own businesses. Altogether 79 per cent of respondents said a Labour government should not devalue sterling within the ERM but more than half believed it would do exactly that. Sectors likely to suffer if Labour is returned would be: The conglomerates, where stricter regulation of acquisitions is expected; Consumer stocks, which would be hit by higher levels of personal taxation; Housing, in spite of higher spending on public projects; Labour-intensive businesses, as wages would rise due to adoption of the Social Charter; Regulated utilities. While the Labour Party's attempts to woo supporters in the City might have won over some people, the James Capel survey shows corporate boards remain wary. More than two thirds said they would not invest more if Labour persisted with plans to introduce tax incentives to encourage investment spending. And 59 per cent believed Labour was planning dividend controls.</p>

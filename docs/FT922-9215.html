			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Acas reports slow growth in derecognition DERECOGNITION of unions, especially for supervisory, technical and professional jobs, is being considered by a 'slowly growing number of employers', according to the annual report of Acas, the conciliation service. Nevertheless, the report also points to a greater readiness on the part of individuals and unions to use the law against employers by taking unfair dismissal and discrimination cases to industrial tribunals. Acas, which has a statutory duty to conciliate between employee and employer before a case goes to a tribunal, saw a large increase in its workload in individual and collective cases last year. In the first quarter of this year, individual conciliation cases have increased by 40 per cent over the same period last year. Of the 60,605 individual conciliation cases last year, a 16 per cent rise over 1990, only 32 per cent went to tribunals. Sex discrimination cases rose by 119 per cent to 3,500. That was because of a wave of cases influenced by the European Court's Barber judgment, which extended the definition of equal pay to include pensions. Sir Douglas Smith, Acas chairman, also pointed to cultural changes that had led to a greater readiness by women to go to court. Unions, too, had changed their attitudes and 'are much more ready to ensure that members are aware of their statutory rights'. Although that is a sign of unions having less leverage through collective bargaining on matters such as election for redundancy, Sir Douglas said he did not believe unions were terminally weakened. He said national union leaders were more pragmatic than they used to be, but union strength often remained considerable at local level. Sir Douglas said he did not believe that employers wanted to scrap the Bridlington rules, through which the Trades Union Congress regulates disputes between unions. He also expects much more work involving the public sector  - hitherto four fifths of Acas's work has been in the private sector  - as new, more devolved industrial relations are introduced into many public services. The Acas report said it had already intervened in National Health Service trusts where 'there often remains a lack of expertise and experience (in industrial relations) among local managers and trade union reps alike'. The report also warns public-sector managers not to embrace uncritically performance-related pay at a time when the private sector's experience is becoming 'more mixed' and some employers are re-examining the advantages and disadvantages.

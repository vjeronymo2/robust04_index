			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Observer: Official rescue It is not often that the British government has a lot to thank Mexico for, but Prime Minister John Major and his embattled chancellor should light a candle for their counterparts in Mexico City. Normally the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development issues its annual review of the UK economy around this time of year. Bearing in mind the UK's economic woes, the next report wouldn't make happy reading for a government desperate for good news. But Mexico - which wants to join the 24-nation think-tank - stepped in and asked the OECD at short notice to run the rule over its economy as a prelude to membership. The only way this was possible was for the OECD economists who would have written the UK report to switch their attention to Latin America. The sighs of relief from Great George Street are almost audible. Had the organisation's report appeared on schedule, Treasury officials might even have had to interrupt chancellor Norman Lamont's Italian holiday to deal with it. It probably won't appear now till early next year.</p>

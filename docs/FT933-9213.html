			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Mystery over bomb attacks in Chilean cities AT LEAST five bombs exploded overnight in the Chilean capital and the southern city of Concepcion, causing some damage but no injuries, police said yesterday, AP reports from Santiago. No one claimed responsibility for the blasts and there was no indication if the attacks came from Chile's left or right. The blasts in Santiago were at an office of the Christian Democratic party - the leading party in the ruling centre-left coalition government - at the Supreme Court, a bank and at a Chilean government office. The bomb at Concepcion, south of the capital, shattered windows at offices of the state-sector coal mining company.</p>

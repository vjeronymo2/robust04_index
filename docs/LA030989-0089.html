			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGER OVER PUBLIC FUNDS FOR BOARDING SCHOOL  </P> <P> This is in response to the article (Jan. 26) written by Jesse Katz on the use  of public funds to send a dyslexic girl to an expensive boarding school in  Massachusetts. In that article, he also mentioned my frustrating situation in  not being able to get adequate services for my learning-disabled child.  </P> <P> My hat is off to Katz for bringing this to the public eye. The public has a  right to know where its tax dollars are going.  </P> <P> I find myself very angry at this outrageous injustice. Here I am, with a  beautiful child with medical needs, whom I love as much as any parent with  money, and I can't get him the help he needs. It seems if you have money and  position, you not only can get help, but you can get somebody else to pay for  it.  </P> <P> Further, I cannot believe that their child could not have been well-served  within Ventura County.  </P> <P> But the thing that bothers me the most, besides the obvious abuse of the system  and the belief that at least a dozen children could have gotten services for  what is being spent on only one child, is how anyone can truly believe that it  is in the best interest of the child to be sent to the opposite end of the  country, away from her parents.  </P> <P> JUDITH A.

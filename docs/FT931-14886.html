			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Stanley Leisure slips but detects signs of recovery STANLEY Leisure Org-anisation, the betting shop, casino and snooker club group, yesterday reported a slight drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 3.53m in the six months to November 1. The group also said it had recently detected the first signs of a recovery in spending due to lower interest rates. Mr Leonard Steinberg, chairman, said: 'People don't want to be miserable. They want to go out and spend it', but he added that high levels of unemployment were likely to prove a continuing restraint on confidence. The profits setback was struck from turnover 8 per cent ahead at Pounds 108.5m. Mr Steinberg said the period was the worst he had experienced in 38 years in the gaming industry. He added: 'We believe that while the recession is not yet over, a slow upturn has started. As a result, we remain confident and look forward to the next financial year with a degree more optimism than previously'. Stanley will have more than 350 betting shops after next month's completion of its acquisition of 26 Surrey Racing betting shops in Scotland for Pounds 2.99m. During the half year, the racing division showed a slight improvement, but this was mainly due to turnover from acquisitions, and the average stake per slip increased only marginally, from Pounds 3.38 to Pounds 3.42p. Gross margins were slightly down, after a run of unfavourable results during the summer. Stanley's 17 provincial casinos, which contribute about half of group profits, saw a slight fall in turnover, coupled with an improvement in margin. The spend per head was flat at Pounds 84. Mr Steinberg said: 'Trading has improved since the half-year, with the casino division showing greater signs of an upturn. Betting turnover had also improved, but margins are under some pressure.' Earnings per share were down from 5.82p to 5.48p. The interim dividend is held at 1.52p.</p>

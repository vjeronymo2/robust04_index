Vladimir Bezkorovannyy,  commander of Ukraine's Naval Forces, believes the naval vessels  of the coastal service of the Black Sea Fleet must be divided  equally between Russia and Ukraine. However, in the opinion of  Valeriy Kuznetsov, adviser to the Crimean president for military  issues, Ukraine is not capable of financing combat training even  with the minimum of vessels at its disposal.    The Black Sea Fleet numbers more than 100 naval vessels in  all; of these only five are Ukrainian. At the same time, as  Valeriy Kuznetsov emphasized, Ukraine has substantially  increased the number of its ground armed forces on the territory  of Crimea. Here there are now about 50,000 Ukrainian servicemen  together with their construction units.    Ukraine is probably afraid of the processes that are taking  place in Crimea, Valeriy Kuznetsov said, because Crimea is  Russian in spirit.</p>

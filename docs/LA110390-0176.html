			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS PROTEST PROPOSED SITE OF UNIVERSITY HOUSE  </P> <P> UC Irvine's graduate student leaders have passed a resolution demanding that a  planned chancellor's residence be built somewhere other than a four-acre  plateau that biology professors regard as the most environmentally sensitive  area on campus.  </P> <P> The resolution, passed unanimously Thursday night by the Associated Graduate  Students of UCI, also asks the university to conduct an environmental impact  study of the project.  </P> <P> "We took this action because the university has plans to build the University  House in an area of our campus that is the habitat for a very rare bird," said  Kevin Kandalaft, president of the graduate students' council. "We see it as  needless destruction of that habitat when the house can just as easily be  moved."  </P> <P> University House, the chancellor's official residence as well as an  entertainment facility and guest quarters, is scheduled for construction on a  hilltop near the southern edge of campus. The university already has launched a  drive to raise $3 million in donations for the 13,500-square foot building,  which would have a panoramic view of the campus, Upper Newport Bay, Newport  Beach and the ocean beyond.  </P> <P> But the hilltop is also one of the last and best stands of coastal sage scrub  on campus, and it is home to about half a dozen nesting California  gnatcatchers. The small darting bird is disappearing so rapidly throughout its  coastal range that federal wildlife officials are studying it for possible  emergency listing as an endangered species.  </P> <P> The plateau is also home to a very rare spring-blooming plant known as Dudleya  multicaulis, and to nesting cactus wrens, another increasingly uncommon bird  that once was abundant throughout much of Southern California.  </P> <P> A recent university-commissioned survey of the hilltop determined some measures  could be taken to ensure survival of the rare plant and the cactus wrens if the  University House is built. But it concluded that construction would have  "unavoidable adverse impacts" on the gnatcatcher.  </P> <P> However, university officials say they have a new design for the building and  accompanying parking and picnic areas that would minimize the impact on the  birds and the plant.  </P> <P> They have said they will not consider moving the site, and they plan to break  ground on the project in spring, 1991.  </P> <P> The graduate students said the council acted after campus biologists alerted  them to the environmental issues. The students emphasized their support for a  chancellor's house on campus.  </P></p>

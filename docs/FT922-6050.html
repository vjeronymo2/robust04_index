			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Too few fish in the sea / Describing why the livelihood of New England fishermen is threatened by reduced quotas Sonny McIntire, an aging Maine fisherman, drew his boat into harbour with a visible frown on his face. Together with his two sons, he inspected their daily catch, then slowly shook his head. 'We put out twice the traps we used to and catch half as many lobsters,' he said sadly. McIntire's complaints are echoed throughout the once-thriving fishing villages that dot New England's jagged coast. The fishing industry, an important part of the region's economy, has been thrown into chaos as fishing trips bring in ever shrinking yields. The reason for the problem is simple - there are too many fishermen in the sea. During the 1970s and 1980s, the federal government saw fishing as the perfect way to stimulate the New England economy. It offered low interest rates on boats, and tax incentives for anyone wanting to get started. The region applauded the efforts as a way to boost a pollution-free industry. But no one was prepared for the ecological disaster which followed. Marine biologists say the situation has never been more critical, and that the bio-mass of some stocks - particularly haddock and redfish - has dwindled to less than 10 per cent of its original level. Now, the fishermen find themselves caught in a painful situation. To make more money, they need to catch more fish, but to increase the number of fish in the ocean they have to catch fewer. Despite the hard times, fishermen say they are still managing to scrape out a living, but that could soon change. Federal laws set to go into effect soon would cut the region's fishing quotas to just a fraction of their former levels. 'It could put most of us out of business,' said Joe Testaverde, a Gloucester fisherman. New England fishermen are especially bitter about proposals to slash their tuna quota. Prodded by the International Commission for Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, the US government agreed to cut its bluefin tuna harvest 10 per cent by 1993. Moreover, the National Marine Fisheries Service decided to increase quotas for recreational tuna angling. 'I just don't understand,' said McIntire, who switches from lobster to tuna during the summer months. 'Weekend fishermen could just catch and release, but we need to make a living.' Sports anglers catch some 40 per cent of the 65,000 tuna landed in the US each year, according to Andrew Applegate, analyst at the New England Fisheries Management Council. The catch has been well in excess of their legal quota, since recreational fishermen are subject to little government monitoring. Because they overrun their limits by such a large margin, recreational fishermen have successfully argued that their quotas are too small. Over the next few months, their official limit is set to more than double. William Fox, assistant administrator of fisheries, insists recreational fishermen have not been given preferential treatment. 'They will suffer more than commercial fishermen from some of the new rules, including ones which forbid the landing of smaller fish,' he says. The bluefin tuna, a fast, crafty fish which can reach up to 12 feet in length, has attracted the attention of environmental activists around the world. Because the fish can migrate large distances - some marine biologists claim to have tracked the fish over thousands of miles - ecologists formed an international commission to help protect the species. The bluefin is popular with sportsmen because it is notoriously difficult to catch. The fish is popular with commercial fishermen for another reason: it is extremely profitable. Most of the tuna landed in the US is sold for about Dollars 10 a pound to consumers in Japan, who consider the bluefin a delicacy. Since the giant fish reaches about 700-800 pounds, a single catch can yield Dollars 8,000 or more. The International Commission for Conservation of Atlantic Tuna has been pushing for more controls on tuna fishing for at least a decade. A widely-agreed 10 per cent quota reduction represents one of its biggest victories, but the commission continues to battle for even stricter controls. The reduction in tuna quotas is just one of the problems facing New England fishermen, though. Two US environmental groups, the Audubon Society and the Conservation Law Foundation, entered a lawsuit last year against the National Marine Fisheries Service for allowing the stocks of groundfish - such as cod and haddock - to fall to dangerously low levels. In response to the lawsuit, the federal government asked the New England Fisheries Management Council to come up with new rules to revitalise the fish population. The council proposed halving the number of days fishermen can spend at sea, a suggestion which angers the fishermen. In the New England fishing village of Gloucester, fishermen attended a public meeting recently where they presented an alternative plan. The Gloucester Plan, as it has been dubbed, accepts some reductions in fishing, but far less than those proposed by the Management Council. After the meeting broke up, the fishermen and their families lingered to air their concerns. 'They say 'get another job' but there is no other job,' said Daniel Sullivan, who works on one of the boats in the area. Unemployment in the Gloucester, at 15 per cent, is one of the highest in Massachusetts. Some New England fishermen call for federal subsidies to help buoy them through the crisis. Others favour the use of hatcheries and investment in the development of better fishing technology to reduce the rates of fish mortality on the seas. 'Many of the fish die unnecessarily,' admits fisherman Joseph Cracchiolo. 'They are too small to sell, and we have to throw them back in the sea dead. If we had better equipment, that wouldn't happen.' The National Marine Fisheries Service, however, believes hatcheries would be ineffectual. Moreover, they warn that tighter fishing quotas could be in the pipeline. Most fishermen know that something needs to be done. But they worry that if they cut back further, they will be forced to get out of the business altogether. For many, who have been in fishing families for four or even five generations, the thought is painful. 'It's a way of life,' said McIntire, whose great-grandfather, grandfather and father forged a living as fishermen off Maine. 'I just hope that whatever happens, it will be fair.'</p>

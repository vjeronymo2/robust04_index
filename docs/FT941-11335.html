			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Armani takes control of Simint Mr Giorgio Armani, the Italian fashion designer, has become the biggest shareholder in the troubled Simint clothing group after buying out a close business associate. Mr Armani and his sister Rosanna are together buying the 21.71 per cent stake held by Finarte, the auction group controlled by Mr Francesco Micheli, a Milan financier. Milan analysts said the stake was being divided between Mr Armani, who already holds about 20 per cent of the quoted Simint group, and his sister, to avoid triggering a compulsory takeover bid. The Simint saga illustrates the risks and rewards of investing in the fashion world. Mr Micheli, who took control of Simint in the late 1980s, helped steer a strong recovery under new management. Earnings rose steadily and, in 1992, Simint even joined the select group of Italian companies to issue American depository receipts on Wall Street. Since then, the story has been less positive. Simint, which specialises in producing clothing under licence for well-known designers, has been affected by high debts and stagnant demand in the recession-hit clothing market. It has been particularly affected by the 1991 decision to join forces with Mr Armani in developing a relatively low-priced store chain in the US. Although the shops, named Armani Exchange (A/X) share the designer's name and sell exclusively Armani-labelled wares, Simint bore the development costs. Heavy investment spending in the US venture has largely accounted for the sharp reversal in recent performance. Net profits for the year ended April 1993 fell to L1.6bn (Dollars 946,000) from L17.5bn. For the first half of this year, the group reported a L12.8bn loss against pre-tax profits of L6.6bn. Mr Micheli justified his decision to sell out on the grounds that Simint's US venture had become too risky.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Blenheim revamps management Blenheim Group, the acquisitive international exhibition organiser which has seen its share price drop by more than 40 per cent this year, yesterday announced a management reshuffle. Mr Philip Soar is stepping aside from his post as chief executive to become director of planning and strategy. Mr Staffan Svenby, 49, a Swede who joined the UK group in 1991, has been appointed managing director. Blenheim, once a highly rated stock, suffered a blow to its credibility in September after BZW, joint broker with Credit Lyonnais Laing, cut its profit forecast for the second time in three months. There was irritation in the City that the reduced profits outlook emerged so soon after a convertible share issue in June, in which Blenheim raised Pounds 75.8m to fund acquisitions. Mr Neville Buch, chairman and founder of Blenheim, denied speculation by some analysts that Mr Soar was being blamed for the group's derating. Mr Buch said: 'If anyone was going to carry the can, they would have been sacked.' He said Mr Svenby was a hands-on manager and would pursue the group's policy of trying to get closer to the needs of consumers. Mr Svenby joined the group when Blenheim acquired his company, Sydexpo, one of Sweden's few independent exhibition companies. He was appointed to Blenheim's main board in February and earlier this year became chairman of the company's executive committee. Mr Soar, who joined Blenheim as managing director in 1990, is credited with improving computer systems and management controls at the group, which had expanded rapidly through acquisitions mainly in the France and the US. He is to concentrate on developing medium and long-term strategies, especially in information provision, new technologies and marketing. Mr Buch was keen to dispel City concerns that Blenheim might be entering business publishing in a big way. The chairman said it would limit itself to providing publications for exhibition users. Mr Ulrich Kromer has also resigned as an executive director, following the merger of Blenheim's Swiss interests with Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EECO NEGOTIATING TO SELL COMPUTER KEYBOARD BUSINESS  </P> <P> Pressed by its bankers to repay more than $8 million in loans, EECO Inc., a  Santa Ana electronics manufacturer, said Wednesday that it is negotiating to  sell its computer keyboard business based in Arizona and the Mexican state of  Sonora.  </P> <P> EECO wouldn't disclose its asking price nor identify the buyer.  </P> <P> But a sale of the money-losing keyboard business could put EECO back in the  black, Chairman Robert B. Bonney said.  </P> <P> Late last year, EECO was saying it could turn the keyboard business around  despite strong competition and internal problems.  </P> <P> The unit, called Maxi-Switch, had already decided to lay off workers to cut  costs.  </P> <P> But EECO's bankers wouldn't wait. EECO said Wednesday that its major lender  extended a loan agreement until the end of March. Then, however, the bank can  demand the approximately $8.5 million it is owed.  </P> <P> Under the loan extension agreement, the bank can pull the plug even earlier  than the end of the month if the negotiations to sell the keyboard unit fall  through.  </P> <P> EECO said that if the bank calls in its loan it isn't sure it can get financing  elsewhere, and it hinted that the company may face bankruptcy.  </P> <P> The bankers had been cooperating in keeping the company afloat, Bonney said.  </P> <P> EECO has struggled since 1986 with falling profits, the ailing keyboard  business, a $13.2-million loss in its fiscal 1989 year and a $612,000 loss for  the nine-month period ended Oct. 1. The company has been selling some of its  assets to repay its loans.  </P> <P> EECO's computer keyboard unit in Scotland, which the company says is more  profitable than the Tucson-based operation, is not part of the sale.  </P> <P> The company also makes electromechanical switches for electronic products like  stereos; "pad" or flat, keyboards used in appliances like microwaves and  certain phones; and computer systems used to manage hotels.  </P></p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Hongkong Electric sets up HKDollars 1bn paper programme THE Hongkong Electric Company (HEC) yesterday said it had arranged a HKDollars 1bn (USDollars 129.4m) commercial paper programme with 23 financial institutions extending over 5 years. The programme, arranged by Wardley Capital but which is not underwritten, will enable HEC to raise either US or Hong Kong dollar-denominated commercial paper for periods of one month to 12 months. It enables the company to raise fixed-rate finance for periods of 12 months to 60 months in either currency. Mr Howard Welsh, HEC's finance director, said the facility would allow the company to take advantage of competitive funding opportunities as they may arise. 'We are delighted by the strong support demonstrated by the financial community for the programme,' he said. The 23 financial institutions would act as a tender panel although HEC was allowed to accept unsolicited bids from any member of the panel, Mr Walsh said. HEC is owned by Hutchison Whampoa's listed subsidiary Cavendish International. It operates Hong Kong island's electricity monopoly.</p>

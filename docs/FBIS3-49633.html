			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Some pronouncements by European politicians on the  state of Slovakia's preparedness to join NATO and other  structures have not been very flattering. Slovak President  Michal Kovac commented on such statements as follows:    [Begin Kovac recording] We have noted that representatives  of  some NATO countries failed to mention the Slovak Republic.  Differences in the economic standards of individual countries  should not determine whether or not they join Partnership for  Peace. We discussed this issue with President Clinton, urging  him to exert an influence on his partners in NATO member states  so that they stop leaving Slovakia out of this group, either  intentionally or unintentionally. President Clinton said that  America will not do this, now or in the future, and that he will  speak to other representatives along these lines.    I think, however, that the whole issue will be resolved  simply because Slovakia -- just like the three other [Visegrad]  states -- has clearly stated that it is joining Partnership for  Peace and is ready to sign the relevant treaties and documents,  and to observe them. I think that once this has taken place the  issue of omitting Slovakia and so on will have become quite  pointless. [end recording]</p>

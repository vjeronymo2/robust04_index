			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Lower Saxony election forecast Two weeks before a state election in Lower Saxony, a poll by the German television station Sat 1 shows the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Bundnis 90/Greens would be able to form a so-called 'red-green' coalition government, agencies report from Bonn. The SPD is currently supported by 47 per cent of the voters while the Bundnis 90/Greens are supported by 8 per cent. The Christian Democratic Union is currently polling 38 per cent of the vote. Nationwide, however, a poll shows a mild upswing in support for the CDU.</p>

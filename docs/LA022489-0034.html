			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> The Grateful Dead has canceled a series of March concerts in Oakland because  citizens complained that fans of the rock band would despoil their neighborhood  and use their yards as restrooms. "The Grateful Dead does not want to be  perceived as coming in and ruining the neighborhood," concert producer Bob  Barsotti said after an emotional meeting Wednesday with Oakland Convention  Center directors. "Until we can come up with some solution, I don't want to  bring these concerts here." About two dozen convention center neighbors  applauded his statements. Police issued 370 citations and made 28 arrests  during three Grateful Dead concerts at the convention center two weeks ago.  "The sex acts, urination, defecation, drug use -- it's unreal," neighborhood  leader Elaine Schiano said. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

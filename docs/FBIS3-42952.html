Samadov, chairman of  the Council of Ministers of Tajikistan, took place in Moscow. As  the head of a government delegation, he had many meetings,  consultations, and negotiations here. Nevertheless, this busy  working visit remained outside the attention of the  press--probably undeservedly. Major policies are not made in  front of television cameras or receptions filled with pomp.    [Chernyshev] Abduzhalil Akhadovich, what was the main thrust  of the meetings and negotiations you had in Russia?    [Samadov] It is not, of course, meetings per se that are  important for the fate of the people. What follows is important.  To summarize the results briefly, they reinforced the feeling in  me that Russia not only shares the pain and hopes of Tajik  people. Just like us, Russia is sincerely ready for mutually  beneficial cooperation at the new level of our relations. The  totalitarian past is behind us, and what is ahead is an era of  the civilized market and respect for human rights and dignity.  So we came with the intention of working in this era. In Moscow  we made an important comparison of viewpoints--they are similar  across the entire spectrum of Russian-Tajik relations.    Russia, Uzbekistan, and other CIS countries have been and  will remain our main partners in the foreseeable future. Up to  80 percent of the Tajik economy is contingent upon CIS  countries. And it hardly makes sense for the Commonwealth, with  Russia as its centripetal center, to reject the economic  opportunities of the Tajik market. In terms of not only raw  materials but also finished products.    [Chernyshev] The opinions has been voiced in the Russian  press that bringing a number of CIS states back into the ruble  zone will cause a new round of inflation in the economy. What  can you say on this subject?    [Samadov] Such a viewpoint has a right to exist. But let us  look at this phenomenon from another angle as well. Expansion of  the ruble zone will boost, launch, develop, and strengthen  production, economic, and many other ties. Tajikistan, for  instance, is ready to supply cotton, fruit, vegetables, and  other products. But we need metal, equipment, petroleum  products, and many other things. In the situation of separate  "zones," that is, disrupted ties, Russian textile enterprises  began to experience a dearth of cotton; the trade sector needs  cheap fruit, vegetables, canned products; other consumers need  the variety of products previously supplied by Tajikistan. In  the Russian market all this was being made up for by shipments  of goods mainly from West Europe. For hard currency, of course.  Because the West does not want to buy those Russian products  that in the past went to Tajikistan. Which means that having  broken the ties with the CIS countries, the Russian economy and  society were subjected to a great cataclysm, a shock. But this  did not translate into therapy; in a number of places production  declined sharply. Has the ruble become stronger for this? Has  the people's situation improved? Has domestic production gone up?    We heard these kinds of biting questions and opinions from  competent Russian specialists in finance, economics, and  production. This means that we need different mechanisms to  carry out the tasks we have set for ourselves. Therefore we  noted with great satisfaction the position of a number of deputy  groups and factions in the State Duma and the Federation  Council, the leadership of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Finance and Central Bank of Russia, and ministries and  agencies--a position that is close to the way we see things: The  way to strengthen the ruble should be sought not in narrowing  down its sphere of circulation but, on the contrary, in  expanding it. We cannot look at this problem from the position  of a small merchant. Which is: obtain ruble credit in one place,  turn it over in another, then pocket the profit and pay off  debts. The state economy works according to a different scheme.  We have to look at this process more broadly. For instance, if  Russian rubles begin to flow into the Tajik zone, a certain  shortage of rubles will emerge in Russia itself, as you might  easily guess. The rising demand for the ruble will in turn  affect the exchange rate--it will go up. Of course, not  everything is this simple in real life. This aspect and many  others related to Tajikistan's entry into the ruble zone will be  considered soon by a group of authoritative Russian experts,  whose arrival we are expecting in Dushanbe.    We, in turn, also intend to establish appropriate control to  keep our economy from living on cheap rubles. The point is to  make financial resources reflect adequately in the movement of  many other resources, assist in their forward movement. It is  clear that we do not intend to play the role of spongers in the  ruble zone.    I will ask you a teaser. What do you think: Will the  position  of the American dollar become stronger or weaker if the zone of  its circulation becomes limited only to the territory of the  United States? I doubt that even one American economist will  answer this question in the affirmative. So I also believe that  the ruble zone can and should expand, and the ruble should  become a full-fledged international means of payment.    [Chernyshev] This means that to the relief of business  circles of two countries we may say that after Tajikistan joins  the ruble zone the problem of nonpayments will also become a  thing of the past?    [Samadov] Undoubtedly. Mostly we have inherited nonpayments  as a legacy from the Soviet past. But there is a time for  everything. You do not start building a house with the roof. The  same goes for us: We have to create the proper conditions for  normal economic relations, their legislative foundation. Be our  guests--trade, work, build. Our government will be only too glad  to help. But any particular deals and operations are a  prerogative of the parties to the agreement. Since as a result  of the crisis Tajik society has experienced a textbook case of  force majeure across the entire complex of production, trade,  financial, and other ties with CIS countries, we see it as one  of our vital tasks to prevent this sort of event happening in  the future. When the economy begins to grow, there will be no  reason for people to gather at rallies. They will be busy with  the business at hand. It is like a system of communicating  vessels.    We are very grateful to all those partners in Russia and CIS  countries who, at a difficult time for our motherland, supplied  us with food, clothes, petroleum products, raw materials, and  parts... Behind this stream of rather costly resources was and  is the labor of tens of thousands people. Although we are living  through a very difficult period, I dare say that the time will  come when not a single person will regret helping Tajikistan in  its hour of hardship. This is not in our national character.    [Chernyshev] In your opinion, which directions of  Russian-Tajik cooperation are most promising today?    [Samadov] Practically any sphere. Our traditional export  products. The development of mineral deposits, in which we have  nearly all the elements in the Mendeleyev table. The extensive  potential of agricultural production. But we have to start  small. Areas that can bring tangible returns in the near future,  establish solid ties. Tajikistan has, for instance, great places  for health spas and recreation. We have many resort zones,  including those with curative hot springs. This is a launching  pad for the development of prestigious 7,000-meter-high mountain  resorts. I could spend hours telling you about our land of  plenty, blessed by sun and nature. Spring will come soon to the  southern parts. Valleys will be covered with emerald greenery  and a sea of flowers. Better come and see for yourself. But it  is better still to come to work rather than vacation. We will do  everything to bring people's living standards up to commonly  recognized norms, to establish their direct economic interests.  This applies to a full extent to Russians as well. Especially  those who were literally forced to leave Tajikistan.    As to certain concerns regarding political instability, I  can  tell you unequivocally: Life is getting back to normal. Today  there are no more dangers facing you in our land than in any  other country. "Isolated incidents" can happen anywhere, and  they do not happen by the will of governments or peoples.    [Chernyshev] How will the economic reform that is underway  in  your country affect Tajikistan's export potential in the near  future?    [Samadov] The economic reform is a component of our merging  with the Russian economy. We have laws on property, enterprise,  and investment that are similar in many respects... Moreover, we  envisage additional steps that will create a most favorable  status for Russian entrepreneurs. We do not envisage any  obstacles or barriers to the movement of capital.    The formula of our reform is to put in motion productive  forces in Tajik society, to put into action most effectively its  rich economic, scientific, and spiritual potential. To ensure  the formation of a dynamic market economy and the priority of  human rights and dignity, which are deeply consonant with  fundamental values and views in the East and the  sociopsychological traits of our peoples. We are striving to  manage without a ponderous administrative apparatus and red tape  in dealing with various matters. And most importantly, to create  conditions for the forward development of society while not  permitting the state to interfere in the life of its citizens  and entrepreneurs. Our economy must have a "Tajik face." We do  not have any other path to revival.</p>

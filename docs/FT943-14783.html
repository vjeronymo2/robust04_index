			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Clarke pitches for 'hard centre' Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday joined ideological battle with Mr Tony Blair, front-runner for the Labour leadership, with a pledge that the Conservatives would occupy the 'hard centre' of British politics. In a speech staking out the territory on which the two main parties will fight the next general election, the chancellor warned his rightwing Tory colleagues that the party had to respond to the new insecurities of the middle classes. The increasing numbers facing temporary unemployment as the economy changed wanted to know that there was a high-quality health and education system on which their families could depend. The middle manager from middle England also wanted to know that there was a 'modernised, affordable welfare system which will assist him with the means to retrain and find new employment'. But Mr Clarke was equally adamant that Britain could not escape the realities of the intensified competition of global markets. 'Stop the world, I want to get off' was simply not an option, he said. He added that alongside the security of the welfare state both the least well-off and the citizens of middle England wanted to keep 'more of every extra pound they earn or save'. That meant a sustained squeeze on public spending and further cuts in marginal tax rates. In his lecture at the London School of Economics to the Social Market Foundation, he dismissed the idea that markets and social stability were inevitably in conflict and said Labour was engaged in a desperate struggle to come to terms with market forces. For all Mr Blair's talk of a 'dynamic market economy' the opposition still depended on the notion of 'collective power' to assist the individual. The lecture brought an immediate attack from Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, who accused Mr Clarke of 'panicking in the face of renewed confidence on the left'. Mr Brown said recognition by the government that crude free market theory had had its day would be greeted by the electorate with a mixture of 'amusement and incredulity'. Mr Clarke flatly rejected the argument that belief in market forces led to an atomisation of society and corroded the nation's institutions. Instead he insisted that by harnessing market signals in areas such as health, education and police, the government was strengthening the welfare state. The chancellor said the task of the government was to explain that 'our agenda will continue to reconcile free market principles with an enlightened social policy. Free market principles underwrite institutions, they do not undermine them'. He added that market principles such as choice and accountability strengthened the local institutions which bound together individuals. Reforms in the health, education and police services reinforced the sense of 'ownership' on the part of local citizens. Such an approach combined the best of the Conservatives' One Nation tradition with Thatcherite determination.</p>

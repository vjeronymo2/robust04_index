			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- The National Council of  Christian Churches of South Korea in a policy discussion of the  reunification committee June 10 said that the U.S.-led move of  "sanctions" against the North might get on its nerve and  demanded that "the United States stop utterances and acts  creating tensions on the Korean peninsula," a Seoul-based radio  said.    Noting that the authorities' inconsistent "policy" towards  the North increases the confusion and uneasiness of the people,  the organisation decided to strongly urge the puppet authorities  to "shape and promote a reunification policy giving top priority  to the existence and peace of the nation."    The Federation of Christian Social Movement in a recent  statement clarified its stand opposed to "`sanctions' against  the North," that heightens the war crisis.</p>

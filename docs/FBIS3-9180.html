Has the government adopted measures to  liquidate this daily?    [Moravcik] The government does not have the means to  liquidate dailies. Or does it? The press ought to be  independent, also economically. I believe that it can fulfill  its role only when it is independent.    [REPUBLIKA] In other words, you have not dealt with the  liquidation of REPUBLIKA in the government?    [Moravcik] No, not yet.</p>

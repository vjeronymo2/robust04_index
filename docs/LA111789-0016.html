			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSLIM SCARVES  </P> <P> The article "Muslim Schoolgirl Scarves Banned: France in a Furor" (Part A, Nov.  7) points up the importance of freedom of religion as enshrined in our Bills of  Rights.  </P> <P> It seems incredible that three teen-age Muslim girls in France can so arouse a  whole country over so simple an issue as an article of clothing. Certainly no  one talks about banning topless bikinis from the French Riviera but somehow  Muslim girls modestly wearing head scarves to public school is an emotional  issue. What is at issue, however, is the question of religious freedom. And  when it comes to Islam, the French schools and the anti-religious intellectuals  are still fighting the Crusades.  </P> <P> While these independent-minded teen-agers would be heralded as a new group of  liberated women heroically standing up to a society's status quo if they were  anything but Muslim, that conviction alone seems to be the reason for their  expulsion from school.  </P> <P> The issue is not one of an "attempt to convert others to their religion" as the  school principal ridiculously insists. According to this logic, priests, nuns,  ministers and others should remove their religious clothes and wearing crosses  and Jewish stars should be banned, too.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the wife of President Francois Mitterand, the archbishop of Paris  and a French rabbi, supporting these girls' rights, have sided with light  against darkness. Bravo for all clear-minded thinkers in a world where  irrationality too often prevails.  </P> <P> MAIMOONA M. AHMED  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates  </P></p>

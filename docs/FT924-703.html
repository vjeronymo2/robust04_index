			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Berlitz clears the way for Japanese bid BERLITZ, the language school and publishing group that was once part of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's empire, yesterday said it had resolved a number of outstanding differences with the court-appointed administrators of the Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC). The agreements should help clear the way for the planned takeover of Berlitz by Fukutake, a Japanese publisher. The Fukutake deal was contingent upon the resolution of disputes about financial obligations among Berlitz; MCC, which is operating under US bankruptcy proceedings; and Macmillan, the publishing subsidiary of MCC. The issues that were settled yesterday include an agreement under which Macmillan will transfer to Berlitz 180,000 shares of Berlitz preferred stock it was holding. In addition Berlitz will transfer to Macmillan a Dollars 64.6m Macmillan promissory note it was holding. MCC will then release Berlitz from all claims against the company. For its part, Berlitz will agree to reduce by Dollars 58m to Dollars 71m the amount of its claims against MCC regarding outstanding promissory notes. The companies have also agreed to clarify certain tax agreements. Berlitz said the Fukutake deal would be submitted to its shareholders in January. MCC has featured in the Berlitz saga because some 56.5 per cent of Berlitz stock was pledged to banks last year as collateral for loans made to the late Mr Robert Maxwell. These shares have been the subject of litigation. When the Fukutake deal is completed Berlitz shareholders will end up with 33 per cent of the company and the Japanese buyer will own the majority 67 per cent stake.</p>

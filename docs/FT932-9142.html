			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Crackdown on private briefings for analysts: Stock exchange censures LIG over leaking of information THE LONDON Stock Exchange yesterday cracked down publicly for the first time on the selective leaking of sensitive information. In a highly unusual move, the exchange publicly censured London International Group, the condoms to photo processing company, for revealing important information to a group of analysts and institutions rather than to the market generally. The ruling raises questions about what some see as 'cosy' relationships between companies and analysts, and how analysts are often guided towards a company's expected profits or losses. The City reacted with unease to the ruling, which it believes could signal a general tightening of approach by the authorities and change the way information flows from companies to investors. 'It's a very fine line, and this will make the job of running a company or being an analyst much more difficult,' a merchant banker said. City professionals said the exchange's rebuke to LIG would force companies to review how they release price-sensitive information. One observer said the case could result in greater use of public announcements for releasing information, and fewer private briefings for analysts. The exchange said that an unnamed LIG employee, believed to be below director level, was told by the company's board to release certain information about its trading performance. On February 1 this year, the employee spoke separately by telephone to 13 analysts and four of the company's largest institutional shareholders and told them their profit expectations for LIG were too high. At least three times he exceeded the board's instructions by indicating the extent to which forecasts should be lowered, the exchange said. Late that morning, LIG's shares started falling and ended the day down 22p, or 8 per cent, at 248 1/2 p. The exchange started an insider dealing investigation after the price fall and complaints from brokers who had not been contacted by the company. The exchange said yesterday that both the information the board wanted disclosed, as well as the unauthorised information, should have been sent first to the exchange's announcement office. It added, though, that there was no evidence of insider dealing. Under exchange rules, companies should release all material and price sensitive information through the announcements office. This means that all investors receive information at the same time and prevents a false market. Analysts involved in the case said the profit warning concerned LIG's photo processing division, which they said was difficult to assess because of seasonal factors such as Christmas. The only way to judge the division's performance, and therefore LIG's total profits, was from hints made by the company, they said. 'There was always quite a lot of hand-holding,' said one. One banker said the exchange appeared to be tightening up on what was previously a 'grey area'. Companies regularly give out information, which is sometimes price-sensitive, but LIG was unlucky because its shares fell, he said. Lex Page 24</p>

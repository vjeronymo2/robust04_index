			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Letter: Step ahead One has to admire Lord Walker of Worcester's impeccable timing. He parted company with Jim Slater well before Slater Walker went down, quit the Conservative government before the rot set in, and has assembled one of the most impressive string of directorships of any former cabinet minister. He was chairman-designate of Maxwell Communication but backed out less than four months before the late tycoon jumped ship. Last month he stepped down as a non-executive director of troubled training group DC Gardner. Lo and behold, a few weeks later Gardner's chief executive Barry Topple is toppled after terrible trading news. Walker had a good excuse for wanting to reduce his non-executive directorships now that he has taken on the chairmanship of the Urban Regeneration Agency. Moreover, Gardner thanked him profusely for 'his hard work and firm support' over the past couple of years. Even so, there might be a slight tremble the next time he hands in his notice.</p>

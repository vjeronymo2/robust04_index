			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Hoogovens to close plant after Usinor deal USINOR SACILOR, the world's second largest steelmaker, has struck a production sharing accord with Hoogovens, its Dutch competitor, which paves the way for Hoogovens to close a 45-year-old heavy plate rolling mill. Hoogovens is to close by the end of 1992 its 140,000 tonne per year Walserij West mill, and then buy its supplies of heavy plate exclusively from the French group's more modern plant. Heavy plate, one of the most depressed sectors of the steel industry, is mainly used in civil engineering, shipbuilding and to make large soldered pipelines for the oil, gas and water industries. In return for Usinor Sacilor's heavy plate, Hoogovens will provide the French company with an equivalent tonnage of hot rolled coil, principally used in the car and packaging industries. This is the latest example of restructuring between European steel companies, and is one of the ways in which the industry has responded to the recent decline in world steel demand. For similar motives, Usinor Sacilor two years ago combined its large pipe making plants with Mannesman Rohrenwerke, the leading German steel tube and pipe maker. The joint venture, Europipe, happens to be a leading user of plate of the type made by Hoogovens' Walserij West plant. Usinor Sacilor will supply Hoogovens from its two plate rolling mills GTS in Dunkerque, northern France and Dilling in Germany. The two plants produce more than 2m tonnes of plate annually, making Usinor Sacilor the world's biggest supplier. Hoogovens says it hopes to find other jobs for the 300 workers at Walserij West.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Fowler pledges big review of Tory machine SIR NORMAN FOWLER, who takes over as Conservative party chairman today, yesterday promised a 'fundamental review of the party's organisation and structure'. 'We need to make sure that we are as efficient and effective as possible,' he explained. 'My aim is to make this party the best political organisation in Europe.' He indicated that he might look favourably at increasing democracy in the Conservative machine. There is pressure in the party for elections for senior posts - including Sir Norman's - at Central Office. At present, holders of such posts are chosen by the prime minister. Sir Norman also indicated that he might publish fuller party accounts. The Sutton Coldfield MP's responsibilities will include depleted party finances, boosting the chances for women to become candidates in Commons and council elections, and preparing for the 1994 elections to the European parliament. Central Office is an unwieldy and costly machine that Sir Norman sees as ripe for change. The general election campaign was lacklustre, even if the result was a Tory win. Sir Norman, as the prime minister's 'minder' during the campaign, saw at first hand the lack of cohesion - and Mr Major's frustration. Unlike many previous party chairmen, Sir Norman will not join the cabinet. He could have insisted on a cabinet post in the new government, but says the extra responsibility would have stopped him getting out into the country. There will be staff cuts and changes at Central Office under his leadership. He wants organisation to be improved in marginal seats and the central party machine to be geared to giving the service expected by local activists. The party is in the red. Central Office insiders say the election was financed by a flurry of donations during the campaign and that the deficit has not grown. The party's advertising budget for the general election, believed to have been about Pounds 4.5m, was no more than half the amount spent in the 1987 campaign. Sir Norman, a Tory knight of middle England, will have to guard against defeats in by-elections. There were some spectacular ones in the last parliament, such as the one at Eastbourne in October 1990. With the government's majority now cut to 21, losses in this parliament will be more costly. When a member of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government, Sir Norman acquired a reputation for fighting Westminster battles with verve while shielding his back. He was loyal to Mrs Thatcher and successfully avoided much of the controversy in his six years as social services secretary that plagued his successors. Only subsequently was the department split into social security and health. Under Mr John Major he helped to quell Tory backbenchers' threats to the Maastricht Treaty by standing, successfully, for the post of chairman of the party's backbench Europe committee. In January 1990 Sir Norman, an Essex-born grammar school boy, resigned as Mrs Thatcher's employment secretary, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. Now aged 54, he wants to return to the political fray. Sir Norman explained that his children were older. 'I have almost to make appointments with them', he added. MR JOHN MAJOR has appointed three backbenchers to senior posts in the Conservative party. Mr Gerry Malone, who won Winchester in the general election, is to be a deputy chairman. Mr Tim Smith, MP for Beaconsfield, is to be party vice-chairman in charge of finances and fund-raising. Mr Andrew Mitchell, MP for Gedling, will be vice-chairman responsible for candidate selection.</p>

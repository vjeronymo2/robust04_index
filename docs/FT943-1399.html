			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Leading Article: An economic evolution When a species has taken more than 5m years to evolve, it is foolish to expect much to change in a few years. Thus John Major's grand predictions for the UK economy differ little from those of his immediate prime-ministerial ancestor. His promise of a long steady recovery would prove more reliable, however, if the UK economy had since evolved further. In his speech in Saudi Arabia on Monday, Mr Major declared that the UK 'was at the threshold of an economic recovery unlike any we've seen since the second world war'. Margaret Thatcher greeted a similar dawn in March 1983, declaring that the UK was 'better placed to recover and make good profits and give new jobs than it has been for a very long time. The economy is sustainable.' Uncovering relics of a bygone era makes one sceptical about the scope for rapid human development. Both leaders stood low in the polls, having received little credit for more than two years' slow recovery. If anything, today's embattled prime minister is more cautious: Mrs Thatcher was speaking in the eighth quarter of the early 1980s recovery, while the rebound in UK output growth is now into its 10th quarter. On the face of it, Mr Major's optimism also has a more solid basis in the economic statistics. Data released yesterday confirm that the UK grew by 3.8 per cent in real terms in the year to July, significantly above its long-term trend of about 2 1/4 per cent. There has been little sign so far that capacity constraints will turn higher growth into price and wage pressures. Retail prices (excluding mortgages) picked up very slightly last month, but the July index was only 2.3 per cent higher than a year earlier. Wage-price spiral Similar records were being broken at the time of Mrs Thatcher's pronouncements. Retail price growth briefly fell to an annual rate of 3.8 per cent rate in March 1983, the lowest in 15 years. Low inflation had come at a high price, especially in manufacturing employment, but the shedding of labour and technical improvements were to provide rapid growth in productivity until the middle of the decade. By then, however, the ingredients of a traditional UK wage-price spiral were already in place. Will the current recovery meet the same fate? Perhaps not. Although the many similarities between this recovery and the last one are too often forgotten, there are clearly encouraging contrasts as well. None guarantees that the 'boom and bust' cycle will fail to recur, but this time it might take longer to appear. The two most important differences are the trend in the balance of payments and the continued slow pace of wage growth. UK exports picked up more quickly after sterling's devaluation in September 1992 than many expected. A broad range of trade data portray a UK tradeable sector reacting to sterling's fall as the most optimistic textbooks would predict. In the passenger car industry, for example, the volume of vehicles produced for export was up by nearly a fifth on last year's in the three months to July. That compares with a mere 3 per cent rise in the volume produced for buyers at home. The UK consumer of the 1990s is a more calculating beast than his credit-hungry cousin of the 1980s. Although the main component of the recovery to date, consumption growth has been cautious throughout. Recent data suggest even that momentum may be beginning to run out. Lower savings True, yesterday's national accounts data confirm that households have been slowly cutting back on precautionary saving as the recovery continues. But those lower savings merely allowed households to maintain their existing spending, despite the fall in disposable income produced by April's tax rises. In short, it is difficult to see the seeds of another damaging boom in the developments of the past two and a half years. For the good news to continue, the extra competitiveness won by sterling's exit from the ERM must continue to be combined with stable domestic inflation. In the 1980s, most of the hard-won gains in competitiveness were distributed as real wage increases, not profits. But if the long-term unemployed are ever to see a real change in the UK economy, this must not happen again. So far, both employment growth and investment have lagged behind the rest of the economy. The chances that either or both will pick up in the future depend heavily on the stability of the government's macro-economic policy. The commitment to stable and sustainable growth has certainly been vociferously presented. The chancellor, for one, seems determined to tread a slightly different path from that followed by predecessors in similar situations. Yet an economy enjoying stability is rather less exciting than one driven by over-expanding credit. Wage growth is low and the employed are less sure that their jobs will last. The main risk must be that the politician's desire to win votes will triumph over hopes that a new species of chancellor has been born.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Japanese business confidence declines JAPANESE business confidence has fallen sharply over the past three months, according to a survey of senior executives published yesterday which showed that 70 per cent do not expect their company's performance to improve before the final three months of the year. The survey by the Keidanren, the leading employers' federation, found that seven out of 10 top business executives think their company's profits will only start to recover between October and December. The 252 business leaders forecast Japan's economy would grow by 2.5 per cent in the coming fiscal year from April, down from the 2.9 per cent they forecast in a similar survey in November. About 44 per cent of the respondents said the economy as a whole would only begin to recover towards the end of the year. The results of the survey will add to pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut interest rates and on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to bring forward plans for an emergency public spending package to stimulate the ailing economy. Business leaders will renew their calls for a more expansionary policy at a meeting with LDP leaders on Friday. Officials figures for business and consumer confidence due to be published today will confirm the depressed state of the economy. The momentum behind the downturn was underlined yesterday by official figures showing that sales of cars were down 10.5 per cent last month compared with January 1992 and that sales of lorries were 15 per cent lower.</p>

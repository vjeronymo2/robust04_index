			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 313 of the Magnuson Act, as amended by section 404 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, Pub. L. 102&hyph;582, authorizes the Council to prepare, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), a Research Plan for all fisheries under the Council's jurisdiction except salmon fisheries. The proposed Research Plan would require that observers be stationed on certain fishing vessels and U.S. fish processors participating in the BSAI groundfish, GOA groundfish, and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries, and it would allow these requirements to be extended to the halibut fishery off Alaska. Observers would be deployed for the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation, management, and scientific understanding of fisheries under the Council's authority. The Research Plan also would establish a system of fees to pay for the costs of implementing the Research Plan. The fees would be based on the exvessel value of retained catch in the BSAI and GOA groundfish fisheries, the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries, and the Pacific halibut fishery off Alaska (Research Plan fisheries). Future recommendations by the Council to include other fisheries under the Research Plan would require an amendment or amendments to the Research Plan and to the regulations implementing it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations implementing Amendments 18 and 13 to the FMPs for Groundfish of the GOA and the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area, respectively (54 FR 50386, December 6, 1989), authorized a data collection program to obtain information necessary for conservation and management of the groundfish fisheries. One of the measures in Amendments 18 and 13 authorized a comprehensive domestic fishery observer program. The Secretary, in consultation with the Council, prepared and implemented an Observer Plan to implement provisions of that program (55 FR 4839, February 12, 1990). The Alaska Board of Fisheries (Board) implemented a Shellfish Onboard Observer Program for the king and Tanner crab fisheries off Alaska in April 1988 (5 AAC 39.645). Currently, no observer program is established for the Pacific halibut fishery in convention waters off Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two problems with the current Federal and State observer programs have been identified. First, the costs of observer coverage are not borne by all fishery participants. Under the current Federal observer program, some groundfish operations are required to pay for 100 percent observer coverage, others are required to pay for 30 percent coverage, and still other operations that benefit from the observer program pay none of the cost. The last group includes some groundfish and all halibut operations, because they have no observer coverage requirements. State king and Tanner crab regulations require observer coverage for all vessels that process king or Tanner crab in waters off Alaska, but mandate no observer coverage for crab catcher vessels or shoreside processors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the current method of paying for observers under the Federal and State observer programs limits NMFS and State control over the observer programs and impedes the agencies' ability to manage the programs effectively. Observer contractors are not solely responsible to NMFS or to the State for the quality of their work performance; sometimes they have conflicting responsibilities to their clients, to whom they are providing observers, and to NMFS or to the State. The owners and operators of vessels and processing facilities now are responsible for making arrangements with an observer contractor of their choice to meet observer requirements and for paying the costs of observers directly to that contractor. This direct business relationship, and the ability of an owner or operator to select among the group of contractors, mean that the contractors and, indirectly, the observers, work for the operations they are observing. This relationship could provide a means for an operation to reward or penalize contractors and their observers and thus negatively influence the work performance of the observers and quality of the data collected. This appearance of a conflict of interest could reduce the credibility of observer data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To resolve these problems, the Council initiated development of the Research Plan. A draft EA/RIR for the Research Plan was initially reviewed and approved for public distribution and comment by the Council and its advisory bodies at their January 15&hyph;17, 1991, meetings. After reviewing written comments and advice from its advisory bodies, and hearing public testimony at its meetings of April 23&hyph;26, 1991, the Council further refined the Research Plan. A revised EA/RIR was reviewed and approved for public distribution and comment by the Council and its advisory bodies at their April 20&hyph;26, 1992, meetings. After reviewing written comments, obtaining further advice from its advisory bodies, and hearing public testimony at its June 23&hyph;28, 1992, meeting, the Council adopted the Research Plan and recommended that it be submitted to the Secretary for review. The EA/RIR was updated in December 1993 to reflect newly available information. The Council approved the Research Plan as described in this proposed rule at its December 1993 meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Description of the Proposed Research Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Provide a framework for an observer program for the Alaska groundfish fisheries and the Pacific halibut fishery to accommodate inseason management and stock assessment needs, and to provide accurate, real-time data of sufficient quality to implement an individual vessel incentive program developed to meet specified management objectives of the Council;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Provide a framework for an observer program for Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab fisheries to accommodate inseason management needs, monitor industry compliance with Federal and State regulations, and collect biological and management data necessary to achieve the sustained yield of the crab resource without overfishing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

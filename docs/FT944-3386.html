			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / BR sell-off speeds up as rail network finances are hit The UK government is to speed up railway privatisation amid claims that the network's financial base is starting to crumble. Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director responsible for selling the passenger train companies to the private sector, will today announce plans to dispose of eight of the 25 British Rail companies. BR had planned to sell just six in the first round of franchise sales. He will set out rules for franchisees, including limits on fare increases in some areas, such as London commuter lines, where there is no real competition from other means of transport. He will also specify basic levels of service, which would be lower than at present, but expects operators to run more trains for commercial reasons. Mr Salmon's move is expected to hit InterCity routes, but maintain protection for rural services. Under the new rules, companies will also have to accept each others' tickets. The attempt to revive the momentum of BR privatisation comes after the leaking of a confidential report prepared for the Commons transport select committee, disclosing increasing pressure on the railway network to cut costs and services. The report, by two railway experts, Mr Richard Hope, a consultant, and Professor Bill Bradshaw of Oxford University, prompted the committee to announce plans yesterday for an immediate inquiry into the state of railway finances. The report highlighted a Pounds 400m gap in the railways' finances which, if not filled, could in theory lead to the closure of 4,000 miles of branch lines out of the network of 9,000 passenger miles or to a 25 per cent cut in the level of peak services. The network's finances have suffered after last summer's four months of strikes by signalmen, a drop in coal shipments because of a shift to gas by power generators, the cost of preparing for privatisation and cuts in government subsidies. The report says it is difficult to obtain a clear picture of railway finances over the coming months because the principal organisations involved were themselves unclear about what was happening. But the fact 'that a serious shortfall in cash looms is scarely in doubt,' the report said. In the Commons, Mr John Major said that privatised servicces would be based on existing timetables, and 'scare stories' about the process Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, demanded the cancellation of privatisation if there was even a 'remote risk' of big cuts in the rail network. Further evidence of the cost pressures on the railway was provided yesterday when Mr Terry Worrall, BR's director of safety, said measures designed to reduce the risk of accidents could be introduced only if they were affordable. The government wants to privatise at least half the passenger rail network before April 1996. Bidders face stringent controls, Page 8</p>

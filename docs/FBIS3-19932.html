			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Willy Claes by Josef Vesely </F> in Prague on 21 March: "The Czech Republic Could Chair the  European Union, Says Claes"]    [Text] Prague -- Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said  yesterday that he can envisage very well the day the Czech  Republic will chair the European Union [EU].    "You have a consolidated program for political  democratization and you are also continuing to develop a very  disciplined system for managing the economy," declared Claes,  who has been on a visit to the Czech Republic since Sunday [20  March], following his talks yesterday with his counterpart,  Josef Zieleniec. "I am of the opinion that the declaration  issued by the 12 in Copenhagen last June, which laid down strict  conditions for the admission of countries like the Czech  Republic, may play a historic role in this," he added.    [Vesely] Does the entire European Union have the same  attitude toward the Czech Republic?    [Claes] Anyone in West Europe who thinks we can live on our  own, as if on some island paradise and in isolation from the  rest of the continent, is very naive. The movement toward  integration has various motives; however, we have to stimulate  it, because it is simply in our interest to do so.    [Vesely] The negotiations on expanding the European Union  are becoming increasingly difficult. Would it not be enough --  at the moment -- just to have a common market?    [Claes] With regard to expanding the Union, it will be  necessary first of all to fortify the existing European  structure and to reinforce its foundations. This is not  possible merely by strengthening the economic union.    [Vesely] What about the experience of the European Free  Trade Association?    [Claes] The states represented by the four current  candidates -- Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria -- indeed  belonged to this free trade zone. However, after a certain  time, they themselves recognized they need greater integration  and a higher level of cohesion. They also recognized that this  cohesion can only be guaranteed by a political union. All its  signatories must speak unanimously later. Naturally, after this  common point of view is reached by democratic means.    [Vesely] Are they being considered as a group or  individually?    [Claes] In Prague, in particular, it is appropriate to  emphasize that, in preparing for the next stage of expanding the  European Union, we will -- obviously -- not negotiate as one  bloc with another bloc. At this stage of accepting new members,  we are not negotiating with the Scandinavians and the Austrians  concurrently and under the same conditions. It was, and still  is, possible that the outcome could be the Union's expansion to  only 14 or 15 members instead of to 16 members.    [Vesely] Will this course of action also apply for Eastern  candidates?    [Claes] Obviously, we will not be able to negotiate with the  Eastern candidates as if they comprised a single bloc of states.  Therefore, it is tenable that the Czech Republic may fulfill all  the conditions at a time when the other states are still unable  to do so. It is possible that the next stage of expanding the  European Union will take place step by step, state by state. I  think that this is the important message I can convey to you.  It does not only concern your country, but is also associated  with the issue of the quality of the European Union.</p>

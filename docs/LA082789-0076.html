			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINNING COLORS RETURNS A WINNER  </P> <P> Winning Colors, the 1988 Kentucky Derby winner who underwent throat surgery  three months ago, scored a 4 1/4-length victory in a six-furlong allowance for  fillies and mares at Saratoga Saturday.  </P> <P> Winning Colors, trained by Wayne Lukas and ridden by Pat Day, was timed in 1:10  1/5 and earned $24,600 from the purse of $41,000 for her first victory since  the Derby. Winning Colors returned $2.80.  </P> <P> Lukas said that the only visible effect of her surgery had been that "she was a  little louder after lengthy gallops."  </P> <P> Summer Squall, also ridden by Day, won the $234,000 Hopeful Stakes for  2-year-olds later in the program.  </P> <P> The son of Storm Bird-Weekend Surprise remained undefeated in five career  starts, the last four of which have been stakes, covering 6 1/2 furlongs in  1:16 4/5. Summer Squall returned $3.80.  </P></p>

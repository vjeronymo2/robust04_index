			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pension portfolios seen opening up to commodities Many large pension funds are close to including commodities in their investment portfolios as a way of diversifying away from traditional financial holdings, according to Mr Steven Strongin, vice president and commodities strategist at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. 'We are now in a bull market and some investors are taking their first steps into commodities, but it will probably not be until the next production cycle when commodities earn a permanent place in many portfolios,' he said. The perception among many investors is that commodity markets are reaching the peak of their price upturn. But Mr Strongin pointed out that although some metals and coffee had swung sharply upwards, many other commodities were yet to be affected. The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, which tracks movements of 22 commodities, is up 4 per cent so far this year. 'There is a certain pattern to price movements in each business cycle: gold leads the way followed by the industrial metals with oil coming later and soft commodities last,' Mr Strongin said. So far, the current price run has adhered to previous patterns. Oil has been left behind as other commodity markets have taken a roller-coaster ride this year, but Mr Neil Bresolin, commodities analyst at Goldman, believes that lack of investment in production, coupled with increased demand, will be enough to push prices up next year. 'Oil and coffee are the most volatile markets so you won't see oil going up in a straight line, but there is potential for it to ratchet up next year,' he said. Global growth will give a boost to all commodity markets. Mr Strongin points out that strong growth in Asia and Latin America is more closely linked to rising demand for basic commodities as production in those economies is more commodity-intensive. 'The specific timing of price moves in different sectors depends on the build-up of capacity in previous cycles: there will be an increase in soft commodities fueled by demand from developing countries. But the bumper US harvest has temporarily dampened those markets,' said Mr Strongin. Some strong price movements in metals and coffee this year have been blamed on speculative action by hedge funds ignoring market fundamentals. But Mr Strongin believes speculation in commodities cannot be sustained for long periods because of the discipline imposed on the markets by physical realities. 'The spot markets make commodities unique because they are based on real physical demand for raw materials. Anticipatory moves in price are difficult to sustain.'</p>

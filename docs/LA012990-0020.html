			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POGO  </P> <P> Why no go Pogo? Whither our Okefenokee? The world here in Fort Mudge needs  every day to meet the enemy.  </P> <P> He is us. He is not Marmaduke. Whither our Christmas Carol? Our Christmas  Albert. Our warnings that Friday 13th comes on a some Tuesday soon? Who got to  you? The muddled masses who didn't get it?  </P> <P> Oh please. So much drivel in the comics and you pick on the ghost of Walt Kelly  -- so well conjured by Doyle-Sternacky. Please advise. Please paddle out in  your rowboat and think about it.  </P> <P> I go Pogo.  </P> <P> JACK SLATER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

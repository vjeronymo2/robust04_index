			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / De-recognition expected to rise Union de-recognition is likely to increase this year although the trend is attributed to practical factors rather than hostility towards unions, says an industrial relations report published today. Of those companies which admitted de-recognising unions in a survey by Industrial Relations Services, the independent research organisation, most said that a wish to establish a closer link between pay and performance was the main motivation. De-recognition entails switching from national to local bargaining. Pembrokeshire NHS Trust took issue with the report's belief that it had de-recognised unions. Mr Keith Brown, head of personnel, said it still recognised its 16 unions for the purposes of representation and consultation. He added that Pembrokeshire was one of the few trusts to organise its pay system locally. 'The rest of them are wimps,' he said.</p>

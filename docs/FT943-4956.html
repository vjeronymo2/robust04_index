			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: UK gilts drift upwards in quiet trading UK gilts drifted upwards yesterday in quiet futures-led trading, ahead of tomorrow's monthly meeting on monetary policy between the Treasury and the Bank of England. Economic data showing a slowdown in M0 money supply growth for August and modest consumer credit figures for July had little impact, analysts said. 'The weaker-than-expected M0 figures are a hint that the pace of economic expansion may be easing,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg. He said they were unlikely to lead to a rise in base rates from the current level of 5.25 per cent after Wednesday's meeting. 'The market view is that nothing will happen (on Wednesday), but there will be some degree of market nervousness,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi. There was little change in the yield spread between gilts and German bunds, which remained at about 140 basis points. On Liffe, the December long gilt future fell in early trading to 100 1/4 from the previous close of 100 29/32 , before recovering to 101 1/32 in late trading, up 1/8 on the day. Bunds started the week in dismal fashion as worries about an early overheating of the German economy prompted an early sell-off. The market is worried that the west gross domestic product data for the second quarter, due on Thursday, could show quarter-on-quarter expansion in excess of 1 per cent, which would bring the yearly growth rate to close to 2 per cent. Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International, said that such an acceleration in economic growth would lead to inflationary pressures and would also cause the output gap - the difference between actual and potential growth - to close far earlier in the cycle than expected. These worries, coupled with concerns about the Bundesbank's large funding programme, are likely to keep a lid on bund prices. On Liffe, the December bund future stood 0.45 points lower at 89.67 in the late afternoon in volume of 75,473 lots, off the day's worst level of 89.38. French government bonds were also weaker amid worries that recent base rate rises by French commercial banks would put pressure on the Bank of France to do likewise. On the Matif, the September notional bond future was down 0.14 points at the day's low of 112.62 late in the afternoon. Elsewhere, the yield on 10-year Spanish government bonds rose 16 basis points to 11.17 per cent. Mr Simon Meggs of UBS said the movement was driven by worries about the continuing negotiations over the government's budget, and performances were similar along the yield curve. 'It was a rocky ride today and the market may get jittery if there is no firm news this week,' he said. He added that investors were also concerned at the possibility of Spain being left out of the core of a multi-speed Europe. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Italian government bond rose 3 basis points to close at 12.06 per cent, moving in line with markets elsewhere.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / European Press Review: Media show signs of election fatigue  -Germany Perhaps it was always inevitable that in an election marathon year in Germany, with no fewer than 20 polls, exhaustion would set in before the bitter end. With 15 down and five to go, the German media are showing signs of a severe surfeit of politicking. Far from flooding their readers and viewers with a torrent of conflicting information from the parties' headquarters, they have opted for the opposite: play it down and keep it simple. Election issues are barely discussed. The only real focus is on the opinion polls, the personalities, and the possible permutations in coalition government which could emerge after next Sunday's poll. It is not as if the outcome is beyond doubt. Everything suggests that the result is on a knife-edge, in spite of a surge in support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl through the summer months. It all depends on whether Mr Kohl's current coalition partners, the Free Democratic party, can get into the Bundestag at all. And the other unknown factor is whether the former East German communists - the party of Democratic Socialism - will not sneak in and end up holding the balance of power. Given that uncertainty, and the stark choice between the current conservative-liberal coalition, the left-wing alternative of Social Democrats and Greens, and a grand coalition from centre-left to centre-right, one might expect saturation coverage. Far from it. The mighty Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, for example, has led its front page over the past week with a speech by the federal president on German unification, President Boris Yeltsin promising a steady reform course in Russia, upheaval in the Italian coalition government in Rome, the conflict in Bosnia, and Iraqi President Saddam's troop manoeuvres on the Kuwait border. The election has merited no more than a couple of leaders and a front-page brief. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the mass circulation Bild Zeitung has led twice on the affairs of Britain's Princess of Wales, and once on the death of the actor Heinz Ruhmann, Germany's answer to Charlie Chaplin. Politicians and their pranks don't even rate a paragraph there. Perhaps it is because the personalities are simply too dull. Mr Kohl, for example, is solid, provincial, safe and uninspiring. He reckons that is what the German voters want. His rival, Mr Rudolf Scharping, appears to think the same: he is making every effort to appear more solid, safer, duller and less inspiring. The media have tried to hype the polls, and they have even tried to hype the pollsters. The Forsa opinion poll, published in the weekly newspaper Die Woche, and on RTL television, was the first to dare to suggest that the FDP might not be re-elected. Five worthier and more established pollsters denounced the results as unsound, giving massive publicity to their rival on every other television channel. Not that the press is averse to slamming the pollsters, on whom they still rely for most of their election-watching. It is the 'Sunday question' - 'Who would you vote for if there were elections on Sunday?' - which is the original sin of the pollsters, thundered the left-of-centre Frankfurter Rundschau this weekend. 'Originally this was just one indicator among many, with which one tried to identify the current political mood,' the newspaper said. 'But then the opinion researchers themselves were instrumental in elevating the answers to this question to the level of a prophecy.' They should realise that the modern media will publish the results in the most simplistic way, without any serious effort at explanation, or indication of the margin of error, says the Rundschau's Mr Martin Winter. Which leaves it less than clear who is to blame. After the polls have been exhausted, all that is really left for the press is the personalities. And that is really how Mr Kohl wants it, because he towers (literally) above the rest, and has fought his whole campaign on his personality, not his politics. Even in these last few days, as the newspapers cast desperately around for a new theme, the chancellor managed to oblige: he promised to stay in office - if elected - for the full term until 1998. But would he resign, or would he not, after 1998? The fact that he declined to give any clear answer to the question does not appear to have deterred any of the newspapers from instant speculation. It gave a whole new lease of life to the weekend columnists. The Hessische Allgemeine, from Kassel, put it succinctly: 'That is the price of the media society: everyone reports on an event which isn't one. That the chancellor announces something which has long been known is barely worth reporting. But it still gets written. 'Helmut Kohl has often enough complained of the power of the media, and always managed to present himself as the loser. But it is perfectly clear (on this occasion) that he is the one who sets the tone. 'Everyone one came along, and they all presented him with a first-class election campaign appearance, on prime time, and on all the front pages.' He could scarcely ask for more.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Call for single broadcast regulator THE Independent Television Commission said yesterday that the government should consider a single regulatory body for all British broadcasting. The commission, the regulatory body for commercial television, proposed in a policy document sent to the government on the future of the BBC that the new body should replace both itself and the BBC board of governors. It said the intersection and overlapping in the jurisdictions of a number of different bodies was 'already a source of serious confusion and concern'. The commission also suggested a clearer line of separation between the responsibilities of BBC governors and management, and that the governors become a separate body with their own support staff. The licence fee could be paid to the BBC via the governors on the basis of an agreed corporate plan. The BBC should continue to provide a wide range of programmes, it said, but the corporation should not be allowed to extend its activities further - for example into city-based local television.</p>

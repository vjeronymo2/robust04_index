			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by PAD and B.I.W.: "Solidarity `Omitted' by the </F> Government"]    [Text] Roman Adamczyk, chief of the Prime Minister's  Office, forwarded a letter to Solidarity ["S"], in which he  stated that, "during its Tuesday [12 April] session, the Council  of Ministers will discuss the motions resulting from the  negotiations and the talks of government and union experts, and  the talks with employees' organizations held so far." Similar  letters were sent to the chairpersons of 17 other unions. At the  same time, the prime minister invited the chairpersons of the  unions to a meeting in the Office of the Council of Ministers  that is to be held this afternoon. "S" Head Marian Krzaklewski  announced that he will not participate in the meeting; however,  the union will send an observer.    On Tuesday, the Presidium of the "S" National Committee  [KK],  which had a session in Gdansk, waited for the government reply  as to how it was going to implement the union demands. KK Press  Spokesman Piotr Zak said that "S" will wait for this reply only  until the KK starts its session--that is, until this morning.  The KK will make a decision concerning the further course of  the "S" protest action.    Unofficially, Pawlak's letter was interpreted as an attempt  to bypass the deadline, set by "S" for 12 April, for forwarding  the reply to the union. The letter does not say that the  government has taken a stand on the "S" demands and that it will  make a decision; it merely says that it will "discuss the  motions." Despite the announcement made toward the end of March  that the protocol of the talks between the government and union  experts would be discussed at the nearest session of the Council  of Ministers (incidentally, the nearest session was held  earlier), such an item did not appear on yesterday's agenda of  the session of the Council of Ministers. In the Government's  Press Office, we were told that "it may be under the `various  issues' item, and the `various issues' may include various  matters of the last moment."    The union spokesman announced that "S" will protest against  the new version of the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage  increases] law.    The KK Presidium believes that the Sejm "should complete the  proceedings against Wojciech Jaruzelski and Czeslaw Kiszczak, so  that those responsible for imposing martial law can be judged by  both the Constitutional Tribunal and general courts." "S"  believes that the Sejm "should also represent the stand of the  extraparliamentary opposition on this issue."    The KK also criticized the work of the Selection Committee  of  the National Investment Fund [NFI]. According to the "S"  leadership, most of the candidates for members of the  Supervisory Boards of the NFI selected by the committee are  people who have their roots in the former party  nomenklatura. "S" believes that, in the Supervisory  Boards, there should be room for delegates of representative  unions.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Let us drink Evian: Is the City swapping wine for water? Some London executives mourn the days when their City staff went down to the wine bars in Bow Lane to drink from personalised bottles of port. 'In those days you could always pretend you were someone else and get a free glass of port,' says one corporate finance manager. Today, wine bar owners are just as likely to set aside crates of Evian for their business customers. A report this week that six out of 10 senior managers never touch alcohol during the day was corroborated by many financiers. They agreed with the findings of the Portman Group, which is sponsored by eight UK drinks companies to encourage 'sensible drinking'. The stereotype - and sometimes the reality - of a London business lunch in the early 1980s was that it began at noon, ended at 3.30pm and involved gin and tonic, several bottles of wine, and brandy. Business lunches in the 1990s are decidedly more restrained. 'The old days of a decanter of port hitting the table and lunch going on until 4pm bit the dust at the end of the 1980s,' says Alex Sandburg, chairman of College Hill, a financial public relations company. 'At the banks where I go for lunch everyone goes for the tomato juice and water before lunch and then has a glass of wine with the meal.' Inside corporate dining rooms, executives and their guests are limiting themselves to one or two glasses of wine. At the investment bank SG Warburg, one dining room has traditionally been dry, while guests in another dining room, where alcohol is served, 'rarely empty a bottle of wine'. Lunches are shorter and more strictly businesslike. 'Lunch means getting down to some pretty hard stuff,' says one merchant banker. Many other City bosses note a change in corporate culture. 'Before, by the time you got back from lunch at 3.30pm, the market was closed. It was not an issue whether you could function or not,' says an investment bank analyst. 'Now, with much longer trading days and people having meetings after the market closes, people are a bit more responsible and are drinking less.' At some companies alcohol consumption has fallen victim to policy reforms as well as culture. BT has an alcohol-free building. At Shell UK and Shell International headquarters, alcohol is generally kept off the premises, except for special occasions such as Christmas or retirement parties. National Westminster Bank has closed down its two employee bars. Recession and increased competition have exacerbated the trend towards fizzy water. 'There is more anxiety about business, and the pace of it has increased,' says Anthony Cardew, chairman of Cardew &amp; Co, a financial public relations company. 'People want to be on the ball at all times.' Such attitudes do not seem to have taken root across the Channel. Most French businessmen still appear to see wine and lunch as inseparable. 'Most of my clients will have a glass or two of wine at lunch,' says one merchant banker. 'Overall we may drink less than we did in the past, but that is perhaps because the lunches are often shorter, more Anglo-Saxon.' In the US, business people have been abstemious for much longer. 'I would not want someone to see me drinking alcohol at lunch,' says a financial analyst at Wertheim Schroeder, the investment bank, in New York. 'It would raise eyebrows. I would not even have a glass of wine.' In Japan, while most financiers would also consider it unconscionable to drink at lunch, they have no qualms about relaxing with clients after hours at restaurants and karaoke bars. 'The important thing is to let the clients know how much you're spending on them,' says Kazuo Tamayama, director at Yasuda Kasai Brinson, the investment managers. During the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s, banks and brokers were prepared to spend upwards of Y500,000 (Pounds 3,185) a night on entertaining clients, though recession has cramped the corporate entertainment scene since then. While similar economic constraints have afflicted the City, Derek Richards, director of Smith NewCourt, the stockbroker, is sceptical about the notion of a teetotal London. Business people are just changing the time of day that they drink, he says. 'The wine bars are chock-a-block from 5pm to 6pm.' Still, some - notably journalists - are lamenting the demise of the long lunch. 'Have you ever known anybody tell you more over a glass of water than a glass of good chablis?' asks Daniel McGrory, chief foreign correspondent of the Daily Express. 'I mourn as everyone does the passing of the old lunch customs of Fleet Street where we went out and behaved appallingly.' Additional reporting by John Ridding and Emiko Terazono</p>

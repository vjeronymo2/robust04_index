			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Industry praise for British Gas THREE QUARTERS of industrial gas consumers are satisfied with the service they receive from British Gas, according to a survey released today by Ernst &amp; Young. Most welcome the introduction of competition into the gas market but are concerned about possible supply difficulties. The survey of more than 60 of the UK's biggest industrial consumers, as well as independent marketers and Ofgas, the industry regulator, is the first undertaken since the market was opened to competition in 1990. It was carried out by the Industrial Research Bureau. Its findings may surprise critics of British Gas as well as independent suppliers who have pledged to outperform British Gas's standards of service. The belief that prices would fall was the reason most consumers supported increasing competition, although the survey found factors such as possible shortfalls in production and supply might result in prices remaining stable. Around 90 per cent of respondents believed competition would benefit industrial customers. Some large users were concerned about the ability of independent shippers to supply gas in sufficient quantities. Two thirds of users said they would not risk changing suppliers simply for the sake of lower prices, but many said they were likely to buy from more than one source. Consumers said British Gas should continue to provide storage facilities for independents who were unable to make the necessary investment, but should be allowed a fair rate of return. British Gas looks set to clash with Ofgas after insisting that the rate of return on its pipeline and storage business should be 6.7 per cent on existing assets and 10.8 per cent on new investments. Many felt competition could be achieved more quickly if there was more discussion - and less confrontation - between Ofgas and British Gas. Overall, 75 per cent of large industrial consumers said the service they received from British Gas was either 'outstanding' or 'above average'. British Gas and Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, have formed a jointly managed company to provide combined heat and electricity to up to 10 of Rhone-Poulenc's 30 sites in the UK. British Gas is investing up to Pounds 30m in the new company, Rhone-Poulenc Energy. It will install and operate gas-fired plant, with the potential to sell surplus power.</p>

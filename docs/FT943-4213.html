			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mining world startled by diamond find in Finland The mining industry has been startled by an out-of-the-blue revelation that Ashton Mining of Australia, has discovered a diamond province in Finland. It also said that 'the prospect for a commercial discovery is considered to be high.' While other companies have been scouring Canada's Northwest Territories, African, Australia and even deep down in the depths of the sea for the gem stones, Ashton secretly has been prospecting in Finland, a country best-known for base metals production, for eight years. Mr John Robinson, chief executive of Ashton, which is one-third owned by the state-controlled Malaysian Mining Corporation, said his company had found two fields of kimberlite pipes and a number of isolated kimberlite occurences - 21 kimberlites in all - and most of them were diamond-bearing. One pipe of about two hectares in surface area had yielded 26 carats of diamonds of more than 8mm in size per 100 tonnes from a 23-tonne sample, with a weighted average of 17 carats per 100 tonnes. 'The results to date confirm that the basic geology in Finland is prospective for the discovery of an economic diamond deposit and that Ashton's exploration techniques are effective in glacial terrain,' said Mr Andrew Button, Ashton's group general manager of exploration and development. 'New targets in Finland are being generated and testing is continuing in this exciting location. The exploration areas are close to established infrastructure and the prospect for a commercial discovery is considered to be high,' he added. Independent experts agreed. 'This compares favourably with most of the discoveries in the Northwest Territories, said Mr Roger Ellis, editor of the Mining Journal. Ashton is a 40 per cent joint venturer in the Argyle mine in Western Australia which is the biggest diamond producer in the world in carat (but not value) terms. It is not alone in looking for diamonds in Finland. The annual meeting of RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, was enlivened this year by the presence of two members of the Finnish Sami population (the Laplanders) who complained that the UK-based group was seeking permission to excavate in parts of Finland where they had reindeer grazing rights. Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, said this week the group had, indeed, staked large tracts of land in Finland, mainly because of its potential to yield diamonds. Meanwhile, Ashton has accelerated the pace of its activities in Finland and is building a broader presence in the Nordic/Baltic region, including Norway, Sweden and Karelia.</p>

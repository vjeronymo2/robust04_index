			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Netherlands Company for Energy and </F> the Environment Helps Bulgaria Save Energy"]    [Text] Rotterdam -- The Netherlands Company for Energy and  the Environment (NOVEM) is giving Bulgaria aid to reduce its  energy consumption. This week, L. Petkanchin, the Bulgarian  deputy minister for energy, visited NOVEM to hold further talks  regarding a project for the local communities in his country to  save energy.    Of the bilateral aid The Netherlands is giving to East  Europe, NOVEM is paying for technical advice from consultants,  modern measuring equipment, and supervision. Energy consumption  by Bulgarian (Government) buildings, households, and industry is  very high. There is the threat of an energy crisis because the  bills can no longer be paid. One quarter of the fuel used for  generating electricity is imported from Russia.    The Bulgarian partners in the project began by measuring the  energy consumption of local communities. In addition, advice  and training was given for improving organization and making  cleaner use of heating and ventilation systems.    NOVEM's experience in energy saving in The Netherlands is a  guideline. The Bulgarians were taught that they have to contend  with not only a financial problem, but also a quality problem.  According to NOVEM's T. Verkerk, Bulgaria can save 10 to 15  percent of its energy consumption without any costs at all, and  another 15 percent by making small investments. This project  serves as an example and as a step toward wide scale energy  saving projects to be funded by the Bulgarian Government, the  East European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the  World Bank.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Letter: Old enough to say 'never'? Sir, In his review of An Ideal Husband (November 13) Alastair Macaulay described me as 'never a convincing actor'. 'Never' is a big word to apply to a career spanning 54 years, and would only be appropriate if he had seen me as Paris in Troilus and Cressida in 1938 and in my subsequent 50 West End appearances. Can he be so old? Michael Denison, Globe Theatre, Shaftsbury Avenue, London W1</p>

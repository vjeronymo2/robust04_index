I am listening carefully to views, but I . . . will take some persuading.' Mr Hamilton was giving his preliminary views on responses to a consultative document issued by the Department of Trade and Industry last year. The DTI invited comments on the European Commission's recommendation on the regulation of insurance intermediaries. His remarks came in the wake of a report by the Consumers' Association which found that in a survey of insurance intermediaries - brokers and agents who sell policies on behalf of companies - the majority breached 'virtually all the provisions of the codes of practice which supposedly govern the sale of non-life insurance'. The Consumers' Association is recommending that the regulatory body the Insurance Brokers Registration Council, or a new independent body, should enforce regulations more actively.

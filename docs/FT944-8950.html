			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Asprey statement seeks to reassure investors Asprey, the Queen's jeweller, is today expected to issue a joint statement with its bankers, the Bank of Scotland, in an attempt to reassure investors that its financial health is not in jeopardy. It also emerged last night that the Stock Exchange's surveillance department, which investigates possible wrongdoing in share dealings, has been examining events at Asprey. In its statement today, the bank will confirm that the contents of a leaked memorandum from its UK banking division, which expresses concern about Asprey's financial condition, is genuine. But it will say that the date of the memorandum, which was first disclosed in last weekend's Mail on Sunday, was September - and not October 28, as appears on the leaked copies. A banker said last night that he regarded it as 'highly significant' that the date had been altered on the leaked memorandum. Since the memorandum was drafted by Mr Richard Ramsey, the bank's director of structured finance, the bank has satisfied itself that Asprey is trading in accordance with the terms of the Pounds 20m banking facility, which it provided to the group on June 29. Asprey's shares have plunged to 148p from a year's high of 357p. Most of the price collapse came in September, when the group announced that it would be only 'marginally profitable' in the first half of the financial year and that profits in the full year would be 'well below current market expectations'. In the memorandum, Mr Ramsey says: 'It is possible that the directors (of Asprey) were not wholly open with us at the time of signing (of the loan facility) with regard to the achievement of the budgeted level of profit'. However, a banker said this was a view intended for discussion by internal executives only and did not represent the board's opinion. In the previous year, Asprey made pre-tax profits of Pounds 25.4m. Its accounts for this year were signed and approved by directors and auditors on July 6. In the preface to the accounts, Mr John Asprey, the group's chairman, says: 'After a world recession . . . we are encouraged by signs of improvement . . . We expect to benefit from a recovery in the economic climate, although the rate of that recovery remains uncertain.' On July 8, Namara, a company in which Mr Naim Attallah, Asprey's chief executive, has a controlling interest, sold its holding of 415,375 Asprey shares at a price of 306p. Namara had bought 250,000 of these from Mr Attallah the previous September, at a price of 317.5p. On July 14, Mr Attallah and another Asprey director, Mr Nicholas Harrington, sold a further 54,127 shares and 30,836 shares respectively, at a price of 310p. These shares had been acquired three days earlier following the exercise of share options at a price of 268p. At around the same time, Asprey's employee benefit fund spent Pounds 774,110 on purchases of Asprey shares. On July 8, it bought 40,375 shares at 306p and on July 14 it bought 209,859 shares. Asprey has indicated that the collapse in profits was due to a large extent to the loss of sales to a particular middle eastern client, believed to be the Sultan of Oman. However, a sharp fall in profits of its main Bond Street showroom in London, responsible for most business with such clients, was already discounted in its budget for the current year. There was a bigger drop compared with budget in the profits expected to be earned by a series of subsidiaries, Watches of Switzerland, Garrard and Les Ambassadeurs.</p>

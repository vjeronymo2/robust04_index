This amendment is prompted by a report of an uncontained stage 1 HPT disk failure which resulted in an aborted takeoff. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an uncontained stage 1 or stage 2 HPT disk failure, which could result in an inflight engine shutdown, rejected takeoff, or damage to the aircraft.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective June 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from General Electric Aircraft Engines, CF6 Distribution Clerk, room 132, 111 Merchant Street, Cincinnati, OH 45246.

That action proposed to require an eddy current inspection for cracks in the stage 1 high pressure turbine (HPT) disk rim bolt holes, and stage 2 HPT disk rim and inner bolt holes; and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. The inspection, and replacement, if necessary, would be performed in accordance with GE CF6&hyph;6 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;1002, dated February 12, 1993; CF6&hyph;6 SB No. 72&hyph;1003, Revision 1, dated June 17, 1993; CF6&hyph;50 SB No. 72&hyph;1057, Revision 1, dated June 17, 1993; and CF6&hyph;50 SB No. 72&hyph;1059, dated February 12, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in compliance paragraph (b)(6) of the proposed rule should be replaced by 1,000 cycles in service (CIS) after the effective date of this AD, in order to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs. This change is consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer, and is supported by the positive inspection results to date. This final rule has been revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in compliance paragraph (b)(6) of the proposed rule should be extended to one year after the effective date of this AD, in order to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs in part. The FAA agrees that the current compliance end-date may cause forced engine removals; however, an extension of this date alone may still cause an undue burden on low cycle/low time operators. A cyclic definition in lieu of a compliance end-date will help alleviate this potential problem. The manufacturer has informed the FAA that a typical operator accumulates approximately 1,000 CIS in one year. This change is consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer, and is supported by the positive inspection results to date. Therefore, the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in paragraph (b)(6) in the proposed rule has been replaced in this final rule by 1,000 CIS after the effective date of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters state that the compliance end-date of May 31, 1994, in compliance paragraph (a)(1) and (a)(2) should be removed, and 4,500 cycles since new (CSN) should be replaced by 5,400 CSN to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs. This change is consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer, and is supported by the positive inspection results to date. This final rule has been revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters state that the compliance end-date of May 31, 1994, in compliance paragraph (a)(3) should be replaced by 1,400 CIS after the effective date of this AD to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs. This change is consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer, and is supported by the positive inspection results to date. This final rule has been revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REED JUNIOR HIGH WINS MATH CONTEST  </P> <P> For an unprecedented second year in a row, a team of students from Walter Reed  Junior High School in North Hollywood has captured the state championship in a  national mathematics contest.  </P> <P> Walter Reed beat out teams from other California junior high schools to win the  Mathcounts competition held Saturday at Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> The second consecutive win by the Walter Reed team is a feat unmatched in the  daylong contest's seven-year history.  </P> <P> Coached by teacher William Fitz-Gibbons, the four students on the team were  Eric Yeh, Anshul Amar, Daniel Kamins and Daniel Shell. Individual scores by  Yeh, Amar and Kamins also ranked in the top 10.  </P> <P> Fitz-Gibbons, who has coached the Walter Reed team since 1985, said the team  never has placed lower than fifth in the competition.  </P> <P> Mathcounts is sponsored by the National Society of Professional Engineers to  encourage students to study mathematics and become engineers. Individual  students are ranked according to their performances in two rounds of written  examinations.  </P> <P> Team standings are determined by taking the average of individual scores and  adding the result to the outcome of a final round in which the four team  members work together to solve a series of problems.  </P> <P> The top four individuals from Saturday's contest will form the California team,  which will compete in national competitions May 18 in Washington. Fitz-Gibbons  said this was the first year Walter Reed has not had a student on the  California team.  </P></p>

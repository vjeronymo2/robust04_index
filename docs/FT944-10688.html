			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Second high for Sonae Sonae Investimentos, Portugal's largest conglomerate, hit its second consecutive 1994 high yesterday on forecasts of strong earnings growth and increased liquidity, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. The shares were Es56 higher at Es3,734 by the close. Dealers said foreign investors led the surge, and projected a rise to above Es4,000 by the end of the year. Yesterday's high represented a 55 per cent jump since June 20, when the shares began to climb on anticipation of robust half-year results. Sonae forecasts that net consolidated earnings for 1994 will double to Es10bn. Earnings for Sonae's core business of hypermarket and supermarket chains are expanding rapidly and a turnround is under way at the group's smaller industrial division, Sonae Industria, based on wood processing. A recent study by Banco Portugues de Investimento and Schroder Securities also highlighted strong earnings potential for the group's unlisted divisions: Sonae Imobiliaria, a shopping mall real estate company, and Pargeste, which groups together non-core interests. Mr Belmiro de Azevedo, Sonae chairman and chief shareholder, said last week that these two subsidiaries would be floated on the Lisbon stock exchange in 1995. The free float of Sonae Industria is also expected to be increased from about 32.2 per cent to 40 per cent later this month.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Observer: Homeward bound No word yet on Sir Andrew Hugh Smith's plans after he steps down as chairman of the London Stock Exchange in a fortnight. But Martin Hall, head of Hugh Smith's propaganda machine, is already being courted by headhunters. Maybe he will succeed Rosalind Gilmore as chairman of the Building Societies Commission. A former Treasury boffin, he helped draft the Building Societies Act. One drawback - does the BSC have a long-term future? And the job is only a Grade-II civil service post - so Hall might have to take a hefty pay cut.</p>

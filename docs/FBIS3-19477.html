			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Red Army Faction (RAF) has raised  its voice again: In an 18-page letter to the east German daily  JUNGE WELT, the terrorists denied that Klaus Steinmetz, an  undercover agent of the Federal Office for the Protection of the  Constitution [BfV], was an RAF member. Steinmetz was involved  in the antiterrorist operation at Bad Kleinen on 27 June 1993.  The RAF letter, which was described as authentic by BfV experts  on Wednesday [16 March], notes; "Had our contacts with  Steinmetz been as intensive and close as claimed by the state  protection propaganda, we would have uncovered him as a cop."    According to the RAF, there was no cooperation with  Steinmetz  for the blowing up of the "Weiterstadt jail" on 27 March last  year. Statements claiming anything else are "lies." The  "alleged membership of a cop in the RAF" is an action intended  to further defame the organization in public. Such rumors were  spread by the "state protection propaganda."    According to information provided by JUNGE WELT, the  declaration also rejects BfV claims that the RAF stayed in touch  with supporters through a mailbox. The sole purpose of these  statements is "to destroy the communication structures of the  radical left."    For the first time, the terrorist organization has made a  public comment on the split between the RAF prisoners. The  split was not caused by the negotiations of lawyer Christian  Stroebele on easing prison conditions and the early release of  prisoners, but the fact "that some prisoners had split with us  long ago." The split was the result of "longstanding  antagonisms that have never been clarified."    The RAF wants to stick to its objective of establishing,  along with all revolutionaries, a "social counterpower from  below," and to dispense with attacks against leading state and  business representatives. The underground organization has  admitted its failure. "We are further away from the social  identifiability of our struggle than in past years."    The letter further states: "Since the operation of Bad  Kleinen, it has been absolutely clear to us that parts of our  attempt in past years to use our concrete initiative for the  freedom of the prisoners, even in an era of transition to new  regulations, has failed and cannot directly continue that way."  Today the left "is not tangibly present, not because there are  no leftists, but because they hardly try to develop a joint  force."    "In the developments of the past few years that culminated  in  the rift, we crashed on the basis of reality. As political  setting prisoners/RAF [als politischer Zusammenhang  Gefangene/RAF] we have not managed to build on the experience of  23 years of struggle for this process together. This is a  defeat," the extensive paper further states. It is signed:  "Red Army Faction, 6. 3. 1994" and bears the RAF emblem with a  submachine gun against the background of the five-pointed RAF  star. According to JUNGE WELT, the letter was received by the  Berlin daily on 15 March.</p>

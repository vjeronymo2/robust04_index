			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MAPLE LEAFS, ING HALT RANGERS, 4-1  </P> <P> There are better ways to break into the National Hockey League than as a  goaltender for the Toronto Maple Leafs.  </P> <P> Peter Ing, 21, is learning the lesson, but he is also giving the team with the  worst record some solid netminding.  </P> <P> With Aaron Broten scoring two goals, the Maple Leafs, behind Ing, beat the New  York Rangers, 4-1, Wednesday night at New York.  </P> <P> Ing stopped 19 shots, losing his shutout when Ray Sheppherd scored on a power  play with 2:37 remaining.  </P> <P> It was a reversal from Ing's first appearance against the Patrick Division  leaders. On Oct. 22, he gave up five goals in 45 minutes before being replaced.  </P> <P> Although he has lost 14 games, Ing has won seven of the nine games Toronto has  won.  </P> <P> It was only the Rangers' second home loss in 15 games.  </P> <P> Broten was acquired by Toronto from Quebec on Nov. 17. "All you can do is go  out and do your best," he said. "You play for pride. I did that at Quebec and  now I'm doing it again. Hopefully, with people like Ing, we will improve."  </P> <P> Quebec 1, Montreal 1 -- It was a moral victory for the Nordiques. After beating  the Canadiens Tuesday night at home, they came right back to get a tie at  Montreal.  </P> <P> Although the Canadiens outshot Quebec, 35-22, there was only 5:18 left when  Shayne Corson scored their only goal. It spoiled goalie Ron Tugnutt's bid for  his first shutout in his 96th NHL game.  </P> <P> A crowd of 16,832 jeered as the Canadiens, one of the worst teams on the power  play, blew all six of their opportunities.  </P> <P> Chicago 3, Washington 2 -- Dirk Graham scored a short-handed goal with 4:25  left at Chicago to give the Blackhawks the victory.  </P> <P> Graham's backhander from seven feet out enabled the Blackhawks to reach 50  points before any other team. With a 24-11-2 record, the Blackhawks lead the  Norris Division by six points.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks took control in the last period. For the first 14 minutes, the  Capitals had only one shot on goal. Ed Belfour stopped 16 shots for his 22nd  win. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

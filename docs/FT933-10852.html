			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Update of trademark law back on agenda A MUCH-DELAYED overhaul of the law on trademarks, intended to simplify and modernise the system for registering and protecting them, is set to be brought forward in government legislation this autumn. The proposals are based on the white paper published in September 1990. Until now, parliamentary time has not been found for a bill because ministers have not regarded the policy as a political priority. It will be the third piece of legislation for next session sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry, even though the government's business managers have sought to curb the number of bills. The DTI's other bills are the flagship measure on deregulation and the legislation to privatise British Coal. The trademark bill has been bounced out of the legislative programme before, but unless emergency legislation is required on a subject as yet unforeseen, officials are confident that this time it will make it to the statute book. It is a sign of the influence wielded by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, that his third priority for legislation should be included when other measures of a similarly worthwhile but undramatic nature have been ruled out by the business managers because of lack of time. Pressing ahead with the move is also intended to strengthen the UK's hand in its lobbying for London to be the site of the European Community trademark office. In spite of discussion among EC member states, the office is among the institutions still awaiting a location, and no agreement is expected for some time. The main elements of the bill are expected to be: a more flexible definition of the kinds of signs that may be treated as trademarks; a presumption that a mark ought to be registered unless there is some specific objection; simplified procedures for registering marks with the Trade Marks Registry; and improved protection for existing trademarks. The new law will also contain a provision allowing the UK to ratify the protocol to the Madrid Agreement, an international system for the protection of trademarks, making it easier for UK trademark owners to obtain protection in other countries.</p>

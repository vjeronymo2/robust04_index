			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance Deputy Mirko Tremaglia, </F> chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Chamber of  Deputies, by Stefano Mensurati in Rome; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Tremaglia] We really must  achieve a strengthening of European political union, which  cannot be confined to the Maastricht Treaty, which is  restrictive. To build European unity with the help of all the  continent's countries, from those of EFTA [European Free Trade  Association] -- which include Norway -- to those of East Europe.  These latter must be free to decide independently on NATO  membership -- without any vetoes from Russia -- which is partly  supported by the United States, though Clinton has now softened  his stances, by moving on from "if" to "when" the countries of  the East can join the Atlantic alliance. I have argued the need  to take account of the problems being experienced by Russia,  whose intervention in the conflicts in the republics of the  former Soviet Union are to some extent understandable. Then  there is the problem of the Russian minorities, not to mention  the still unresolved issue of the dismantling of nuclear  weapons. These statements were appreciated by all the  delegations and may have helped the Norwegians to understand  that perhaps some people went too far.    [Mensurati] The atmosphere was already different by the time  you left.    [Tremaglia] Yes, indeed. The chairman of the Norwegian  parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, Blankenborg, a  Laborite, said: "I have no intention of taking part in a witch  hunt and of persecuting someone because of his past. Mr.  Tremaglia must be judged on the basis of his ideas now." He was  supported in this by the daily, AFTENPOSTEN, in an editorial  which stated among other things: "Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore  Godal recently said that he does not want any meetings with  neofascist members of the Italian Government. Immediately  afterward he went to China to shake hands with the very same  people who trampled the democratic forces only a few years ago.  It seems that `the name is worse than the action,' that the  name `neofascist' is a greater problem than the real conditions  created by `a totalitarian, barbaric, and regressively Marxist  China.' This shows that we can legitimately expect to be judged  on the basis of our deeds."    [Mensurati] This responsible stance was also adopted by  American President Clinton.    [Tremaglia] The final echoes of the dispute will end with  the  major electoral blow that will fall on the left-wing forces in a  week's time. I would say that Clinton's remarks are perfect.  He said that he felt like an Italian citizen and, in view of  the need for change, he said, with regard to the prime minister:  "Let us allow him to work and support him." With specific  reference to the AN ministers, he put an end to all speculation:  "In a democracy different parties have their roots in the past,  and people must be judged on what they do, not on their labels."    Clinton's remarks have put an end to a passing phase, so no  more interference, especially from the French president, who  would do better to concern himself right now with France's  serious responsibility for what is happening in Rwanda, the arms  trafficking which preceded the massacre, and for which previous  Italian governments also bear their share of responsibility.    [Mensurati] With regard to Rwanda, two days ago the Foreign  Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies unanimously  approved a document submitted by its chairman.    [Tremaglia] There is a certain style and tradition in the  Foreign Affairs Committee that I want to encourage: The  nation's problems come before partisan considerations.    The issue under discussion was this disastrous situation in  Rwanda, and I called for the foreign minister to speak, and he  promptly addressed the committee. So the first meeting was  attended by Martino and his under secretaries. The proceedings  were of a very high standard. Everyone approved the resolution,  with no exceptions. This was a satisfying conclusion for me,  from a personal viewpoint too, after some disappointments.    [Mensurati] Which we will pass over...    [Tremaglia] ...no, we will return to them, to express my  absolute determination to fight with Italians around the world  for the defense of their rights, and more besides. I very much  wanted, I would say I built, this ministry for expatriate  Italians, in order to set in motion a comprehensive policy  involving our fellow countrymen at all levels in the media and  in the field of promulgating our culture, in the field of  economic cooperation, and in the field of organizations.    [Mensurati] Clinton's visit to Italy was scheduled a long  time ago, but nevertheless it is taking place at a time of major  political developments. What is your opinion of it?    [Tremaglia] The visit signifies several different things,  and  I will not try to evade them. It recalls the time of war, but  it is an important political act, with respect to Italy too.  Clinton said he is anxious to have contacts with our  government. I must say that this visit also prompts a serious  reflection. That is, the civil war between the nations of  Europe and the civil war in Italy ended 50 years ago. So this  is a great act -- in both ethical and political terms -- of  reconciliation among all the European states and among the  Italian people. We have always felt this need for  reconciliation by paying tribute to the fallen, without partisan  distinctions, and by demanding respect for the living who fought  on both sides. As happened at Montecassino, where on 19 May  there were not only Italians present, but representatives of all  the foreign armies that fought there 50 years ago.    This is the attitude with which, with great enthusiasm, I  regard Clinton's arrival in Italy. He is a president that has  displayed great sensitivity, the ability to understand that only  within mutual respect and a solid alliance without any first-  and second-class distinctions can we confront, with  determination and the necessary compactness, the challenges that  face us at the international level.</p>

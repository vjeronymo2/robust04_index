			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Boycott, He Urged: The co-chairman of Proposition 140, Lewis K. Uhler, is  calling for a viewer boycott of the CBS mystery "Murder, She Wrote" and its  sponsors if a commercial with its star, Angela Lansbury, opposing Propositions  131 and 140 remains on the air. Uhler's ire was raised after Lansbury said in  the ad that if Propositions 131 and 140 pass, "millions of your tax dollars  will go to politicians' campaigns" -- an apparent reference to provisions of  Proposition 131 that would set up a system for public financing of campaigns.  However, Proposition 140 has nothing to do with campaign financing. CLAUDIA  PUIG  </P></p>

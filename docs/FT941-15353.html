			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mother does not want to be a burden on her daughter Sir, Mr L J S Evans's letter (January 12) posed the question 'What does mother think?' regarding views expressed by my daughter. Well, mother does not want to live with daughter either, especially when I become old, infirm, incontinent, and so on. I quite understand my daughter's sentiment and her very practical wish to provide for elderly members of her family. I, too, would welcome a policy to which I could contribute, along with my children if they so wished, while I am still financially able to do so. What parent wants to burden offspring with the added responsibility of becoming carers, especially when they have families, careers and lives to lead. As our health service appears to be falling into rapid decline, and decent residential homes for the elderly become increasingly expensive and therefore elitist, let's hope some other institutions - friendly societies or others - start to look at the problem.

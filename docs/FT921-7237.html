			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Scent of victory for fighter: The UK is confident that the EFA project will go ahead, despite German uncertainty The first prototype of the revolutionary, multinational and decidedly controversial European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) looks unremarkable at first sight. It stands in the middle of a hangar, trailing strands and bunches of electrical cables from its half-filled belly and wings, like some wounded beast with its entrails hanging out. Its state-of-the-art carbon fibre composite bodywork (70 per cent of the total surface area, another first) is dull grey, yellow and ochre, more like heavy-duty linoleum than space-age material. The development hangar is in the heart of the Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB) manufacturing complex at Ottobrunn, just south of Munich, where the multinational Tornado was first put together. As a multinational exercise, however, it looks and sounds rather more impressive: three British electricians are working in the cockpit, two Italians under the left wing, and a Spaniard is perched on top of the right wing, while Germans are ferrying parts to the fuselage, all communicating in English. It is going to have to be impressive, if it is to survive in the harsh world of post-Cold war military budgets. This is the last year of EFA, but only in name. By next year it is due to be re-baptised. Managers are urgently searching for a title more appealing to the taxpayers of four countries, who stand to pay more than Pounds 20bn on the most complex flying machine ever built in Europe. Above all, they need a more popular image in Germany, the partner nation whose commitment to the project - known there as the Jager 90 - has been most in question. In the UK, confidence has been growing in the past few months that the two-engined, single-seat, delta-winged, fly-by-wire fighter will go ahead. But it will not be quite the way it was planned. It will happen less rapidly, the partner nations will between them buy fewer aircraft, and Britain will have to assume a more dominant role. The partners - comprising the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain - are now completing an Pounds 8bn development phase. The debut flight was to take place about now, but has been set back several months. It is uncertain whether it can be the star performer at the Farnborough air show in September. 'The cockpit is still very empty. That is the worst,' says Dr Achim Aehlig of the EFA programme division at MBB. 'There is work-sharing on every instrument, and on top of that we have transport problems within the EC. 'Sometimes parts have to spend six or eight weeks at the customs because these are classified as military exports,' he says with a grimace. 'It's easier to get cocaine from South America.' A decision on investment to set up EFA production was to have been made by the end of this year, but this may well move into early 1993. The target date for bringing the first aircraft into service has already slipped from 1996 to 1997, but planners say it should still be possible to meet that deadline. With the decision on production investment, the partners will have to reorganise the share-out of work. As with the Anglo-German-Italian Tornado programme, now almost over, work is given to each country in relation to how many aircraft it buys. For the development phase the UK and Germany assumed 33 per cent each, Italy 21 per cent and Spain 13. Already, Spain is saying it wants to buy fewer machines - 87 instead of the original 100, according to Mr Julian Garcia Vargas, the defence minister. Germany - assuming that it stays in the programme - now appears unlikely to want aircraft until quite late in the delivery schedule, and it is expected to buy closer to 150 aircraft rather than the 250 envisaged at the outset. Any reduction in Bonn's commitment means that the British government - still pledged to buying 250 of the fighters - would be paying a larger proportion of the bill. Project managers say that this would probably mean only a marginal increase in the absolute cost to the UK. They are hoping for a 'reasonable' production run of at least 500-600 aircraft. But even with only 400, the 'flyaway' cost - the basic cost of each aircraft, not counting the money that has already been spent on development - would not be significantly higher, they say. If the UK government were to assume the main responsibility for the project, the programme would be more exposed to public debate, particularly if there were any serious glitches. So far, EFA has enjoyed all-party support in the UK, in stark contrast with Germany, where opposition is strong. To palliate this resistance, Bonn has set up a series of reviews on possible alternatives to EFA. The key working group consists of six members of the ruling coalition. The Free Democrats, the junior coalition partners, are most divided on the issue, with Mr Jurgen Mollemann, their economics minister, on the record as saying: 'This is one bird which will never fly.' The six are to report by the summer. The opposition Social Democrats are much more solidly opposed. 'The cost explosion of the Jager-90 is simply no longer bearable,' says Mrs Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, the party's finance spokesman. 'It is time for iron savings measures, and not for blowing more money on militarily unnecessary grand projects.' UK planners are optimistic that, even if Germany opts out, Italy and Spain will remain committed and keep the project from collapsing. Germany's work-share could be redistributed among the other partners, or the work could be subcontracted to the same German companies. At MBB and its parent group, Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), they are confident that the decision can only go in favour of EFA, unless the design parameters are completely redrawn. All the partners looked in detail at rivals, such as McDonnell Douglas's F/A-18, before they signed away the money for EFA development. However, one aircraft they did not look at then, but which the Germans have looked at since, is the Russian MiG 29. Bonn inherited 24 of these from the former East German air force. They would be cheaper to buy than EFA, but they have a comparatively short useful life, adding to their long-run cost, and the German air force has already had problems obtaining spares. Dasa says that the aircraft is 'no longer seriously under consideration'. More likely options would include the French Rafale, due for service with the French navy from 1996 and the air force from 1998. However, the Rafale is built for a different requirement and could prove as expensive as EFA. The EFA's 'flyaway' price is reckoned to be about Pounds 20m at today's prices - some 20 per cent less than that of a Tornado fighter-bomber. Also under review in Germany are US fighters from the current top-of-the-range F-15 to its planned successor the F-22. Choices include future developments of the F/A-18 and General Dynamics' successful F-16. The F-16 would be cheaper than EFA. But, like Sweden's new Gripen fighter, it has only one engine - and that is anathema to the German air force after the notorious sequence of crashes, beginning in the 1960s, which involved the single-engined F-104 Starfighters. Conceived in the Cold war, EFA is now touted as an aircraft versatile enough for contingencies around the globe. But its performance requirement is still measured against the best Russian product - no longer seen as the MiG 29 but potential improved versions of the Su 27 counter-air fighter. According to projections by British Aerospace (BAe), none of EFA's rivals would do as well against an upgraded Su 27 in air-to-air combat except for the Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics F-22. But, say EFA project managers, the latter will be much bigger and heavier than EFA; it is unlikely to be able to take off from a 500m strip (one of the EFA requirements); and it is not meant for a secondary ground-attack role. It is also highly secret, not yet exportable, and probably at least twice the price of EFA. There are strong industrial arguments for Germany remaining in the EFA programme. Its aircraft industry was reorganised with government encouragement in 1989, when Daimler-Benz took control of MBB to form Dasa. EFA is the largest collaborative military programme it is likely to have for a long time to come. The company would benefit from EFA exports, for which there are high hopes. Any alternative would be unlikely to offer it more than a production sub-contracting role. Dasa wants to work from the experience of Tornado and EFA to form a joint European military aircraft company, which would eventually bring in Dassault of France. Nobody believes Europe can afford to split ranks again and produce two aircraft of this kind simultaneously - Dassault is already talking with BAe about the next generation of supersonic combat aircraft that would succeed EFA and Rafale some time after 2020. Bonn's risk, if it withdraws from EFA, is that German industry would be left on the sidelines. But Germany has a tight budget for buying a new fighter - DM 12bn (Pounds 4.1bn) between now and 2005 - and has already started looking for ways of cutting its EFA costs. It has pulled out of an infra-red sensor system for the aircraft and is looking for cheaper electronic warfare equipment than the system chosen by the other partners. The partners have cut the number of prototypes from eight to seven and are studying changes in assembly arrangements. The aircraft is planned like the Tornado, with each partner producing separate bits. EFA's front end is British, its middle German, its rear end Spanish and Italian, its fin German, its left wing Italian and its right wing sometimes British, sometimes Spanish. Under the Tornado model, each country would carry out its own assembly and its own flying tests. It may be possible to reduce the number of test centres, but partners will be reluctant to lose their assembly lines, which would cost jobs. Tight cost limits were imposed for the development programme, with performance targets written into the contract, and companies bearing the penalty if costs exceed the budget. But it is clear that a serious overrun would test the determination of governments. Would they pursue their strict principles to the point of bankrupting their national aircraft companies? As defence budgets shrink, other services look askance at the amount of available funds that EFA will eat up. But at the same time, the aircraft it is due to replace - including Italian F-104s, and German and Spanish F-4 Phantoms - are becoming increasingly expensive and difficult to maintain. EFA's proponents are banking on the lack of an alternative. The development money is already spent. Whether there is any other realistic choice that would not, at this stage, prove more expensive is doubtful. It is almost certainly too late for Dasa or any of its counterparts in the other EFA countries to play a significant part in an alternative project. And there is no other military aircraft programme in the offing until well into the next century - not one that could sustain a full capability for designing and making front-line fighters. That is something that neither Britain nor Germany is probably yet prepared to relinquish.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F> Serbian Krajina, by unidentified correspondents in Belgrade on  16 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Martic] We did not discuss the future status of  the republic of Serbian Krajina. We will deal with this problem  in the coming period, and we have said that the problem of the  republic of Serbian Krajina must be returned to the  International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia since it is  well known that we have not been present there for some time  now. The Krajina is being discussed without the presence of the  Krajina representatives. Therefore, I believe that in the near  future, the Krajina will have its place at the Conference on the  Former Yugoslavia, where this issue will be reviewed. However,  generally, the issue of the Krajina will be solved on the  principle of self-determination, something that has been  guaranteed to all other peoples; we shall fight so that we in  the republic of Serbian Krajina can also have this right.    [Unidentified correspondent] How did Mr. Churkin react to  this?    [Martic] Well, quite correctly, and he supported the  initiative to have our problem solved within the framework of  the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Martic, has there been  pressure for the Krajina to join the Muslim-Croat federation?    [Martic] There has been no pressure so far. Probably most  of the pressures are now concentrated on that part of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. I suppose that there will be [pressure].  However, nothing in the Krajina can be solved without the people  of the republic of Serbian Krajina, without the legitimately  elected institutions -- the parliament, government, president;  we shall decide the future of the republic of Serbian Krajina  within this framework. Moreover, I believe that the fate will  be decided in a [word indistinct] new referendum before the  international public, once we in the republic of Serbian Krajina  are granted this right, the right to self-determination.    [Unidentified correspondent] In what phase are the  negotiations, the direct negotiations, between the Krajina and  Croatia?    [Martic] Well, for a long time we did not hold any  negotiations for well-known reasons, because Croatia simply did  not respect any peace agreements and continued with  provocations, infiltrating terrorist groups like the one  recently infiltrated into Lika where the Vojnic territory was  taken back -- this is known -- then again recently, the  infiltration of groups into the area of Banija, or more  precisely, around Glina, where we have noticed a constant  duality of the Croatian side [sentence as heard]; on one hand  they are stressing peace, promoting peace in the world, yet on  the other hand they are constantly provoking. [Words  indistinct] as we have agreed today to negotiate a cessation of  hostilities, to establish peace, which certainly does not mean a  political solution for either the Krajina or Croatia.    [Unidentified correspondent] What were your conditions for  going to Zagreb?    [Martic] We certainly stressed that it has got to be known  that this is not the territory of the Republic of Croatia, that  this is extraterritorial since it is the Russian Embassy, and  with maximum security -- which we do not doubt -- and which will  be taken care of by Russia, by its representatives, that is, so  that our delegation can feel they are on neutral ground and that  they can negotiate on completely equal terms.    [Unidentified correspondent] Who will be in your delegation?    [Martic] Well, we will elect a delegation, probably  comprising the defense minister, the foreign minister, we shall  see, we shall come to a decision in a couple of days.    [Unidentified correspondent] Were you pressured by Belgrade  to accept this agreement?    [Martic] No, no. We held correct talks with Belgrade and  the official authorities, but we have been given the initiative  to decide our own fate; of course, we can accept  well-intentioned suggestions from anyone, particularly  suggestions that are well-intentioned -- and that has always  been the case so far -- and we accept the suggestions of the  ruling cadre of the Republic of Serbia. However, we were not  pressured.    [Unidentified correspondent] (?Will you be meeting with  Milosevic)?    [Martic] I probably will. This cooperation is simply  necessary and it was never discontinued.</p>

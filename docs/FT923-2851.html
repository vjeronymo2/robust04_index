			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / End of car strike opens way for Fiat takeover A SEVEN-WEEK strike at Poland's FSM small car factory, which is being taken over by Fiat of Italy, collapsed yesterday giving the government a victory in its battle for wage restraint. The government had been hoping that its firm stance on the FSM strike would send a positive signal to foreign investors. The way is now open for Fiat Auto, which last May signed a deal worth nearly Dollars 2bn for the plant, to take possession. Fiat has been waiting for the strike to end and the company's office in Warsaw says it hoped the 'opening date' for the takeover would be October 1. Meanwhile up to three thousand workers yesterday agreed to leave the plant at Tychy in southern Poland after failing to win concessions other than a 30 per cent wage increase offered by Fiat at the end of July. The rise will come in to effect once the Italian car maker is in control and should bring the average monthly wage at the plant up to 4m Zloty (Pounds 156). The strikers had originally demanded that wages be indexed to the market price of the new Cinquecento car they have been producing for Fiat at FSM since the New Year. FSM was to have produced 160,000 vehicles this year but the strike has resulted in the loss of some 15,000 cars, delaying Fiat's western Europe sales campaign for the Cinquecento this autumn.</p>

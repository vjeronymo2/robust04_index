			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said on Wednesday no sanction against North Korea is being  mulled among South Korea and some of its allies outside the  frame of the United Nations in connection with the nuclear  question.    "It is not proper to discuss any sanction outside the United  Nations at this time when international negotiations are going  on over the issue of sanctions," the president said.    In an exclusive interview with the daily HANGUK ILBO on its  40th anniversary, Kim said the most important thing under the  circumstances is to adopt sanctions against North Korea through  the UN Security Council.    The president said this is no time for South Korea and the  United States to discuss ways to induce North Korea to come to a  dialogue.    "If North Korea is interested in dialogue, Pyongyang itself  should advance an acceptable offer," Kim said.    The president said he would have another telephone  conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton to discuss  possible sanctions against North Korea.    He also said he does not feel the need to modify the  government's unification policy that rules out any unification  by means of absorbing North Korea.    "The government's firm policy is to promote unification step  by step through consultations between the two Koreas," he said.    The president further reaffirmed that during his presidency,  there would be no constitutional change to revise the existing  single five-year term of presidency or in favor of a  parliamentary cabinet system.    Asked if he plans to meet Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the  Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, President Kim said it would be  unnatural for him to discuss political matters with a man who he  said has retired from politics.    "But, I believe there will be some opportunity to meet him  open-heartedly," the president said.</p>

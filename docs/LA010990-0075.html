			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Baccarat Table to Be Installed at LACMA: A dazzling crystal table, made in the  mid-19th Century at the Baccarat French crystal house, is being installed today  in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's decorative arts galleries. The  5x3-foot table is a longterm loan from Los Angeles collectors Arthur and  Rosalinde Gilbert.  </P> <P> The crystal table formerly belonged to Liberace. Asprey galleries of London  bought it for $44,000 in Los Angeles at an April, 1988, auction of the late  singer's collection. The Gilberts subsequently purchased the table from Asprey  for an undisclosed price. Reproductions of baccarat tables are occasionally  offered for sale but, according to the museum, the only other known original is  in the collection of the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y.

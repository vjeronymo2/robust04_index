While in the republic, he met with Vaclav Klaus, the Czech  Republic's prime minister, Ivan Kocarnik, Deputy Prime Minister  and Finance Minister and Radomir Sabela, Deputy Minister of  Industrial and Trade Ministry.    All parties agreed to a co-operative economic expansion in  trade, investment and banking.    Thailand expressed desire to export rice, coffee, and  tapioca  to the Czech Republic. Direct buying and selling transactions  are planned to be conducted through Thailand's Ex-Im Bank  instead of sales through the third country. The two parties  agreed to operate the free trade area of CEFTA [Central European  Free Trade Association] and AFTA [Atlantic Free Trade Area] by  concentrating on Indochina's and Eastern Europe's trade gates to  help decrease export taxes on products bound for the Czech  Republic. The private sectors of both countries will also map  out additional co-operative efforts, he said.    In the investment sector, Thailand persuaded the republic to  pursue their crystal and machinery industry in Thailand.  Expertise and production technology from Czech Republic are  needed in Thailand, said Suphachai.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (3): Toughest time ever for European players - Hardware suppliers are on the defensive as profits plunge BUSINESS has never been easy for Europe's computer hardware manufacturers, and it has probably never been tougher. A combination of the economic recession, fierce competition from US and Asia, and shifting end-user requirements has forced the few remaining full range European players on to the defensive. The past few years have seen a radical restructuring of the European industry and the formation of new defensive and strategic alliances, including some with the US and Japanese computer makers, who dominate the world market and have shown increasing interest in Europe in the run-up to the Single European Market. The US has the largest share in the world of information technology (IT), representing about 42 per cent of the Dollars 545bn world market. However, the European market, with a share of 34 per cent, is growing fast and is expected to become the largest market during the 1990s, according to Datamonitor, the independent market analysts. Hopes that a new European computer super-champion might emerge to compete with International Business Machines (IBM) and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of the US and Fujitsu of Japan, vanished in 1990 when Fujitsu acquired ICL of the UK. Since then ICL, at present the only profitable European computer hardware group, has acquired Nokia Data. In the meantime, DEC has acquired Keinzle, a minicomputer maker which was once owned by Mannesman of Germany, and last year purchased the mini-computer interests of Philips of the Netherlands. Of the top 10 information technology companies in the world in 1990, only three were European, and they were eighth, ninth and tenth. Siemens-Nixdorf Information Systems ranks number eight with worldwide IT revenues of Dollars 7.73bn, Olivetti (ninth) with revenues of Dollars 6.4bn and Group Bull (tenth) with IT revenues of Dollars 6.35bn. All three are losing money. While Siemens's computer operations were modestly profitable before the merger with loss-making Nixdorf, Group Bull and Olivetti have been restructured in an effort tostem losses. Together, the three had combined European IT revenues of about Dollars 16.8bn in 1990, or only about 11.6 per cent of a market dominated by IBM. The fact that even Europe's biggest IT groups are small in comparison with their US and Japanese rivals, reflects the historical fragmentation of the European market and the effect of nationalism in European countries. This has meant that Siemens-Nixdorf, Bull and Olivetti have remained principally domestic full range manufacturers. Significantly, the four largest western European markets in 1991 were Germany (Dollars 23.9bn), France (Dollars 19.4bn), UK (Dollars 16.3bn) and Italy (Dollars 11.4bn). In spite of mergers and acquisitions, there is still substantial overcapacity and margins for hardware manufacturers are shrinking. There is a trend towards smaller products ('down-sizing' or 'right-sizing') as technological advances enable each generation of products to pack the same or more power than their larger predecessors. Thus, today's desktop computer has all the power of a mainframe a decade ago, but the margins on the new technology are much lower. As computers have become more commonplace, they have also become more standardised as end-users have become more experienced and have demanded 'open systems' (and the common platform provided by versions of the Unix operating system). In theory, this means equipment from different manufactures can work together and is interchangeable. This has led to the 'commoditisation' of IT equipment. This has also made it easier to enter the market but more difficult for vendors to differentiate products and has led to thinner margins for manufacturers than on proprietary systems. In turn, hardware companies are being forced to move into new areas where they can 'add value' to their products and boost margins. Led by ICL, they are moving into computer software and services to leverage their revenues from hardware products. As such, they are trying to present themselves as providers of 'systems solutions,' rather than merely hardware vendors. 'One of the important trends which has been with us for a while is for hardware manufacturers to realise that the business is about more than just hardware,' says Dr Aodh O'Dochartaigh of ICL. This means hardware manufacturers are no longer simply competing with each other. As they move into other services in search of new business and higher margins, they are increasingly in competition with existing software providers, computer services companies and the telecommunications groups. The big European IT groups have traditionally had highly centralised structures, but falling margins have forced them to look for ways to cut costs and improve productivity. To compel individual businesses to become more competitive, European IT companies are now decentralising control of their operations. Since a full-blown merger of Europe's remaining independent IT groups is thought unlikely, it is also clear that to survive, European IT groups are having to reach product marketing agreements and form strategic alliances with powerful partners. Such agreements can provide economies of scale, and also help offset the costs of research and development activities. For example, after protracted negotiations with Hewlett-Packard among others, Groupe Bull reached a broad agreement with IBM last year. As part of the agreement, Groupe Bull will obtain access to IBM's Reduced Instruction Set Computing (Risc) expertise and IBM will gain increased manufacturing volumes, improved distribution and access to Bull's expertise in multiprocessing and networking. In addition, IBM is taking an equity stake in Bull and will resell about 100,000 portable computers made by Bull's Zenith Data Systems subsidiary under its own label. Groupe Bull had been hit by increased competition in the European market from Japanese and US manufacturers which were seeking to bolster their sagging profits. To address these problems, Bull instituted a restructuring plan - necessitating a FFr 4bn provision in 1990 - which includes consolidating manufacturing sites, large-scale redundancies and focusing on markets where it has a sustainable advantage, and negotiating alliances. There are persistent rumours that Olivetti is also seeking strategic alliances. The company confirmed late last year that it had held preliminary discussions with Cap Gemini Sogeti, the leading European software and computer services house. Olivetti needs a software partner to boost its activities in that area. Like Groupe Bull, Olivetti, which has traditionally been very strong in PC's and office equipment, has seen profits plunge. It announced a Dollars 242.2m loss for 1991. Olivetti has also been shedding jobs, aiming to cut its workforce by 12 per cent from 47,000 in 1990. However, Olivetti's has little room tomanoeuvre. In spite of lengthy negotiations with the Italian government and trade unions, the company has had to accept fewer redundancies than planned. In theory, Siemens-Nixdorf should be the strongest and largest of the three independent European groups. However, it has taken longer than expected to integrate the two IT operations following the merger and the group has blamed customer uncertainty, the recession and marketplace pressure for losses. The European computer groups have sought assistance from the European Commission. However, while the Commission is keen to help indigenous producers, it says it cannot provide aid or other forms of subsidies which would be seen as anti-competitive. Through various research programmes, especially Esprit, the Commission has, however, encouraged and part-funded collaboration on pre-competitive research and has agreed to support plans for a large project which has become known as the European Nervous System (ENS) - designed as a trans-national high speed data highway which could be used for co-ordinating such common functions as EC social policy and certain tax receipts. Mr Bruno Lamborghini, Olivetti's director for economic research, says: 'The European industry is not dead - it is not finished. It has many skills and resources to take advantage of the enlargement of the market.' What happens to the European industry in the short term is likely to depend on the economic environment. But in the long term, it is already clear that the computer, consumer electronics and telecommunications industries are moving ever closer.</p>

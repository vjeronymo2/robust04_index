			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Truth of the Matter: Hosannas in the high street - Hugh Dickinson enjoys a throng carolling all the way from the cathedral to the shops He - or she - was 'Shocked and Dismayed'. I think the signature was deliberately illegible. He or she was shocked and dismayed to see a senior dignitary of the church rubbing shoulders with the president of the chamber of commerce, the pantomime dame, the mayor, the chairman of the district council and the giant hobnob on an occasion 'which simply advertised the commercial materialism of Christmas'. It all started quite innocently with a friendly glass of dry sherry for civic officials in the cathedral chapter house. The occasion was the switching on of the city lights for Christmas. We processed into the cathedral to find about 800 citizens of Salisbury eagerly waiting to sing their first carols. Various official personages read the familiar lessons - the protocol for these events is always tricky. Which bit of the story is, as it were, senior? Everyone was in fine voice and as we processed out we had to step over round-eyed children sitting in the middle of the aisles waving silver balloons. No shock or dismay yet. Outside the Cathedral, in the windy darkness, the Salvation Army Band waited. As we oompahed our way out into the high street a further 1,000 citizens coalesced around us. There, awaiting us, towered the 15ft high figure of Hobnob, his face freshly painted and his cheeks rouged. He tends to swing in the wind a bit as he rotates on the four pairs of legs beneath him. We surged after him to the entrance of the shopping mall - he had to go around as the archway is too low. Gathered around an empty fountain, the Salvation Army trombones struck up with festive sonority. Startled pigeons leapt out of the eves. 'Thus spake the seraph and forthwith appeared a mighty throng . . .' The mighty throng at the other end of the mall was singing the same carol but a different verse. A group of teenagers outside Millets were singing their own words amid shrieks of laughter - I wonder if they were the same words I laughed at 50 years ago? Crammed against the window of a charity shop, full of artificial snow and secondhand dresses, we bump into the theatre director wiping the steam from her glasses. 'Fancy seeing you here]' we say with equal surprise. The wife of a local landowner, with two long-legged daughters in incredibly short skirts, blows kisses at us across the singing heads. The good humour is almost tangible. The pantomime dame, in a scarlet wig and a saffron ball-gown, has climbed into the fountain. 'Ooh] There's the vicar]' She screams in mock horror, blowing kisses, too. 'All glory be to God on high,' we yell back. Her bosom has slipped and is wildly asymmetrical. Familiar faces and complete strangers smile and sing. The mayor, a small and sprightly woman, is in danger of being swamped. She has a minder who seems far more worried about her heavy gold chain with enamelled medallions than about her personal safety. A quick grab and it would disappear in the crowd. She might, too. Some doughty councillors close in around her and we push on to the market square. Hobnob has already arrived and another 2,000 people are crowded in front of the guild hall by an avenue of four Christmas trees. The traffic has come to a resigned halt with drivers leaning out of their windows. Children climb on to their fathers' shoulders waving glowing wands or wearing Martian head-dresses with iridescent feelers. Somewhere another choir is cheerfully battling with the elements and a complex eight-part carol. We struggle through the crowds behind the Salvation Army which is heading the final push for the safety of the steps up to a Palladian portico. On a small floodlit stage to one side, a comedian in white bow tie and tails has been keeping the crowds amused over a loudspeaker system which carries to only the first 15 rows. Beyond that is jolly pandemonium. A bus honks wearily. A flock of starlings takes off from the plane trees. On to the stage climb the mayor, the panto dame, the council chairman, the mayor's minder (his eyes glued to her neck) and Mr Tourism and Leisure. The church hides discreetly behind a white stucco pillar where a small girl is being quietly and efficiently sick. Pink ice cream. Two pink ice creams by the look of it. I get 10 yards of loo paper from the toilets to mop it up. So I miss the district council chairman's speech. A reporter spots me and prays fervently. 'O God, I wish I had a camera.' Prayer, mercifully, not granted. Now the panto dame has the microphone. He is a real pro and knows just how to work the crowds. 'Did you hear the one about Father Christmas and the rain, dear? He got dreadfully wet]' They love it. But here comes the big moment. The council chairman starts the countdown to the Big Switch On. 'Ten, nine, eight. . .two. . .one. Bingo]' The Christmas trees light up. All the shops around the square follow with their own illuminations. From the roof of the guild hall, fireworks scatter burning embers on upturned faces. Those of us in the portico rush out into the crowds to get a glimpse of all those angels in the sky. A baby in a pram looks up and chuckles. Embers are falling all around so I hold my umbrella over it. 'It's raining stars,' says a boy perched on his father's head. As the laughing crowds disperse we wedge our way against the tide, heading for mulled wine and mince pies with the civic authority, the mayor and the dame. We look back over the seething square. This is what it is all about - the holy and the secular rolled into one rich human texture. You can keep Regent Street. And Oxford Street. This is community. A little bit of heaven. Sorry, Shocked and Dismayed. The Rt Rev Hugh Dickinson is the Dean of Salisbury.</p>

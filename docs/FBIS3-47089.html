The meeting was attended by Yun Ho-chin, a councilor at the  North Korean Embassy in Vienna, and two other North Korean  diplomats and by inspectors at IAEA Headquarters. The meeting  lasted for two hours from 4 in the afternoon, it said.    "There had been the working-level contact (between North  Korea and the IAEA) on problems related to inspection of North  Korea's reported nuclear facilities," IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer  said. "The two sides agreed to continue their contact early next  week."    It has been reported that the two sides agreed in principle  that they will resolve problems related to inspection activities  through negotiation.    Sources said the North Korean officials conveyed Pyongyang's  official position but the two sides could not reach any  agreement on the scope and number of inspections or on the size  of the inspection team and date of its visit to North Korea.    One North Korean official described Friday's meeting as  "very  productive," however, and said that there are some items left  for further discussion and the two sides have decided to solve  the problems, according to an IAEA official.</p>

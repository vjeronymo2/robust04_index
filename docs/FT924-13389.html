			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Clark directors talk for a compromise An announcement is expected today on the outcome of compromise talks at C&amp;J Clark, the private shoe manufacturer and retailer which has been rocked by a boardroom split for two months. Directors will meet at 10 am this morning in a last ditch effort to avert a public confrontation at an extraordinary meeting called for tomorrow. The compromise being hammered out last night is likely to mean the postponement of the egm until April. Four members of the Clark family, which controls 80 per cent of the company, have called for the resignation of Mr Walter Dickson, chairman, and Mr James Power, non-executive director. The chairman and Mr Power are supported by five board directors, including two Clark family members. The group behind the egm offered a 10-point compromise plan on Tuesday, which would leave Mr Dickson's position intact.</p>

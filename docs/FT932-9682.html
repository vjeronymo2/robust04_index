			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / ITV attacked over UK Gold COX ENTERPRISES, the US investor in UK Gold, the satellite television channel, yesterday attacked ITV for suggesting it had been subsidised to enter the UK market. The ITV companies criticised the BBC in a submission to the government last week for getting involved in risk ventures such as UK Gold. ITV said that the only obvious beneficiary of the BBC's involvement in UK Gold had been Cox, which owns cable companies and newspapers in the US. The ITV submission on the future of the BBC said that Cox 'has in effect been given a subsidised entry into the UK broadcasting market by being able to exploit the BBC's programme library - originally paid for out of licence fee money'.</p>

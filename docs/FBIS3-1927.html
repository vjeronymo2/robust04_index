The representatives summed up and  exchanged experiences of launching the campaign to learn from  Lei Feng under the new circumstances of expediting reform and  opening up and establishing a socialist market economic  structure. They pledged to more conscientiously take the lead  in learning from Lei Feng and to bring into full play the role  of militiamen in building two civilizations.    Taking part in the forum were advanced representatives, who  take the initiative to implement the party's policy encouraging  efforts to become prosperous and, after becoming better off,  remember the state and collectives by leading others onto the  road of common prosperity; who seek neither fame nor wealth and  work selflessly at ordinary posts; who enthusiastically render  services for others and set a good example in fostering new  socialist customs and habits; who risk life to protect the life  and property of people; and who safeguard motherland unification  and national unity and make active contributions to promoting  stability and development of the frontier region.    They will attend special report meetings on their advanced  deeds in the capital.</p>

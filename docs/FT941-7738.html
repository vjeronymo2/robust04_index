			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mannesmann warns of heavy loss Mannesmann, the German engineering group, said yesterday it would report a substantial loss in 1993. Without quantifying the loss, it said in its preliminary review of the 1993 financial year that the group had suffered from the continuing weakness of the world economy. Restructuring measures and adverse currency movements had also taken their toll. The economic downturn had hit customer demand, Mannesmann said, and led to sharp price falls in certain sectors of the business, especially the steel tubes activities. Turnover for the group was stagnant, up slightly to DM28.04bn (Dollars 16.5bn) from DM28.02bn, while order intake rose by 1 per cent, from DM27.76bn to DM27.94bn. Income from the telecommunications business, which comprises the D2 cellular telephone network operated by the group's Mobilfunk subsidiary, increased from DM138m to DM902m. Investors' excitement about the potential for this operation drove the shares up 86 per cent last year. Restructuring measures led to a significant reduction in the group's break-even point and enhanced productivity, Mannesmann said. This had strengthened the group's international competition. During the year, the workforce fell 6 per cent to 127,861. Mannesmann indicated that only one of its six divisions made a profit in 1993. However, while machine tools achieved a positive result, the figure was down heavily from 1992, on sales down 2 per cent to DM12.47bn. There was an especially high loss in automotive components, where restructuring charges were high. Turnover here fell 7 per cent to DM6.08bn. Electrical engineering and electronics fell into a loss, partly reflecting outlays on large orders which have yet to produce any income. The traditional steel pipes business reported a large loss, while start-up losses in the telecommunications division were reduced.</p>

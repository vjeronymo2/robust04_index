			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Gangsters go to law for protection GANGSTERS in the Japanese city of Matsumoto have acquired a new identity - Matsumoto Corporation, specialising in property development and interior decorating. Like many Japanese criminal organisations - or yakuza - the Matsumoto gang has registered as a company to try to evade an anti-gangster law which comes into effect today. Others are claiming to offer services from landscape gardening and golf course management to running old people's homes. A gang in rural Fukui plans to specialise in weddings and funerals. The law, and the gangsters' response, highlights the ambivalence of Japanese attitudes to yakuza. There is widespread condemnation of drug dealing, the criminals' biggest source of profit, but some tolerance of their traditional enterprises of gambling and prostitution because many people use these services. Also, Japanese society is highly regimented and yakuza groups provide work for those Japanese who find it difficult to conform. The police say the law is a reaction to a change in yakuza over the past decade. The gangsters used to keep to themselves but are increasingly aggressive towards ordinary Japanese people, pushing into legitimate business such as property development. The police are most worried about the consolidation of yakuza into nationwide organisations. Yamaguchi Gumi, Japan's largest yakuza group, accounts for about 30 per cent of the 90,000 gangsters known to police. Gang leaders have developed into sophisticated businessmen with links with some of Japan's top companies. Sagawa Kyubin, the transport company at the centre of a growing scandal, allegedly lent large amounts of money to companies connected to Mr Susumu Ishii, the former boss of Inagawakai, Japan's second-largest gangster group, who died last year. The law strengthens police power to prevent yakuza threatening ordinary people. Until now the police have only been able to arrest yakuza for threatening behaviour if they could prove the use or threat of force. Victims have often been too frightened to give evidence. Police will now be able to arrest members of designated gangs for extorting protection money under the guise of donations, expelling sitting tenants and extracting phoney sub-contracting orders from companies. The law also prohibits a favourite yakuza ploy - collecting compensation on behalf of victims of traffic accidents. Faced with this challenge, yakuza have gone to their lawyers, who advised turning gangs into incorporated companies. Following lawyers' advice, Yamaguchi Gumi this week sent a faxed message to hundreds of its affiliates urging gangs to register as companies, with the bosses filling the posts of chairman, president and vice-president. Earlier this month, yakuza staged a demonstration in central Tokyo claiming the law infringed their rights. Yakuza said on television they too had to make a living. One even explained why they favoured large cars, such as Cadillacs. The body was made of thicker steel than a Japanese car, he said, and was better at withstanding bullets.

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PLENTY OF GASPS, LAUGHS AT ANIMAL SHOW  </P> <P> Students at the Exotic Animal Training and Management Program at Moorpark  College get plenty of opportunities to share what they know about their  charges.  </P> <P> Regularly scheduled animal shows are held at 3 p.m. each Sunday at the animal  compound's outdoor stage, 7075 Campus Park Drive, at the west end of California  118.  </P> <P> Admission is $2 for adults, $1 for children 12 and under. Special birthday  shows can be scheduled in which a llama, baboon, performing seal and a variety  of animals are part of an ensemble cast of entertainers. Special shows for  classes of schoolchildren can also be arranged. The animals have appeared at  grand openings and other special events. Call 378-1441 for additional  information and rates.  </P> <P> At a recent presentation for nearly 200 kindergarten children, the youngsters  gasped at a vulture and a few let out some "yuks" and "oohs" when Kim Smith,  the trainer, said the birds are bald so that they don't get bloody and dirty  when they stick their heads inside a carcass. Melissa Dawson, 3, said she liked  the sheep the best. But not all children are as easily impressed.  </P> <P> Lynne Doria, the program's assistant director, recalled the time a mother in  Beverly Hills was planning a party for her young son. "She put the boy on the  phone so that I could tell him all the animals we were bringing," Doria said.  "I told him, 'We'll have a sea lion and a llama and a pony' and all these other  great animals. All he said was, 'Oh, no elephant?' "  </P></p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Falling bond prices undercut morning rally Wall Street AFTER a morning rally, US share prices finished at mixed levels yesterday, as falling bond prices undercut the positive impact of the week's corporate earnings reports, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 13.14 higher at 3,649.30 after remaining well above the all-time closing high of 3,652.09 until early afternoon. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 2.08 at 463.28, while the Amex composite was off 0.27 at 477.25. The Nasdaq composite was ahead 1.41 to 772.69. At the opening, equities moved decisively into positive territory, as the bond market registered modest gains over levels reached in Thursday's sell-off. In reviewing the third-quarter performances of many cyclical companies, those most affected by business cycles, many investors appeared to be encouraged by the economic outlook. The perception of improving conditions was reinforced by Thursday's news that business activity in the Philadelphia area had surged over the past month. In the afternoon, however, bonds reversed direction in a nervous reaction to comments made by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year issue was  7/8 lower at 103 23/32 , to yield 5.976 per cent. Stock prices quickly followed suit, falling back from their earlier highs with an added drag from program trading. In the last two hours, the market recovered some steam, but fell short of its initial promise. One of the most actively traded issues was Caterpillar, up Dollars 4 1/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 90 after being upgraded by several analysts on the strength of its earnings report. Another advancing cyclical was Cummins Engine, up Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 87, after it provided forecasters with reasons to expect further profit gains in the fourth quarter. Banking issues continued to recover from losses that followed JP Morgan's cut in its prime lending rate earlier in the week. Bankers Trust climbed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 79 3/8 , while Chase Manhattan added Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 1/2 in heavy volume. JP Morgan gained Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 74. QVC, which has announced an Dollars 80-a-share tender offer as part of a two-tier deal to acquire Paramount, was down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 55 on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, Paramount was up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 77 1/2 . On the Amex, class-A shares in Viacom, Paramount's friendly suitor, fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 59 3/8 . Its non-voting class-B shares were off Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 53 1/2 . Canada TORONTO closed mixed in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index fell 9.39, or 0.23 per cent, to close at 4,153.81. But advancing issues outnumbered declines 372 to 358. Volume was 55.54m shares, down from yesterday's 63.67m shares, and trading value fell to CDollars 642.8m from CDollars 723.1m.</p>

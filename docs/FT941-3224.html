			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / How to lose friends in Europe - Political Notebook When Mr John Major replaced the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, Mr Douglas Hurd took the opportunity to review the way Britain handled negotiations with its European partners. The foreign secretary had long deprecated the former prime minister's bargaining style. She too often found herself in less-than-glorious isolation. There were solemn declarations that she would never back down, confident assertions that the rest of Europe was isolated and frequent public tantrums. Then of course came the retreat. So Mr Hurd sent his colleagues some guidelines to help them occasionally to win the argument in Brussels. It was pretty basic stuff: the sort of advice found in cheap paperbacks on winning friends and influencing people. Ministers should not show all of their cards at the outset. They should work at building new alliances. They should listen as well as speak. They should not stake out publicly a bottom line from which they would be forced to retreat. More than one minister thought such rules so blindingly obvious as to be not worth writing down. Now it is Mr Hurd who is breaking them. The impasse this week over the supposed 'dilution' of British authority in the European Union's Council of Ministers bore all the depressing hallmarks of the Thatcher era. The government sets out what it states to be an immovable position. It becomes progressively isolated. It then prepares for the climbdown, relying on its partners for a figleaf to hide its embarrassment. The latest argument is about the arcane but important issue of how many countries can block a decision when the European Union acts through qualified majority voting. At present the 12 countries share a total of 76 votes. Larger countries have 10 each and smaller ones five or fewer. For a measure to pass it must secure 54 votes. That means 23 votes  - two big countries and one small  - constitute a blocking majority. But when the four new entrants  - Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - join the European Union the total number of votes will rise to 90. Fairly predictably, Britain's partners  - with the exception for complicated reasons of Spain  - want the block-ing minority to rise proportionately to 27 votes. Mr Major's government has combined passionate advocacy of enlargement - a wider Union means a less centralised Union  - with a refusal to countenance any dilution of its own influence. It has couched the argument in terms of preserving the system whereby two large and one small country can together muster a veto with 23 votes  - though in reality Mr Hurd has deeper but unacknowledged concerns that the present voting system is heavily biased in favour of the smaller nations in the Union. Either way, the issue has been elevated into one of great principle. The absurd notion that it is a battle against fiendish federalists has in turn fuelled the Euro-sceptic fire on the Tory backbenches Unsurprisingly, Mr Hurd has found himself outmanoeuvred. Britain's partners will not accept the enlargement that the government wants without the voting change. But a large chunk of the Tory party now sees the change as an unacceptable encroachment on British sovereignty. The party's pro-European wing meanwhile is furious that the government is cast once again as the obstructionist of Europe. So Europhobes and Europhiles are both predicting another civil war in the Conservative party before the June elections for the European Parliament. Mr Hurd is confident he can still pull his hands from the fire: that a deal can be concocted that will satisfy the rest of the Union and be sold at the same time to most Conservative MPs. Enlargement will go ahead and the fragile facade of party unity will be put together again. The foreign secretary's friends are vehement in his defence. By fighting his corner with vigour he will ensure the resultant deal, whatever it is, will be much better than it otherwise would have been. But others whisper that Mr Hurd should not be blamed. He was locked into an aggressive stance by the combative instincts of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and the weakness of Mr Major. But for pro-European Conservatives the saga has exposed a depressingly defeatist view of Britain's place in Europe. It has conducted the debate as if it will always be part of a minority  - seeking to block rather than to promote decisions. It has admitted tacitly it has little hope of winning over the Union's new entrants to the cause of a liberal, decentralised Europe. What is left is a strategy designed to reinforce Britain's capacity to obstruct. So Mr Hurd has stirred up the antagonisms in his own party and given further cause for Britain's partners to doubt its commitment to Europe. Sooner or later  - and probably next week  - the sticking plaster of compromise will be applied. In the interim Mr Hurd might consider re-issuing his negotiating rulebook  - and then reading it.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News in Brief Georg Fischer, the Swiss foundries and engineering group, said 1992 net income tumbled 74 per cent to SFr11m (Dollars 7.1m), mainly because of heavy restructuring costs. The dividend, reduced from SFr10 to SFr8 in 1991, will be eliminated 'in view of the significant deterioration in profitability and the uncertain economic outlook.' ***** Incentive, the Swedish industrial group, saw earnings after financial items rise 70 per cent last year to SKr371m (Dollars 50.8m) from SKr218m, despite a fall in sales to SKr11.77bn from SKr13.77bn, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. If earnings from the group's big shareholdings in Asea, Electrolux and Esab are included, profits rose to SKr1.28bn from SKr1.17bn. An unchanged dividend of SKr6 per share is proposed. The group said sales fell partly because of worse market conditions and partly because of divestments. The recession also hit orders, which fell 20 per cent to SKr11.4bn from SKr14.2bn. The improved result stemmed from rationalisation, more efficient use of capital and share sales. There were better performances from the group's construction and environment, power and camera operations, but the materials handling, process and transportation units all posted weaker results.</p>

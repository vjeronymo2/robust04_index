			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Retention of Thresholds for Recipients of Section 3 Covered Housing or Community Development Assistance; Increased Threshold Amounts; Removal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD Share and Project Cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to promoting one ``effort'' standard that would be applicable to all recipients, several commenters stated that the issue of thresholds also should be treated uniformly. The commenters stated that the thresholds should be applied to all recipients and contractors, or none at all. Eight commenters stated that a threshold requirement is inconsistent with the statute's ``greatest extent feasible'' requirement. Seven commenters stated that a dollar threshold for housing authorities is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  inconsistent with a greatest extent feasible requirement. Nine commenters representing units of local government stated that the dollar threshold for recipients of housing and community development assistance was too low, and should be raised. Other commenters stated that in lieu of a dollar threshold, the rule should establish a population threshold so that small and rural communities which sustain few businesses, and must advertise regionally (rather than locally) to fill economic opportunities, would be exempt from compliance with section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department carefully considered all comments on the issue of thresholds, and determined to retain the proposed rule's position on this issue, which is to provide no dollar thresholds for HAs and their contractors and subcontractors, and to provide dollar thresholds for recipients of housing or community development, and their contractors and subcontractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> No Thresholds for HAs, and Their Contractors and Subcontractors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department continues to maintain that a dollar threshold in section 3 covered public and Indian housing programs is not consistent with the statute. Section 3 applies to public and Indian housing operating assistance, development assistance and modernization assistance, which covers virtually all HA projects and activities. Additionally, the statute is very specific about the residents and business concerns to which HAs and their contractors and subcontractors must give preference. These residents and business concerns are tied to the housing development for which the assistance is expended, or another development owned by the HA. The Department believes that the statute's expansive coverage of public and Indian housing projects and activities indicates that any attempt to diminish the coverage would be inconsistent with the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Thresholds for Other Recipients and Their Contractors and Subcontractors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In contrast to public and Indian housing programs, section 3 coverage in housing and community development programs is limited to housing and community development assistance expended for housing rehabilitation, housing construction and other public construction. The Department continues to maintain that the limited section 3 coverage in housing and community development programs makes thresholds in housing and community development programs acceptable, and not inconsistent with the statute. Additionally, on further consideration, and as discussed below in the section on ``HUD share,'' the Department has determined to raise the thresholds to twice the amount set forth in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Removal of HUD Share and Project Cost <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Related to the issue of thresholds is the concept of ``HUD share'' because, under the proposed rule, the threshold was based on the HUD share of project cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters were divided on the issue of HUD share. Eight commenters stated that in determining whether the dollar threshold is met, the entire project and total dollar amount should be considered, and not solely the HUD share of this total dollar amount. These commenters stated that the use of HUD share creates excessive paperwork. Ten commenters stated that using HUD share to determine the dollar threshold was correct. These commenters stated that to peg the threshold to total development cost would not appropriately tie section 3 responsibility to Federal assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agreed with the commenters who stated that the use of HUD share and calculation of the project cost makes the rule cumbersome, and creates additional paperwork. Accordingly, the interim rule provides for the threshold to be based on the amount of the award of assistance_an amount by which responsibility to comply with the section 3 preference requirements is more easily determined. Because the interim rule removes the HUD share and project cost calculations for determining the threshold (a process which excluded certain costs of the recipient), the Department determined that it is appropriate to raise the dollar thresholds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim rule provides that the requirements of part 135 apply to recipients of covered section 3 housing and community development assistance for which the amount of the assistance exceeds $200,000; and these requirements apply to contractors and subcontractors performing work on projects funded by housing and community development assistance for which the recipient's award exceeds $200,000, and the contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. If the recipient's award of assistance exceeds $200,000, but the contracts and subcontracts do not exceed $100,000, then only the recipient is subject to the section 3 preference requirements. The recipient's responsibility includes awarding contracts, to the greatest extent feasible, to section 3 business concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Clarification of Range of Economic Opportunities ``Arising in Connection With'' Section 3 Covered Housing and Community Development Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the Congress amended section 3, it narrowed the type of activity to which the statute would apply in housing and community development programs to three types of construction projects: housing rehabilitation (including reduction and abatement of lead-based paint hazards); housing construction; and other public construction projects. A few commenters stated that the proposed rule's implication that ``covered opportunities'' in housing and community development programs were limited to construction-type jobs (e.g., heavy labor, trade jobs) was incorrect. The commenters stated that the statute applies to employment and training opportunities ``arising in connection with'' these three types of construction projects, and that jobs arising in connection with these projects are not only the construction jobs, but also, management, maintenance, clerical and administrative jobs that come into existence because of the construction project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

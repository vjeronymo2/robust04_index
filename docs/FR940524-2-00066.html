Trent, M.D; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 22, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to David L. Trent, M.D., 12013 Surrey Lane, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73099. The Order to Show Cause sought to revoke Dr. Trent's (Respondent) DEA Certificate of Registration, AT8064379, and deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner for reason that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4) and 823(f). The Order to Show Cause alleged that between 1989 and 1992, Respondent prescribed numerous controlled substances to at least two individuals, including an undercover officer, for no legitimate medical purpose and outside the scope of professional practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 30, 1993, Respondent filed a request for hearing on the matters raised in the Order to Show Cause. The matter was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Following the submission of the parties' prehearing statements, a hearing date was set for September 22, 1993. On September 14, 1993, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition based on the Oklahoma State Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control's (OBNDDC) September 13, 1993, order revoking Respondent's state license to handle controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OBNDDC order, attached to the Government's motion, referred to an Oklahoma Medical Board (Board) complaint that alleged that in January 1992, Respondent issued two prescriptions for controlled dangerous substances to an undercover agent. According to the Board's complaint, Respondent issued the prescriptions without sufficient examination, without the establishment of a valid physician-patient relationship and without medical need. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board complaint further asserted that during 1991 and 1992, Respondent prescribed, administered and dispensed controlled dangerous substances to other patients without sufficient examination, without establishing a valid physician-patient relationship and without medical need. Following a show cause hearing on June 3, 1993, the hearing officer recommended that Respondent's authority to handle controlled substances be revoked. This recommendation was adopted by OBNDDC order dated September 13, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 27, 1993, Respondent answered the Government's motion and requested that the DEA proceedings be stayed or that the hearing date be rescheduled. On October 6, 1993, the administrative law judge issued an order granting the Government's motion for summary disposition and denying Respondent's request for a stay or rescheduling of the proceedings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No exceptions were filed and on January 18, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Acting Administrator. The Deputy Administrator now enters his final order in this matter pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is well established that the Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he does business. See 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The DEA Administrators have consistently held that practitioners who lack state authorization to handle controlled substances cannot be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration. See Ramon Pla, M.D., 51 FR 41168 (1986); George S. Heath, M.D., 51 FR 26610 (1986); and Dale D. Shahan, D.D.S., 51 FR 23481 (1986). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration concludes that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration should be revoked based on his lack of authorization to handle controlled substances in the State of Oklahoma. The Deputy Administrator has determined that in light of Respondent's lack of state authorization to handle controlled substances, it is not necessary to address whether Respondent's continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AT8064379, issued to David L. Trent, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective June 23, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

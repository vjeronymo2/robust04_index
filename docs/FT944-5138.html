			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Banks More 10-month figures come from the German banks this week, with Dresdner reporting tomorrow, Deutsche on Wednesday and Vereins and Hypo on Thursday, but few analysts expect them to set the market alight. In a pan-European review of the banking sector, Merrill Lynch notes that November saw the bounce from French and Belgian banks that it had been anticipating, producing eight out of 10 of the best performers in Europe. However, Merrill continues to believe that there will be no sustained late cycle rally, in spite of the current buoyancy. It is not encouraged by the environment of rising rates and looks to specific stocks only to deliver longer-term performance. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

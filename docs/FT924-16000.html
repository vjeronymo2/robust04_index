			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK and France agree on Maastricht ratification UK prime minister John Major and French president Francois Mitterrand agreed yesterday on the need for EC states to advance 'as Twelve' to ratify the Maastricht treaty. After a 90-minute talk at the Elysee Palace, Mr Major said the French president showed 'no impatience, but a lot of understanding and agreement' with him on the difficulty of pushing the Maastricht treaty on European union rapidly through a UK parliament, which is divided on the issue. A joint statement issued by the two leaders indicated that Mr Mitterrand is, for the moment, more anxious to help than to pressure Mr Major on the treaty's ratification. The two leaders 'stressed the importance of the Community developing as Twelve and respecting the interests of each member state', the statement said. 'In this context, they looked forward to the ratification and entry into force of the Maastricht treaty.' The absence of any mention of timing on ratification will be helpful to Mr Major, as well as to his Downing Street dinner guest last night, Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister. Before meeting Mr Major, Mr Schluter called for a 'new basis' for the Maastricht treaty as a condition for a new referendum in Denmark next year. He said he saw 'common ground' with other EC countries on the need for more openness and less bureaucracy in EC decision-making. On the question of the timing of any new referendum, he said: 'Whether it is May, June or September (next year) - it's a bit too early to say.' After assurances from Mr Mitterrand that France and Germany were not hatching a fast-track move to a restricted economic and monetary union, excluding the UK and other weaker EC economies, Mr Major said: 'I don't think any of us want to see what is loosely called a two-speed Europe.' After Mr Major congratulated Mr Mitterrand on the outcome of the French referendum, the two men agreed that 'the debate in France and elsewhere about the Maastricht treaty had revealed public concern about the need to build a Community which respected national identity and to avoid Community involvement in matters which should remain the subject of national action'. Mr Major and Mr Mitterrand signalled their hope that the forthcoming EC summit in Birmingham would produce 'a clearer understanding of the respective competences of the member states and the Community'. German chancellor Helmut Kohl has also made it clear that he is on the same wavelength as the British and French leaders about the need for greater 'subsidiarity'. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will today offer a vigorous defence of the Maastricht agreement, coupled with a warning that the UK's interests are unlikely to be as well-served without the treaty, when he addresses a meeting organised by the European Policy Forum, a London think tank. In a speech which will set the government's line of argument in coming months, Mr Hurd is expected to argue that Maastricht represents the opposite of a blueprint for a federal Europe. The range of feeling in the Tory party on the Euro-sceptic side of the argument was underlined again yesterday, as Lord Ridley, a former cabinet minister, rebuked the government for holding the Bundesbank responsible for sterling's difficulties in the exchange rate mechanism.

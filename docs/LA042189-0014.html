			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TARZANA CANYON TO JOIN STATE PARK SYSTEM;  </P> <P> HOME BUILDER DONATES 440 ACRES TO CONSERVANCY  </P> <P> A state parks agency has agreed to accept 440 acres of a scenic canyon in the  hills above Tarzana from a developer preparing to build a tract of expensive  homes along a southerly extension of Reseda Boulevard.  </P> <P> The gift of land in Caballero Canyon is one condition imposed by the city on  the developer of the 178-home Mulholland Park subdivision. Another -- extending  Reseda and paving a small stretch of Mulholland Drive -- is worrying some  neighbors and environmentalists.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy voted earlier this week to accept the  parkland gift, which will increase that agency's holdings near the Mulholland  crest to more than 800 acres.  </P> <P> The state agency already owns a 382-acre tract to the west of the Caballero  Canyon property, which is expected to be deeded to the conservancy this summer.  With the addition, state holdings in the area -- including the 9,000-acre  Topanga and Will Rogers state parks -- will form about a 10,000-acre swath of  parkland from the San Fernando Valley to Malibu and Pacific Palisades.  </P> <P> But a few critics have complained that the road work required for the  development will degrade the newest tract to be acquired by the state. They  also say it could be the beginning of a road for trash trucks to proposed  landfill sites in Sullivan and Rustic canyons south of Mulholland. The sites  are owned by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Condition Questioned  </P> <P> "I'm dying to have those 440 acres," said Jill Swift, a Tarzana resident and  Sierra Club member who leads hikes in the area. "It's just . . . what condition  it will be in by the time we get it?  </P> <P> "It's still beef, but instead of getting a filet, you're getting ground beef,"  she said.  </P> <P> Conservancy officials and an aide to City Councilman Marvin Braude, who  represents the area, said the road work will not be a foot in the door for  landfill development. Braude opposes establishing dumps in the Santa Monica  Mountains, and the conservancy is trying to buy Rustic and Sullivan canyons  from the sanitation districts.  </P> <P> But Joe Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy, said he will ask city  officials to allow narrower paved widths on Reseda and to vacate part of the  city's right of way within state property. This would reduce the chance that a  road wide enough to accommodate trash trucks could be built, he said.  </P> <P> Harlan Lee &amp; Associates, a Marina del Rey developer that is in the process  of acquiring the Mulholland Park tract from Florida-based Avatar Properties,  will consider scaling back the road work if area homeowners desire and city  officials approve, said Michael Dieden, a partner with Harlan Lee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1 1/2-Mile Extension  </P> <P> Reseda now ends at Braemar Country Club. Under conditions imposed by the city  when the 125-acre subdivision was approved years ago, the developer is to  extend Reseda 1 1/2 miles to Mulholland to create a second exit for residents,  in case of fire or other emergency. The Reseda extension is to be 44 feet wide  through the Mulholland Park development and 30 feet wide across state park  property the rest of the way to Mulholland Drive.  </P> <P> The developer is also required to spend about $250,000 on paving Mulholland to  a width of 30 feet both east and west of the Reseda intersection. The road is  unpaved for about 10 miles between Encino Hills Drive above Encino to Canoga  Avenue in Woodland Hills. Gil Bechtel, a consulting engineer for Harlan Lee,  said no more than a few hundred feet could be paved for that amount of money.  </P> <P> The development was approved by the city in 1981, with the condition that the  Caballero tract be given to the conservancy. But the project was delayed, in  part because of opposition to the Corbin water tank that was finally built  along Mulholland partly for fire protection.  </P> <P> Contending that the development never received proper environmental review,  Swift and other opponents urged the conservancy earlier this week to refuse the  gift of land. But the agency's board voted Tuesday to accept it, saying that  refusing the land would not cause the project to be reviewed all over again by  the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Authority  </P> <P> Edmiston said the conservancy had no authority to overturn a city land-use  decision, only an opportunity to obtain public parkland.  </P> <P> Had the conservancy refused the land, the developer could have complied with  city requirements by deeding it to the homeowner association, which would fence  it off, Edmiston maintained.  </P> <P> As it is, "there will be the opportunity to drive up to the end of Reseda . . .  walk under sycamore trees and see a very pleasant canyon that, part of the year  at least, has a running stream through it," he said.  </P> <P> "That land will be publicly usable, as opposed to . . . private open space."  </P></p>

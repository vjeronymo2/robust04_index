			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Monday Interview: Russia's true power broker - Arkady Volsky, leader of Russia's industrialists, talks to John Lloyd and Leyla Boulton He has the face and manners of a Renaissance courtier: strong, subtle, humorous, but with the foxy look of a man with a thousand projects and stratagems. His reputation is for intelligence and guile: even an enemy like Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, information minister and confidant of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, admitted recently: 'Volsky is cunning: and he is now manoeuvring.' Arkady Ivanovich Volsky has ended up on the right side of power for a quarter of century, and may now, in his 61st year, be reaching the apogee of his influence. As president of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, he is the disposer of favour, contracts and authority, whose ability to construct coalitions of apparent strength at a time of flux and crisis has given him the role of kingmaker in Russia. Mr Volsky is tremendously well connected in a country where contacts are all: years in the industrial department of the Communist party's central committee give him a network of acquaintances in nearly every plant of any size in the land. His style is that of the jovial man of business with a grasp of the world - rare, still, in post-Soviet Russia. Last week, to an audience largely of Italian business people, he was an expansive and funny, yet always pointed, lunchtime speaker, warning of the need for political change in Russia: 'Do you know which country understands us best? Germany. And why? Because they have been given a present of East Germany. East Germany has had a mama (he makes the motion of lifting out a breast to give suck) who can feed it. But (his finger up, monitory) we have no mama. Yet Germany now has two fascist parties and 2m unemployed. We must think about this.' However, his commodity is power - and knowledge of where it can be applied. 'Power belongs to those who have property and money,' he told Reuter in July. 'At present it is not the government but the industrial managers who have both.' He is constantly consulted by leading politicians. During our interview in his office last week, he took a call - long, confidential, alternately soothing, joking and commanding - from first deputy prime minister Vladimir Shumeiko, before being bustled out by his aides to meet Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi. His endorsement of a project is almost a guarantee of its success. He moves easily among the business and political elites of the former Soviet states and of foreign countries: travelling and receiving delegations constantly. His friends are British financiers, German bankers, Japanese industrialists. He has the gift, shared with his former patron, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, of conveying personal warmth to anyone he meets - but he has not, it seems, made Mr Gorbachev's mistake of believing personal charm is enough. Mr Gorbachev inherited and lost the vast power of a Communist party general-secretary: Mr Volsky, even while he was in the final 'Soviet' government between the August 1991 putsch and the resignation of Mr Gorbachev last Christmas, was building up his base from the disintegrating parts of the command system. He brought together the great Soviet enterprises, which increasingly had been cast adrift from the 'mama' state at the end of the 1980s, in what is now called the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Associations of joint ventures and co-operatives mingle with the big state companies on the union board, a blending of the public and the private sectors. In the past year, he has added political clout: his union was the guiding spirit behind the combination of three parties - Mr Rutskoi's Free Russia, Mr Nikolai Travkin's Democratic party and his own creation, the Renewal party headed by his deputy, Mr Alexander Vladislyavyev - into the Civic Union. Since it was founded in August, it has attracted the support of parliamentary factions and individual deputies - and of the main trade union federation, the Federation of Indepedent Russian Trade Unions. In Russia, an alliance between the unions and the main employers' organisation is no surprise: both have an interest in putting pressure on the state to continue subsidies to industry. More surprising, and even more of a testament to Mr Volsky's political skill, has been a pledge of support from Mr Konstantin Borovoi, a former commodity and stock market boss who created and leads the Economic Freedom party, a pro-business group. Mr Borovoi initially set himself up as a liberal critic of Mr Volsky: now he has joined the fan club. By enlisting Mr Borovoi's support, Mr Volsky seems to cover almost the entire spectrum of 'moderate' opinion. What will he do with all of this power? Why, to use Mr Poltaranin's word, is he now 'manoeuvring'? Using the practised phrases of a politician who must have employed them at a hundred meetings and briefings, he talks of wanting a 'correction' in government policy; of wanting to rid the cabinet of 'incompetent people and crooks'; of a round table, convened by the president, with the participation of all the politicial parties and blocs. His union of industrialists has already completed a plan to 'correct' the government's policies: this has gone to President Yeltsin, and will be presented to a conference of industrialists on November 14. As for cabinet changes, Mr Gaidar, the acting prime minister, must stay in it, he says. But, asked if Mr Gaidar must stay as prime minister, Mr Volsky avoids a direct answer. Instead he says that he has told Mr Gaidar that anyone who cannot command authority in that post should go. Will he get the changes in government and policy that he wants? It is evident things have been moving his way: 'The government has listened to us and is listening to us,' he says. He claims the meeting between senior ministers and industrialists in the car-manufacturing town of Togliatti, on the Volga, last weekend fulfilled his idea that ministers should get out of Moscow and meet real people. And he can point to passages in the speech the Russian president gave to parliament last month in which he specifically commended the Civic Union, told the government to listen to its ideas and pointed to it as the basis for 'a modern, civilised two-party system'. In a significant phrase, Mr Yeltsin said: 'A market economy is not an end in itself: it is a means by which we can and must raise Russia.' Mr Volsky had said almost exactly that in an earlier speech. Is he, then - as many in the present government charge - a disguised commisar: a man who wants to bring back at least elements of the old system? It is a charge which he passionately rejects, denouncing those (including the Financial Times) who, he says, had seen his espousal of the 'Chinese option' as a plea for an authoritarian state. 'We can use the experience of China; we can use the experience of Japan; we can use the experience of Mrs Thatcher,' he says. He wants privatisation - not through giving the population the right to own shares via vouchers, but through a system giving more direct control to industrial managers. He wants to see bankruptcies - not through the system favoured by the government, which gives state committees the power to close companies, but by giving the courts the right to declare a company bankrupt. He wants foreign investment: but he wants it more regulated by the state, with systems in place that foreign investors can understand. He is equally passionate on his rejection of political ambition, saying he does not want to be prime minister. This is believable: he has amassed so much power in his present position that he would hardly gain more in that hot seat. He wants to see the cabinet changes he has called for take place in the latter part of this month. If this is done, he believes, the scenario of a government destroyed and a president damaged by an angry Congress of Peoples Deputies, which opens on December 1, could be avoided. If not? He will, he says, 'go into opposition'. This would mean his becoming leader of the disparate but large groups he represents, rejecting completely the government's policies and initiatives. Such a battle would be a testing one: some government radicals believe that his troops exist only on paper, and that there are pro-government constituencies which still have to be counted. But Mr Yeltsin is clearly leaning towards the Civic Union platform. The government is weak; Mr Volsky, for now, has most of the cards.

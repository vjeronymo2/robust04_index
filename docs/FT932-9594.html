			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister heads off revolt on shipping TORY BACKBENCHERS last night shied away from confronting the government over help to the shipping industry after a Treasury minister agreed to meetings to discuss the sector's problems, David Owen writes. The undertaking - by Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury - persuaded the potential rebels to withdraw a proposed change to the Finance Bill aimed at giving the shipping industry 100 per cent first-year capital allowances. Pressed to a vote by Labour, the proposals were defeated by 279 votes to 244. Mr Nelson, describing shipping as 'something of a hardy annual in finance bill debates', promised to listen to the industry's arguments but said it would be wrong for him to raise hopes that the government would be swayed. Costing the proposals at between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m a year in terms of tax revenue forgone, he defended the government's record on shipping, saying it had enacted measures to help the merchant navy over successive years. Spearheading the calls for more government assistance, Sir Giles Shaw, a member of the powerful executive of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs, said the shipping industry was entering a 'phase of decline' which could be terminal if action was not taken.</p>

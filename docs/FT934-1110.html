			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Keeping France in the picture - Gooding Consumer Electronics' latest buy Behind the rescue of the Grundig television factory in north-east France by Gooding Consumer Electronics is a gamble. It is an attempt by the Welsh company to become a European volume manufacturer of low-cost sets, competing directly with east Asian imports in a market where profitability is under heavy pressure. In a deal announced last week, the newly-formed Gooding Consumer Electronics has acquired the Grundig factory at Creutzwald, in the Moselle region, for FFr160m (Pounds 18.28m) with an additional French government grant of FFr50m. The German consumer electronics company, and Philips, the Dutch group which has management control of it, announced last January that production would be switched from Creutzwald at the end of this month. As part of last week's deal, the factory will continue to make sets for Grundig until the end of 1994, which will allow the Welsh company time to introduce its own design for sets at a lower end of the market. It believes it can increase production from the annual capacity of 500,000 to 1m within three years. Gooding Consumer Electronics is jointly owned by Mr Alfred Gooding, a 61-year-old Welsh entrepreneur whose family holding company, Gooding Investments, is the majority shareholder, and Mr Koen van Driel, a Dutchman who is a former managing director of Grundig UK. Mr Gooding, who sold the steel components maker, Catnic, for Pounds 15m in 1983, is chairman of Gooding Sanken, a company he set up in south Wales with Sanken Electric of Japan to make power supply units, and of Race Electronics, a contract manufacturer also based in south Wales. Among other things, Race makes 10,000 satellite television receivers a week for retailers such as Dixons, Currys and Comet. The new scheme is to put together a package of receivers and sets to sell either under store brands or under the brand names Minerva, acquired from Grundig, and Continental Edison, bought from Thomson of France. 'What I'm trying to do is put together a very substantial electronics-orientated business,' Mr Gooding said. 'We're putting together a group that in 1994 could move into something like Pounds 130m turnover.' South Wales is known as a base for the production of Sony and Panasonic televisions, but Gooding Consumer Electronics will manufacture in France rather than Wales because a high-quality, recently modernised, factory was available at a highly discounted price. 'It would have cost me three times that amount of money, maybe four times, to put in the same plant, with the same guaranteed workload for a year and with a trained workforce of 350 people,' Mr Gooding said. 'None of this is being done at the expense of what I do in south Wales. In fact it is complementary - we will be able to go to the big store groups with satellite receivers and TVs which are all in the same family.' There was a big market in Europe, he said, for low-cost 14in to 21in televisions. 'At present, the bulk of those type of sets are imported from east Asia. I know that with modern sophisticated equipment, with a well-managed labour force, we can compete head-on with east Asia, which has to ship the stuff half way round the world. 'We've already spoken to big store chains like Dixons. There is no doubt that if we can come up with a competitive product, they won't think twice about buying a European set.' Part of the appeal of the Creutzwald factory, he added, was that it was in a coal mining region similar to south Wales. 'People in a mining area have a work ethic - they are prepared to work shifts, they're prepared to be flexible. The labour force there have made it quite clear they are right behind me to protect jobs in this factory.'</p>

Yugoslav Army planes, respecting the UN Security Council  resolution banning flights over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina,  did not fly around or overfly this zone, the Yugoslav Army  General Staff stresses.    Since the establishment of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, Yugoslav Army planes have not flown outside FRY air  space, they stress at the General Staff. [passage omitted]</p>

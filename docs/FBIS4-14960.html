			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Aydinyan report: "Armenian Nuclear Power Station: </F> What's Going on in and Around It?"]    [Excerpts] Yerevan -- The agreement signed between the  Russian and Armenian Governments on the demothballing and  industrial utilization of the Armenian nuclear power station  [AES] remains one of the most important events of recent times.  The AES' significance in the republic's life is so great that  the agreement has both political and even psychological and  moral repercussions. It will be a while -- at least a year --  before the power station comes on stream, but this represents  both a real deadline and a real hope, which will make it  possible to withstand yet another dark and cold blockade winter.  [passage omitted]    A visiting session of the republic government was held at  the  Armenian AES recently. Opening it, President Levon  Ter-Petrosyan spoke highly of the agreement signed by the  Russian Federation Government. The political and technical  problems have been solved, he said. Work is now underway on  settling the financial problems. After demothballing, the power  station will be producing 400 megawatts of electricity, which  will make it possible to meet the republic's minimum  requirements and escape the damage caused by the blockade. The  Sevan River, whose water resources are currently being  overexploited, will be saved from silting up.    As for the power station's safety, this is one of the main  points of the Russian-Armenian agreement. Furthermore, for  months now a group of experts representing various countries and  international organizations has been studying the situation at  the AES. They also think that the station can be commissioned if  a number of measures are taken. The president described the  opening of the station as a priority task, and the decisions  which have been adopted show that these are not just words --  the government is serious about this.    In order to insure an inflow of skilled personnel, wages 20  times above the minimum wage in the republic are being set for  the power station's workers. This is much more than the  highest-ranking state officials get. Provision has been made  for large sums to provide free food for the workers. Repairs to  the AES' rest home will be completed this year.    So the first steps have been taken. Yet reactions to the  demothballing of the AES have been far from unequivocal. The  United States makes no secret of its negative attitude, and  Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Georgia are sharply opposed to the  nuclear power station resuming operation. But for all this  Turkey and Azerbaijan are not prepared to lift the blockade, and  Georgia is still incapable of ensuring the protection of the gas  pipeline and the railroad. Admittedly the United States has  allocated in the form of aid a large consignment of kerosene,  which is being distributed among the socially vulnerable strata  of the population. But this humane act cannot influence the  situation in the economy. Neighbors' views have to be taken into  account as far as possible, of course. But this desire must be  mutual. Moreover, some countries' attitude betrays not so much  ecological worries as concern of a strictly political nature.    The Armenian and Russian sides spent a long time working on  the draft and, one assumes, also gave careful consideration to  the possible international reaction to the opening of the AES.  And there is one other curious detail. Commenting on the  agreement, observers -- manifestly without collusion -- have  concluded that Russia is coming back. This sounds somewhat  strange, particularly in Armenia, which Russia has never  seriously left. Its troops are stationed here and its border  guards protect the border. Not so long ago a document was  signed under which there will be twice-yearly drafts in Armenia  of young people for service in the Russian Border Troops. The  whole point, probably, is that the troops can be moved in or out  in a short space of time. But the demothballing and joint  operation of the AES is a matter calculated for decades ahead,  and the agreement once again confirms the seriousness of  Russia's intentions. At the time, the closure of the AES  coincided with the start of destructive processes in the  economy. Might its demothballing mark the beginning of the  restoration of destroyed ties, of a destroyed economy? It would  be nice to believe so.</p>

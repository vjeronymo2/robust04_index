			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Andorrans vote for first time Andorrans voted yesterday in the tiny Pyrenean principality's first constitutional election, ending semi-feudal traditions that date back seven centuries, Reuter reports from Andorra La Vella. Five political groups were competing for 28 seats in the Consell General de les Valls, the Andorran parliament. About 9,700 Andorrans, representing only 15 per cent of the population, are eligible to vote.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 7 IMPORTERS ACCUSED OF SELLING COUNTERFEIT GOODS  </P> <P> A team of U.S. Customs agents based in Kentucky swept into Los Angeles this  week and arrested seven importers, including five Korean nationals, and seized  thousands of allegedly counterfeit high-fashion handbags, watches and articles  of clothing.  </P> <P> According to arrest warrants made public Wednesday in U.S. District Court in  Los Angeles, the seven arrested sold counterfeit merchandise bearing such names  as Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Rolex to Customs agents in Kentucky, shipping the  merchandise by United Parcel Service.  </P> <P> Customs officials estimated that the merchandise, taken in the largest such  seizure ever in the Los Angeles area, could have been sold for more than $1  million.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Customs Service said Wednesday that several truckloads of  merchandise were seized by agents who served 10 search warrants Tuesday,  primarily in the garment district of Los Angeles. Most of the merchandise  appeared to have been imported from Korea, spokeswoman Maryanne Noonan said.  </P> <P> Customs agents were cataloguing the merchandise at the Terminal Island federal  prison Wednesday and are planning to hold a press conference on the seizure  today.  </P> <P> Six men and one woman arrested as part of the operation were charged Tuesday  with conspiracy, smuggling and counterfeiting. All were arraigned Tuesday in  U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and released on $15,000 bail.  </P> <P> Noonan said the U.S. attorney's office is expected to prosecute the seven in  Kentucky, where the six-month investigation was centered.  </P> <P> Arrested were Heung Sik Nam, 35, of Los Angeles; Pong Chip Chon, 36, of Los  Angeles; Won Kun Oh, 41, of Los Angeles; Kyu Sang Kim, 39, of Bellflower; Hak  Bong Son, 39, of Los Angeles, and Chang Kwun Shin, 29, and his wife, Kwan Hee  Shin, 31, both of Walnut.  </P> <P> Nam, Chon, Oh, Kim and Son are all Korean nationals, court records showed.  </P> <P> The Shins, charged with conspiracy, smuggling and trafficking in counterfeit  merchandise, could be sentenced to a maximum of 15 years in prison and fined  $270,000 if convicted. Nam, Chon, Oh, Kim and Son were charged with smuggling  and trafficking and could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined  $260,000.  </P> <P> Noonan said the investigation, called Operation Tradesman, began in Cincinnati  after counterfeit merchandise began showing up in Midwest markets.  </P> <P> According to affidavits filed with the arrest warrants, customs agents found  the name Chang Kwun Shin and a telephone number for Slauson Total Fashion with  several hundred pieces of counterfeit merchandise seized Jan. 10 at a retail  outlet in Louisville.  </P> <P> An agent called the number early in February and ordered merchandise. Later, 38  Gucci and Louis Vuitton bags arrived in Kentucky, C.O.D.  </P> <P> When the agent phoned again in May, Kwan Hee Shin bragged over the phone that  "she was the largest distributor of counterfeit goods in Los Angeles and that  she supplied all of the smaller retailers in the area and many out of state,"  the warrant said. She told the agent she had a warehouse full of Louis Vuitton  merchandise and offered discounts for orders of more than 100.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, agents came to Los Angeles in March for meetings with the five  others, believed to be part of a second smuggling operation that operated on a  similar basis. In those meetings and with follow-up telephone orders in April,  they made purchases that included 78 MCM handbags for $1,154 and 30 Rolex  watches for $750. In all, more than 300 items were shipped to several Kentucky  cities.  </P></p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: SmithKline Beecham In its quiet way, SmithKline Beecham is turning out the glamour stock of the UK pharmaceuticals sector. Since the start of the year it has outperformed Glaxo by some 25 per cent and Wellcome by nearer 30 per cent. It was always going to take several years for the market to be satisfied of the success of the merger. It also took time for equilibrium to be established between US sellers and UK buyers of the merged stock. But yesterday's second quarter figures - underlying pre-tax profits up by 15 per cent, in spite of zero price increases and a 2 per cent fall in Tagamet's volume - show there is still growth after the immediate cost savings from the merger have worked through. For the sector, of course, the overshadowing influence this week is the Wellcome sale. But however that may be scaled back, it will surely not be pulled. The Wellcome Trust, after all, is merely swapping assets within the equity market. For purposes of charitable funding, locking into an indexed fund on a starting yield of 5.1 per cent is a remarkable opportunity. With all that, it is worth recalling that SB is on a substantially lower multiple than Wellcome and on only a modest premium to the market as a whole.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Capital Markets (International Bonds): Spain issue could spark Ecu primary sector revival THE Ecu bond market, which has been subdued for the last month or so, looks set to revive, as the Kingdom of Spain prepares an Ecu750m-Ecu1bn issue of registered bonds. However, dealers say there is an overhang of paper from the deluge of issues earlier in the year. Banesto will lead manage the issue, which may emerge later this week. Spain's debut in the Ecu market a year ago, an Ecu500m offering due 1995, has performed strongly and is yielding 9.08 per cent, a relatively expensive level compared with other secondary market issues. An intensive marketing campaign in Spain will seek to encourage domestic participation, which ran at around 5 per cent for the last issue. On the face of it, Spanish investors have little incentive to buy Ecu bonds yielding 9 per cent or so, when Spanish government bonds denominated in pesetas yield more than 12 per cent and carry no foreign exchange risk. However, the peseta is expected to weaken against the Ecu over the medium- to long-term, so domestic investors' returns may be enhanced by currency gains. In addition, Banesto will again be offering Ecu bank accounts to retail investors. Nevertheless, despite its domestic, registered structure, the deal will be mainly placed internationally, and will trade like a Eurobond. The issue, which will not be swapped, is expected to be attractively priced, given its political purpose. The maturity and size of the issue could be fixed later today, once the extent of institutional interest in the French Treasury's offer to exchange an outstanding six-year Ecu bond issue for longer-dated bonds has been gauged. In the Australian dollar market, the State Electricity Commission of Victoria launched an ADollars 100m 10-year deal. The borrower's outstanding debt is currently under review by Moody's for possible downgrade from Double-A1. However, the pricing took account of any uncertainty, dealers said. They added that investors know Australian states (the borrower is guaranteed by the State of Victoria) are declining credits. In the equity-linked sector, Unitika, a Japanese textile manufacturer, launched a Dollars 110m four-year deal, quoted at a premium of three points to its par issue price.</p>

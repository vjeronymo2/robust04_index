			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> ZONE CHANGE DEFERRED  </P> <P> Responding to concerns from 20 angry residents of Mildred Avenue, the City  Council deferred the granting of a zone change for construction of an office  building on their block until the developer comes back to the council with  plans that would shift the driveway for the building from Mildred Avenue to  Washington Boulevard.  </P> <P> Plans for the three-story office complex had already been approved by the  Planning Commission, and the council was to rule on whether to grant a change  from a residential to a limited commercial zone.  </P> <P> Residents were concerned that having the driveway on Mildred Avenue would  increase traffic on the street.  </P> <P> "It's a quiet street, relatively speaking, and we would like to keep it that  way," said Jerry Kaye, who organized residents on the street.  </P> <P> A traffic engineer hired by the developer said that putting the driveway on  Washington Boulevard would be more dangerous for cars making left turns out of  the parking lot.  </P> <P> Several residents expressed anger that they had not been notified of the  project. According to city ordinance, notification is required only for  property owners within 300 feet of any proposed construction or zone change.  </P> <P> The architect for the building, who was present at the meeting, said he would  come back to the Planning Commission in December with plans that include a  driveway on Washington Boulevard. The request for a zone change will then come  before the council at its first meeting in January.  </P></p>

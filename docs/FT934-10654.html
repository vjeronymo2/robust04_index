			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Differing impressions of European unity Sir, The unresolved question of whether those opposed to European integration must be called Eurosceptics or Europhobes has been further complicated by Britain's prime minister describing himself as the most Eurosceptic of them all. The question now is whether someone who is most Eurosceptic must be Eurosceptic/Europhobe, or Euroscepticphobe for short. Raphael Papadopoulos, 52 Asmuns Place, London NW11 7XG</p>

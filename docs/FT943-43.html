			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (27): The harsh effects of peace - Defence / Bernard Gray looks at the global squeeze on military budgets While it lasted the cold war was certainly a boon for the world's arms makers. By the mid-1980s, some 85 per cent of all arms purchases were made by members of Nato or the Warsaw Pact. Small wonder then that the ending of the biggest armed confrontation in history has had a dramatic impact on the arms industry world-wide. Since the fall of the Berlin wall the pressure for a 'peace dividend' reduction in arms spending, combined with economic hardship in the west and the former Soviet Union have put a heavy squeeze on industrialised countries' defence budgets. At the same time the world recession has also put pressure on third world spending, the Gulf War spent much of the funds that were available to middle eastern states and low oil prices since then have put a cap on that normally buoyant market. Times are tough for the world's arms manufacturers. Most have responded to the cuts, but some have moved faster than others. In the US weapons procurement, the part of the military budget which most affects arms manufacturers, has fallen by almost two-thirds in real terms in the last decade, and companies have moved quickly to meet the challenge. Workforces have been cut heavily - employment in the US defence industry has fallen from 1.35m in 1989 to 800,000 five years later. Manufacturers have also rationalised their chains of suppliers and adopted many lean manufacturing techniques now that they can no longer rely on long production runs to offset the fearful one-off costs of weapons development. More recently, US companies have merged or sold operations to cut overheads. Large companies which were only peripherally involved in defence, such as Ford, IBM and General Electric, have sold their defence arms to defence specialists such as Martin Marietta and Loral. General Dynamics, once one of the largest defence companies, has sold much of its business to competitors who can consolidate the industry and returned much of the money to shareholders. Now the industry is moving into what Norman Augustine, chief executive of Martin Marietta, calls the fourth and ultimate phase, where large and dissimilar defence companies merge to reduce central costs. Earlier this year, Northrop took over Grumman, and at the end of August the largest deal so far was struck when Martin Marietta and Lockheed announced plans to merge. This is not 'vertical integration' in the conventional sense, where the manufacturers of components merge with those who assemble them to create giants which run all the way from raw materials to finished products. Neither Northrop nor Grumman makes many components for the other, and while Martin does make electronics systems, comparatively few find their way into Lockheed aircraft. Rather, this latest round of mergers cuts corporate overheads such as head office costs and duplicated research and development, while at the same time spreading risk over a larger number of weapons systems. This risk spreading means that if one large weapons system is cancelled in the US, it is not life-threatening for the company. For example, the deputy defence secretary, John Deutch, recently queried the need for the 12 most expensive US programmes. Martin Marietta is heavily involved in developing one programme, the Comanche scout helicopter, while Lockheed is involved in another even larger project, the Dollars 71bn F-22 stealth fighter. Delay or cancellation of either programme would be serious for each company separately but much easier for the combined group to weather. As well as consolidating rapidly in their own free market, US companies are also being much more aggressive about seeking export opportunities, and a more relaxed Congressional attitude to overseas arms sales is helping the cause. Yet even here the market is becoming increasingly competitive as third world and European defence budgets fall. Historically, most arms buyers have been interested in the performance of a weapon and buy from their political allies or develop home-grown solutions. Now the pressure to get value for money means many European countries are being forced to consider cheaper off-the-shelf US weapons, to the detriment of their indigenous arms makers, and third world buyers are running beauty parades where western arms makers have to compete on price. This gives the US manufacturers an advantage. While their arms have often been more expensive, both because they were more sophisticated and because the US has been less concerned about price, now the consolidation of companies and the introduction of lean manufacturing techniques is closing the gap. European manufacturers know they must respond, but are hampered by the unwieldly structure of their market. Natural suspicions between the ancient nation states of Europe makes them reluctant to rely on one another for weapons supplies. Besides, several of the large continental companies, such as Aerospatiale of France, are still state-owned, making mergers difficult. Because cross-border consolidation is hard many large European projects have been managed as a kind of half-way house where there is joint development of the weapon, for example in the Eurofighter 2000 between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain. While such methods save some money, much is wasted on duplication of effort and poor co-ordination between the partners. Equally, work in development and production is parcelled out on the basis of national commitments to a project rather than on the basis of the most competitive bids. As a result, the cost base of the European arms industry is higher than it need be, and Europe gets a less effective set of weapons at a higher price than it would get if the industry were consolidated. The pressures that this generates were obvious at the Farnborough air show held at the beginning of September. Serge Dassault, head of the French Dassault fighter maker, criticised those European governments which chose to buy US products when an acceptable European alternative was available. There was much muttering behind the scenes about how, if at all, Europe needed to respond to the US challenge. Some apparently thought that provided Europe bought domestically it need take no action. Others, such as Noel Forgeard of Matra Defence, argued that a response was necessary. There are some signs of movement and Matra is one of the companies leading the charge. It has been in negotiations for 18 months to merge its missile business with British Aerospace Dynamics. It has already formed a joint venture with GEC's space subsidiary to create Matra-Marconi space and this recently bought BAe's space business. BAe is also at an early stage of talks about merging its Royal Ordnance subsidiary with munitions-maker Giat of France. Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace are also discussing pooling their missiles interests. Yet the progress is painfully slow, and neither Europe's arms makers, nor the politicians they supply, have a clear vision of how to mould their ambitions to the size and shape of industry they can afford.</p>

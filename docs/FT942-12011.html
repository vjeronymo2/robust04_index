			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Incomplete picture conveyed of power workers' attitudes Sir, Frank Ledger and Howard Sallis's article about the operations of the Central Electricity Generating Board during the 1984-1985 miners' strike ('We kept the home fires burning', April 23) was a trailer both for their forthcoming book on the subject and for the BBC2 documentary, 'The men who kept the lights on', shown the same evening. The producers of the documentary had the laudable aim of bringing that story to a wider public; unfortunately, by their choice of interviewees they conveyed the impression that the only members of the workforce who co-operated with management in carrying out the industry's fundamental public service commitment to keep the lights on were weak, unprincipled or greedy, or all three. It was not so. Among the industry's workforce there was much sympathy for the miners' predicament. But, with comparatively few exceptions, it did not translate into support for the strike itself - for obvious reasons. Arthur Scargill, the miners' leader, with his own overtly political objectives, made a lot of people wary, even when sympathetic. He not only endorsed picket-line violence, but it was widely appreciated that, in the absence of a ballot, he needed it. Scargill's slogan that no mine should be closed on economic grounds rang no bells with a workforce which accepted that power stations had to be closed when they were no longer economic. And then there was always a strong sense of responsibility about electricity supply being a public service. Management was only able to pull the industry through the strike in the way it did because the workforce as a whole was, at the very least, unpersuaded about the legitimacy of the miners' strike under Scargill's leadership. No one could know that from watching the documentary. Of course, there were those in the industry who strongly supported the strike. They also had honourable reasons, but they were in a minority. At perhaps six or seven of (from memory) about 90 power stations support for the strike was sufficiently strong to prevent management from getting in any new coal supplies. But at the great majority of power stations these problems did not arise or else were comparatively minor. No one could have known that from watching the documentary. I do not think the producers of the documentary set out to produce the skewed picture with which they ended up. But they should have painted the wider picture as well.

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WATER BOARD OFFICIAL ACQUITTED OF ARSON IN HOUSE FIRE  </P> <P> A Lancaster Superior Court judge found Antelope Valley water board member Glenn  Martin not guilty Monday of a charge that he intentionally set fire to his  Lancaster house last year.  </P> <P> Judge Margaret Grignon announced the acquittal on a single count of felony  arson after presiding over a three-day, non-jury trial last week.  </P> <P> Although Grignon said she had suspicions about the origin of the fire, she said  testimony by an insurance company investigator that the fire was accidental  raised a reasonable doubt.  </P> <P> After the verdict, Martin left Lancaster for a vacation and was unavailable for  comment, a water agency official said.  </P> <P> Martin, 67, has served 16 years on the board of directors of the Antelope  Valley-East Kern Water Agency. If convicted, he could have been sentenced to up  to eight years in prison and would have been forced to resign from the board,  because convicted felons cannot hold public office.  </P> <P> Carl Hunter, one of Martin's six colleagues on the board, said in a telephone  interview Monday that he wrote to the judge on Martin's behalf and was glad to  hear of the acquittal. Hunter said he argued that Martin would not have  committed a crime that could have prevented him from holding elected office  again.  </P> <P> "His whole life revolves around being on the water agency board," Hunter said.  "It seemed incredible that he would do anything to jeopardize that."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Damon, who prosecuted the case, said Grignon's  decision appeared to have been based on defense testimony by an insurance  investigator about the fire, which began in a living room and caused heavy  damage to the junk-strewn home last July.  </P> <P> The investigator said the blaze could have been caused by careless smoking,  countering testimony by arson investigators who said evidence showed that it  was set intentionally.  </P> <P> "The fact that he was able to call an expert was really critical," Damon said.  "It's scientific evidence, and reasonable minds differ over scientific  interpretations."  </P> <P> Martin, who has twice been convicted under Lancaster's nuisance ordinance for  storing junk on his property, acted as his own attorney during last week's  trial. His defense featured exhibits of memorabilia from his days as a fighter  pilot in World War II and recollections of his youth, as an argument that he  was not the kind of man who would voluntarily destroy items he valued. He  alleged that the charges against him were politically motivated. Prosecutors  described that as nonsense.  </P> <P> Martin stands to collect an insurance payment of about $120,000, according to  court testimony.  </P></p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / BBC and Granada may share resources BBC North and Granada Television are holding talks about the possibility of sharing resources including everything from studios to outside-broadcasting equipment, Raymond Snoddy writes. Agreement is expected later this month, and it is thought it would be the first time the BBC and ITV have co-operated in this way. The aim would be to use short-term marginal capacity at both major regional broadcasting centres.</p>

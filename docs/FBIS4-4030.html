			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Japan's newly elected  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata today called for talks with the  breakaway Social Democratic Party (SDP) in a bid to draw it back  to the ruling coalition fold.    Hata, while appealing to SDP to remain within the coalition,  warned that he will form a new cabinet even without the SDP, the  biggest party in the alliance.    He had this to say, "we cannot spend so much time" on this  matter.    SDP quit the coalition earlier today, in a move that  deprived  the coalition of its parliamentary majority, leaving the new  prime minister crippled at the start of his administration and  the country facing the prospect of possible early elections.    The SDP decision of pullout was approved formally at an  emergency meeting of the party's central executive committee.    At the meeting SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama attacked the  sudden formation last night of a new parliamentary bloc grouping  the coalition's centrist and conservative parties but excluding  the SDP, saying it destroyed the coalition structure.    The SDP holds 74 seats in the 511-member lower house. Beside  the 130 lawmakers already committed to the new bloc, the  centrist Komeito (Clean Government Party) is reportedly ready to  bring in its 52 members as well.    Against this, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  holds 206 seats.</p>

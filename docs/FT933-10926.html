			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Arts: In the world of Walter Matthau - Nigel Andrews enjoys a masterclass with Hollywood's most distinguished sourpuss 'MY FATHER was an itinerant menial worker,' recalls Walter Matthau. 'He was an electrician, carpenter, photographer. My mother always used to say . . . Rene, what happened to those nice b-o-w-l-s?]?' His mother said what? Rene the waiter looks startled; Matthau, in mid-reminiscence, scowls at his salad plate; Leonard the agent, seated opposite, gives me a crisis-smoothing smile. It is 1.40 pm in a dining-room at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club and Hollywood's most distinguished sourpuss is giving us a masterclass. For the next five minutes the rococo Matthau vowels and sing-song Matthau adenoids are deployed in caustically comparing bowls to plates. Forty years and as many films - including perennials such as The Odd Couple, The Front Page and A New Leaf - have turned this man into the best-known comic misanthrope since WC Fields. No star has more ingratiated himself by being uningratiating. Look up 'grouchy' in a dictionary and you will find Matthau's face there. Rubber-duck features with excess-baggage jowls; narrow eyes sunk under half-mast lids; thick black hair slapped on top - 'real', Matthau insists - like a mortarboard on a crusty teacher. This week he returns in Dennis, a rampaging-kid comedy scripted by John 'Home Alone' Hughes. Though the film's American title was Dennis The Menace, it has nothing to with the shock-haired delinquent known to Beano readers. 'I didn't even know you had a Dennis the Menace in Britain,' Matthau proclaims. 'Our film is based on a comic strip by Hank Ketchum, who lives up in Carmel. Dennis is a six-year-old terror and I play his neighbour Mr Wilson, who's described as 'cur-mudgeonly' and 'can-tankerous'' - Matthau chews over every syllable - 'but like all curmudgeons, with a heart of gold.' Pause for Rene to set down new salad bowl. 'I wanted to play it another way. I wanted to play a guy who really hated kids.' Matthau's off-camera duties on Dennis included teaching co-star Lady Olivier how to speak Chicago-style. 'Every time Joan got British I'd say, Not 'worried', dear, 'werried'. My own accent is fair-to-middling New York. But I can do Chicago. 'A ket-ehhstrophe is something that shouldn't hehhpen . . .'' A master mimic, Matthau can also do Deep South, Far West and broad Cockney, though he is modest about the accent he used in his last major film, Polanski's ill-starred Pirates. 'I wanted to do Irish but Roman said there are no Irish pirates. I tried Cockney at the audition and the British guy acting with me said, 'Very, very good. Australian?'' As for Pirates itself, Matthau still winces at the film that probably toppled him from the box-office heights where he had lived happily for 20 years. 'Humour is not Polanski's forte,' he darkly states. 'The film was jumbled, confused, it was' - pause for word-search - 'ob-fus-cated.' As delivered by Matthau, this one-line vocal snapshot is more memorable than the whole movie. Pouncing on words and teasing them into constituent growls  -they seem to come with a whole commentary of baroque mockery - is one of the secrets of his wit as an actor. He started his screen career playing mangy, rangy villains in movies like Fail Safe and Charade. Then Billy Wilder, after almost giving him the lead role in The Seven Year Itch, put his elastic features and gnarled vocal emphases into Meet Whiplash Willie (1965). That began the double-act of Matthau and Jack Lemmon - sardonic vinegar and plaintive oil - and the equally flavoursome relationship with Wilder. 'Billy saw me as the quintessential con man. You know, 'Watch out, this guy will sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.' Lemmon was the gullible innocent - which of course he is in real life] 'People don't believe you can do comedy until you do it. For years they took one look at me and said, 'You're the villain.' An actor when he starts out is judged by his face. You, for instance' - I brace myself - 'would be cast as the villain. You're not glamorous enough to be the leading man. He' - Leonard braces himself - 'would be the 'best friend.' When Ronald Reagan was running for Governor of California, Jack Warner said 'Governor? Ronald Reagan? No. Best friend.' A governor has to have wit, intelligence, aggressiveness. Warner couldn't see any of that in Reagan.' But who could have seen Matthau's destiny in his unpromising origins? He was born to a Jewish immigrant family on Manhattan's East Side. For his start in show business he sold drinks in New York's English-language Yiddish Theatre. 'Soft drinks and three-flavour ice bricks. Then they put me on stage and gave me a couple of lines. I played an old lady in a crowd scene and my lines were 'Mazel-tov] Mazel-tov]'' After that it was more high-profile theatre on Broadway, alternating with historic days in live TV. 'I must have done over 100 television shows and it was the best acting experience you could ever have. Made you think on your feet. First thing you learn is, if you're sitting around doing Chekhov and the cat walks in, you must pay attention to the cat. You cannot continue with the dialogue of Chekhov without including the cat. So on live television we'd automatically go into ad-lib gear. There's the famous story: suddenly the phone rings on stage and there's not supposed to be a phone call. And it's persistent. And eventually the guy walks over, picks up the phone, says 'Hello?' Then he looks at the other actor and says 'It's for you.']' Accident-management became a Matthau speciality. In a Broadway production of Anne Of The Thousand Days he remembers bustling on stage as an unannounced understudy, behind the back of Rex Harrison delivering a high-flown soliloquy at stage front. 'I was playing the old bishop and I came on and said' - deep-voiced British accent - ''I have known you from a child, King Henry, I was present when you took your first three steps.' At which point he turned his back to the audience and in a very loud Rex Harrison voice let out 'Oh shit]' So for the next ten minutes all I could hear was the audience whispering 'Did he say shit? Did King Henry say shit?'' Matthau finally escaped into movies. But for his first ten years in celluloid he was only ever cast as the foreign-looking heavy. 'They saw me as a tall Jewish Ukrainian, talking about horses and smoking cigars. I was never cast as the lead. A woman stopped me once on the boardwalk on Coney Island and here were her exact words. 'Hand-some? I've seen better. But you're something, I don't know what]' 'Later, when they determined I was a box-office draw, they started to give me leading roles in which I was connected to the female romantically.' Connected to the female romantically. No other actor in Hollywood talks like that. Matthau plays with polysyllables as if they were precious coinage; and even simple words become valued currency for him in the right context. He once had a debate about a small conjunction with Neil Simon, who wrote several comedy roles especially for Matthau, including Oscar in The Odd Couple. 'In one of his plays I said to Neil, Can I say 'I got hit by a puck instead of with a puck. And he said, the line is 'with'; but he let me try it. And 'by a puck' got a bigger laugh. It makes the puck an animate object.' Why - since Matthau clearly knows his mind when it comes to how comedy should read and play - hasn't he followed the current Hollywood trend and turned from actor to director? See Eastwood, Redford, Beatty and company . . . 'Actors seem to think there are more important things than acting. That includes not just directing but mouthing off about politics and causes. Maybe they're right. But if you plan to keep acting as well, you'd better decide how much you want to jeopardise your credibility. As an actor, you have to leave yourself open for different roles. If you're a flaming reactionary or liberal, you bring hostile elements into your corner. The less you say about yourself, the better off you are. Otherwise people say: Oh I know him, he's that Jewish fellow from New York who was impoverished as a young man - why's he trying to play an Episcopalian priest?' Matthau himself is still haunted by the career advice he once gave a fellow thespian from England. 'I once did two films with Glenda Jackson. One night we were dining with some aristocrat friend of hers in London and she was talking the hind legs off us about social justice and class and poverty, and afterwards I said 'You know, Glenda, you really should go into politics.'' Matthau takes a rueful chew on his salad. 'I understand she took my advice.'</p>

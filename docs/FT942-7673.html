			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper pushes through resistance to fresh highs Copper prices took off again yesterday as US fund buying pushed them decisively through technical resistance levels that had held firm last week. Metal for delivery in three months went to Dollars 2,277 a tonne, up Dollars 47.50, at the close on the London Metal Exchange. The metal Copper continued its climb in late trading and touched Dollars 2,300 a tonne, its highest price in 16 months. Copper also moved again into backwardation, where a premium is paid for immediate delivery, frequently a sign of supply tightness. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, in Merrill's monthly metals report, advises copper users 'to act now and look to secure at least some forward cover'. He forecasts that in the next two to three months copper will trade between Dollars 2,000 and Dollars 2,315 a tonne. Ms Leanne Baker and Ms Janet Cochoff, analysts at the Salomon Brothers financial services group, say they expect that 'short-term sentiment toward copper will remain bullish, driven by positive technical and seasonal considerations, as well as robust US demand'. They suggest, however, that 'supply increases will begin to overwhelm demand during the second half of this year and building into 1995 and 1996.' They have raised their average copper price forecast for 1994 from 80 cents a pound (Dollars 1,763 a tonne) to 90 cents (Dollars 1,984) and their 1995 price estimate from 75 cents a pound (Dollars 1,653) to 80 cents. The International Wrought Copper Council, an association of consumers, suggests that there will be a 'moderate' refined copper supply deficit this year - after taking into account net trade with China and the Commonwealth of Independent States - but adds that preliminary estimates for 1995 indicate supply and demand will be much more closely balanced. According to the IWCC, refined copper production last year outside the CIS and China increased by nearly 3 per cent to 9.5m tonnes while consumption grew by more than 2 per cent to 9.4m tonnes. It forecasts production will show a 'modest' increase of under 1 per cent in 1994 but then jump by nearly 5 per cent to more than 10m tonnes in 1995. Consumption, meanwhile, is predicted to move up by 4 per cent this year and by another 3 per cent in 1995 to more than 10m tonnes.</p>

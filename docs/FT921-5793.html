			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Companies express interest in providing BR rail services MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, transport secretary, yesterday said that about 12 private companies had expressed interest in providing various rail services when British Rail's network monopoly is broken, Gary Mead writes. He said the government 'will end British Rail's monopoly because there are already about a dozen British companies who want to provide new services, both freight and passenger'. Mr Rifkind said that one reason why private investment might be sought was poor performance by some sections of British Rail. Among those interested in participating in a future privatised network is Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin, the entertainment and travel group. Mr Rifkind said suggestions that his views on British Rail were at odds with those of Mr Major were 'complete rubbish'. He added: 'John Major and I have a very close shared view on what we would like to see happen. 'There has been no row in cabinet and it has not been discussed in cabinet.' Conservative policy on the future of British Rail is now likely to be detailed in the party's general election manifesto. It appears that the party has shifted ground, bringing it closer to Labour policy. Mr Rifkind suggested that both government subsidies and private investment would run in tandem. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, accused Mr Rifkind of having 'pinched' some of Labour's ideas. 'I do not mind private people coming in,' he said. 'What I do worry about is safety.'</p>

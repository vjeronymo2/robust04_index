			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Newspaper offer may rise The consortium including Mirror Group Newspapers that last week launched a bid for Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent, is now free to increase its offer. The consortium had offered Pounds 2.60 a share for the 52 per cent of Newspaper Publishing stock that it did not already own. But the bid quickly became academic after Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland bought 24.99 per cent of Newspaper Publishing at Pounds 3.50 a share. The consortium - which also includes the founders of The Independent led by editor-in-chief Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, as well as El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy - is now considering increasing its bid. After talks with the Takeover Panel, the consortium said yesterday: 'The consortium has chosen not to be bound by the statement that was made not to increase its offer for the share capital of Newspaper Publishing.' An early decision is unlikely. Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, has embarked with fellow non-executive director Sir Kit McMahon on a series of talks with all parties involved. These are not due to be completed before next week and any further bids are unlikely until then.</p>

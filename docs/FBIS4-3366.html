			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Danzim, deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous  Regional CPC Committee, delivered an important speech at the  autonomous regional propaganda and ideological work meeting on  the afternoon of 19 April. He pointed out that facts prove  Tibet's propagandists and ideological workers are a contingent  loyal to the party and the people's cause; a contingent of  especially good, devoted, and hardship-enduring fighters; a  contingent full of vitality; and a contingent which the party  and people can trust. Basang, also a deputy secretary of the  autonomous regional party committee, presided over the 19 April  afternoon meeting.    Comrade Danzim's speech was entitled: Work Under the  Guidance of the Theory on Building Socialism With Chinese  Characteristics and Carry Out the Tasks on the Propaganda and  Ideological Front in an All-Around Way. It contained three  parts: (1) The basic situation of Tibet's propaganda and  ideological front; (2) several major tasks of Tibet's propaganda  and ideological front which we should strive to perform well now  and in the days to come; and (3) strengthening leadership and  improving methods to raise the level of our propaganda and  ideological work.    Comrade Danzim first summarized the basic situation of  Tibet's propaganda and ideological front.    He said: Over the past 40 years since the peaceful  liberation of Tibet, the propaganda and ideological front in  this region has done a great deal of work and made remarkable  achievements in seriously implementing the party's basic  theories and basic line of various periods, effecting an  historic change in Tibet's society and accomplishing the tasks  assigned by the party. Since Third Plenary Session of the 11th  CPC Central Committee in particular, comrades on the propaganda  and ideological front, adhering to the Marxist ideological line  and working under very arduous conditions, have overcome  difficulties, seriously conducted discussions on the criteria of  truth, and helped bring about a thorough emancipation of the  minds among CPC members, cadres, and the broad masses of people  in the region. They have persistently treated economic  construction as the central task, subordinated themselves to and  served the party's central task, and actively publicized the  party's line, principles, and policies, as well as the  guidelines of the Party Central Committee's instructions on work  in Tibet. They have carried out a thorough education in  patriotism and in unity among all nationalities, seriously  performed the task of arming the whole party with Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, applied the theory in unifying people's  thinking, and promoted the study of the Volume 3 of the  "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping."    Comrade Danzim said: During political storms and the Lhasa  riots, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front in this  region always identified themselves with the Party Central  Committee and autonomous regional party committee, correctly  guided public opinion, and helped maintain social stability in  Tibet [sentence as heard]. During the course of deepening  reforms and opening up wider, they have stepped up ideological  education and ideological and political work, ensured the smooth  implementation of major reform plans, and conducted active and  effective propaganda work toward the outside world. Against the  intensified attempt made by Western hostile forces and the Dalai  clique to separate Tibet from China, comrades on the propaganda  and ideological front have waged a tit-for-tat, justified, and  forceful mass media struggle. They have publicized the accurate  image of socialist new Tibet, made Tibet's actual situation  known to more people, and effectively promoted Tibet's opening  to the outside world and its cultural exchanges with foreign  countries. They have helped the building of socialist spiritual  civilization, and promoted cultural and educational undertakings  and social progress in Tibet.    Comrade Danzim said: Propaganda and ideological work has  made the people of all nationalities in Tibet emancipate their  minds, and has aroused their enthusiasm, initiative, and  creativity for participating in reforms and establishing a  socialist market economy. Propaganda and ideological work has  been a strong support in the anti-splittist struggle and work of  maintaining stability. It has enriched the people's cultural  life in Tibet, advanced the fine cultural traditions of all  nationalities, upheld the unification of the motherland and  unity among various nationalities, and ensured the smooth  proceeding of Tibet's reform, opening up, and modernization  drive.    Comrade Danzim pointed out that the propaganda and  ideological front of this region should strive to do its work  well in the following 11 major respects both at present and in  the days to come: (1) To continue to do good work in arming the  whole party with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics; (2) to do good work in conducting  news propaganda and in guiding public opinion; (3) to strengthen  ideological education; (4) to make socialist culture,  literature, and art flourish further; (5) to step up publication  work; (6) to give wide publicity to the anti-splittist struggle  and work of maintaining stability; (7) to step up the building  of socialist spiritual civilization; (8) to continue to step up  propaganda toward the outside world; (9) to put emphasis on  strengthening propaganda and ideological work at grass-roots  units in rural and pastoral areas; (10) to strengthen the  contingent of propagandists and ideological workers; and (11) to  seriously do good work in publicizing the 30th anniversary of  the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region.    Comrade Danzim emphatically pointed out: What should Tibet  rely on to reform and develop itself, further liberate and  develop its productive forces, and improve the people's living  standards? It is most important and most fundamental to rely on  the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. Only by seriously  studying the theory and arming our minds with it, can we  correctly apprehend the party's line, principles, and policies;  keep to a correct orientation, correct road, and correct  measures in reform and development; and attain the objectives of  reform, development, and stability in this region.    Danzim called on the whole region to study Volume 3 of the  "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," the decision of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the  guidelines of the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth  Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, simultaneously; and to  apply what is learned in the study to bring about a more  comprehensive, thoroughgoing, and down-to-earth development.    On publicizing the anti-splittist struggle and work of  maintaining stability, Comrade Danzim emphasized: Tibet's  stability is a political issue concerning the situation and  stability of the whole country. Without a stable social and  political environment, Tibet's reform and development will be an  empty word. Propagandists and ideological workers should deem  it their duty to maintain social stability in Tibet; always put  the stress of propaganda and ideological work on publicizing the  anti-splittist struggle, maintaining the unification of the  motherland, strengthening unity among all nationalities, and  maintaining social stability; be (?faithful) [zhong shi]  ideologically and solid in work: and actively maintain a  political situation of stability and unity in this region.    Comrade Danzim called on the news media in Tibet to meet the  needs of establishing the new socialist market economic  structure, start new special columns and new programs on special  topics, improve editorials, commentaries, theoretical articles,  and serial reports, increase the weight and depth of news media,  and help create a powerful public opinion for Tibet's economic  construction, reform, and opening up.    In conclusion, Deputy secretary Danzim pointed out:  Propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on the  undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  It should be done by the whole party and all party members  should attach importance to it. Party committees at all levels  must pay great attention to propaganda and ideological work,  strengthen leadership over it, and seriously build both material  and spiritual civilizations and attach equal importance to both.  The party committees should conscientiously assume the  responsibility for leading propaganda and ideological work in  their respective localities and departments, strive to  accomplish all tasks, improve the quality of propaganda and  ideological work, and make new and greater contributions to  promoting reform, development, stability, and comprehensive  social progress in Tibet.</p>

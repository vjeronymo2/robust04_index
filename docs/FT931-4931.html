			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Inquiries that neglect the man in the street - The debate over company investigations Doubts about Department of Trade and Industry company investigations as a method of regulation have resurfaced in the wake of the recent publication of the long-awaited report into share dealings by the conglomerate Suter and its chairman, Mr David Abell. Debate has been further fuelled by the revelation in the House of Commons last week that the investigation cost Pounds 501,000. The 147-page report, which had taken four and a half years to put together, found no evidence that Mr Abell had acted in concert with associates in taking stakes in a number of companies in the mid-1980s. The DTI said no further action would be taken. Yet the report called into question some of Mr Abell's evidence as 'inconsistent' or seeking to 'mislead'. It questioned the timing of private share purchases by Mr Abell in Suter's potential bid targets. Investors might legitimately ask why it took four and a half years to lift the cloud hanging over Suter, particularly in the light of the DTI's decision not to take action. Suter's growth was held back by the investigation. Other small conglomerates with which it was compared during the early 1980s have moved ahead. Concern about the company investigations system as a means of protecting individual consumer and investor interests were first voiced at the end of the 1980s following criticisms of the handling of the House of Fraser, Barlow Clowes and Guinness investigations. The House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee produced a report in May 1990, calling for changes to make the system quicker and more efficient. It said that broader public interests than just the duties of directors and the rights of shareholders should be reflected in company law and the way it was applied. The DTI had told the committee that the object of Companies Act investigations was to find out in the first place what was going on. This was done by calling for papers and interviewing witnesses. This evidence then formed the basis for any action, which included criminal prosecutions, winding-up of companies, disqualification of directors, sanctions by employers or other regulators, and changes in the law. The committee, however, felt the overriding aims of investigations should be to protect investors (and other companies or individuals with whom the company under investigation may do business), to promote efficient and honest markets, and to maintain the integrity of the UK as a financial and business centre. It concluded, from looking in particular at the House of Fraser report, that the interests of consumers, non-equity investors, creditors and employees did not attract the attention they deserved. The committee also recommended changes to speed up the whole process. It accepted the DTI's argument that it would be impractical, given the present level of available resources, to abandon the use of part-time external inspectors in favour of a full-time internal inspectorate. Even a small team of full-time inspectors would be periodically underemployed or overstretched. But it said outside inspectors should be required to devote at least 75 per cent of their professional time to an inquiry and major inquiries should complete their reports within 12 months. The DTI's response to the committee's report was lukewarm. Professor John Farrar, a company law specialist, called it 'characteristically complacent'. The department accepted it had some responsibility for protecting the interests of consumers and individual investors but said there had to be realism about what any regulatory system could achieve. It could not hope to prevent all company failures or misconduct. The objective should be to set a framework within which investors could make their own judgments about risk and reward. The DTI criticised the committee for concentrating on major inquiries and paying scant attention to the bulk of its investigatory work - basic fact-finding carried out by in-house investigators under section 447 of the Companies Act 1985. These inquiries are not announced and the findings are not published. Although the DTI says it is still in discussions with the select committee, little progress has been made towards implementing reform. Implementation of the recommendation that the trade secretary should automatically apply for the disqualification of directors who give false information to DTI inspectors could have had a significant bearing on the Suter report for example. Instead the DTI appears happy to rest on its record. On the surface that looks quite impressive. In the fiscal year 1991/92, there were 177 investigations under companies legislation, 155 of them unannounced inquiries where the DTI called for company papers under section 447. Seven teams of external inspectors were appointed and five inspectors' reports were published during the year. Seventeen companies were wound-up. Eighteen trials resulted in the conviction of 31 individuals. Ten people were disqualified as directors for periods from three to 15 years. The DTI also disclosed information and documents to regulatory bodies on 63 occasions. The City, too, appears generally happy with the present system. Company lawyers do not see reform as a priority and seem more concerned with ensuring procedures are fair to those under investigation. Mrs Frances Heaton head of the Takeover Panel, said that while the present system was 'clearly not ideal' there was a 'need to be realistic about what it is trying to achieve'. Where there was a possibility of criminal charges, inquiries had to proceed with great caution. It was difficult to see what could be done to speed them up. The Securities and Investment Board said there had been few problems with recent investigations. The inquiries that gave rise to all the criticism arose out of events dating back to before the 1986 Financial Services Act. The Mirror Group Newspapers investigation would provide the first real test of the system since the act came into force, but it was too early to say yet that it was taking too long. From the public's point of view, however, the DTI's record is less satisfactory. The number of appointments of inspectors is very small compared with the number of applications for investigations, 65 per cent of which are now made by the public. The number of applications has risen steadily in recent years from 441 in 1987/88 to 850 in 1991/92 but the number of statutory investigations has only risen from 135 to 177 over the same period. This has only fuelled criticism of inaction by the DTI. Little progress appears to have been made either in speeding up the procedure. The average time to complete a major investigation has fallen from three years, eight months in the early 1980s to two years, four months today. But delays in publication after an inquiry seem to have increased. Regulators welcome the publication of interim reports as a useful development, but no action has been taken on the committee's proposal that inspectors' recommendations for prosecution or disciplinary action should be contained in a separate appendix so that the bulk of a report can be published quickly. It may come down to a question of resources. The DTI investigations division needs beefing up. While resources remain scarce, reform along the lines recommended by the committee looks unlikely.</p>

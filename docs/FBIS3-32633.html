The poll indicated that 33 percent of Cubans favor  implementing these measures quickly and that 59 percent favor  doing it slowly or gradually. [figures as heard]    Right now, workers are meeting to discuss measures that  might  be discussed by the National Assembly. These measures include a  change of currency, the creation of taxes, payroll reductions,  and the elimination of some subsidies, although not those  related to education or public health.    The poll also revealed that only 0.2 percent of the people  favor changing Cuba's economic system.</p>

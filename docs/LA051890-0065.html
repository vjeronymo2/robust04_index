			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> JC NOTES / IRENE GARCIA;  </P> <P> EL CAMINO SENDING CROWD TO STATE MEET ON SATURDAY  </P> <P> El Camino College will be well represented at the state junior college track  meet Saturday at Santa Barbara City College. Fifteen individual Warriors and  four relay teams have qualified.  </P> <P> The El Camino women's track team, which placed third in last week's Southern  California Championships, will have a hard time defending its state title  against this year's tougher competition, but the Warriors should come away with  several individual titles.  </P> <P> For instance, El Camino has two of the state's top distance runners. Sophomore  Sharette Garcia, last year's 800-meter state champion, is favored to repeat.  Freshman Diana Tracy is a strong bet in the 3,000- and 5,000-meter races.  </P> <P> Garcia, from Belize, won the 800 and 1,500 meters in the Southern California  meet at Cerritos College, and Tracy, 37, swept the 3,000 and 5,000.  </P> <P> Adienna Thomas qualified in the 100 meters, and cross-country standout Carla  Swain will run in the 3,000 meters. Julie Salas, a surprise qualifier, earned a  spot in the 1,500 meters with a 4:41.49 finish at the Southern California meet.  </P> <P> El Camino is also expected to rack up points in the triple jump and long jump.  Tiesha Holmes will compete in both events, and Sharlotte McKoy and Gail Suthern  will go for triple-jump titles.  </P> <P> The women will also have 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams at the state meet.  </P> <P> The El Camino men's team qualified seven individuals as well as 400- and  1,600-meter relay teams.  </P> <P> Freshman DeAndros Long qualified by winning the 800 meters in 1:52.84 at the  Southern California meet. Sophomore Keith Davis will also compete in the 800  meters, freshman David Haskell in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, Khevin Pratt  and Yuli Henry in the 400 meters and Phil DeMontigny in the 1,500 meters.  </P> <P> Curtis Mitchell, considered the state's best triple jumper, will go for the  official title in Santa Barbara. The sophomore leaped 52 feet, 5 1/2 inches at  the South Coast Conference meet April 28.  </P> <P> Alan King, longtime Palos Verdes High boys' soccer coach, will replace Roy  Janes as the Harbor College men's soccer coach next season.  </P> <P> In 17 years at Palos Verdes, King compiled a 320-118-54 mark. He led the Sea  Kings to seven Bay League titles and made the CIF 4-A semifinals nine times.  </P> <P> His teams have won the past two CIF titles with a 33-0 record in 1989 and a  29-2-2 record this past season. At Palos Verdes, King was named league coach of  the year seven times, CIF coach of the year twice and national coach of the  year twice.  </P> <P> King will continue coaching boys' soccer and teaching at Palos Verdes while  coaching at Harbor.  </P> <P> Maybe Harbor first baseman Ryan Karp isn't major league material. At least he  didn't behave like it in the Seahawks' first playoff game against Miracosta  College Friday.  </P> <P> In back-to-back at-bats, Karp got hit in the head by Miracosta pitcher Aaron  Mirandon and he didn't rush the mound fiercely, major league style.  </P> <P> The University of Miami-bound sophomore simply jogged to first base even after  the second hit, which bounced off his helmet and struck his neck.  </P> <P> Harbor Coach Jim O'Brien said he trains players to remain calm in those  situations.  </P> <P> "We've worked at it," he said. "If you do (rush the mound), you get in a fight  and guys get thrown out of the game. We don't think it's worth it. That's why  we don't rush the mound first. But I'll tell you, if they do, you can bet  they'll get a good homecoming."  </P> <P> The Seahawks won that game 11-5. Mirandon gave up nine hits and six runs in  five innings. The right-handed sophomore walked two and had three wild pitches.  </P> <P> It's been a terrible baseball season for the entire South Coast Conference, not  just El Camino. The two SCC teams that reached the playoffs were eliminated in  last week's first round.  </P> <P> Defending state champion Cerritos (35-7, 19-1 in the SCC) lost to Rio Hondo,  and Long Beach (16-23, 10-10) got wiped out by Moorpark.  </P> <P> El Camino handed Cerritos its only conference loss May 3, but the Warriors had  a disappointing season under interim Coach Glen LeVier. El Camino placed fourth  in the five-member SCC with a 6-13-1 record and was 14-21-1 overall.  </P> <P> The Warriors, however, weren't forgotten when all-conference teams were  selected. Sophomore pitcher Jon Newville and sophomore infielders Cesar Rivas  and Denny Hocking were named to the first team, first baseman Brian Wixom and  outfielders Steve Allyn and John Otte to the second team.  </P></p>

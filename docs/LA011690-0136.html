			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AUSTRALIAN OPEN;  </P> <P> BECKER WINS EASILY, WORRIES ABOUT TIMING  </P> <P> Boris Becker, in eager pursuit of a third straight Grand Slam title, is worried  about peaking too soon in the Australian Open after flexing his muscles in a  first-round showpiece.  </P> <P> Becker pummeled travel-weary Paul Haarhuis 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 today, just a few  hours after the Dutchman arrived from New Zealand following visa difficulties.  </P> <P> Haarhuis, who upset John McEnroe in the second round of the U.S. Open last  fall, never had a chance against the Becker onslaught.  </P> <P> Becker, the Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion, said the McEnroe upset was on his  mind.  </P> <P> "It's the reason why I played very hard in the first round, which is not normal  for me," he said. "In a Grand Slam, you can't play too well too early. You have  to wait a little bit. There's a fine line between not playing too good and  playing too bad.  </P> <P> "If I want to do good in a Grand Slam, I have to peak the last three days. If  you peak too early, then you might not be able to peak again."  </P> <P> While Becker looked sharp, Stefan Edberg and McEnroe issued warnings that they  might be ready to stop him as he goes after Ivan Lendl's Australian title and  No. 1 ranking.  </P> <P> The soft-spoken but confident Edberg, 1985 and 1987 Australian Open champion,  won his first-round match today and proclaimed himself ready to challenge No. 1  Lendl and No. 2 Becker for the top spot in men's tennis.  </P> <P> "I see myself there," said the No. 3 Edberg, whose highest ranking was No. 2 in  1987. "I feel strongly that I can come back to challenge."  </P> <P> Edberg beat Swedish-born Johan Anderson, who lives in Australia, 7-6 (7-1),  6-3, 6-4, in a first-round match on center court just before Becker took on  Haarhuis.  </P> <P> McEnroe made his debut on center court earlier in the day and swept to an easy  victory over Thierry Tulasne of France. (Story, C2.)  </P> <P> In other first-round matches today, No. 5 Aaron Krickstein of Grosse Point,  Mich., beat Italy's Gianluca Pozzi 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 7-5; No. 8 Mats  Wilander of Sweden beat Australian Richard Fromberg 7-6 (7-5), 7-5, 7-5 and No.  9 Andres Gomez of Ecuador beat Australian Darren Cahill, a 1988 U.S. Open  semifinalist, 4-6, 6-3, 1-6, 6-2, 6-3.  </P> <P> No. 10 Carl-Uwe Steeb, who beat fellow West German Becker last week in Sydney,  lost to Veli Paloheimo of Finland 5-7, 6-2, 0-6, 6-2, 6-2.  </P> <P> No. 11 Andrei Chesnokov beat Australian Mark Kratzmann 3-6, 6-7 (4-7), 7-6  (7-5), 6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> No. 12 Yannick Noah of France struggled past Yugoslav Goran Prpic 4-6, 7-6  (7-5), 6-2, 4-6, 7-5; and No. 15 Thomas Muster beat West German Pavel Vojtisek  6-3, 6-2, 6-4.  </P> <P> In women's play, No. 2 Gabriela Sabatini beat Amy Frazier of Rochester Hills,  Mich., 7-5, 6-1; No. 3 Zina Garrison of Houston defeated Akiko Kijimuta of  Japan, 6-1, 6-2 and No. 4 Czech Helena Sukova beat Australian Tracey Morton  6-4, 6-3.  </P></p>

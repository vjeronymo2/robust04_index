			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure from SNP over steel - News in brief NATIONALISATION is not the answer to the proposed closure of the Ravenscraig steel works, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said yesterday, as he introduced a motion condemning British Steel's repeated failure to 'support and invest in' its Scottish plants, David Owen writes. Instead, the option of finding a buyer for the plant should be kept open as long as possible although the chances were slim, he said. His remarks followed a Scottish National Party assertion that 'public ownership of steel' in the Scottish economy was needed. 'It is unacceptable that Scotland should face a future without a steel industry,' said Mr Jim Sillars, SNP deputy leader. The government formally applied to the European Commission yesterday to create an enterprise zone in Lanarkshire in order to offset the impact of closing the Ravenscraig works. Last night's debate also followed a government move to shift attention to more favourable news for the region by announcing that a contract for three Type 23 frigates had been won by Yarrow Shipbuilders on the Clyde. The announcement was welcomed by MPs on all sides of the House. Mr George Galloway (Lab Glasgow Hillhead) advocated naming the vessels Stewart, Lang and Forsyth in honour of three ministers who, he said, were unlikely to be much longer in office. SUNDAY TRADING: Directors of supermarket chains and not local managers should be the target of any future prosecutions for breaches of the Sunday trading laws, Mr David Harris (C St Ives) suggested in the Commons yesterday. Mrs Angela Rumbold, home office minister, acknowledged cross-party support for a private member's bill to prevent deregulation of Sunday trading in England and Wales. She maintained that it would be 'foolish' to proceed with fresh legislation before a pending European Court of Justice ruling.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cockerill confirms Eko Stahl bid Cockerill Sambre, Belgium's biggest steelmaker, yesterday confirmed it had put in a bid for Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's loss-making steel mill. However, the Treuhand privatisation agency, which is selling Eko Stahl, one of the few large industrial enterprises still on the Treuhand's books, declined to disclose the bidding price or confirm that Cockerill was the only party interested in acquiring Eko Stahl. Cockerill made its offer after carrying out several studies at Eko Stahl, located in the eastern state of Brandenburg, and following the collapse last May of a bid by Riva, the Italian private steel company. The Belgian group had originally considered joining an international consortium, including Thyssen, the biggest German steelmaker and Usinor-Sacilor, the largest French producer, to prepare a feasibility study on Eko Stahl's prospects. A consortium led by Thyssen and Preussag had earlier proposed buying 50 per cent of Eko Stahl's cold rolling mill, closing down the hot blast furnace over a period of three years, and providing 1,000 jobs through its subsidiaries. However, the Treuhand wants to retain the mill's manufacturing capacity largely for political and social reasons since the 50,000 inhabitants of Eisenhuttenstadt are dependent on the plant. Until German unification, Eko Stahl had supplied steel to the east European and Russian market and had an annual capacity of more than 2m tons. This has since been reduced to 900,000 tons a year while the workforce has been cut from 12,000 to fewer than 3,000 since 1991. The Treuhand is anxious to privatise Eko Stahl, preferably before the federal elections which take place next month.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Taiwan company to clone Intel chip TAIWAN's top semiconductor manufacturer plans to launch a clone of the top selling Intel microprocessor chip, the brains of most personal computers. A legal battle, which may take on nationalistic tones, seems likely to ensue. United Microelectronics, Taiwan's flagship chipmaker formed in 1980 with government support, says it will introduce a 486SX microprocessor chip next month, with a higher performance 486DX chip to follow next year. UMC plans to sell the chips only to non-US customers to avoid legal problems with Intel, which is vigorously defending its intellectual property rights against other efforts to clone its microprocessors by Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix , both of the US. Avoiding the US market may not, however, protect UMC if Intel determines that UMC has copied its technology. Intel holds world patents and copyrights protecting all its products the US company said. UMC's move reflects Taiwan's ambitions to become a fully-fledged producer of computers and other electronics product, rather than an assembly site for US, Japanese and European-branded PCs using components manufactured mainly in the US and Japan. Encouraged by the Taiwan government, UMC is attempting to reduce the dependence of the country's fast-growing electronics industry on foreign component suppliers. Already the company produces memory chips and several other semiconductor devices for the PC market. Some 75 per cent of its chips are sold to Taiwan-based companies although most are ultimately exported in finished goods or sub-assemblies. UMC is not expected to put a serious dent in Intel's microprocessor sales. The company has limited production capacity and is forecasting revenues of about Dollars 350m (Pounds 227m) this year, up from an estimated Dollars 250m in 1992, but a far cry from Intel's Dollars 5.8bn 1992 revenues. However, the Taiwanese company is about to begin building a manufacturing facility that will more than double its output when completed in about two years. Moreover, UMC is well placed to usurp Intel's near monopoly of the world PC microprocessor market. Over the past five years Taiwan's production of PCs and the main circuit boards that power them has expanded rapidly. Taiwan now produces almost 70 per cent of all PC circuit boards, making it Intel's biggest market. If UMC succeeds in the microprocessor market, others might be encouraged to follow suit. Intel's response to UMC's introduction of 486-clones could also be critical to the development of Taiwan's electronics industry, the highest growth segment of its economy. The US company's ownership of the core technology for PCs represents a serious barrier to Taiwan's ambitions to 'move up the value chain' in the information technology industry. This objective - established by the government as a central element of its industrial policy - has been backed by heavy government spending on research and development. Taiwan's Information Technology Research Institute has an annual budget of Dollars 450m. Thus a legal challenge aimed at UMC by Intel would amount to an attack on Taiwan's industrial development in the eyes of many Taiwanese. Emotions are fuelled by the resentment that already exists among Taiwan's PC circuit board producers towards the US company, which they charge has bullied them into paying high prices and threatened to cut off supplies of critical components if they purchase microprocessor 'clones'. These feelings have been exacerbated by a trade complaint, filed in the US by Intel against one of Taiwan's PC producers. Intel charges that Twinhead of Taiwan which makes PCs based on AMD's clone microprocessors, is selling PCs in the US that infringe its intellectual property rights. ITRI has stepped in to help defend Twinhead. A legal battle between Intel and UMC could also undermine Taiwan's efforts to prove that it has made significant progress in implementing new laws to protect intellectual property rights as it seeks membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Intel executives are sceptical that UMC can actually produce 486-compatible chips.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The current level of inflation, which is  slightly higher than projected, is no threat to long-term  economic growth, says Bank of Thailand Governor Wichit Suphinit.    He said the current inflation rate is 4.8 percent, a level  considered not too high and is only a point-in-time measurement  and not the annual average figure.    He noted that inflation has been caused by agricultural  commodities prices, which have risen by 5.8 percent, while the  prices of non-agricultural commodities have risen by only 3.8  percent.    Savings in the first quarter of 1994 expanded 15.9 percent  while credit expanded 22.8 percent. Commercial banks have  raised interest rates to entice savings. The country's saving  rate is estimated to lag investment by 6 percent, said Mr Wichit.    The governor maintained that the widening gap between  savings  and credit extension, and the higher inflation rate, are not  alarming. [passage omitted on comments by commercial bank  officials]    Meanwhile, huge capital inflows through the Bangkok  International Banking Facility of 110.58 billion baht in the  first quarter helped Thailand avert a capital shortfall.    The inflow through this channel in the first quarter last  year amounted to only 15.5 billion baht, Mr Wichit said .    Capital inflows in other channels suffered declines: direct  investment dropped two billion baht investment in securities  dropped 8.3 billion baht and non-resident deposits dropped 16.8  billion baht.    Total capital inflow to the private sector in the first  quarter amounted to 76.58 billion baht, lower than the 82.34  billion baht in the same quarter last year, according to Mr  Wichit.    He also noted that net capital inflow to the private sector  in 1994 would be around US$10 billion, compared with the US$13  billion in 1993.    The shortfall was primarily caused by recent changes in US  interest rates.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Angela Quintal] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 29 SAPA -- Three senior Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance] officials were  among 33 right-wingers who appeared in the Johannesburg regional  court on Friday [29 April] in connection with bomb attacks in  the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region since  Sunday.    AWB chief-of-staff Josias Alexander van Cruywagen,  Ystergaarde [Iron Guard] Commander Leon van der Merwe and the  organisation's executive secretary Nico Prinsloo were among the  accused.    Assistant Police Constable Hercules Jacobus Coetsee and  police reservist Andreas Coetzee also face charges ranging from  19 counts of murder, 191 counts of attempted murder, vehicle  theft, malicious damage to property and charges under the arms  and ammunition and explosives acts.    A 34th accused, Mr P Koekemoer, could not attend the hearing  because he was in a Rustenburg hospital after being shot in a  foot.    The accused packed the courtroom, dressed casually rather  than in AWB uniforms, and occupied benches brought in to expand  the dock. The group included a father and son, both named  Cornelius Johannes Botha.    Relatives and friends, including AWB leader Eugene  Terreblanche's brother Andries, sat in the public gallery and a  large contingent of local and foreign media jammed the courtroom.    The men, many in their late teens and early 20s, were not  asked to plead and State Advocate Brink Ferreira requested that  they be remanded in custody until July 10.    Counsel for the defence, represented by Advocates H L  Prinsloo and H van der Walt and Attorney Fanie van Vuuren,  argued that proper consultation with their clients for a bail  application was impossible because the charge sheet did not  provide sufficient detail. They submitted that according to the  interim constitution every person had the right to information  in the possession of the state or its agents to protect their  rights.    They also submitted that because bail was a fundamental  right  protected by the constitution, the accused were entitled to bail  unless the state could prove on a balance of probabilities that  the granting of bail was not in the interests of justice.    Mr Ferreira argued that the constitutional provisions to the  right to information applied only to accused on trial. As they  had yet to plead to charges the provision could not apply.    Magistrate C J van Heerden ordered the state to provide  additional information so the defence could prepare for the bail  application. He added that, according to the constitution, the  state had the burden of convincing the court on a balance of  probabilities why bail should not be granted.    After a short adjournment the state expanded on the charge  sheet, saying six of the murder charges related to the Bree  Street, Johannesburg, car bombing on March 24, a further eight  murder charges related to the bomb in Germiston on March 25 and  the rest to a bombing in Bloed Street, Pretoria, later the same  day.    The vehicle theft charges related to cars used in the three  bombings.    Details of the identity of the deceased would be given to  the  defence once the information became available, Mr Brink said.    The 34 accused were facing charges in their personal  capacity  and as part of a conspiracy.    Mr van Heerden then ruled the bail application should be  heard in the Johannesburg regional court on May 16 and that the  accused be remanded in custody until then.    Another of the accused, who cannot be named because he is a  minor, appeared briefly in court after the main hearing. He was  released into the care of his mother and was warned to report  twice a day to the Rustenburg police station.    The other accused, from Randfontein, Carletonville,  Ventersdrop, Rustenburg and Pretoria, include: Clint Ellish,  Abraham Liebenberg Myburg, Pieter Daniel van der Merwe, Nicolaas  Clifton Barnard, Jan Antonie Oelofse, Serge Marie Joseph  Dabbabie, Douglas Pieter Taylor, Gerhard William Antonius  Elbers, Dirk Jacobus Coetzee Meyer, Marthinus Albertus Deysel,  Nelson George Woutberg, Gustav Woutberg, Gert Kruger Jacobus  Albert, Louis Johannes Fouri, Hermanus Steyn Luyt, Theunis van  Schalkwyk, Andries Wilhemus Nel, Milestone Sharp, Zacharius  Johannes Beneke, Willem Frans Johannes Hattingh, J P Olivier,  Jacobus Petrus Nel, Johannes Coenraad Smit, Pieter Duvenhage and  Roelof Johannes Fouche.</p>

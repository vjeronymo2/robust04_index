			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- The ruling coalition  government came under pressure at a forum Monday [6 June] to  carry out administrative and fiscal reforms ahead of a  consumption tax hike.    The government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata held a tax  reform forum Monday to hear views from representatives of  business and consumer groups.    The representatives asked the government to continue income  tax cuts in fiscal 1995 and beyond.    They were divided on a possible increase in consumption tax  from the present 3 percent, but joined hands in calling on the  government to carry out administrative and fiscal reforms over  resistance from bureaucrats.    Business representatives told the session an increase in  consumption tax will be unavoidable to generate funds to make up  for revenue shortfalls resulting from income tax cuts and to  cope with the aging society.    Masae Wada, representative of the Japan Housewives  Association, expressed opposition to a consumption tax increase,  calling for a correction in the unfair tax system.    A labor representative called for a revision of consumption  tax to transfer part of the revenue to local governments.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar firmer The dollar finished firmer yesterday on foreign exchanges ahead of the weekend G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Washington, writes Philip Gawith. Trading was mostly range-bound as dealers closed positions in order to protect themselves against political comment emerging from the meeting which could move the market. Speculation about the possibility of some dollar supportive package emerging from the G7 helped the US currency close in London at DM1.6947 from DM1.6882. It was marginally firmer against the yen, closing at Y103.650 from Y103.545. The D-Mark closed unchanged at FFr3.427 against the French franc, but fell to L956.7 from L958.4 against the Italian lira. The Spanish peseta firmed after the central bank cut its key lending rate to 7.75 per cent from 8 per cent, finishing at Pta81.37 from Pta81.44 against the D-Mark. Although G7 meetings seldom produce any comment on currencies, markets were slightly nervous on account of rumours throughout the week of concerted central bank intervention to support the dollar against the yen. Recovery in the US treasury market also lent support to the US currency. Increasingly, though, the market is taking the view that if the dollar breaches the key support level of Y102.50, then it is likely to fall below Y100. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, commented: 'I am sure the downside is going to be tested again.' There was little response to the announcement of two economists, Mr Alan Blinder and Ms Janet Yellen, to fill the vacancies on the board of the US Federal Reserve. The nominations were expected. German call money rose to 5.20/5.30 per cent, from 4.90/5.00 per cent earlier, when the Bundesbank announced it was selling 5.30 per cent treasury bills to put a floor on interest rates. Analysts said the Bundesbank's action was a reminder to the market not to overreach itself in terms of its interest rate expectations. Although the central bank allowed the repo rate to fall by 12 basis points this week to 5.58 per cent, it now seems likely to return to a path of slow and steady cuts. In the futures market the June euromark contract closed three basis points firmer at 94.75. In the UK a stronger than expected M4 lending figure for March gave the pound a small fillip, but it finished the day a pfennig lower at DM2.517 from DM2.527. It also finished more than a cent down against the dollar, at Dollars 1.4853 from Dollars 1.4969. Sterling futures had a slightly better day, with the June contract finishing four basis points higher at 94.63. The market mood, however, remains very bearish, with the December contract discounting three month money at 6.10 per cent at the end of the year. This involves interest rates rising nearly 1 percentage point from current levels. Although a string of strong economic data has put a firm dampener on hopes of a near-term rate cut, analysts believe the chance of rates rising soon is also slight. In the money markets the Bank of England comfortably dispatched a Pounds 1.1bn shortage.</p>

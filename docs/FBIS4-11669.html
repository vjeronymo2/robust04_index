			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad al-Tibi, one of 'Arafat's advisers, by </F> Julia Albrecht; place and date not given: "I Was Naively  Optimistic"]    [Text] [Albrecht] The day before yesterday, in the  evening, the Israeli military shot six al-Fatah members in the  Jabalyah refugee camp in Gaza. How can such acts of violence be  prevented?    [Al-Tibi] Only by implementing the peace agreement. Even  though things will not become completely peaceful then, the acts  of violence will at least be reduced.    [Albrecht] Yesterday, it seemed that the peace negotiations  would be continued now. Is this still true?    [Al-Tibi] The PLO Executive Committee is currently  discussing how things are going to continue after the latest  crime.    [Albrecht] You call it a crime.    [Al-Tibi] Yes, it is a crime. It is just a continuation of  the Hebron massacre. First, Baruch Goldstein shot 30 people.  Then, during the following eight days, the Israeli military  shot 30 Palestinians. And now another six Palestinians were  killed. It will be very difficult to continue the peace talks  this week.    [Albrecht] What is your demand to the Israelis?    [Al-Tibi] They should stop killing us. They should make  sure that the atmosphere changes and they finally see us as  human beings.    [Albrecht] Do you trust Rabin, who is defense minister and  prime minister at the same time?    [Al-Tibi] Defense Minister Rabin is hurting the peace  efforts of Prime Minister Rabin.    [Albrecht] How, do you think, did this most recent shooting  of Palestinians come about?    [Al-Tibi] The only reason that can be behind that is that  there was an order to stage a massacre. If the Israeli military  goes to the refugee camps, it does so only for one specific  reason. In addition, these soldiers were not normal military.  They were a special unit that went in to shoot people. Who  gave the order to go to the refugee camp one day before the  continuation of the talks?    [Albrecht] A few days ago you were still optimistic about  the peace process. You spoke of "historic changes" and of the  "mutual recognition of the two peoples."    [Al-Tibi] Yes, I was naively optimistic.    [Albrecht] Why?    [Al-Tibi] Because we were very close to an interim solution  after the massacre in Hebron. Nevertheless, I am sure that, in  the end, we will implement the peace agreement.    [Albrecht] The trust of the Palestinians in their leadership  is constantly decreasing. While the leadership wants to  continue the peace talks, the people at the grassroots demand  not to continue negotiations.    [Al-Tibi] Yes, I just had a telephone call from Gaza. I was  asked to tell 'Arafat that he should stop the peace talks.  However, there is no alternative to the peace process. Of  course, our credibility has suffered. The Palestinians still do  not see any change or improvement. I am sure that at the moment  when the agreement comes into force and when the Palestinians  see that the Israeli military withdraws, the support for peace  will be there again. I know my people.</p>

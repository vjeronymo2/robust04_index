			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JANOS NEGYESY STILL BUCKS PARTY LINE;  </P> <P> MUSIC: TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER DEFECTING FROM HUNGARY, THE UCSD VIOLINIST AND  CHAMPION OF CONTEMPORARY COMPOSERS ALSO MANAGES TO KEEP A FLAME BURNING FOR  TRADITION.  </P> <P> It was no surprise that UC San Diego music professor Janos Negyesy chose to  perform John Cage's "Freeman Etudes" at a Bartok festival in Szombathely,  Hungary, this summer. The trip was his first visit in 25 years to his native  country, and his choice of music symbolized the musician he had become in the  West after defecting in 1965 when the authorities refused him permission to  study music in West Germany.  </P> <P> A proponent of avant-garde violin music, Negyesy has premiered more than 40  works either written for him or dedicated to him over the past two decades.  </P> <P> Among those works that give Negyesy special pride are Cage's "Freeman Etudes,"  which he premiered in 1984 in Turin, Italy, and UCSD colleague Roger Reynolds'  "Personae" for violin and orchestra, unveiled last March.  </P> <P> "Cage is always a good test for audiences," Negyesy said. "It is 80 minutes  nonstop for solo violin, including many silences."  </P> <P> Much to Negyesy's astonishment, his Hungarian audience loved the challenging  Cage opus and showered him with 20 minutes of applause.  </P> <P> "It was absolutely a big success, which I didn't expect. I played in a large  gallery, and the people were lying on a carpet on the floor. It was like  playing in a church. It was hard for me to know how far they had come in 25  years. When I was a student in Budapest, composers like Schoenberg, Webern and  Stravinsky were on the black list. I remember when some older colleagues  smuggled in recordings of their music from Vienna. We closed the curtains and  listened to the records at the softest level possible. It was this kind of  terror I grew up under."  </P> <P> Even after living a quarter of a century in the West, Negyesy remains the  soft-spoken iconoclast, still eager to subvert party lines.  </P> <P> In the UCSD music department (where the party line is the pursuit of  contemporary music), Negyesy raised eyebrows when he started his series of  traditional chamber music concerts, "Soirees for Music Lovers."  </P> <P> How could it be that the violinist they had hired to play Krenek and Xenakis  was organizing concerts of Schubert and Mozart?  </P> <P> "I don't see any essential difference between a Telemann sonata and the Cage,  except that the Cage is not so old," explained Negyesy, who joined the faculty  in 1979. "I have always felt that, if you play only new music, it is just half  of the picture. If you play only Mozart and Brahms, that's another half. I'm  sure that, if somebody plays Cage, his or her Mozart is different, and vice  versa. I just cannot separate them -- that is why I started the series."  </P> <P> At first, Negyesy said, he had no support from the department. But he continued  promoting his quarterly chamber music concerts, and they soon became a popular  fixture of university life.  </P> <P> The soirees also had a side bonus. Recently, Negyesy invited faculty members of  certain departments to preview the performances.  </P> <P> "We don't know anybody on this campus," he said, shaking his head. "It's  wonderful to see people meet after you've played for them Schubert's 'Trout'  Quintet. At our last soiree, the head of the chemistry department took me aside  and said, 'Some of our colleagues from the chemistry department met at your  concert for the first time!' "  </P> <P> For his performances, Negyesy tries to find the most appropriate visual  setting. Last year, when he brought a program of recent violin works written by  young American composers to Bern, Switzerland, he performed them in a gallery  that was featuring an exhibit by noted American painter Jackson Pollack.  </P> <P> Recently, at La Jolla's Salk Institute, an ensemble of Negyesy's students  performed Telemann, Schumann and Mozart surrounded by whimsical sculptures of  musicians made by their fellow UCSD students under the tutelage of art  professor Peter Phillips.  </P> <P> Mixing temporary sculpture and chamber music is symptomatic of Negyesy's  undogmatic and sometimes fanciful approach to his discipline, an attitude he  attributes to Cage.  </P> <P> "Cage enlarged my possible borders to receive influences. I don't judge things  or happenings too soon. He got rid of my black-and-white thinking, as well as  the tendency to rely on only two choices. Curiosity, I believe, is the engine  of life. Without it, everything is hopeless."  </P> <P> Among Negyesy's diverse musical projects is a performance with Belgium's Rosas  Dance Company, an engagement that has turned him into a long-distance commuter  to Rotterdam for rehearsals. He will perform Eugene Ysaye's three Sonatas for  Solo Violin as accompaniment to the dancers. Ysaye's arch-Romantic musical  idiom is light-years away from Cage or Reynolds, but Negyesy relishes the  challenge.  </P> <P> "It's really great music in spite of its Lisztian virtuosity, and it's  remarkable what Ysaye could do using just the four strings of the violin. It's  also fun for me to work at the other end of the musical spectrum."  </P></p>

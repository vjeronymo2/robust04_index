			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 25 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni troops  cut the coast road between Aden and the oil refinery at Little  Aden on Saturday [25 June], seriously threatening fuel supplies  to the city, an AFP correspondent reported.    Troops cut the road between the port city and Little Aden,  18  kilometres (11 miles) to the west, at the village of Madinat  al-Sha'b.    Southern troops set up a roadblock at the village, which  lies  only 10 kilometres (six miles) from Aden, and turned back  civilian vehicles, saying northern forces were firing at traffic  on the road.    The soldiers said southern troops were trying to push back  the northern forces.    Villagers in Madinat al-Sha'b said the road was cut  following  infiltration by northern troops loyal to President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih.    When Aden residents heard of the infiltration long queues of  cars formed outside the city's petrol stations.    If northern forces keep the road cut Aden's fuel supplies  will be seriously jeopardised because tanker trucks will not be  able to reach the refinery.    A southern military spokesman said earlier Saturday that  northern forces had launched an offensive towards Madinat  al-Sha'b.    Fierce fighting raged around the village and Aden Radio  transmitters were hit, forcing the radio off the air.    War erupted between Salih's forces and those of his southern  rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 5.</p>

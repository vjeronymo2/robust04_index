			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US judge orders tuna import ban A US judge has ordered the government to block imports of tuna from Italy, Spain, France and Japan on grounds that they buy the fish from countries where fishermen use a method that kills dolphins, Reuter reports from San Francisco. The Earth Island Institute said yesterday that Judge Thelton Henderson, sitting in San Francisco, had granted the environmental group an injunction ordering a halt to imports from the countries. The San Francisco-based organisation has waged a court fight since 1988 to stop fishermen from using nets that kill dolphins as they catch tuna. It says 6m dolphins have been killed since fishermen began using the nets. The practice was outlawed for US fishing fleets in the early 1970s.</p>

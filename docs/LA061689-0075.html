			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WARNER CENTER OFFERS INCENTIVES FOR EMPLOYEES TO SHARE RIDES  </P> <P> A Warner Center business group Thursday announced a $400,000 package of  financial incentives aimed at doubling -- to about 4% -- the proportion of  employees riding van pools to work.  </P> <P> Among the inducements to get workers out of single-occupant cars and into  15-passenger vans are fare subsidies and a free ride home in the event of an  emergency that keeps an employee at work late or requires him or her to leave  early.  </P> <P> The free rides home will be by taxi or rental car, said Christopher Park,  manager of the Warner Center Traffic Management Organization, which is  administering the program.  </P> <P> Also, those who have been with a van pool for 11 months will get the 12th month  free under the program "to hold onto those we now have in the van pools," Park  said.  </P> <P> Monthly fees for van pool riders range from $52 to $65, depending on distance.  </P> <P> The incentive program is being financed with money from the Los Angeles City  Council-created Warner Center Trust Fund.  </P> <P> Robert Voit, Warner Center's major developer, was required by the council to  place $5.5 million into the fund, which is controlled by the city's  Transportation Department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Street Widening  </P> <P> Besides subsidizing ride-sharing, the fund is being used to widen streets and  improve traffic signalization in an effort to offset the traffic impact of the  center's 35,000 employees.  </P> <P> The council in recent years has been requiring major developers to underwrite  traffic improvements and ride-sharing programs for employees.  </P> <P> Of the 26,000 workers employed by the 19 firms that have formed the Traffic  Management Organization, 17% car pool to work, about 2% ride van pools and 1%  ride buses, Park said.  </P> <P> He said fewer than 1% ride bicycles or walk to work.  </P></p>

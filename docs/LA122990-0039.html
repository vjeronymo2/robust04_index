			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO ARE THEY?  </P> <P> In "When Gay Means Loss of Revenue" (Calendar, Dec. 22), the brave Steve  Weinstein describes how the brave ABC network lost $500,000 when the brave  "thirtysomething" showed an episode including two gay (and undoubtedly brave)  characters. Weinstein even names gadfly the Rev. Donald Wildmon as the  (brave/bigoted: choose one) leader of boycotts against advertisers of such  programs.  </P> <P> What is missing are the names of the cowards: the advertisers who drop episodes  with gays, the advertisers who fear Wildmon. Why doesn't Weinstein name them?  What happened to the first W in reporting? Who are these guys -- and how much  ad space do they buy in the Los Angeles Times?  </P> <P> ERIC BAGAI  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P> <P>  Editor's Note: ABC said its policy is to not identify advertisers who pull out  of its programs.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares [Democratic Revolutionary  Party candidate -- PRD], Ruben Dario Carles [Nationalist Liberal  Republican Movement candidate], and Ruben Blades [Papa Egoro  Movement candidate] registered the highest citizen preference  ratings for the presidency of the Republic. Those results stem  from a poll requested by Telemetro Television Network which  included interviews conducted in 1,260 houses in Panama, Cocle,  Chiriqui, Herrera, Los Santos, and Veraguas Provinces from 9 to  11 February. The Federico Guerra consulting firm carried out the  poll.    The results of the poll show that Perez Balladares obtained  a  32.8 percent preference rating; Carles a 16.3 percent; and  Blades 14.8 percent. Arnulfist Party candidate Mireya Moscoso  de Gruber is in fourth place with 9.9 percent; industrialist  Samuel Lewis Galindo [Solidarity Party candidate] came in fifth  with 2.9 percent; Christian Democratic Party candidate Eduardo  Vallarino, the sixth position with 2 percent; and last place is  held by Jose Salvador Munoz [Doctrinaire Panamenist Party  candidate] who obtained 0.2 percent. The poll results also  indicate that 21.1 percent of the people interviewed remain  undecided on who they will vote for in the 8 May presidential  elections.    Comparing this poll with others carried out at the end of  1993, it can be noted that Carles, who did not appear in the  latter, has managed to overtake other candidates, including  Ruben Blades, in this one. Blades, however, has suffered a  decline in his popularity rating.    Furthermore, the poll results reveal that although Perez  Balladares and Carles obtained the highest preference ratings,  they are also the candidates who obtained the highest negative  ratings. Of polled interviewed, 31.3 percent stated they would  not vote for Carles, another 20 percent objected to Perez  Balladares' candidacy, 14.8 percent objected to Mireya Moscoso  de Gruber, 7.6 percent of those interviewed said they would not  back Blades, 3.3 percent would not support Vallarino, 1.9  percent likewise regarding Lewis Galindo, and 1.6 percent do not  intend to vote for Jose Salvador Munoz.    The Telemetro poll included interviews in 105 sectors of the  country. In each sector 12 homes were chosen.    Regarding candidates for city mayor, Omaira Correa leads  with  a 31.5 percent preference. She is followed by Andres Vega  Cedeno [PRD] with 21.3 percent, Ana Mae de Endara 10.3 percent,  Isabel Corro [Labor Party] 2.1 percent, Hernan Arias [Christian  Democratic Party] 1.3 percent, Jose Manuel Paredes [National  Unity Mission] 1.2 percent, and Maribel Cuervo de Paredes 0.4  percent.</p>

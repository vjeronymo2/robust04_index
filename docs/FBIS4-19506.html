			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Di Donato, Ex-Socialist Deputy </F> Chief, Arrested"]    [Text] (ANSA) Naples, April 16 -- Naples police on Saturday  [16 April] detained the former Socialist Party vice secretary,  Giulio Di Donato, who thus became the first member of parliament  of the former legislature facing corruption charges to be  arrested after having lost his parliamentary immunity.    Di Donato is under investigation in several cases involving  alleged corruption, violation of party financing laws and  bribery. Last month he was indicted by a Naples court along with  a former official of the telephone company, SIP [Italian  State-Owned Telephone Company], on charges of attempted  extortion.    According to the prosecution, executives of the IPM  telephone  company have testified they had been put under pressure to give  jobs to people proposed by Di Donato or face cancellation of  future sub-contracts with SIP. IPM managers were also asked for  contributions to a magazine published by Socialist Party  supporters of Di Donato, who also faces charges of abuse of  office.    Public prosecutors in Naples on February 12 had issued a  preventive detention warrant against Di Donato in connection  with alleged kickbacks paid for the privatization of the city's  garbage collection services.    Di Donato, who was not reelected in the March 27 elections  and lost his parliamentary immunity when the new legislature was  inaugurated earlier today, faces charges of abuse of office and  corruption in connection with the affair. Magistrates have also  issued a house arrest warrant for Di Donato in connection with  the telephone company corruption case.</p>

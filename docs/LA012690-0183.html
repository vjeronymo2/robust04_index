			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN'S INFLATION UP, GROWTH OFF  </P> <P> Japanese inflation soared and production growth slumped in 1989, but the  country still turned in an economic performance that was the envy of most of  its trading partners.  </P> <P> The government said today that consumer prices jumped 2.3% last year, after  rising a meager 0.7% in 1988.  </P> <P> That was the biggest rise since 1984 but still looked small when compared with  many other nations, including the United States, where inflation is about 4.5%.  </P> <P> Japan also did better than many of its trading partners in churning out  products in 1989, even though industrial output grew only 5.9% after surging  9.5% in 1988. Economists said the slowdown in output growth was to be expected  after 1988's torrid rise and maintained that the 3-year-old economic upswing  remains in place.  </P></p>

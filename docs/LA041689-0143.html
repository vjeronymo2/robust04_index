			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 25 CHARGED IN FRANCE WITH RUNNING FRAUD RING MAKING BORDEAUX WINE  </P> <P> Twenty-five people were being questioned Saturday after police broke up a fraud  ring involving some of France's finest Bordeaux wine, officials said.  </P> <P> They refused to name any of the people being held, but police sources said  major wine producers were involved. The arrests were made on Thursday and  Friday.  </P> <P> Some of the region's finest wines, such as Saint Emilion, Montbazillac,  Bergerac and Cahors, were affected, police said.  </P> <P> The 25 under arrest are accused of producing more vintage wine than the law  allows and selling it illegally to stores and restaurants.  </P> <P> Police said the wine was kept in secret reservoirs, bottled and taken to shops  and restaurants. The wine was correctly labeled and buyers had no idea the  sales were illegal, they said.  </P> <P> Production of vintage wines, or grands crus, is limited by law to maintain  standards, but modern techniques mean that growers often produce double the  amount they are allowed to sell.  </P> <P> The surplus is supposed to be sold as table wine or turned into industrial  alcohol, incurring a large financial loss compared to the profits that can be  made on the sale of a bottle of vintage wine.  </P></p>

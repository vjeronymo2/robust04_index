			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Costs in Halcion libel case set to top Pounds 5m: BBC, Upjohn and professor to pay damages The BBC, Upjohn - a US drugs company - and Professor Ian Oswald, a psychiatrist, face legal costs exceeding Pounds 5m at the end of one of the costliest libel trials in UK history yesterday. Damages totalling Pounds 210,000 were awarded. The BBC, Upjohn and Professor Oswald were each found in a four-month High Court trial to have committed libel. Justice Sir Anthony May said the BBC and Prof Oswald had been wrong to accuse Upjohn of deliberately misleading regulators about the possible side effects of the sleeping pill Halcion. At the same time, Upjohn libelled Professor Oswald, by attacking his scientific credibility. Upjohn, which employed the specialist libel law firm Peter Carter-Ruck and Partners, won Pounds 60,000 from the BBC and Pounds 25,000 from Prof Oswald. Dr Royston Drucker, an Upjohn employee, was awarded Pounds 75,000 against Prof Oswald. Upjohn faces legal costs that will probably exceed Pounds 2m. Prof Oswald, whose views on Upjohn and Halcion were broadcast in the BBC's Panorama programme and who wrote on the subject for the New York Times in January 1992, won a counterclaim against Upjohn and was awarded Pounds 50,000 in damages. He faces a bill for up to Pounds 2m. The BBC said yesterday it would appeal against the decision to award damages against it. 'This is a blow to investigative journalism,' it said. It said it had kept legal costs relatively low through using staff lawyers. Its bill is likely to be less than Pounds 1.5m. Halcion has a history of controversy involving claims that it could have side effects such as amnesia, paranoia and violent behaviour. Britain and several other countries banned the drug in 1991. The Panorama programme of October 1991 entitled 'The Halcion Nightmare' alleged that Upjohn had deliberately mishandled its clinical trials so as to provide evidence supporting its applications for approval of the drug. Upjohn admits it made 'human errors' but denies deliberate wrongdoing. Each of the parties was heavily criticised by Sir Anthony. Upjohn had been 'thoroughly discreditable' and 'reckless' in the way it had conducted the clinical trials, which reduced the damages awarded in its favour. The seriousness of the company's libel against Prof Oswald 'speaks for itself', and Upjohn 'persisted with the allegations'. The libels against Upjohn, however, were 'obvious and great', and Dr Drucker, a medical doctor had been accused by Professor Oswald of lying in a professional context. 'The allegation may have permanently damaged his career,' said Sir Anthony.</p>

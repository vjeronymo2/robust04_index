			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "We Will Have a Dangerous Neighbor"] </F>   [Text] The Press Service of the organization "Ukraine's  State Independence" has got hold of a document under the title  "A Special Status for the Dniester Region (Considerations on  Possible Legal Foundations)," which had been compiled by a  "plenipotentiary representative of the president of the Russian  Federation to the negotiations on the political settlement of  the conflict in the Moldovan Republic's Dniester Region."  Russia proposes that "a special status" for the Dniester Region  be established by means of which Russia could actively influence  Moldova's domestic and external policy. In accordance with the  document handed over to the Moldovan side for consideration, the  elected legislative body of the Dniester Region "may suspend the  action on its territory of laws and normative acts of the  Moldovan Republic, if they are at variance with the special  status...." (Section 7). Thus, a foreign state grants a regular  administrative region of sovereign Moldova the status of a fully  autonomous enclave. The 10 sections of the Russian project are  aimed at creating a separate state, which will be Moscow's  vassal.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEORGIA PACIFIC BIDS $3 BILLION FOR GREAT NORTHERN  </P> <P> Georgia Pacific Corp. on Tuesday launched a $3.18-billion bid for Great  Northern Nekoosa Corp., a buyout proposal that analysts said might trigger a  bidding contest for Great Northern and lead to consolidation in the forest  products industry.  </P> <P> The bid was something of a shocker because, in one analyst's words, there had  until now been an "unwritten rule" against such unsolicited offers. The  acquisition would bolster Georgia Pacific's position in the paper and cardboard  market and make it the world's largest forest products company.  </P> <P> The $58-a-share cash tender offer verified rumors that Atlanta-based Georgia  Pacific would mount a takeover bid for Great Northern, a Norwalk, Conn., paper  products company. Georgia Pacific said the offer is 50% higher than the price  of a Great Northern share before last Thursday, when the value of the firm's  stock began to rise with acquisition rumors.  </P> <P> Great Northern closed at $62.875 a share on Tuesday, up $20.125 on the New York  Stock Exchange, where it was the most actively traded issue.  </P> <P> The buyout proposal was outlined in a letter on Tuesday from Georgia Pacific  Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. to William R. Laidig, chairman of Great Northern.  Hahn, in the letter, also requested a meeting to negotiate aspects of the  offer.  </P> <P> "Unlike many of today's transactions driven by financial engineering," the  letter said, "the merger of our two companies represents an excellent strategic  fit based on industrial logic. In addition . . . this combination will result  in a stronger and more competitive forest products company."  </P> <P> Laidig issued a statement calling the bid "uninvited," but did not respond  directly to the acquisition proposal. Instead, Laidig -- noting that the  company's directors have a legal responsibility to consider the offer -- said  Great Northern's board would meet in "due course." Georgia Pacific made the  tender offer, generally considered a hostile acquisition method, because the  firm's advisers consider it to be the surest way to acquire Great Northern,  said Gail Smith, a spokeswoman for the forest products giant. Smith said  Georgia Pacific -- a firm that traditionally sells more lumber products than  paper products -- wants to acquire Great Northern to expand its paper and  cardboard production.  </P> <P> Great Northern has no effective anti-takeover defenses, but the firm might find  a more friendly suitor, some industry observers said. Mark Kurland, an analyst  at Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. in New York, said two other major forest products  firms -- Weyerhauser and International Paper -- are among the companies that  may vie for Great Northern.  </P> <P> "There will be a bidding war," Kurland declared.  </P> <P> Kurland said the bid for Great Northern will trigger other buyouts and major  consolidation in the forest products industry.  </P> <P> "Things will be going the way of the copper industry," he said. "Instead of 10  or 12, we'll end up with five or six."  </P> <P> Robert Schneider, an analyst at the Chicago-based Duff &amp; Phelps, also  expects more consolidation in the industry.  </P> <P> "This bid is important because there was an unwritten rule against unsolicited  takeovers in this industry," Schneider said. "I thought there would be  consolidation in this industry and this (takeover bid) will give it more  impetus."  </P> <P> Schneider said Georgia Pacific -- now second to International Paper in forest  products sales -- would become the largest firm in the industry by acquiring  Great Northern, No. 9 in sales.  </P> <P> By acquiring Great Northern, Georgia Pacific would be able to pursue plans to  boost its sales abroad, said Julie Bryan, an analyst at the New York offices of  S. G. Warburg &amp; Co.  </P> <P> "Georgia Pacific believes it can become more competitive on a worldwide basis,"  Bryan said. "By increasing capacity, they can lower their costs. Will that lead  to higher exports? We'll see."  </P> <P> Bryan said Georgia Pacific may raise its offer to top counteroffers; but any  boost would be slight -- not significant -- she said.  </P> <P> Georgia Pacific said it was offering to buy 100% of Great Northern's shares.  Georgia Pacific would pay $3.18 billion for the stock, would assume $1.8  billion in Great Northern debt and pay fees associated with legal work and  financing -- bringing the total to about $4.5 billion.  </P> <P> Georgia Pacific said Bank of America has pledged to provide $1.25 billion of  the financing. Bank of America will also arrange other financial backing,  Georgia Pacific said.  </P></p>

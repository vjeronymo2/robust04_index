			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SHOT BY DEPUTY IS CLEARED IN ROBBERY  </P> <P> A Long Beach man who was shot three times by a sheriff's deputy last week is  not the robbery suspect police were seeking and will not face charges, an  investigator in the case said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Investigator Jerry Jansen said Palema Matangi, 27, "sure looked like" a man who  had committed a robbery last year at a home in North Long Beach, but that he  had been cleared any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> An investigation into whether the deputy, a 15-year veteran, was justified in  the shooting was not complete, but Jansen said it "appeared" that it was. The  deputy, who was not identified, said Matangi failed to keep his hands in his  pockets as ordered after he was stopped near the North Long Beach house.  </P> <P> Matangi, who was in good condition at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center  Tuesday with wounds to his hand, leg and stomach, told a reporter that he was  on his way home and does not know why the deputy shot him.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ion Sofroniye, Moldovan Government press </F> secretary: "Russian Has Not Renounced Imperial Claims"]    [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- The whole world knows that  there are influential forces in Russia dreaming of reviving the  USSR. THE NEW YORK TIMES recently published an article  headlined "Russian Imperialism Is Stronger Than Soviet Power,"  claiming that "Russia is striving to restore its former empire."  It was this trend that Valeriya Novodvorskaya saw and condemned  in IZVESTIYA (4 March 1994) in an article entitled "I Do Not  Love the State." Two academics dealt her a very prompt rebuff  in the same newspaper. They wrote among other things: "Were it  up to Mrs. Novodvorskaya, the Russian-speaking population of the  Dniester Region should be handed over to Romania as the People's  Front want." But what if the population does not want that?    There are a number of inaccuracies in this talk about the  Dniester Region. What is the "Russian-speaking population"? In  one of his interviews in the Moscow press, Kazakhstani President  Nursultan Nazarbayev said the following about this term: "I do  not accept the concept of `Russian-speaking population.' Which  of us is not a Russian speaker? After all, the whole of  Kazakhstan speaks Russian, including 99 percent of Kazakhs."    That is the linguistic situation in the Republic of Moldova  today, with the possible exception that 100 percent of Moldovans  here speak Russian.    Clearly, the authors of the devastating article in IZVESTIYA  were referring to the Russian population in the Dniester Region.  But in that case they should have known that the overwhelming  majority of the Republic of Moldova's Russian population live  not in the Dniester Region, in other words on the left bank, but  on the right bank of the Dniester River. If you follow the  authors' logic, the Russian population of Kishinev, Beltsy,  Bendery, and other population centers on the Right Bank are in  very great danger of being handed over to Romania. And if that  is the case, a Russian Army should be massed on the right bank  and the so-called Dniester Moldavian Republic set up. But that  is absurd!    There is a second misunderstanding. Neither Left Bank nor  Right Bank Russians, or Ukrainians, Moldovans, Gagauz, and  representatives of other nationalities are threatened with being  "handed over to Romania." Since during a 6 March 1994  sociological poll the overwhelming majority of the population of  the Republic of Moldova advocated building an independent,  integral, and indivisible state. And whereas some people  previously played on the threat of Moldova's joining another  state in order to somehow justify separatism and a foreign  army's sojourn on its territory, it is now time to renounce this  claim which is known to be false.    It is better to tell the truth, as a specialist on nearby  foreign countries did in Moscow's international newspaper  MEGAPOLIS-EXPRESS (No. 9). We quote: "The territory of the  Dniester Region (that is the eastern rayons of the Republic of  Moldova -- Author's Note) where the Russian 14th Army is  stationed is of exceptional military-strategic importance for  Russia and it therefore seems quite logical for a permanent  Russian military base to be set up there. During the special  period [osobyy period] this base will perform the function of an  advance detachment, ensuring the arrival and deployment of the  strategic grouping of Russian troops in this sector."    It is because of these aspirations, Messrs. Academics, that  Valeriya Novodvorskaya does not like the state. It is not a  question of the rights of the "Russian-speaking population,"  which no one is violating, but of Russia's special  military-strategic interests. It is necessary to call a spade a  spade; particularly for doctors of historical sciences.</p>

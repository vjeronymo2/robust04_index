			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: British banks criticise Basle proposals British banks have become the latest group to criticise proposals from international supervisors to make them set aside extra capital to cover risks in foreign exchange, securities and derivatives trading. The British Bankers' Association has told the Basle-based committee of international bank supervisors that its proposals are too conservative and will reduce banks' motivation to develop sophisticated risk management. It describes as 'deeply disappointing' and 'frankly puzzling' the fact that the proposals do not reward banks which have better monitoring systems with reduced capital charges. It also criticises the level of capital which the Basle supervisors propose should be set aside to cover equity and equity derivatives positions, and says the proposals may put banks at a competitive disadvantage to securities firms. The response follows a critical report from the Institute of International Finance, representing 175 international banks, which said that the proposals could undermine the clarity of capital rules covering credit risks. EU banks, which will have to comply with both the EU capital adequacy directive and Basle rules, will find the regulatory regime 'a bit messy' unless the two are harmonised, said the association. It is also critical of the Basle proposal for banks to make an 8 per cent capital charge for equity positions unless they are liquid and well-diversified, when the capital charge falls to 2 per cent. It says these charges - double those under the EU directive - are too conservative. A 2 per cent charge on index futures and options arbitraged against a matched cash position is described as 'certainly not justified'. The association criticises the Basle approach of adding a capital charge for market risk to that of a counterparty credit exposure, arguing that a market movement cannot simultaneously increase both types of risk. It says there is a danger that trading business will be driven to competitors 'by a regime that imposes onerous costs on the banking industry'.</p>

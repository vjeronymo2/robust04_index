			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A DECADE REVISITED;  </P> <P> ATHLETES WHO BEGAN THEIR CAREERS IN THE VALLEY OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS HAVE GONE  ON TO WIN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALS, CY YOUNG AWARDS AND WORLD BOXING TITLES. TEAM  ACHIEVEMENTS INCLUDED IMPROBABLE CHAMPIONS AND RECORD WINNING STREAKS. BUT  FIGHTS, STRIKES AND FIRINGS ALSO MADE THE NEWS  </P> <P> 1987  </P> <P> Jan was dean of the City 4-A football final and the John Clark five from Saugus  High won an improbable Southern Section basketball title.  </P> <P> As wide receiver Kyle Jan walked onto the field at East L. A. College with his  Granada Hills High football teammates, he confidently mentioned to a bystander  that the Highlanders had the City Section 4-A Division championship in the bag.  </P> <P>  Huh?  </P> <P>  Granada Hills was playing heavily favored Carson, which entered the game with  an 11-0 record and a No. 2 national ranking by USA Today. Furthermore, the  Colts already had beaten the Highlanders, 42-14, in the regular season and  56-14 in the semifinals the season before.  </P> <P> Was Jan popping off? No, more like bursting Carson's bubble. Before the game  was over, Jan was named the most valuable player by Prime Ticket after leading  the Highlanders to a 27-14 upset, giving the Valley its only City 4-A football  title of the decade.  </P> <P> Jan caught seven passes from quarterback Jeremy Leach for a game-high 93 yards  and a touchdown. While playing defensive back, he intercepted two passes by  ambidextrous Carson quarterback George Malauulu. He also set the stands ablaze  with his off-field tactics -- not that he was out of the game all that often.  </P> <P> While on the sidelines, Jan ran up the tartan track that encircles the field,  waving his arms to fire up the fans. "He was definitely into it," said Leach,  now a starter at New Mexico who played the championship game in a pair of  borrowed high-top shoes. "He went nuts."  </P> <P> He drove Malauulu nuts too. Jan, who finished the season with 65 receptions for  950 yards and 15 touchdowns, intercepted a Malauulu pass to end a drive in the  third quarter and another with 6:44 to play. Maybe Jan was practicing for his  collegiate career: Jan and Malauulu are now teammates at Arizona. Of course,  now Malauulu intends for Jan to catch the ball.  </P> <P> How big was the upset? Well, the Highlanders -- who finished 9-3 after a 2-3  start -- were a team that even a mother couldn't love.  </P> <P> "I overheard my mom say before the game that she wouldn't bet on us," Leach  said.  </P> <P>  Improbable. Unlikely. Unpredictable.  </P> <P>  A few months later, even the coach was caught up in the barrage of adjectives.  </P> <P> "Unbelievable is probably a better word," Saugus Coach John Clark admitted.  </P> <P> Headline writers all over town ran out of adjectives long before the Saugus  basketball team ran out of juice.  </P> <P> Saugus, which entered the Southern Section 3-A playoffs as a wild-card team,  reeled off win after win to become only the second team in Section history to  win a title as a wild-card entry.  </P> <P> The Centurions' title script was indeed unbelievable. Before each game, Clark  showed his players videotapes of David-and-Goliath movie fare such as "Top  Gun," "Rocky," "Victory" and "Hoosiers."  </P> <P> Led by senior forward Rusty Morse, who averaged 18 points a game, Saugus beat  cross-town rival Hart in a wild-card game, then scored victories against  second-seeded Katella, California, Tustin, Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills in  the final. Rolling Hills, the top-seeded team, was riding a 16-game win streak.  </P> <P> It didn't end there. The Centurions -- who finished 23-10 -- advanced to the  state playoffs and came within a game of the final before losing to Woodbridge  and Stanford-bound center Adam Keefe.  </P> <P> Anybody for unconscious?  </P> <P> The illustrious career of quarterback Tom Bonds ended and, for practical  purposes, Cal Lutheran's experiment with Division II football ended with it.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-10 three-time NAIA All-American was the only reason the school could  compete in the Western Football Conference. As a sophomore, Bonds passed for  2,427 yards and led CLU to a 6-5 record in its first year in Division II. As a  junior, he set NAIA and NCAA Division II records with 44 completions and 434  yards passing in a game.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran had undersized linemen and virtually a nonexistent running game,  leaving Bonds as the lone threat. Still, he finished sixth on the Division II  career passing yardage list with 7,773 and set six WFC records.  </P> <P> Bonds passed for more than 10,000 yards for Valley teams. He led Hart High to  the 1983 Coastal Conference championship in his senior year.  </P> <P> Notable: Thousand Oaks High won the Coastal Conference football championship  behind the running of Marc Monestime, who rushed for 1,596 yards and set a  Ventura County career rushing mark with 3,984 yards.  </P> <P> It was the first Southern Section football title for the Lancers. . . .  </P> <P> Pitcher-shortstop Jeff Cirillo of tiny Providence High tied a single-season  Southern Section record with 57 hits. Cirillo now plays at USC. . . .  </P> <P> Jeff Kubiak of Cal State Northridge won his seventh individual NCAA Division II  national swimming championship. . . .  </P> <P> Denise Sitton of Cal State Northridge became the school's all-time leading  scorer in women's basketball with 1,467 points. . . .  </P> <P> Quincy Watts, a Taft High junior, won state championships in the 100 (10.49)  and the 200 (20.99) and Dave Bultman of Royal won state titles in the shot put  (67-0) and discus (193-6). Watts' victories capped an undefeated season against  high school competition. . . .  </P> <P> The Cal State Northridge softball team continued its domination under Coach  Gary Torgeson by winning its fourth NCAA Division II championship in the past  five years with a 4-0 victory over Florida Southern.

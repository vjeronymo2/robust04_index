			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIX THE JOB, NOT THE WORKER;  </P> <P> LABOR: IF INDUSTRIES ARE ALLOWED TO BAR FERTILE WOMEN FROM 'DANGEROUS' JOBS,  SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY MAY FOLLOW.  </P> <P> The notion that women must be sterilized if they want to work at certain  industrial jobs seems bizarre, something from a fictional, despotic foreign  nation. Not in the United States, surely.  </P> <P> Wrong.  </P> <P> A federal appeals court has ruled that employers may bar all women of  childbearing capacity from factory jobs if the job might be hazardous to a  fetus. The bar applies whether or not women are pregnant, intend to get  pregnant or are likely to get pregnant.  </P> <P> Other courts have rejected this approach, but the new decision is likely to  encourage many employers simply to close their doors to women workers. Or women  will have choose between fertility and employment.  </P> <P> The case involves an automobile battery-making operation in which lead is used.  Workers and their union filed a sex-discrimination case claiming that it is  unjustifiable to bar women since lead is equally harmful to both sexes, most  women workers will not become pregnant and workplace health risks should be  reduced or eliminated by making the workplace safer. After all, that's what  happened when toxic chemicals like DBCP made men sterile -- the chemical was  banned, not the worker.  </P> <P> The appeals court rejected this approach in a decision that has broad  implications. According to dissenting judges, women could be excluded from 20  million industrial jobs. For unskilled women, such jobs may provide the only  escape from poverty.  </P> <P> Because they cannot afford to give up their jobs, many of these women may feel  forced into sterilization. This has already happened and it's likely to get  worse. With heavy financial responsibilities for children or elderly parents,  some women will not have a choice.  </P> <P> Employers with these policies claim that adult workers are safe at certain  exposure levels, but that no exposure is safe for a fetus. To reach this  conclusion, such employers often ignore the findings of federal health and  safety agencies and rely instead on the testimony of industry-funded  scientists. There is ample evidence that workers of both sexes exposed to lead  face health risks ranging from adverse effects on sperm (possibly affecting  future generations) to neurological damage and cardiovascular disease.  Frequently, however, employers pick and choose among studies demonstrating  lead's harmful effects to find the ones they like, usually those focusing on  pregnant women.  </P> <P> Fear of liability for fetal injury is often cited as a justification for  excluding women workers, but the concern should extend equally to both sexes.  In fact, claims on behalf of the children of male workers outnumber those filed  for children of women employees.  </P> <P> And companies that handle toxic substances face potential lawsuits from an  array of sources, not just workers. Toxic chemicals can spill in transport,  leak from disposal sites or escape into surrounding air or water. The children  of male as well as female workers may sue, alleging that a parent's workplace  exposure caused genetic injury.  </P> <P> If employers can identify fertile women as potentially "hyper-susceptible,"  then simply eliminate them to make the workplace "safe," all sorts of  discriminatory possibilities open up.  </P> <P> Some employers claim that certain genetic conditions that disproportionately  affect racial or ethnic groups can be exacerbated by toxic exposures. Will they  require genetic testing of all workers to identify those who are genetically  "hypersusceptible"? Will they then seek to bar workers on the basis of race or  ethnic origin in order to protect them or their offspring?  </P> <P> Employers who bar women would sacrifice the interests of living children and  adults for questionable gains for potential fetuses. When women encounter  reproductive (or other) risks at work, they usually worry about them a lot more  than the boss does. And they certainly are better equipped to decide whether  they should stay, request a transfer or leave.  </P></p>

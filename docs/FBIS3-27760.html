			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Is the Korean Peninsula Really in Crisis?"] </F>   [Text] The United States dispatched a state intelligence  support team to the ROK to strengthen the capability of  gathering intelligence on North Korea. Following this, it is  planning to deploy Patriot missiles to U.S. forces in the ROK  and to replace U.S. Cobra helicopters with ultramodern Apache  helicopters. The United States also plans to send an aircraft  carrier in case of an emergency. Thus, the sense of crisis on  the Korean peninsula has recently been remarkably heightened in  Washington.    As the United States and North Korea reached a basic  agreement at the end of last year on the solution of the nuclear  problem, the people believed that the crisis situation regarding  the North Korean nuclear issue was moving toward pacification.  The toughening of U.S. military measures have caused the people  to worry that the North Korean nuclear issue will not be solved  peacefully and U.S. military pressure will make the North Korean  attitude even tougher, thus leading the situation to a  catastrophe [paguk]. As we anticipated, North Korea on 28  January denounced the projected deployment of Patriot missiles  in the ROK as an "intolerable grave military challenge," and  demanded immediate cancellation of the plan.    There are many varied reasons for intensified U.S. military  measures, including the plan to deploy Patriot missiles. One is  that the measures are intended to cope with an "unpredictable  reaction" by the North Korean side in the event the UN Security  Council imposes economic and military sanctions if nuclear  inspection negotiations between North Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency are ruptured. Another is  that the measures are aimed at pushing for nuclear inspection  negotiations by pressing North Korea.    At this point, the people express worry about our  government's attitude. When North Korea announced a statement  of denunciation on 28 January, the government expressed concern  to the U.S. Government about the atmosphere prevailing in  Washington that tensions are heightened on the Korean peninsula.  The government authorities said that "the deployment of Patriot  missiles is still in the review stage after the commander of  U.S. Forces in the ROK made the request to President Clinton  late last year in order to supplement conventional fire power.  The plan to introduce Apache helicopters was decided on a few  years ago and will now be implemented." Thus, they explained  that the measures were not taken to counter movement of the  North Korean Army. The U.S. defense authorities also stated that  the current measures have nothing to do with specific deployment  of North Korean troops.    Then, we cannot but have a few questions. Why are the  deployment of Patriot missiles, Apache helicopters, and an  aircraft carrier being raised intensively at this very moment if  it is true the North Korean Army is not making any abnormal  moves? It was learned that Patriot missiles will be deployed to  U.S. military bases in Pusan, Taegu, and Kunsan in consideration  of the functions and firing range of North Korean missiles  Nodong No. 1 and 2. Thus, it is noted that the Patriot missiles  are not for the defense of the capital. The United States  insists that as long as North Korea does not fire Nodong No.1  and No.2 missiles at South Korea, the Patriot missiles deployed  to the U.S. Army will be for defense purposes. What is an issue  is that a U.S. Defense Department spokesman openly stated that  "it is the intent of the U.S. Government to willingly sell  Patriot missiles to the ROK." People pointed out that the  Patriot missiles are not adequate for Korea in view of its  mountainous terrain and that strong suspicions have been  presented concerning its accuracy. We will have to bear great  burdens if the United States turns over Patriot missiles and  ultramodern helicopters to the ROK in the future.    Generally speaking, the strengthening of U.S. military  measures against North Korea is not agreeable. In addition, our  government's attitude of appearing to be controlled by the  United States is deplorable. The government should take a firm,  independent approach as the issue of peace on the Korean  peninsula is ultimately related to the destiny of our nation.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Paraguay through 14 April.    According to the Central Bank, BCP, the drop in March's  inflation rate, which stood at 1.9 percent, shows that inflation  will continue its downward rate. The BCP believes the measures  it adopted, namely a strict control of monetary policy, and the  adjustment policy implemented by the government were  instrumental in curbing the inflationary spiral.

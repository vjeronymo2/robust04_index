			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / CBI armed for white paper war: Howard Davies' early and unusual intervention in a departmental spending row A row between the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry over spending and taxation is not something that the Confederation of British Industry would normally be involved in. Although Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, has a habit of not intervening unless he is sure of winning, he has made it clear that he will continue to act as an irritant in Whitehall and Westminster if he senses any Treasury backsliding over the white paper on competitiveness  - first announced by the DTI. Mr Davies is not about to sign up for everything the DTI does. Indeed, he took the unusual step of publicly reminding Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that the white paper, published in May, had demonstrated the need for business advice and support services as good as those available in competitor countries. This meant upgrading the services for small businesses at home and export activity abroad. Yet these are the kind of schemes that the Treasury wants scrapped. 'The whole point in having a competitiveness white paper was that it set out government policy on spending and taxation across all departments,' Mr Davies said. Yet, as he told Mr Heseltine at a CBI dinner last week, the ink was scarcely dry on the white paper before the Treasury began to throw the basis of the policy into question. Mr Davies was referring to the plans of Mr Michael Portillo, the former Treasury chief secretary, to slash the DTI budget. These plans, when leaked during the summer, caused a political row between the government's two principal heavyweights - Mr Portillo and Mr Heseltine. Mr Davies is concerned that the Treasury may feel that economic growth would enable an abandonment of the principles of the white paper. The CBI believes Britain must use the recovery phase to work on correcting four deficits: the public sector borrowing requirement, the balance of payments, the skills deficit, and the investment deficit. The first is portrayed as a government responsibility. Mr Davies believes the other three can only be solved by a partnership between the public and private sectors. 'The DTI and the CBI have shown that they are ready to develop that partnership. I hope that the rest of the government allow us to get on with it,' he said. Treasury officials have expressed surprise at the tone and content of Mr Davies' remarks. Irrespective of the help they believe the government already gives British industry, they remain adamant that the white paper does not prevent them from questioning spending. The Treasury's response may have been predictable, if not the one hoped for by the CBI, but Mr Davies has taken heart from comments by Mr Heseltine that the white paper represented the policy of the whole government. 'This (assurance) is what we wanted to hear,' Mr Davies said, an assertion that the Treasury did not dispute. But although the CBI was on the winning side in the latest departmental battle it will not be clear who has won the war until after the latest spending round.</p>

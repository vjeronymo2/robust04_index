			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist </F> Party of the Russian Federation, conducted by Yevgeniya  Pishchikova: "The `Red' and `White' of the Party Bottling"]    [Text] "By reuniting the `red' ideal of social  justice, which is a sort of earthly hypostasis of the `heavenly'  truth which states that `all are equal before God,' with the  `white' ideal of a nationally expressed statehood perceived as a  form of existence of centuries-old people's sanctities, Russia  will finally attain what it has longed for... inter-class accord  and the might of a great power." ...Gennadiy Zyuganov    The meeting in the staff headquarters of the Communist Party  of the Russian Federation (CPRF) has just ended. The first  immodest impression of the party departure is the impression of  extreme respectability. The two rooms of the hotel suite (the  CPRF, like other influential parliamentary parties, lives its  political life in "Mir") are filled with people in well-cut  suits, with expensive "diplomats" [briefcases] in their hands.  There are no stretched-out sweaters, no overalls, no first  meetings of the "demrosses" [Demrossiya members], no young  fellows with rolled-up sleeves, the true followers of the  insurgent Anpilov. The CPRF, the party of Zyuganov, has  successfully come to relative power bypassing the catacomb  period of the communist congresses in the village of Voronovo  and sidestepping the military actions of the October days. The  communists of Zyuganov look so much like the leading detachment  of the "new Russians" that it is possible to avoid base  parallels by only one method--by remembering that the  respectable part of the "new Russians" looks very much like the  communists of bygone times who reached well-known heights.    In the staff headquarters itself there is a mixture of that  which before was incompatible. The old and the new. Although the  furnishings are rented, they may fully serve as the real symbol  of the CPRF ideology. Crystal chandeliers of the "lieutenant, do  not touch the candelabra" style and worn carpets--the  traditional interior of socialist party apartments--are livened  up by designer office furniture of a "wet asphalt" hue. This is  the popular color for the expensive Mercedes and Zhiguli 99  model. On the splendid table is a stack of papers. In bold  letters, the address is indicated on the top one: To the Central  Committee. The signature--a group of communists. The document  has an air of the calm associated with verticality of power  about it. After all, if the note is directed to the Central  Committee, that means it will necessarily be reviewed and  discussed...    Most political experts evaluate the communist party of  Zyuganov as the most civilized of all the communist parties of  Russia (at the present time there are five of them). It can be  compromised with (the Zyuganov followers are sooner socialists  than communists)--that is the approximate consensus opinion of  journalists. The CPRF tried on for size the general line Deng  Xiaoping--after all, they too agree to tolerate different forms  of ownership. They have been compared with the party of  Brazauskas in Lithuania--ultimately, the ideals of social  justice are good in themselves, but when politicians of this  type come to power, they suddenly remember that there are never  enough sweet cakes to go around for all.    Gennadiy Andreyevich Zyuganov himself does not create the  impression of an exhausted man, even though his political life  is extremely active and eventful. And also not devoid of  problems. He was, naturally, a fervent supporter of liberation  of the October political prisoners, but now he cannot help but  understand that, after the amazing (from the words "to amaze")  victory in the Duma, his party is once again entering a phase of  quiet factional struggle. Which does not facilitate unity of the  ranks. Nevertheless, Zyuganov is full of ideas and energy--a  serious contrast to the political leaders of the democratic  wave, who are unable to conceal their fatigue and a certain  devastation. Evidently, the end of the century, which is  developing a certain set of ideas without offering any new ones  in their stead, has little effect on the communists. They  continue to believe that they have something new to offer the  people.    In response to the question of what his attitude is toward  power, Gennadiy Andreyevich Zyuganov said that he takes it  seriously. His set of ideas--a synthesis of Khomyakov,  Berdyayev, Gennadiy Zyuganov, the Sermon on the Mount and Karl  Marx--seems absolutely viable to him. And here is the most  interesting thing: This set of ideas really is current. And  interesting--just as any medley is more interesting than a  single ingredient taken alone.    [Zyuganov] "Power is a totally nonsynonymous concept," says  Zyuganov. "There is civil power, which is spread to the entire  Western part of the world--that is the power of law. There is  the power of traditions, the power of ideas, the power of the  ideal, perhaps even the power of prejudice--this power is  understandable and dear to our country. And he who does not  sense this will not achieve much in it. There is also a new  power. It is not the fourth power, as it is interpreted, but  rather informational power. This is a power which has become  quite enraged in Russia. Without completely understanding what  it is doing, it is predetermining the outcome of an entire  series of vital events taking place in the country. There is  also the power of money. Both informational and monetary power,  mixed in known proportions, possess a destructive force greater  than that of a thermonuclear weapon. Specifically this is a  weapon--an informational-financial weapon, and it has become  primary in the destruction of the great geopolitical formation  which was the Soviet Union."    [Correspondent] For Zyuganov, as for most opposition  leaders,  the disintegration of the Union is the point of countdown for  catastrophe. And for the civil war, which, in the opinion of  Gennadiy Andreyevich, began long ago. Now his task (and  certainly not the concern of the currently functioning  government) is to extinguish the fire of civil war, and to turn  those who set it toward compromise. Understandably, the  government must also agree to compromise. And it, partially, has  already set off in this direction. However, the CPRF cannot have  a complete merging and civic accord with the "democrats." This  is not difficult to figure out if, together with Gennadiy  Andreyevich, we turn to the history of our country's shocking  events. Particularly since a number of articles have been  devoted to these questions in the recently published book,  "Derzhava" ["Great Power"].    [G. Zyuganov] ...In fact, for the entire duration of the  Soviet period of history, there were not one, but two parties in  the USSR, and there was a stubborn struggle going on between  them, which did not subside for even a moment... The first party  may conditionally be called the party of "our country."  Sholokhov and Korolev, Zhukov, Gagarin, Kurchatov and Stakhanov  belonged to it. It included a large part of the leaders and  party apparatchiks, who toiled unyieldingly during the country's  most difficult days... However, there was also another  party--the party of "that country." Numerically it did not  compare in the least with the former, but its political weight  and influence in the higher echelons of power were  disproportionately great, and often decisive. It included those  for whom "that" country and "those" people were merely an arena  for realization of their own ambitions and vain aspirations.  This was the party of Trotsky and Kaganovich, Beria and Mekhlis,  Gorbachev and Yeltsin, Yakovlev and Shevardnadze. Its rightful  heritage today is "Demrossiya," and we do not want to have  anything to do with this party. (Yet just try to tell the  "Demrossiya" followers that they are the successors of the  CPSU--they would faint dead away..Ye. P.).    By the mid-80's, such a situation was objectively formed  within the party when the "change of generations"... inevitably  would have brought to power politicians of the new formation,  who gravitated toward national-state great power ideals. It is  not difficult to imagine how such a possibility frightened our  foreign and domestic ill-wishers! (And here they are--the  ill-wishers--Ye. P.)...    After World War II, the scientific-technical revolution  brought mankind to the technological boundary which made it  possible to ensure global control over its development...    There is nothing remarkable about the fact that this evoked  a  sharp activization of the transnational, cosmopolitical forces  which were striving to realize such possibilities in a concrete  geopolitical form of a world super-state. This superstructure  must, according to the idea of its developers, gradually swallow  up the national sovereign states.    Practical work on creating such a center began long ago!    The developed capitalist countries readily support the idea  of creating a "new world order" (NWO), within the framework of  which they hope to retain and strengthen their leading position.    The model of a unified world economy within the framework of  the NWO presupposes different levels of consumption for its  component parts. Certain regions would continue to prosper,  while the development of others would be artificially frozen.  Need we say what category Russia will find itself in under such  a "division of labor?"    [Correspondent] What awaits us in the nearest future?    [Zyuganov] In principle, there are two possible variants of  behavior under the conditions which have been created. The  first--to accept the rules of the game which have been imposed  upon us and to fight for increasing the vital "quotas" within  the framework of the mondialist scheme of world development.    The second variant presupposes that Russia will accept that  historical challenge with which our people are faced today, will  not reconcile itself to the coming enslavement and will try to  recapture its former role as a great power.    For this, it is first of all necessary to restore the  historical continuity of Russian statehood and our country's  spirituality. At the same time, we must keep in mind that the  current Russian Federation is not yet fully Russia, but an  amputated appendage with torn and bleeding ties. Without a  rebirth of the Union on a new basis of free and voluntary choice  of the peoples (yet it seems to us they have already made their  choice--Ye. P.), without the reunification of the currently  divided Russian people, our state will not get up off of its  knees.    [Correspondent] In the opinion of Gennadiy Andreyevich, the  two revolutions of the 90's were also rehearsed. These were  gigantic actions aimed at washing out of the government  structures all persons who placed the triumph of Russian  statehood above the needs and demands of the International  Monetary Fund. The scenario for both operations was the same:  All the politicians and honest citizens who are dissatisfied  with the course of reform are accumulated around the center,  which with the aid of manipulation of public opinion is declared  strictly harmful (in the first case--the party, in the  second--the parliament). They are specially insulted, provoked  into ill-planned response moves, and then "duped." The victory  of democracy is celebrated. At the same time, the conductors  (Gorbachev, Yeltsin), do not fully realize that they too are  being manipulated. In principle, they are interesting only as a  symbol, and at the first opportunity--they are replaceable.    Terrible things are happening around these symbols.    [Zyuganov] ...I will not even mention the fact that the  reformers have outsmarted themselves. They knowingly attracted  the criminal element to break the Soviet economy. By selecting  the formula, "dismantling through pilferage." But now the genie  does not want to go back into the bottle. ...It has become so  strong in Russia that not only has it gone out of control, but  it has also become an important subject of politics--a third  power which does not fit into any schemes of the IMF. Today its  effect on all processes is huge, and the continuation of reforms  according to the former scheme will inevitably lead to the  emergence of an entirely new formation on earth--a criminal  de-ideologized power with totally unlimited repressions within  the country and nuclear blackmail of the entire world... The  criminal revolution is taking place. The regime either does not  want to or is incapable to counteracting it. And the blindness  of the intelligentsia is amazing, their eyes covered over with  the liberal utopia.    [Correspondent] Gennadiy Andreyevich, you of course heard  Yeltsin's speech (which included also the struggle with criminal  structures). However...    [Zyuganov] It is not even a question of the fact that, when  I  heard the speech, it reminded me of our materials of three years  ago. You got the feeling that he had spent a long time in a  lethargic sleep or had been on another planet and suddenly  returned: "Good heavens, it turns out that crime is rampant." At  the same time, one night 130,000 associates of state security  are being dismissed (that is what it said on the dictaphone  tape--Ye. P.), and the structure practically ceases to exist.  This is madness! There are two major sections there--on fighting  corruption, organized crime and banditism--and this work has  been paralyzed throughout the entire country. It is quite  understandable why this was done--there are too many documents  there on those who rule. It is necessary to transfer them, the  documents, to other hands and destroy them. However, there is a  peculiarity in state security--materials do not disappear  without a trace.    [Correspondent] How would Zyuganov solve this problem if he  had power?    [Zyuganov] There has been ample experience of this type in  our country. There is experience in mobilization of the economy,  experience in the state of emergency, experience when five  million soldiers were demobilized in several years and all were  found employment and placed without any nervous shock. However,  the current authorities are afraid to turn to this experience,  because its vehicles are the leaders and members of the CPSU.    [Correspondent] In response to the question: Can the  communist party today present a clear-cut program which the  people can understand, i.e., can it utilize the effect of  Ulyanov-Zhirinovskiy, Gennadiy Andreyevich answers immediately:    [Zyuganov] Today the party cannot present such simple and  energetic slogans as in 1917. There are no simple solutions in  today's Russia. In short: A change of course is needed. We must  have a professional government. We must return Russia to its  geopolitical boundaries--not by means of war, but by means of  gradual restoration of all ties. In general, these are strictly  all-national things.    I have thought about the fact that I could become president.  The leader of a large parliamentary party (and yesterday at the  meeting even Shumeyko admitted that the communist party is one  of the most authoritative) cannot exclude such a possibility. If  the party deems it necessary and the circumstances are  right--well... Although I am opposed to the institution of the  presidency itself.    [Correspondent] Here is Gennadiy Andreyevich's prediction in  the case if the evolutionary transition from a government of  radicals to a government of new wave communists does not occur:    [Zyuganov] A regional stratification of Russia is going on.  The severity of the crisis is being thrown into the agrarian  regions and those whose products do not go for export. Russia is  ever more reproducing the system of "first world--third world,"  with a specific enclave which is becoming ever richer--Moscow,  where the commercial and bank capital and the bureaucracy are  concentrated. In order to support such an explosive system, we  need a roll-back not simply to the command dictate, but to the  archaic forms of existence. Moscow is introducing the visa  regimen, and militia guards will collect duty at the city gates  from citizens wishing to visit the capital. Well, is this not  the early middle ages?!    [Correspondent] There has been an acute desire to restore  the  disintegrated connection of the times (this is one of the  methods of assimilating the world, especially by any new  communists). And they have restored it:    Now it is night in the courtyard. It is dark, not a  soul anywhere. I write... But on the desk is a new appeal:  "Comrades, come to your senses. We are bringing you the true  light of socialism! Leave your drunken gangs, conquer the  parasites once and for all! Leave the suffocator of the popular  masses, the former excise advisor Grigoryev! He is suffering  from a bout of hard drinking. He is a hireling of the Entente,  and has a house in Yelizavetgrad!" This is 1920, Bunin, "The  Accursed Days."</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Mercedes to buy 31% of Avia MERCEDES-BENZ, the German car, truck and bus maker is taking a 31 per cent stake in Avia, Czechoslovakia's third largest truck company. The deal, the group's first significant move into eastern Europe, appears to confirm the skill of German companies in beating competitors in the race to acquire Czechoslovak companies. Mercedes, part of the Daimler-Benz group, was chosen to partner Avia over Renault of France after 18 months of negotiations. The French carmaker recently lost a bitter contest for control of the local carmaker Skoda which was won by Volkswagen. Siemens was last year chosen to partner Czechoslovakia's largest engineering firm, Skoda-Pilsen, beating Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Scandinavian power group and Westinghouse of the US. Mercedes planned to increase its shareholding in Avia to a 'significant majority stake' over the next three years, said Mr Vlastimil Devera, Avia's chairman. Mercedes will invest DM350m (Pounds 121.9m) over the next three years in Avia's most profitable plant in Letnany, a suburb of Prague. A further DM100m investment is planned from 1995 to 1998. Avia is Czechoslovakia's third largest truck company, with a 1991 turnover of Kcs4.1bn (Pounds 74.7m). Mercedes intends to phase out Avia's production of small trucks, which average about 17,000 a year and are built under a 1967 licence from Saviem, now part of Renault. Mercedes will instead manufacture two versions of its light and medium trucks. Final approval for the deal must come from the Czechoslovak government before March 30. Under Czechoslovakia's large-scale privatisation programme, other competitive bids can still be submitted up to January 20, which explains reluctance to disclose the price for the share in Avia. If the deal is approved the venture would be created in July. The country's two other truck companies, Liaz and Tatra Trucks, have begun negotiations with potential foreign partners including Mercedes, Renault and Iveco of Italy. Mercedes could be a joint-venture partner in Liaz or Tatra Trucks. The German group has also shown interest in acquiring control of Karosa, the Czechoslovak bus and fire engines manufacturer in eastern Bohemia.</p>

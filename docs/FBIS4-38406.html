			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and  National Bank of Ukraine [NBU] adopted a joint resolution on 28  May "On the Withdrawal from Circulation of Coupons with a  Nominal Value of 10 and 25 Karbovantsi." Proceeding from the  inexpediency of further using these banknotes in cash settlement  operations, the Cabinet of Ministers and the NBU have obliged  regional boards of the NBU and commercial banks to ensure that  the 10 and 25 karbovantsi banknotes are withdrawn from  circulation by 1 August. Banknotes that have been withdrawn  will be kept in regional NBU branches until the NBU decides on  the issue of their recovery. The banknotes remain legal tender  by all entities of entrepreneurial activity, regardless of their  form of activity, by banks, and by enterprises of the Ministry  of Communications until the time limit determined by the  resolution. The resolution says that in connection with this,  from 1 June the setting of retail prices for goods, services,  and works should be carried out in figures that are a multiple  of 50.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN HEARING DEFICIT ALARMS, WE TURN A DEAF EAR TO SOME POSITIVE POINTS  </P> <P> While it's true that the deficit twins -- the budget deficit and the trade  deficit -- are important, the degree of concern currently expressed about them  is exaggerated. Failure to reduce, let alone eliminate, the deficits may be  imprudent. It would not be a disaster. The budget deficit is actually a less  serious problem than is commonly assumed, and the trade deficit is already in  the process of downward, if admittedly uneven, adjustment.  </P> <P> Three extenuating considerations are usually overlooked in the exaggerated  rhetoric about the budget deficit. First, from the standpoint of the effects of  budget deficits on credit markets and the international accounts, what matters  is the consolidated budgets of the states as well as the federal government,  not the federal budget alone. Because the states have amassed a substantial  aggregate budget surplus in recent years, the consolidated deficit shrinks by  $50 billion to $60 billion annually. Thus, the consolidated budget deficit for  1988 is about $100 billion, or about 2% of the U.S. gross national product -- a  figure not out of line with comparable figures in Japan, West Germany or  Britain in recent years.  </P> <P> Second, the federal budget deficit exercises a braking effect on the otherwise  strong political pressures in a pluralistic democracy for government spending  to rise. In general, there is a small negative, but statistically significant,  relationship between the size of the federal deficit in one year and the  increase in federal spending in the succeeding year, net of inflation and net  of debt service: A higher deficit in one year generally means a smaller  increase than would otherwise occur in federal spending in the following year.  </P> <P> Finally, there is a substantial component of capital formation in federal  government spending. Robert Eisner of Northwestern University has estimated  this component at between $100 billion and $250 billion annually -- the higher  figure includes military procurement and military R&amp;D. It is not  inappropriate to finance genuine and productive public infrastructure by  government borrowing, because the infrastructure contributes to improved  functioning of the economy and to widening the tax base, provided the capital  expenditures have been wisely selected in the first place.  </P> <P> Of course, there remain good reasons for wanting to see the budget deficit  reduced: for example, to keep interest rates down, to damp inflationary  expectations, to restore fiscal policy as a credible instrument for countering  recessions and, finally, to convey -- internationally as well as domestically  -- the image of a responsible government that lives within its means. But these  reasons are not matters of urgency, but rather of degree and of timing.  </P> <P> Turning to the other twin, there are encouraging signs that the trade deficit  is already diminishing under the impact of two powerful market forces: the  lowered exchange value of the dollar, and the discipline imposed on U.S.  producers by having to compete for market share with foreign imports in the  United States, and with foreign products in world export markets. As a result,  the trade deficit in 1988 was about $20 billion below the approximate  $152-billion deficit of 1987. By 1989, that figure will probably decrease by  another $10 billion or more.  </P> <P> As the U.S. trade deficit declines, the adjustment problem this will create for  the rest of the world will probably be considerably greater than that for the  U.S. economy. It is too easy for our friends in Western Europe and East Asia to  forget that, for the U.S. trade deficit to diminish, the trade surpluses of  other countries -- especially Japan, West Germany and the Asian newly  industrialized countries -- will have to decline; or they and other countries  will have to experience trade deficits, or some combination of the two will  have to occur. One finds much more criticism these days from European and Asian  governments concerning the need for America to "do something about its trade  deficit," than recognition of what this implies for their own economies. And  these implications remain whether the U.S. trade deficit is reduced by actions  that affect the U.S. budget deficit, the U.S. savings rate or U.S. investment.  </P> <P> This prospect could be adversely affected by one development that has generally  been overlooked. The attractiveness of U.S. assets, including real property, to  foreign investors may propel a continued strong desire by foreigners to invest  in the United States, in the process raise the dollar's value and impede the  downward adjustment of the U.S. trade deficit. It is worth bearing in mind that  capital flows can generate a trade deficit, rather than being generated by it.  </P> <P> In sum, neither deficit warrants alarm. The federal budget and the trade  accounts are less significant indicators of the economy's health than are the  maintenance of sustained real economic growth, high employment and low  inflation.  </P></p>

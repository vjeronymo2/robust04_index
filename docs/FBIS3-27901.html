The decision was made at a meeting of  working-level officials from relevant government offices. It  was presided over by Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong.    The meeting did not set the time of China trip  liberalization, but an informed source said the time would  possibly be two months later, the end of March.    "At the meeting, attendees agreed to liberalize South  Koreans' travels to China at the soonest early date and left the  determining of the time to the Foreign Ministry," an official  said. He added that to facilitate free trips to China, there  should first be some security precautionary measures such as  steps to keep people from illegally entering North Korea by way  of China.    "Given the time needed to prepare such steps, we believe  travels to China could be liberalized toward the end of March,"  he said.    Presently, a person wishing to visit China, Cuba, Laos or  Cambodia should obtain an invitation from an organization or  firm of the country he likes to visit and then obtain a  government permit to go.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: WestLB ahead at DM481m Group earnings at WestLB, the largest German public-sector bank, rose 106 per cent to DM481m (Dollars 289.7m) in 1993, following the first-time consolidation of the Thomas Cook group and the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz. Mr Friedel Neuber, chief executive, said: '1993 was an exceptional year in terms of earnings, a result which cannot be repeated very quickly.' He added that the first quarter of 1994 had been 'satisfactory', although operating profits of DM142m were 9 per cent below last year's levels. Mr Neuber forecast the bank would present 'satisfactory' 1994 results due to 'a more positive economy and our good condition'. About a third of 1993 profits came from foreign business. The group plans to expand its operations in Asia and eastern Europe in the coming year. The bank plans to concentrate its property interests in Immobilienbank, to be headquartered in Mainz and run jointly with SudwestLB and the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz. WestLB said it had lost DM140m in two developments run by Mr Jurgen Schneider's property group. However, the 'risks had been adequately covered', the bank said. Although Mr Neuber said Germany was pulling out of an 18-month recession, the bank raised bad-loans provisions in 1993 by 35 per cent to DM973m. Earnings at the bank rose 48 per cent to DM1.281m and profit from trading on its own account 34.5 per cent to DM398m. Before provisions, operating profit rose 66.1 per cent to DM1.767bn, up from DM1.064bn the year before.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Leading Article: BT's charges THERE ARE encouraging signs that BT, the UK's privatised telecommunications company, is now responding intelligently to the challenge of greater competition. The package of price changes announced yesterday suggests that BT is developing a more market-oriented strategy, designed to build its business in an industrial sector which is due for expansion, rather than simply to exploit its near-monopoly position. The package is largely aimed at persuading customers to make greater use of their telephones, used for just four minutes a day in the UK compared with six minutes in the US. Call charges are to be frozen or cut, with a modest increase in line rentals to reflect the actual incidence of BT's costs. There will be more generous discounts for big users, domestic and business, with special deals for larger business users. More interesting, BT is beginning to explore the scope for increasing revenues through much larger price cuts. The Sunday special experiment, which offers trunk calls at local rates between 3pm and midnight on Sundays, has doubled call volumes. A similar exercise will cut call charges to Europe in January. There are indications that BT is considering price cuts in the future greater than those required by Oftel, the regulator. All of this is designed to fend off increasing competition from Mercury, the cable companies and other operators. Next year, it will be possible to access BT's competitors without a special telephone, and eventually users will have portable numbers they can use on any network. BT can no longer expect to dominate the market by its control of most of the local network, and yesterday's package reflects the realisation that the company must win business in a more competitive environment. This new approach is a reaction to the success of regulation in opening the industry up to competition, through interconnection of networks and open access. And the requirement on BT to separate the accounts of its various businesses will make it easier for competitors to bid for parts of the market. The threat to BT's core business has led to long-overdue management changes and an extensive cost-cutting exercise which is now bearing fruit. It is, however, too soon to pension off the regulator. A further tightening of the price cap may be necessary when it is next reviewed - BT's profitability is holding up well in the recession. A regulator is also needed to protect BT's competitors from predatory pricing. And the interests of special groups of users must be protected. (Oftel persuaded BT to introduce a special tariff for low-use customers such as the elderly.) BT will retain its dominant position in the industry for the foreseeable future and only active and tough regulation can ensure that this position is not abused.</p>

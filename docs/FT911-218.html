			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Indian Elections: Hindu party's rise unsettles Moslem north  -There is a tangible sense of fear in the towns of Uttar Pradesh Around the white-washed village mosques of northern India and in the densely populated Moslem areas of the main towns, there is a tangible sense of fear as this election campaign enters its final phase. Maulana Mannan Raza Khan, a Moslem cleric in Bareilly, a market town in central Uttar Pradesh where 25 per cent of the population is Moslem, says Moslems are beginning to ask themselves whether they should stay in the area or leave for the duration of the election. What seemed scarcely conceivable a few weeks ago has now become a distinct possibility. The Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), campaigning on a platform of establishing a Hindu state, has generated such a wave of support that it could emerge as the single largest party in next week's polls. In Uttar Pradesh, the largest state of the union and the traditional barometer of electoral swings, Mr Rajiv's Gandhi's Congress party seems everywhere on the defensive. By contrast, local BJP officials are triumphantly self- confident. 'There is a wave sweeping in our favour,' says a party worker at Bara Banki, near Lucknow, a constituency with no previous record of returning the Hindu revivalist party. A BJP-led government is still the less likely outcome to this election. But the pace of the party's advance has caught Moslems off balance and for the first time faced them with the prospect of a party coming to power on a platform that they feel threatens their religious and cultural identity. Moslems account for 12 per cent of India's population or more than 100m people. 'If the BJP comes to power and implements the policies in its manifesto', says Dr Kalbe Sadiq, the leader of the Shia community in Lucknow and a senior Moslem known for his moderation, 'then we will have to protect our identity and the basic fundamentals of Islam.' A central plank of the manifesto is the BJP's pledge to push ahead with the construction of a Hindu temple at Ayodhya on the site of a former mosque. The building of the temple has become a symbol of confrontation with Islam. Another commitment is the introduction of a uniform civil code which would replace Islamic personal law. Other Moslem clerics are far more belligerent. 'Moslems cannot live in a Hindu rashtra (state),' says Maulana Raza Khan. 'We would have to fight - to issue a fatwa (decree) for a crusade.' This election is witnessing a greater polarisation between Hindus and Moslems than any previous campaign. As Hindu votes in the north gravitate towards the BJP, Moslem votes are swinging to what seems the party best placed in any one constituency to defeat it. The Congress party had hoped to benefit from a consolidation of the Moslem vote against the BJP. But in many constituencies the Janata Dal or the Communists are the main challengers. The Moslem vote is thus divided - with the BJP reaping the benefit. Moslems hope that if the BJP did come to power, reason would prevail, and that a repetition of the Hindu-Moslem violence that has cost more than 2,000 lives in the past year can be avoided. 'We feel no hate for Hindus,' say Moslem villagers at Bhojpuri, near Bareilly. They point to the Brahmin families in the village who in the past have protected them at times of communal tension. Many orthodox, middle-class Hindus, who for the first time are backing the BJP because of their disillusionment with the other parties, have also convinced themselves that the BJP in power would not implement the controversial parts of its programme. Nonetheless this campaign is sowing seeds of religious hatred that will be difficult to remove. In the shade of a mango orchard on the edge of Bhojpuri, a local leader of the Hindu extremist RSS movement - the parent organisation of the BJP - blames Moslems for the secessionist movements in Kashmir, Assam and Punjab. 'Why is it,' he asks his audience, 'that wherever there are Moslems there is a demand for a separate state?' Some Moslems concede that the Moslem community itself must bear much of the blame for Hindu resentment and anger. Hindus feel that Moslems are dragging down the country's economic growth by higher rates of illiteracy and population growth. Dr Kalbe says that Islamic doctrine permits certain types of family planning. But most Moslem clerics in India are adamantly opposed to it. Even if the BJP emerges with the most seats, Moslems hope that other parties will ally to prevent it coming to power. But they feel a reprieve may be only temporary.</p>

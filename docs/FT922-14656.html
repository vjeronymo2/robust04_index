			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Petrocon's appeal over Wilkes bid rejected JAMES WILKES last night successfully escaped the clutches of rival engineering group Petrocon after the Takeover Panel rejected an appeal to have the Pounds 35m bid extended, writes Richard Gourlay. The panel found that new information given to only certain Wilkes shareholders was not material in the context of the offer. The bid should therefore lapse. The bid closed on Monday but Petrocon and Robert Fleming, its adviser, appealed first to the executive committee and then to the full Panel. Edinburgh Fund Managers, one of the shareholders, which received new information decided on March 27 not to support Petrocon. It had been among shareholders which had supported the Petrocon bid in an unusual public letter. The new information concerned statements by Mr Arthur Watts, Wilkes chairman, and Rowe Pitman, the brokers, that two executive directors would 'probably leave within the next few months'. Mr Oliver Ellingham, a director of Robert Fleming, said: 'We considered that the departure of the finance director and one other director, comprising one third of the board was important information for shareholders.' Despite rejecting the appeal, the Panel reinforced the rule that no new information and no new significant opinions should be aired to selected shareholders during the course of a bid.</p>

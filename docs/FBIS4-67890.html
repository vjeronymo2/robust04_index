			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yi Chang-min from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] Quoting the U.S. military and aviation journal, AIR  SPACE DAILY, in a report dispatched from Washington, Japan's  SANKEI SHIMBUN reported on 23 April that soon after developing  the Nodong No. 1 missile, North Korea is developing a new  missile which has a shooting range of up to 6,000 km.    According to SANKEI SHIMBUN, there are two types of the new  missile. This was discovered in February at the North Korean  Sannudong Research Development Institute through the U.S.  reconnaissance satellite. Each type consists of two-stage  rockets [kakkak idanisikuro toeoitta].    The U.S. intelligence authorities stated that the new  missile  was named, Taepodong-1 and Taepodong-2. They estimate that the  first stage is 18 m long and its diameter is 2.4 m and the  second stage is 14 m long and its diameter is 1.3 m.    SANKEI SHIMBUN reported: ``If the shooting range is 6,000  km,  Guam as well as all of Japan, including Okinawa, can be a  target. AIR SPACE DAILY reported that if North Korea is  successful in developing this missile, it will emerge as a big  military power in the East Asian region.''    SANKEI SHIMBUN also reported: ``Great Britain's military  journal, JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY, reported that the missile North  Korea is developing has a shooting range of over 2,000 km.  However, this is the first time it is revealed that its  shooting range is in fact 6,000 km. If North Korea completes the  development of this missile, the entire East Asian region would  be greatly threatened.''</p>

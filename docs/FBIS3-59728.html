Introduction </H5>   Concerning the problem of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; , several studies on  the feasibility of the direct removal of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  from  fossil fuel power plants have appeared&lt;sup&gt; 1)&lt;/sup&gt; . As a  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  removal technology, one which comes to our mind  involves techniques of low-temperature processing, absorption,  adsorption, and membrane separation. In this report, we deal  with a system designed to absorb and remove CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  by  using a combination of hollow fiber membrane and liquid  absorbent and to recycle the liquid absorbent through the use of  the conventional heat dissipation type recycling method. This  method has found its application in the fields of study of  medicine, artificial lungs&lt;sup&gt; 2)&lt;/sup&gt; , and the closed system  of the universe&lt;sup&gt; 3),4)&lt;/sup&gt; , as well as in the basic  research of the various types of gases&lt;inf&gt; 5),8)&lt;/inf&gt; .  Recently, its application has been extended to the field of  research aimed at removing CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; &lt;sup&gt; 9-13)&lt;/sup&gt; . In  our previous report, we covered the analysis of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  mechanisms, selection of liquid absorbent, the evaluation of  various types of membranes by absorption tests using hydrophobic  porous membrane materials, and a test combined with a recycling  part designed to verify the possibility of developing this  method into a system. Also reported was the result of basic test  we conducted using the direct current small module, constituting  a film module used in the actual equipment--namely, the  high-efficiency removal of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  and reduction in  absorption component size. In this report, we will deal with  results of the evaluation test aimed at improved performance and  durability of the membrane, which plays a central role in this  method and of feasibility study when this method was applied to  the actual machine.  <H5>  2. Experiment </H5>   In our previous report, we pointed out that the porous  material's mass transfer coefficient is approximately 10 times  larger than that of the composite membrane, and, therefore, the  porous membranes are more suited to our  system&lt;sup&gt; 12,13)&lt;/sup&gt; . In this report, we examined the  optimization of the porous membrane and its durability.  Moreover, in order to provide a clear picture of the  characteristics of the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system, we conducted  an experiment on CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -N&lt;inf&gt; a&lt;/inf&gt; OH system.  <H5>  2.1. Experimental Equipment </H5>   We used the nine types of porous membranes shown in Table 1  as specimen membranes. They consist of Membrane No.1  polypropylene(PP) and Nos. 2-5, polyethylene (PE), used as  specimen mainly in the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; NaOH system experiment;  Nos. 6-8 membranes polytetrafuloroethylene (PTFE); and No.9  membrane, a surface-reformed PE membrane produced by applying  the coating of fluorine group monomers, mainly used as a  specimen for CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system. For a specimen gas,  assuming the use of coal firing, we used a cylinder gas  (consisting of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; =15&percnt;, O&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; =5&percnt;, and  N=80&percnt;) saturated with moisture. Temperatures used in  experiments were 50&deg;C for membrane durability test and  25&deg;C for the optimization test of porous material membranes,  because of the availability of abundant material property data  when we wish to make comparison with the previous report or to  conduct analysis. Moreover, for this experiment, we used the  equipment shown in the previous report&lt;sup&gt; 11-13)&lt;/sup&gt; ,  together with its method of testing and measurement.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-53A>             Table 1. Specimen Membranes </FIG>      <H5>    2.2 Results and Considerations </H5>   (1) Optimization of Porous Membrane    The main factors related to transfer properties of the  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -NEA system requiring our consideration are  membrane thickness &dgr;, hole ratio &egr;, and hollow fiber  diameter d&lt;inf&gt; i&lt;/inf&gt; . Of these, since d&lt;inf&gt; i&lt;/inf&gt;  is  determined principally from the standpoint of resistance to  liquid flow and increase in temperature by reaction heat, and  separated from the transfer characteristics, this paper will  deal with only the effects of &dgr; and &egr;.    1) Membrane Thickness &dgr;    The resistance of porous gas membrane is given in the  following equation:    (1) R&lt;inf&gt; M&lt;/inf&gt; =(k&lt;inf&gt; M&lt;/inf&gt;  x  d&lt;inf&gt; 0&lt;/inf&gt; /d&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; &lt;sup&gt; -1&lt;/sup&gt;    The material transfer coefficient of the gas membrane,  K&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  is written as follows:    (2) k&lt;inf&gt; M&lt;/inf&gt; =D&lt;inf&gt; G&lt;/inf&gt;  x &egr;/(&dgr; x &khgr;)    We conclude from equations (1) and (2) that the smaller the  &dgr;, the smaller the R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  will become,. However, if  this is to be evaluated by the experiment, it is necessary to  have a membrane with a constant &egr; and a variable &dgr;. It  will  be extremely difficult to obtain such a membrane; moreover, what  actually matters is the ratio of R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  to the entire  resistance R&lt;inf&gt; &tgr;&lt;/inf&gt;  shown in the following equation:    (3) R&lt;inf&gt; T&lt;/inf&gt; =(K&lt;inf&gt; exp&lt;/inf&gt;  x H)&lt;sup&gt; -1&lt;/sup&gt;    Consequently, we computed R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt; /R&lt;inf&gt; &tgr;&lt;/inf&gt;  of  highly porous membranes Nos. 6-9 in order to obtain their  relationship with &dgr;. Moreover, in Equation (3),  K&lt;inf&gt; exp&lt;/inf&gt;  is an experimental value of an overall material  transfer coefficient K of the inside diameter, and H denotes a  henry constant of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system. Using the  following equation&lt;sup&gt; 14)&lt;/sup&gt; , we used the compensated  H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O's henry constant H&lt;inf&gt; w&lt;/inf&gt; :    (4)  log(C&lt;inf&gt; A&lt;/inf&gt; /C&lt;inf&gt; AW&lt;/inf&gt; =0.3C&lt;inf&gt; B&lt;/inf&gt; (1+xC&lt;inf&gt; B&lt;/inf&gt;    In this equation, for &kgr; we used value 0.95 contained in  the  reference source&lt;sup&gt; 14)&lt;/sup&gt; , and for bending ratio x in Eq.  (2), also using the reference source&lt;sup&gt; 15)&lt;/sup&gt; , we assigned  3.0 to bending ratio x in Eq. (2).    Results of computations are shown in Table 2. R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  of the membrane No. 8, characterized by a large :gd (350&mgr;m)  and small &egr;, is 96.6s/m, while R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  of the membrane  No. 9, characterized by small &dgr;, viz., 120&mgr;m, and large  &egr;,  viz., 0.8, is 18.4s/m. The former is approximately 5 times the  latter. However, the ratio of R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  to the total amount  of resistance ([R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt; /Rt]x100) in the case of membrane  No. 8 is 4.896&percnt;. In the cases of membranes Nos. 6, 7, and  9  (&dgr;=120-122&mgr;m), ranging from approximately 1.7 to  3.4&percnt; t  also is fairly small. In other words, with the  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system, membrane resistance R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  for the most part can be disregarded.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-54A>             Table 2. Membrane Resistance (Computed Values) </FIG>       2) Hole Ratio &egr;    In our previous report&lt;sup&gt; 12)&lt;/sup&gt; , in order to study the  relationship between K and &egr;, we used 9 types of PE membranes  in the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system and reported on its result. However,  in the case of PE membranes, because of moisture produced in the  membranes by MEA, we no longer were certain whether we still had  the specimen membrane on which accurate evaluation could be  based. In order to resolve this problem, we reviewed the  experiment using highly hydrophobic PTFE membranes (Nos.6-8) and  a reformed-surface membrane (No.9). Moreover, using the  membranes (Nos.2-5,8) with a wide variety of &egr;, we  experimented with the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -NaOH system, a system of  reaction absorption which is similar to the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA  system but on which moisture has little effect. This was  intended to provide supplementary data in resolving the problem  created by the characteristics of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system.  Fig. 1 shows the relationship between K and &egr;.    With the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -NaOH (1 mol/l) system,  data on the relationship between K and &egr; are relatively well  defined, as the larger the &egr;, the larger K will become. With  the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA(5mol/l) system, on the other  hand, few data are available to elucidate relationship between K  and &egr;; consequently somewhat less well defined in comparison  with those in CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -NaOH system. However, its tendency  for the most part is similar to that of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -NaOh  system, another reaction absorbing system, in that the larger  &egr; is, the larger K will become. With the  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O system, on the other hand, the  situation is completely different. K exhibits no relationship to  &egr;, and is related only to R&lt;inf&gt; eL&lt;/inf&gt;  (currently obtaining  detailed data). It appears that this largely is due to the  thickness of the liquid boundary membranes of both  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O system (physical absorption) and  the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system (reaction absorption). We hope to  present reason for this in detail at the next opportunity.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-55A>             Fig. 1. Relationship between Comprehensive Material </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-55B>             Fig. 2. Relationship Between Comprehensive Material </FIG>        2) Comprehensive Material Transfer Coefficient and Liquid  Flow Condition    In connection with the relationship between  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system's comprehensive material transfer  coefficient K and liquid flow conditions, we conducted several  experiments using PP and PE membranes. Because of the effects of  moisture produced by MEA on the membranes, we have not been able  to identify a clear tendency. In the experiment presented in  this paper, we used the PTFE membrane (No.8), in which any  effect of moisture can be disregarded, to examine relationship  between K and R&lt;inf&gt; eL&lt;/inf&gt; . As indicated by the test result  shown in Fig. 2, K is only slightly proportionate to  R&lt;inf&gt; eL&lt;/inf&gt; &lt;sup&gt; 0.07&lt;/sup&gt; , showing almost minimal effects  of Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt; . As reference, we showed in Fig. 2  data&lt;sup&gt; 3)&lt;/sup&gt;  generated when  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O system was used. In this case, K  is proportionate to Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt; &lt;sup&gt; 0.33&lt;/sup&gt; , exhibiting  definite effects created by Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt; . The reason why the  dependence of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 's K on Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt;  differs  between CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system and  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  system may be stated as follows:  since the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system absorbs reactions, its  liquid boundary membrane is thin and therefore it is difficult  for ReL to impact it, whereas the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  system is a physical absorption system, its liquid absorption  membrane is thick and therefore it can be easily impacted by  Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt; .    (3) Durability of Membrane    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-55C>             Fig. 3. Properties of Comprehensive Material Transfer </FIG>       Fig. 3 shows changes K had undergone during many hours of  experimentation in which No. 3 membrane (material: PE) and No. 8  membrane (material: PETE) were used under the following  conditions: temperature T=50&deg;C and MEA concentration  C&lt;inf&gt; B&lt;/inf&gt; =5 mol/l. Although No.3 membrane's K  falls rapidly with passing of time t, with No.8 (PETE), hardly  any change was noted in K for a long period of time, viz.,  t=approximately 6000 hours. In Fig. 4, angle of contact cos  &thgr;  by Kaelble, et al.&lt;sup&gt; 16)&lt;/sup&gt;  and a surface tension &dgr; are  plotted. MEA(50&deg;C)'s &dgr; is 0.059N/m (a value actually  measured), and the PEFE's angle of contact cosign at this value  is cos&thgr;=-0.2 and the PE membrane is cos&thgr;=0.1.  Consequently,  PEFE membrane has a large negative value. That is why moisture  does not affect PEFE membrane.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-56A>             Fig. 4. Relationship between Angle of contact and Surface </FIG>      <H5>    3. Feasibility Study </H5>   An example of a feasibility study of a CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  removal system using a membrane method is described below:  <H5>  3.1. Summary of Study </H5>   (1) A 1000MW system designed to remove 50&percnt; of  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  from coal fire boiler's exhaust gas is being  examined. The conditions are shown in Table 3.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-56B>             Table 3. Conditions of Feasibility Study </FIG>          (2) Relationship between a CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  recovery rate and  a membrane area will be examined below.    The diagram of this system is shown in Fig. 5. This system  is  based on a chemical absorption method using a hollow fiber  membrane in the part which absorbs CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; . In an  absorption fluid recycling part, a heat radiation-type recycling  tower, the kind used in the conventional chemical absorption  method, is being used.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-56C>             Fig. 5. CO </FIG>      <H5>    3.2 Results of Study </H5>   (1) The result of the study when a CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  recovery  rate was set at 50&percnt; is shown in Table 4. In this system,  the  absorption part was established on the assumption that a gas  flue would be expanded somewhat. Moreover, a draft loss on the  gas side of the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  absorption part was  approximately 100mmH&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O. When the expansion of the  duct work is taken into consideration, a loss probably will be  in the range of 1/3-1/5 of that produced by the conventional  chemical absorption method.    Moreover, since absorption fluid will free-fall on the basis  of the membrane's inner static differential, a pressure loss on  the absorption side of the membrane part is approximately  0.6kg/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; .

Moreover, In this study, since MEA and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  [produce equimolecular reactions], we set a MEA/CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  molecular ratio as a constant.  <H5>  3.3. Considerations </H5>   The conventional methods of filling columns and wetted wall  columns require a well-designed installation space and duct  placement because the absorption part becomes a column type.  With our method, however, it is possible to install the  absorption part by somewhat expanding a horizontal gas duct.    Moreover, since our method is expected to reduce a loss in  gas-side draft from one-third to one-fifth of the draft loss  produced by the filling column and wetted wall methods, with the  power of the exhaust gas fan, it can be controlled at around  2000-5000kWh/h. Moreover, as considered in the previous section,  with an increase of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  recovery ratio, a membrane  area will increase at a rapid rate. Consequently, a scale of  equipment, also, will be enlarged. For instance, if we are to  take a viewpoint that an amount of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emitted from  a certain power plant a year is to be reduced, rather than  aiming for high recovery ratio using one boiler, as shown in  Fig. 7, we can consider a method of using two boilers with  low-recovery rate. Consequently, in selecting CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  recovery ratio, it will be essential that we consider and  examine fully the amount by which CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions can  be reduced in addition to the method of plant operations and  economic factors.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-58A>             Fig. 7. Relationship between CO </FIG>      <H5>    4. Conclusion </H5>   Concerning the removal of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  from thermal power  plant's exhaust gases through the method of gas absorption using  hollow fiber membranes, we had conducted a series of experiments  and a feasibility study and were able to obtain the following  results:    (1) With the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system, the smaller the  value of a membrane thickness &dgr; is, the larger the  comprehensive material transfer coefficient K will become; still  its effect is quite small, no more than 5&percnt;. To the liquid  Reynolds number Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt; , K is proportionate to  Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;sup&gt; 0.07&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/inf&gt;  and its effect is very slight. The  hole  ratio &egr;, however, greatly affects K, as the larger the value  of &egr;. the larger K will become.    (2) With the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system, although wetness of  the membrane caused by MEA greatly reduces its durability, if a  hydrophobic material (for instance PTFE) is used, we can  eliminate this problem. This fact was verified by the continuous  processing test lasting for approximately 6000 hours.    (3) It was verified that, in order to enlarge and stabilize  the porous membrne's K when the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system is  involved, we must use highly hydrophobic membrane materials so  that &egr; can be enlarged as much as possible.    (4) We applied this method to a system designed to separate  and recover 50&percnt; of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  from gas emissions from a  1000MW coal fire boiler and compared its results with those  produced by the conventional chemical absorption method. We  found that with the new method we were able to reduce exhaust  gas fan power to around 5000kWh/h.    We wish to thank membrane makers and their associates who  provided us with specimen membranes and valuable information  concerning those membranes and membranes in general. We also are  greatly indebted to those at university research laboratories  who so generously contributed their advice and valuable  information.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-59A>             Symbols Used in the Text </FIG>        Bibliography    1) U.S. DOE Rep (DOE-CH-16-2) A system study for the removal  recovery and disposal of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel power  plant in the U.S./ (1984)    2) Shimizu, Yoshida : Artificial Organs, 10, 1979 (1981)    3) Matsumoto, Kakimoto, Sato : Chemical Engineering :  Collected Papers, 17. 1201 (1991)    4) Matsumoto, K.

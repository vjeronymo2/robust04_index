			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (15): Monument to reckless lending - Profile: Securum Mr Lars Thunell, president of Securum, is gaining a reputation for being one of Sweden's best-travelled business executives. When your asset portfolio includes the British Embassy building in Burma, an air charter operation in Zimbabwe, a skiing lodge in the US, an airport operator in the UK, scores of properties around Europe and huge real estate and industrial operations in Sweden, it is easy to see why. It is not an empire which was built up by design; rather one which was dumped unceremoniously into Securum's lap a year ago when it was established as a home for the failed loans within state-owned Nordbanken. 'We are a super conglomerate. The only thing the assets we own have in common is that they were used as collateral for credits in Nordbanken,' says Mr Thunell. Long after Nordbanken has been returned to the private sector, Securum will stand as a monument to the reckless lending which made the bank the single biggest casualty of Sweden's financial crisis. It has the dubious distinction of being Europe's biggest 'bad bank' and one of its largest property groups after taking over a whopping SKr67bn in sour and non-strategic credits from Nordbanken. Nordbanken, meanwhile, has made a rapid and controversial return to profit and could well be re-privatised during 1995. By the time Securum has foreclosed on all its properties in the middle of next year, its total portfolio will be worth between SKr40bn and SKr45bn. Real estate accounts for 50 per cent of the total, comprising some 2,000 buildings across Sweden, the UK, the US, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and other European countries. The rest of the portfolio consists mainly of industrial operations, hotels, and financial investments. The aim is to get rid of them lot quickly and efficiently, while maximising the returns for the taxpayer. The second part of this equation is crucial to Securum's strategy. The bad bank concept was pioneered in the US, partly as a result of the crisis in the savings and loans sector. But Securum has taken the development a stage further and has a far bigger operational role than its predecessors. 'We want to take an active role and create value. We are not purely a liquidating company,' says Mr Thunell. With SKr24bn in equity backing, the company has deliberately been structured for a 15-year wind-down. The timetable ensures that it is not a distressed seller. More importantly, given its market position as one of Sweden's leading real estate groups, it has prevented a flood of new properties on to the market which would only have depressed values further. The idea of 'creating value' was clearly demonstrated last month when a SKr16.6bn merger between Nobel Industries, in which Securum held 72.9 per cent, and the Dutch chemicals group Akzo was unveiled. Securum won many plaudits for the way in which the deal was constructed and the differing concerns of taxpayers, employees, and minority shareholders were addressed. Securum itself gained a stake of about 20 per cent in Akzo as a result of the merger, and an unrealised capital gain worth SKr5bn. Another example of the group's active management style was the way it restructured the Kramo construction equipment and renting group by putting four different companies together to give them a better chance of weathering the deep recession in the Swedish building market. The result is that a group of companies which last year lost SKr160m will this year break even. So many differing calculations had to be made at the outset, covering everything from interest rate and currency trends to property market developments, that it is difficult to say whether Securum will eventually need more equity from the government All but SKr8.9bn of the original SKr24bn of equity had been wiped out by the mid-year. But that reflects the SKr12bn of credit losses which the group took during its most intensive restructuring phase. Losses in the second half of the year and henceforward will be considerably less. The success of the Nobel deal and the downward trend in interest rates means that the group is ahead of where it expected to be at this stage. Mr Thunell stresses that the company is run as a commercial enterprise, not as semi-political institution. 'We receive minimal interference from the state,' he asserts. But it is the state which will call the shots at the end of the day. What happens to the company in 10 to 15 years' time? 'Either they sell off all or part of Securum, or they instruct us to sell down to the last share or building, and we can eventually turn off the light and go home,' says Mr Thunell.</p>

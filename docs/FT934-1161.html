			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: Sex, equality and pensions - European Court The European Court last week confirmed that the equal treatment principles established in its 1990 Barber judgment for contracted-out private pensions, also apply to private company pension schemes. The Court said the Rome treaty principle of equal pay for equal work in the context of retirement age discrimination was not restricted to contracted-out private pension schemes. Company pension schemes, where the pension payments qualify as remuneration for employment under the treaty rules on equal treatment of men and women, are also covered. Moreover, enforceability in the national courts of the treaty rule on equal treatment was not affected by a 1986 directive on implementation of the equal treatment principle which member countries were obliged to implement only from January 1 1993. But the equal pay principle was enforceable only in the context of company pension schemes from May 17 1990, the date of the Barber decision. The exception was for employees, or those claiming through them, who had commenced legal proceedings or an equivalent claim before then. The Court's ruling came in response to questions referred by the Bonn Arbeitsgericht about a dispute between Mr Moroni and the Collo company for which he worked between 1968 and 1983. During this period he belonged to the company pension scheme, the rules of which said men could not take their pension before 65 while women could do so at 60. German law on private pension schemes provides that when employees leave a company before retirement age they are entitled to maintain the pension rights accumulated at that time until 65, if male, and 60, if female. The amount of pension is calculated by applying to the full pension entitlement at retirement age a coefficient equal to the ratio between the employee's age and pensionable age. Since the years to retirement for women would be less than for men, the pension reduction for men would be greater than for women. Mr Moroni claimed before the national court his pension rights should begin at 60 and be set on the same basis as a woman in the same circumstances. The ECJ explained its Barber ruling made it clear discrimination in the form of different pensionable ages for men and women in the context of contracted-out private pensions infringed the treaty prohibition on pay discrimination between men and women. The alignment of the retirement ages on those of the state pension law made no difference. The principle behind the Barber decision was that the concept of pay in the treaty rule covered all payments present or future by an employer to an employee directly or indirectly by reason of the employment. Payment after termination of employment was not excluded. Against this background, the ECJ said that the principles applied in Barber were not limited to UK contracted-out pensions. Provided a pension scheme was outside the social security system and did not benefit from public finance, it would be subject to the principle of equal pay when it involved an agreement between employer and employee and was supplementary to a state pension. The ECJ rejected any suggestion that a directive could restrict the enforceability of the treaty rule on equal treatment. In line with previous case law, the treaty rule applies directly to all discrimination which can be established by reference only to the criteria of equivalent work and equal pay laid down by the treaty. Finally, the Court confirmed its decision of 6 October 1993 in the Ten Oever case as to the temporal effect of Barber. It said equal treatment in respect of company pension rights could only be invoked for pension payments relating to employment periods after May 17 1990, the date of the Barber judgment, subject to the exception for prior claims. This is the second judgment since Barber. A third is due on December 22 in Neath v Steeper. But no date is fixed for judgment in the Coloroll case. C-110/91, Moroni v Collo, ECJ FC, 14 December 1993.

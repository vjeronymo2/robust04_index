			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Wang Shuzheng (3769 2885 2973) and </F> Reporter Li Shujia (2621 1859 0163): "Resolutely Crack Down on  and Stop the Illegal Transit of Textile Products"]    [Text] It was proposed at the provincial meeting on  cracking down on and stopping the illegal trafficking of textile  products held today that resolute efforts should be made to  crack down on and stop the illegal trafficking of textile  products. At the same time, it also warned enterprises to  strictly guard against being fooled while dealing with the  business of exports of textile products.    It was learned that some enterprises have failed to pay  sufficient attention to the importance of cracking down on the  illegal trafficking of textile products and the relevant  policies. A small number of enterprises still have the idea of  relying on luck and believe that illegal trafficking of textile  products will not occur in their enterprises. Some enterprises,  particularly the "three types of foreign-funded" enterprises,  township enterprises, business companies which have newly been  granted the rights to free management, and production  enterprises know little about the relevant policies and  situations.    The illegal trafficking of textile products has not only  violated our country's relevant laws and regulations but also  the international agreements and the relevant bilateral  agreements, seriously sabotaging China's export order, creating  a bad influence externally, and seriously damaging the interests  of the state.    The meeting proposed: If our province's relevant enterprises  are found to be involved in illegal trafficking of textile  products, they will be criticized in a circular and their  illicit gains and goods will be confiscated. They will also be  punished with fines, have their textile product quota cut, and  have their customs declaration right and their textile products  export operational right temporarily suspended or abolished. At  the same time, persons responsible will be questioned. If their  cases are exceptionally serious, and they are found to have  created great loses to the state and violated criminal law, they  will be transferred to judicial organs to have their criminal  liabilities investigated.</p>

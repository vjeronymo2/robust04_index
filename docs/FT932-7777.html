			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Denton stirs debate on future of junior market - Minister calls for an entrepreneurial approach THE DEBATE over the future structure of a junior market was given added impetus yesterday with a call from Baroness Denton, the minister for small companies, for a more entrepreneurial market aimed at encouraging growth in smaller companies. Speaking to the Financial Times at the opening of the Hoare Govett Small Companies Exhibition, Baroness Denton called for a 'greater sense of risk and enterprise' in any new market which might succeed the Unlisted Securities Market, due to close in 1996.

Mr Peter Meinertzhagen, chairman of Hoare Govett, said the recent revival in the UK smaller companies market had begun to attract international investors. Representatives from the US had attended the London exhibition. Exhibition participants welcomed the opportunity to meet a wide range of institutions and brokers.

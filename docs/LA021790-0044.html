			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'ALVIN AILEY REMEMBERED' ON CHANNEL 28  </P> <P> "Going Home: Alvin Ailey Remembered" (tonight at 9 on KCET Channel 28) breaks  all the rules for entertainment programming. Not merely another tribute to the  choreographer who died Dec. 1, this hour-long telecast is essentially a  transcription of the memorial service held for him at the Cathedral of Saint  John the Divine.  </P> <P> Like Ailey's grieving family, friends and colleagues, we look past his coffin  at a ceremony intended (dancer Donna Wood explains) to send him on. "Great  souls die and our reality, bound to them, takes leave of us," poet Maya Angelou  reminds us from the pulpit. This is no ordinary performance.  </P> <P> Ailey himself speaks to us from archival videotape. "I'm a choreographer," he  says. "I'm a black man whose roots are in the sun and dirt of the South. . . ."  </P> <P> An even younger, dancing Ailey appears in black-and-white 1962 footage, and  these sequences -- along with brief, intimate interview segments with former  Ailey dancers -- help broaden the Cathedral experience. Sometimes the words  don't add up, but the ravaged faces are eloquent enough and director Andrew  Clark Wilk captures them in haunting close-ups.  </P> <P> Edited with great tact, the eulogies by New York City Mayor David Dinkins and  others pass quickly, shifting the emphasis onto dancing by past and present  members of the Ailey company. Dudley Williams takes "A Song for You" (from  "Love Songs") into a new dimension, Wood is back in the exultant final section  of "Cry," Mari Kajiwara returns to lend her radiance to "Revelations."  </P> <P> The Ailey company has been accused in recent years of growing lackadaisical,  mannered, hyperathletic -- but nearly everyone on this occasion is dancing out  of deep emotion, connected to a sense of purpose often latent in these  choreographies but here devastatingly intense.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, only singers and speakers are identified. In what seems to be a  recent PBS mandate, dancer names are relegated to a mass listing in the final  credits -- even when the dancers perform solos or duets. A program by the  American Indian Dance Theatre recently suffered from this same policy and it  will be instructive to see if PBS keeps the dancers of American Ballet Theatre  equally anonymous.

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Challenge to human resource management theory lacks evidence Sir, Mark McKergow (Letters, April 11) expresses concern about the fact that our measure of employee-management relations is subjective. This is so: how can it not be? But the suggestion that human resource managers would be more likely to report worse industrial relations than traditional managers is mere speculation. After all, their whole raison d'etre is to improve such relations. The fact that managers responsible for personnel report honestly is supported by the high correlation between their responses and those of worker representatives, which are almost identical across the 2,000 plus workplaces. This implies that our measure accurately represents the climate of relations in these work places. No one denies that the bottom line in human resource management (HRM) is profitability and financial performance; Duncan Brown (Letters, April 11) seems to suggest we do. But surely HRM is also supposed to produce good industrial relations? To the best of our knowledge ours is the first UK study that attempts to relate HRM practices to either industrial relations or economic outcomes. We shall be interested to see the evidence alluded to by Mr Brown that 'HRM practitioners have been making major strides in fighting the British disease' (whatever that is). We know of no other research which relates HRM practices to economic outcomes. Our own work suggests a dichotomy. HRM appears to be associated with better economic outcomes in the workplace - higher productivity and better performance on the jobs front - but worse industrial relations outcomes - higher number of resignations, higher absenteeism and less good relations between management and employees. Instead of making cheap points against empirical research Mr Brown should give us his evidence on this important topic. Tom Barry (Letters, April 11) is reluctant to admit that personnel hierarchies exist in workplaces. They do - you only have to look at National Health Service trusts. But even in 'flatter' organisations someone has to take decisions. Therefore it is important to consider what makes for good or bad relations. Our own work casts doubt on the self-serving idea that HRM techniques are the vision of the future, for better management/employee relations.

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: JAL records first loss since 1985 JAPAN Airlines (JAL), the country's leading international carrier, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Y6bn (Dollars 46.1m) for fiscal 1991 due to a slump in foreign business travel and rising operating costs. Meanwhile, All Nippon Airways (ANA), Japan's biggest domestic airline, announced a pre-tax profit of Y22.4bn, down 11.6 per cent. JAL, which had a profit of Y24.8bn in fiscal 1990, predicted it would break even in the current fiscal year, while ANA forecast a slight dip in earnings to Y22bn. JAL's loss, which was lower than its earlier prediction of a Y8bn deficit, reflected an operating loss of Y12.9bn. An improvement in financial items, including the sale of securities, led to the smaller pre-tax loss. It was the first loss for JAL since fiscal 1985 when the crash of a JAL 747 in Japan, which killed 520 persons, caused a drop in passenger traffic. Net losses were narrowed to Y2.9bn, against a profit of Y13.7bn in fiscal 1990, due to the sale of aircraft. JAL will pay an unchanged dividend of Y5 in spite of the loss. Sales fell by 0.4 per cent to Y1,114bn. International passenger turnover dropped by 1.5 per cent to Y564.4bn, although passenger traffic rose 5.4 per cent. The downturn was the result of less business traffic, mainly on the Japan-Europe routes, as companies cut their travel budgets because of the recession. Less profitable tourist traffic, particularly to China and Hawaii, was responsible for the increase in passengers to 8.3m. Domestic sales rose by 5.1 per cent to Y265.2bn as JAL expanded routes within Japan, producing a 3.8 per cent increase in passenger traffic to 14m. While total sales remained stagnant, operating costs rose by 3.3 per cent to Y1,275bn due to higher maintenance costs and leasing charges. JAL expects a net profit of Y3bn, while sales are expected to increase to Y1,182bn. ANA blamed its profit drop on higher interest costs following the purchase of new aircraft and other capital investments, which amounted to Y300bn last year. Its net financial deficit grew to Y28.7bn from 17.9bn in fiscal 1990. ANA plans to invest another Y300bn on expanding its flight network this year. It explained that expanded services led last year to a rise in turnover for both its domestic and international routes, which boosted total sales to Y799.2bn, up 9 per cent. Net income fell by 28.9 per cent to Y7.6bn. The dividend will be unchanged at Y5. Sales in the domestic market, where ANA claims a 50 per cent share, rose by 7 per cent to Y651.8bn. International sales increased by 19.2 per cent to Y116.6bn as ANA continued to expand foreign routes. It expects that sales will climb by 5.5 per cent to Y843.5bn in the current fiscal year, although net profit will decline 3.9 per cent to Y7.3bn.</p>

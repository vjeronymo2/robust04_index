			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Venezuela (7): A surge of confidence - Foreign Investment VENEZUELA must be doing something right. After years of lacklustre growth, direct foreign investment in this South American republic soared by a record Dollars 2bn in 1991, from Dollars 440m in 1990 and Dollars 640m in 1989, according to data provided by the government and Conapri, a joint public and private enterprise that promotes new investment. Last year's foreign investment results were unexpectedly high because of privatisation of the national telecommunications company, CANTV, which alone netted the Venezuelan treasury Dollars 1.89bn. Some 72 per cent came from international companies participating in the consortium that bought a controlling interest in the CANTV. As of last month, privatisations in 1992 had not generated any large capital inflows from international companies. Nonetheless, foreign investment remained strong. According to Mr Ricardo Hausmann, Venezuela's minister of planning, foreign investment during the first eight months of 1992 increased by Dollars 725m - a figure far ahead of 1991 if the CANTV privatisation is excluded. Foreign investment figures include fresh capital outlays, reinvestment of retained earnings and, in past years, proceeds of debt-equity swaps. This positive trend in Venezuela has several causes. At the start of its five-year term in early 1989, the administration of President Carlos Andres Perez ordered a series of important economic reforms aimed at reducing state intervention in the economy, promoting competition from domestic and international sources, giving private investment a greater role and generally moving Venezuela toward a free market system. The Perez government broadly liberalised its foreign investment code in 1990 with the approval of Decree 727, which eliminated most of the stumbling blocks which international investors had complained about for years. In March 1992, the government liberalised its foreign investment environment even more. Decree 2,095 eliminated most of the restrictions which previously reserved certain economic sectors for Venezuelan investors, and placed foreign companies on the same legal footing as Venezuelan companies under the rules applying to the Andean Common Market (Pacto Andino), a regional integration group that includes Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. It also allowed foreign concerns to include trademarks, patents, and other specialised technology as capital contributions. This more open environment for international investment - and for private investment in general - is helping Venezuela to realise the potential for growth that people have been talking about for years. Investors familiar with Latin America have long been aware of Venezuela's competitive advantages, which include: low-cost energy from abundant hydroelectric power and large reserves of fossil fuels; major deposits of minerals such as iron ore, bauxite, gold, diamonds, coal and others; the largest proved reserves of crude oil outside the Middle East, plus large gas deposits; a modern physical infrastructure; a young work force and a corps of managers experienced in international business; a good location for reaching markets in the US, Europe and Latin America; a relatively small population (about 20m) with manageable problems. The biggest share of foreign investment in 1992 came from CANTV, which was privatised in December 1991 and is under the operating control of GTE of the US. The CANTV alone reported 1992 investments of Dollars 510m to upgrade telephone and telcommunications services. An international consortium headed by GTE bought 40 per cent of shares - plus operating control - of the inefficient telecommunications concern. Foreign partners GTE, Telefonica Internacional (Spain) and AT&amp;T (US) reportedly control 72 per cent of the consortium. Mr Bruce Haddad, CANTV's president, said that the company plans to invest Dollars 6bn over the next decade. Venezuela's petrochemical sector, which is going through the largest expansion in its history, has attracted considerable international investment since 1989. Some of the most important investors in new or continuing petrochemical projects are Italy's Ecofuel (a unit of ENI); Mitsui (Japan); Spain's Repsol; and three US groups - Olin, Combustion Engineering, International Finance Corp, and Dow Chemical. In mining, Monarch Resources Ltd., a Bermuda-based company, is investing Dollars 23m in 1992-94 to develop a new gold mine, La Camorra, in Venezuela's Guayana region. A number of other companies are also investing in different sectors. They include: Nestle and Heinz (processed foods), Smurfit (paper); the Grupo Once from Spain (tourism); BAT Industries (tobacco and agribusiness); Procter &amp; Gamble (personal use products); Chiquita Brands (bananas), and Iberia (international air service). Even Venezuela's petroleum production sector, off limits to private investment since the oil industry was nationalised in 1976, has opened up. Japan's Teikoku Oil and a group made up of Benton Oil (US) and Vinccler of Venezuela signed operating agreements at the end of July 1992 covering the production of crude oil in so-called 'marginal' oil fields. The contracts call for the two groups to invest a total of Dollars 280m over the next decade. The companies will not own the fields where they operate, but will receive payments according to the volumes of crude oil and natural gas they produce for PDVSA, Venezuela's national oil company. Last month, Venezuela's Ministry of Energy and PDVSA called on foreign and domestic companies to bid on a second series of oil production contracts. PDVSA, hit hard by a combination of low oil prices and high Venezuelan taxes, is also looking for international equity partners in areas such as exploration, production and refining, which had excluded private investment for 16 years. Venezuela has been able to make substantial progress in foreign investment during 1992, even though a failed military uprising in February provoked a political crisis. Foreign executives in general remain quite optimistic and give high marks to the Perez regime for setting conditions for strong economic growth and removing barriers to international capital. They also point out that the government, over-dependent on dwindling revenues from petroleum exports, clearly recognises the need for private capital from Venezuelan and foreign investors if the economy is to continue advancing. However, 1993 is a presidential election year and businessmen are concerned that a populist politician may assume power in 1994. Traditionally, investors in Venezuela put new projects on hold during presidential election years as they wait to see what kind of economic policies they will be facing during the next five-year period of government. While some foreign investors may be holding back, especially for new projects that would begin in 1993, most companies expect the next government to maintain the free-market policies initiated in 1989.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / A lull in creative tension: The outlook for the regulator Officials at the Office of Gas Supply were congratulating themselves yesterday on the outcome of the report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 'On a scale of one to 10, I think we've scored nine out of 10,' said Mr Greg McGregor, director of competition and tariffs. The commission has embraced many of Ofgas's suggestions for the future of the gas industry, with some important modifications. It has also vindicated the view of Sir James McKinnon, head of Ofgas, that his combative style of regulation has achieved significant benefits for consumers. Ofgas had called for the radical break-up of British Gas into separate regional companies as a way of achieving full competition. But officials stressed yesterday that this was a way of promoting discussion rather than Sir James's favoured route. Ofgas's main concern was the separation of the pipelines company from British Gas's trading activities, as the commission recommended. Mr Graeme Odgers, chairman of the commission, said he believed the regulatory system was fundamentally sound, though 'there have been problems with rather confrontational relationships'. But, in future, the closer concentration of Ofgas on the technical aspects of the pipelines company should reduce the element of acrimony. The retirement of Sir James in October and of Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, next year, will help to smooth tensions between the company and its regulator. Sir James's Glaswegian charm has made little impact on the taciturn Mr Evans, and they have failed to strike up a cordial working relationship. Sir James describes his relations with British Gas as 'creative tension', but the tension has often been more evident than the creativity. Sir James has implied that British Gas's top management is not up to the job of taking the company into a new competitive marketplace. British Gas has countered with implications that the regulator is 'off his rocker'. 'It is very important to say that the regulatory system has been given a clean bill of health by the commission. British Gas had been pouring a huge amount of scorn on us,' said Mr McGregor. Ofgas welcomes the chance to develop a relationship with a separate pipelines company - which is what will be left of British Gas when its trading activities have been divested after March 1997. Mr McGregor said he relished the idea of working with the company to set up a regulatory regime, rather than working against it as now. Sir James's attempts to agree pricing and structural reforms with British Gas have been fraught, and he has often turned to the media to promote his views. British Gas has sometimes been caught on the hop, as when Sir James called on the company to cut its prices to household customers in an early-morning radio programme last year. 'With the changes at the top of Ofgas and British Gas, I think it provides an opportunity for a constructive relationship to be built,' said Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive at British Gas. But already hints of future tension have slipped into the more co-operative noises emanating from both the company and the regulator. Ofgas wants to see competition introduced for household customers more quickly than the commission has proposed. It believes that many of British Gas's fears of price rises for small users, and other penalties of a freer market, are 'alarmist'. In addition, the regulator is unhappy about suggestions by the commission that the consumer should foot the bill for the costs incurred in selling off British Gas's trading arm. Ofgas is prepared to push hard for shareholders to bear this burden, since it is they who have benefited from monopoly prices - higher than if the market were competitive - since privatisation. The commission has also trustingly left the details for the introduction of competition into household supply open to negotiation between Ofgas and British Gas. This is an area that could prove contentious since views differ greatly. Sir James's successor will need patience and tolerance if he or she is to remain in harmonious relations with British Gas.</p>

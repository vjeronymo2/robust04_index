			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / No Taipei talks for BAe before June Taiwan Aerospace will not resume talks with British Aerospace on their stalled Dollars 775m (Pounds 520m) airliner joint venture before June, the economic affairs minister, Mr Chiang Pin-kung, was yesterday quoted as saying, Reuter reports from Taipei. Any reopening of talks would depend on a review of Taiwan's plans for its fledgling aerospace industry, expected by June 30, national newspapers reported Mr Chiang as telling parliament on Monday. BAe and Taiwan Aerospace, 29 per cent owned by the Taiwan government, signed a deal in January 1993 to form a 50-50 venture to produce the RJ family of 75- to 115-seat regional passenger jets for assembly in Britain and Taiwan.

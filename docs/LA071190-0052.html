			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER BOARD OKS STUDY ON DESALINATION PLANT  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District's board of directors approved a $500,000 study  Tuesday that will outline the construction and operation of a pilot  desalination plant that will serve Southern California, officials said.  </P> <P> The study, scheduled to last about two years, will determine the cost of  building a plant that would produce 5 to 10 million gallons of fresh water a  day, said Gary Snyder, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based MWD. It will also  pinpoint a location and design a basic construction model for the facility, he  said.  </P> <P> "It's partly because of the drought but mainly because of our long-term needs  for additional water resources," said Snyder, explaining why the study and  proposed plant are necessary.  </P></p>

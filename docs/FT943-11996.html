			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Daewoo sales surge 28% in first half Daewoo, South Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate, reported a 28 per cent increase in sales to Won16,400bn (Dollars 20.4m) for the first half of 1994, according to preliminary results. The group expressed confidence that it could achieve its sales target of Won35,500bn for 1994. Net profits were Won293.5bn - the first time that Daewoo has revealed first-half earnings for the entire group. Net profits for all of 1993 were Won464bn. Daewoo Corporation, the group's trading and construction unit, reported a 25 per cent rise in net profits to Won30bn as sales grew by 19 per cent to Won5,100bn. Daewoo Heavy Industries, a machinery producer, had a sharp rise in profits to Won20bn from Won3bn in the first half of 1993 as sales rose by 35 per cent to Won500bn, reflecting growing exports of excavators and machine tools. Daewoo Motor reported a 56 per cent increase in sales to Won1,450bn, the biggest rise in turnover among the group's main companies. The car company broke even after suffering a Won85bn loss in 1993. The improved performance of the car division was due to the introduction of two models and lower production costs. Daewoo Shipbuilding, which will merge with Daewoo Heavy Industries in October, had the largest group profits at Won130bn, an increase of 40 per cent. Sales grew by 45 per cent to Won1,100bn. The rise in profits reflected the increased production of high value-added ships and absence of labour disputes. Daewoo Telecom profits doubled to Won4bn, although sales fell 6 per cent to Won220bn.</p>

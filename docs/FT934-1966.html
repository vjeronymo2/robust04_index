			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Technology: Troubled oil on Europe's waters - Greek worries over tanker building controls Greece's shipowners have already had to accept tough new safety regulations for tankers as the price of keeping access to the US oil transport market. They are now worried that the UK or even the European Union may adopt equally stringent measures to prevent disastrous oil spills. Greek owners control 15 per cent of the world's oil tanker tonnage, including a high proportion of very large and ultra large crude carriers (VLCCs and ULCCs). The international tanker fleet amounts to fewer than 3,000 vessels, but its advancing age alarms environmental groups. Sixty per cent of tankers are more than 15 years old, while most of the VLCCs and ULCCS operated by Greek concerns were built in the mid-1970s. The Greeks raise technical objections to the US Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, the law that could become a model for European legislators. Under its provisions, all ships sailing in US waters and built after 1990 must have double hulls, and shipowners face unlimited liability for accidents involving gross negligence. John Lyras of Granicos Shipping says: 'We have to live with the double hull requirement. But the evidence is that it is of limited use in improving safety, and it's costly.' The US law resulted from the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 which poured more than 25m gallons of oil into Alaskan coastal waters. Many Greek owners believe another disaster on the scale of the Braer wreck off Shetland or the grounding of the Aegean Sea, a Greek-owned supertanker, off a Spanish port - both earlier this year - would mean the introduction of the double hull requirement in European waters. The Union of Greek Shipowners argues that double hulls, with a cushion of air between the inner and outer steel plating, can reduce oil leakages only if a collision or grounding occurs at low speeds. If two ships collide at normal cruising speed, the cargo tanks are likely to be ruptured and the tanker is more likely to sink. Also, an explosion is more likely aboard a double-hulled ship in an accident, as the gap is filled with oxygen which reacts with vapour from escaping oil. 'The fact that the Aegean Sea had a double bottom made things worse. When the ship grounded, oil got into the space in between and triggered an explosion. Damage to the ship was more extensive and more oil was spilled than if it had a single hull,' says George Banos of Moundreas Shipbrokers. Fitting a double hull adds at least 15 per cent to the Dollars 120m (Pounds 80m) cost of building a supertanker, and cuts its carrying capacity by about 20 per cent. Several large Greek oil carriers, among them the Onassis, Niarchos and Livanos groups, have invested in double-hulled vessels. However, with the shipping industry still in recession, there is little incentive for smaller owners to switch. The compromise solution advocated by the International Maritime Organisation calls for tankers built after 1994 to have double bottoms and a series of ballast tanks along the length of the cargo deck. But this would not necessarily cut the risk of explosion as a fully-laden tanker would have air in the ballast tanks. As 80 per cent of tanker accidents are caused by human error, there is some weight in the Greek owners' claims that higher standards of training for both tanker crews and port officials would be as effective as shipbuilding regulations. Also, technologically advanced navigation assistance in congested international waters could reduce the possibility for collisions and groundings. 'What is needed is a shore-based electronic system, similar to an air-traffic control system, that takes account of the limited ability of a ship to manoeuvre in difficult weather,' Lyras says.</p>

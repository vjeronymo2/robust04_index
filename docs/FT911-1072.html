			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Observer: Golden goodbyes It must be a buy signal. Rob Weinberg, James Capel's gold mining guru and number one in the Extel survey, is out of the door with no job to go to. Along with the departure of Tom Butler, author of Samuel Montagu's respected bullion review, Rhona O'Connell (ex-Shearson) and Mike Coulson (ex-County NatWest), it means that London's role as a centre of research into the yellow metal has just about disappeared. Andy Smith of UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew is the last rated Extel analyst still studying gold, and since Swiss banks are more interested in the stuff than most, his job is probably safe for the moment. Research activity seems to be gravitating towards the gold-producing countries of North America and Australia. With the prospect of South Africa being welcomed back into the international business community, it all seems rather short sighted. London is still the most active gold market, the main international clearing centre, and has a central bank which understands gold. It badly needs someone to plug the research gap. If RTZ, the world's biggest mining finance house, will not take up the golden research ball dropped by Hanson's Consolidated Gold Fields, perhaps the London Bullion Market Association should.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRAZIL INAUGURATES COLLOR DE MELLO;  </P> <P> 40-YEAR-OLD PRESIDENT PROMISES REFORMS TO CUT INFLATION  </P> <P> Fernando Collor de Mello was inaugurated today for a five-year term as Brazil's  first popularly elected president in 29 years, and he pledged sweeping reforms  to end inflation and corruption.  </P> <P> Thousands of people cheered and waved banners proclaiming a new Brazil.  </P> <P> But many people were nervous about economic measures Collor de Mello has said  he will announce Friday to slash crippling inflation, running at 2,700% yearly.  </P> <P> Banks were closed for three days beginning Tuesday to halt frenzied  speculation, and police were called to shops that illegally increased prices.  </P> <P> Collor de Mello, at 40 Brazil's youngest president ever, promised to resolve  the unprecedented economic crisis.  </P> <P> "Inflation is enemy No. 1," he said. "My presidency will wager everything on  victory against this social cancer."  </P> <P> Collor de Mello pledged to combat "corruption and prevarication, paid idlers  who see the state as a source of personal or family gain." He said Brazil will  encourage modernization of the largely state-controlled economy and welcome  foreign investment.  </P> <P> Brazil intends to pay its $114-billion foreign debt, he said, but the country's  growth comes first.  </P> <P> "We don't want confrontation," Collor de Mello said. "But the question is how  much we can pay after we guarantee our economic growth."  </P> <P> Eighteen heads of state or government attended the ceremony. The United States  was represented by Vice President Dan Quayle.  </P> <P> In 1985 Brazil returned to civilian government through an electoral college  vote set up by the departing 21-year military regime and Congress established  the direct vote. Jose Sarney, who became transitional president in 1985, passed  the green and yellow presidential sash to Collor de Mello.  </P> <P> Expectations of a brief wage-and-price freeze, massive layoffs of federal  employees and other drastic measures to cut Brazil's $31-billion budget deficit  sent tremors across the nation of 150 million.  </P> <P> Government officials ordered shop owners not to raise prices, and police  visited stores that failed to heed the warning. Some shops raised prices by as  much as 150%.  </P> <P> Brazilians waited in block-long lines outside automatic bank tellers, where  daily withdrawals were limited to the equivalent of $47 per person.  </P> <P> Labor unions, representing more than half of Brazil's 60-million work force,  threatened to call strikes if wages are frozen.  </P> <P> Business activity slowed as rumors of drastic economic measures swirled across  the country.  </P> <P> Media reports said the Central Bank would devalue the new cruzado by 30%, or  replace the Brazilian currency with another.  </P></p>

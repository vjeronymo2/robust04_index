			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Christopher's Visit to Syria"] </F>   [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrives  in Damascus today. He will be meeting with Zionist authorities  tomorrow after his talks with Syrian officials. During his  visit Christopher will convey the views of the Zionist regime's  authorities to Syrian officials and take their response back to  Tel Aviv. The aim of Christopher's visit is to bring closer the  two sides' positions on the Zionist regime's proposal for a  withdrawal from the Golan Heights by shuttling between Damascus  and Tel Aviv.    During an earlier visit to the region by Christopher, the  Zionist regime proposed promoting a spirit of compromise in the  region. The proposal tried to eliminate the obstacles in the  way of talks with Syria. Syria has linked any talks with the  Zionist regime to that regime's withdrawal from the occupied  Golan Heights. The Zionist regime has proposed a gradual  withdrawal from the Golan Heights, with the withdrawal carried  out over a 10 year period rather than in a single step. Syrian  officials responded by describing the proposal as a plan for  postponing rather than resolving the issue. Stressing their  constant stance, they emphatically called for a swift and total  withdrawal from the Golan region.    At the moment, after the signing of the accord between  'Arafat and the Zionist regime, officials of the Zionist regime  and the White House expect Syria to display more flexibility  about starting talks and announce its agreement with the  proposals that have been put forward. Syria, however, taking  into account the expansionist nature of the Zionist regime, is  doubtful about the proposed plans, which defer a withdrawal from  the Golan Heights.    The Zionist regime has always discussed expanding its  borders  by making pretexts such as maintaining its security and  self-defense, and raises the issue as a vital and strategic  objective. That is why it is futile to hope for that regime's  withdrawal at a time when it has received all the concessions.    On the other hand, although the U.S. is ostensibly exerting  pressure in a responsible way for talks to begin between the  Zionist regime and the Syrian authorities, the Syrians are not  sure that after the talks the necessary pressure on the Zionist  regime will be exerted for its withdrawal from the Golan  Heights, even for a gradual withdrawal. That is why the Syrians  are as doubtful of the U.S. guarantees that any agreements will  be implemented as they are suspicious of Israel professed  willingness to carry out its undertakings.    The liberation of the occupied areas is among Syria's vital  objectives. For reasons of security as well as of honor, Syria  is compelled not to agree to any postponement of the liberation  of the occupied territories.</p>

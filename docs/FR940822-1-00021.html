			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are currently about 22,000 licensees in the United States. About one-third of these are NRC licensees, while the remainder are licensed by Agreement States through agreements entered into under Section 274 of the AEA. Licensees include utilities, nuclear fuel fabricators, universities, medical institutions, radioactive source manufacturers, and companies that use radioisotopes for industrial purposes. About 75 percent of NRC's 6,700 materials licensees use either sealed radioactive sources or small amounts of short-lived radioactive materials. Sealed sources, including items such as check sources, do not pose a contamination problem unless the encapsulation is broken. Decommissioning of these facilities is typically simple because there is usually little or no residual radioactive contamination to be removed and disposed of.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the remaining 25 percent, certain types of facilities (e.g., radioactive source manufacturers, radiopharmaceutical producers, and radioactive ore processors) conduct operations which could produce substantial radioactive contamination in portions of the facilities. At these sites, lands, facilities, or equipment may become contaminated through the use of radioactive material in forms which have not been encapsulated to prevent the spread or dispersal of material. When radioactive material in unsealed forms is used, such as in the nuclear fuel fabrication industry, in production of radiopharmaceutical medicines, or in research, the equipment used to process and handle the material becomes contaminated by the small quantities of material that adhere to surfaces of valves, piping, etc. If material is spilled, then the area of the spill becomes contaminated. These facilities will have to be decontaminated to acceptable levels before they can be released for unrestricted use and their licenses terminated. The population of nuclear fuel cycle facilities which will require decommissioning includes approximately 100 nuclear power plants (at 70 sites); 50 non-power (research and test) reactors; 10 major fuel facilities (fuel fabrication and uranium hexafluoride production plants); 50 uranium mills; and 10 independent spent fuel storage installations. It is estimated that about 1,800 other NRC-licensed facilities could require significant remediation as part of decommissioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Essentially everything that comes in contact with radioactive material must be considered contaminated and checked for the presence of residual radioactive material. Areas surrounding facilities could become contaminated by the movement of materials, equipment, and people into and out of the areas containing the radioactive material. NRC requires that contamination control procedures be used to minimize or prevent the movement of radioactive materials into other areas. Nevertheless, some areas may become contaminated over the course of time due to breakdowns in the control procedures. Contamination may also be spread by the movement of water or other fluids containing the radioactive materials through or along piping, equipment, walls, floors, sumps, drains, etc. In some cases, this has resulted in the release of significant quantities of radioactive material into the ground under or around buildings and facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to contamination, some licensed operations can produce radioactive materials through the process of activation. In this process, materials become radioactive when they are bombarded by neutrons generated in certain nuclear operations. Examples of such operations include nuclear reactors, where metal reinforcing bars in concrete surrounding the reactor vessel may become radioactive through neutron bombardment. These activated materials may also need to be removed or disposed of during decommissioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several hundred NRC and Agreement State licenses are terminated each year. The majority of these licenses involve limited operations, produce little or no radioactive contamination, and do not present complex decommissioning problems or potential risks to public health or the environment from residual contamination. However, as the nuclear industry matures, it is expected that more and more of the larger nuclear facilities that have been operating for a number of years will reach the end of their useful lives and have to be decommissioned. Thus, both the number and complexity of facilities that will require decommissioning are expected to increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC has a program underway to effect timely decommissioning of about 50 sites, which warrant special NRC oversight either because they have not been decommissioned properly in the past or have been engaged in the decommissioning process for an extended period. The Commission has established a Site Decommissioning Management Plan (SDMP), NUREG&hyph;1444, October 1993) for effecting timely decommissioning of these problem facilities. Sites being handled under the SDMP vary in degree of radiologic hazard, cleanup complexity, and cost. Some sites comprise tens of acres that require assessment for radiological contamination, whereas other sites have contamination known to be limited to individual buildings or discrete piles of tailings or contaminated soil. Many sites involve active licenses, but some sites involve formerly licensed sites, or sites where the responsible party is unable or unwilling to perform cleanup. These sites also vary in degree of completion of decommissioning. At some sites, little or no decontamination work has been done; whereas at other sites, decommissioning is underway or license termination is in the offing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

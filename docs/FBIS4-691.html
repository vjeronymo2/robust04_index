			<p>BFN     [Text] KwaZulu Chief Minister and Minister of Police  Mangosuthu Buthelezi has expressed strong reservations about the  deployment of the National Peace Keeping Force [NPKF]. In his  words, Buthelezi says, I have strong reservations about the  deployment of the NPKF where there is still alienation between  the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and ANC. He's accused members  of the NPKF of being former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the  Nation; ANC Military Wing] operatives who had been killing his  supporters. Buthelezi says he's told South African Police  General Johan van der Merwe and SADF [South African Defense  Force] chief General George Meiring he cannot spare members to  serve on the NPKF while there is so much violence around.  Buthelezi says there is controversy surrounding the NPKF as he  had heard that 10 of its members had fired rockets at a hostel  in kwaMashu outside Durban.</p>

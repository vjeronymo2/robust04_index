			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: COMMERCE;  </P> <P> HEARING ON REFUSE TRANSFER SITE PUT OFF  </P> <P> The Commerce Planning Commission has postponed its decision on an environmental  impact report on a proposed refuse transfer station in the west end of the  city.  </P> <P> The hearing was continued until March 22 after a representative of  Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) said the legislator and  community members need more time to review the environmental impact report on  the proposed project.  </P> <P> Laidlaw Waste Systems Inc. is seeking approval to build the plant on the site  of the former Sinclair Paint factory in the 3900 block of Washington Boulevard.  </P> <P> As proposed, small collection trucks operating outside Commerce would deliver  refuse to the station. The trash would then be loaded onto larger trucks and  hauled to the Chiquita Canyon landfill in northern Los Angeles County. The  environmental impact report said the project would have relatively little  impact on noise, air pollution and traffic congestion in the area.  </P></p>

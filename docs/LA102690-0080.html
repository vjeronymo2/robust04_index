			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFF-DUTY OFFICERS LINKED TO ILLEGAL BINGO ACTIVITIES;  </P> <P> INQUIRY: POLICE ORDER AN INVESTIGATION OF WITNESSES' ALLEGATIONS THAT LAWMEN  AND THEIR WIVES RECEIVED FAVORS AND PAY FROM THE WOODLAND HILLS OPERATION.  </P> <P> A spokesman said Thursday that the Los Angeles Police Department will initiate  an internal inquiry into accusations that off-duty officers and their wives  were aware of alleged illegal activities at the city's biggest bingo parlor and  enjoyed financial favors there.  </P> <P> Witnesses testifying at a hearing Thursday afternoon that could lead to the  revocation of the bingo license of Identity Inc. in Woodland Hills told a  reporter outside the hearing room that the wives of two officers were on the  payroll of the bingo operator. They said the spouses of other officers got to  play for free at the games. All the involved officers were working off-duty as  security guards at the bingo parlor.  </P> <P> Police spokesman William Booth said in an interview with The Times, "There's an  appearance of possible impropriety here that warrants an inquiry by the  department." He said he would "initiate an appropriate preliminary inquiry"  today.  </P> <P> But the police officers are expected to testify later that they saw nothing  improper. An attorney for the bingo parlor said the accusers are lying and  stole money.  </P> <P> The allegations were made in interviews with The Times by three witnesses who  testified Thursday on behalf of the city's Department of Social Services, which  is seeking to revoke the bingo license of the nonprofit corporation.  </P> <P> The charity raises funds from its bingo games -- conducted three times a week  -- to help disabled people. City records show Identity's bingo proceeds since  1982, when the organization first employed the game of chance for fund raising,  have amounted to $28.7 million. That is 19.7% of the total bingo proceeds  earned by all other charities in the city over the same period.  </P> <P> The city's complaint against Identity states that the nonprofit corporation  violated state law by paying its workers from its bingo proceeds. As part of an  effort to keep bingo charitable, state law bars bingo operators from paying  their workers.  </P> <P> One former Identity worker, Sylvia Dean, who also sat on the group's board of  directors, testified that she was paid $900 a week in cash by Edith Ryan,  Identity's founder and president.  </P> <P> Ryan has denied that she paid her workers and says that she is the victim of a  plot by disgruntled former workers. Her attorneys, during cross-examination  Thursday, accused Ryan's accusers of lying and stealing money from her -- not  getting paid by her.  </P> <P> The city's case against Identity does not implicate the officers or their wives  in any wrongdoing -- rather the witnesses have done so on their own.  </P> <P> Asked if he was aware of allegations that police officers may have known about  improprieties, Robert Burns, Social Services Department general manager, said,  "No comment."  </P> <P> The charity, which was the target of an unsuccessful license revocation  proceeding in 1984, plans to call as defense witnesses several officers who  worked off-duty as security guards, according to Ryan's attorneys.  </P> <P> The license revocation hearing will be a "big credibility contest" between Ryan  and her police officer allies and Ryan's accusers, said J. Patrick Francis,  Ryan's other attorney.  </P> <P> But the license question may eventually take a back seat to the kinds of  allegations made Thursday by the city's three main witnesses -- all former  Identity workers.  </P> <P> Cindy Houseman, one of the three, told The Times that she and her co-workers  talked about getting paid within hearing range of the officers. "We talked  about it in front of them," Houseman said.  </P> <P> "They couldn't help but know," Dean told The Times. "They knew that 'Go get  your paperwork' was the code word for picking up our pay."  </P> <P> Dean also testified under oath that there was "constant" talk about the illegal  payments among the workers, including Sharon Brosnon, the wife of Officer Bob  Brosnon.  </P> <P> Sharon Brosnon worked at Identity's bingo games as did Mindy Brazner, wife of  Officer Steve Brazner. City records show Mindy Brazner and Sharon Brosnon  worked at Identity as "volunteers" while their husbands were working as  security guards for the charity.  </P> <P> Outside the hearing, Houseman and Deborah Basham said they had seen both  Brazner and Brosnon being paid.  </P> <P> Thirteen current and retired Los Angeles officers were named by the city's  witnesses as having worked for Identity. It is legal for a bingo operator to  contract to pay for security from bingo proceeds. And there is no law or Police  Department rule that forbids off-duty officers from working as security guards  at bingo games.  </P> <P> However, police spokesman Booth said his concern was whether Police Department  personnel knew of possible illegal payments.  </P> <P> Dean also told The Times that she was instructed by Ryan not to charge  admission to the wives of other officers who were also working on Identity's  security detail.  </P> <P> Deborah Basham, another city witness, said "all the security wives played for  free, and all the volunteers wives or husbands played for free too."  </P></p>

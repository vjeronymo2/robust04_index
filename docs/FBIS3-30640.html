			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, February 4 (BTA) -- A frontpage story in  DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS),  reports that within days the National Investigative Service  (NIS) will launch an inquiry into cases of busting the  Yugo-embargo. The daily quotes NIS Director Ani Kruleva as  confirming that her service had evidence of embargo violations.  "We received records from the prosecutor's office and we will  institute proceedings," Mrs. Kruleva is quoted as saying.  According to DEMOKRATSIYA, "this terse statement implies  questions, the answers to which would blast Lyuben Berov's  government." A SDS MP told the daily that "Bulgaria has always  stated that it observes the Yugo-embargo and does not violate it  at the state level, but there is indisputable evidence of  companies and mafia groups busting the embargo, smuggling not  just fuel but weapons as well." "The government assumed  responsibility for the blunders of the Interior Ministry, which  is not employed to enforce law and order in the country but to  help mafia groups. Now the cabinet will have to suffer the  consequences," the MP is quoted as saying.    The Socialist daily DUMA gives prominence to an attempted  export of 648 tonnes of ammonium nitrate to Serbia by the Sofia  company Navamex. Quoting the chief of the Committee on  Standardization and Metrology, the daily says that the  fertilizer was loaded on 17 wagons in 50 kg sacks and was  documented as washing powder. The train was stopped on January  1 at the Dragoman Checkpoint (on the Serbian border) as the  shipment did not have a certificate issued by the laboratory of  the Committee on Standardization and Metrology. The daily points  out that a new procedure effective February 1 was introduced for  getting export permits for Serbia and Montenegro, according to  which the UN Sanctions Committee will be the only authority  competent to clear such exports.    In an interview for the trade union daily TRUD, Henning  Stanislawski, deputy head of the UN Sanctions Assistance Mission  (SAMCOM) in Bulgaria, tells about an incident in which UN  monitors patrolling Bulgaria's border were chased when they  wanted to check a petrol-carrying train bound for Yugoslavia in  Dragoman. When they started checking the wagon numbers and  documents, unknown persons chased the SAMCOM officials from the  border back to Sofia. Still, Mr. Stanislawski points out that  the mission is working well with the Bulgarian authorities.</p>

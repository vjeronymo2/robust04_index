			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee and  provincial government yesterday called a provincial meeting on  family planning. Governor He Zhiqiang addressed the meeting,  stressing that all local authorities in the province must  further intensify family planning, tighten control over  population growth, improve the quality of the population, and  strive hard for the sustained and wholesome economic development  of the province.    In his speech, He Zhiqiang first iterated the necessity of  correctly evaluating the situation in family planning work in  the province. He said that over the past few years, party  committees and governments at all levels in this province have  conscientiously implemented instructions prescribed in the  relevant documents issued by the central authorities and the  State Council, as well as Yunnan Province's regulations on  family planning, and have introduced a stable policy toward  child bearing, thus basically checking the trend of excessively  high population growth. However, we must also be clearly aware  that our province is facing a grim situation regarding  population growth. At present, we are in the third baby boom,  with the population of married women of child-bearing age  continuing to increase. In addition, our province has scarce  human resources to attend to family planning at the grass-roots  level, and birth control is particularly difficult in minority  nationality areas and impoverished areas. Therefore, we are  undertaking very arduous tasks.    He Zhiqiang pointed out that the population issue is both a  social and economic issue. Since reform and opening up, our  province has enjoyed relatively rapid economic growth. From  1989 to 1992, our province's gross industrial and agricultural  output value increased by a wider margin than the average  standard in the country. However, because of excessive  population growth, our province's aggregate per-capita economic  growth is 14 percentage points lower than the national average.  Therefore, local governments at all levels must ensure that the  principle of paying attention to both production and population  growth is embodied in strategic planning and actual work. We  must carry out family planning with real earnest as if we are  dealing with the issues of economic construction, reform and  opening, and social progress so as to ensure a harmonious  balance between population growth and economic and social  development. [passage omitted]    During the meeting, Vice Governor Huang Bingsheng delivered  a  speech entitled: Sum up Experiences, Make Persistent Efforts,  and Lifting our Province's Family Planning Work to a New Level.    Liang Jinquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, presided over yesterday's meeting. Also present at  the meeting were Yang Ming, vice chairman of the provincial  people's congress standing committee; Chen Liying, vice  chairwoman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference provincial committee; and former leading persons of  the provincial authorities, (Gao Zhiguo) and Li Guiying.</p>

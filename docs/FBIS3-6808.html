The minister will, however, join the President during his  Beijing trip scheduled for early next week, he said.    The official said Han Sunday suggested that he would rather  stay in Seoul this weekend, which may be a critical point in the  future development of the North Korean nuclear issue.    He said the international community is expected to move  toward taking some kind of measures against North Korea this  week, The U.N. Security Council may convene to hear reports from  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the results of  its recent inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities.    The official said Minister Han might have felt that it would  be more convenient for him to hold consultations at home with  the United States and other countries on their joint strategy to  persuade Beijing to join international measures against North  Korea prior to his China visit next week.</p>

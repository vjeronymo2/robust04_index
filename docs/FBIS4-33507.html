			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 6 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban Border Guards  Unit refrained from attacking a vessel on which 61 persons fled  the island last weekend, a government source said today.    The guards, who had sighted minors aboard, limited  themselves  to escorting the vessel until it had left Cuban jurisdictional  waters.    The U.S. Coast Guard rescued the vessel on Saturday in  international waters off the Florida Keys; there were seven  wounded aboard. The Cuban Foreign Ministry refused to comment  on the incident.</p>

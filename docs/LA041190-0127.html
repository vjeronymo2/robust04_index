			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> Tharp Works Moving to Chicago: Hubbard Street Dance Company will announce "a  major artistic collaboration" with choreographer Twyla Tharp at a press  conference this morning at the company's headquarters in Chicago. Sources close  to the company report that the announcement will involve Hubbard Street's  acquisition of modern-dance works that Tharp created in the 1970s for her own  company -- a company she disbanded in 1988 to become artistic associate at  American Ballet Theater. "It's a major artistic initiative for Hubbard Street,"  said Gail Kalver, the company's general manager. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

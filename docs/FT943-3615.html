			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Mid Assets in talks over acquisition Midland Assets, which was created in May to acquire four nursing homes from Northern Leisure, said yesterday that it was in talks that might lead to 'a substantial acquisition.' It is understood that the talks could end in a reverse takeover. An announcement is expected by the end of next week. Midland Assets is chaired by Mr Nicholas Oppenheim, also vice-chairman of Northern Leisure. It paid Pounds 1.9m in cash for the RealCare nursing homes business, which Northern had been trying to sell for two years. The company, which raised Pounds 2.4m via an intermediaries offer of ordinary shares, said at the time that it was looking for opportunities that either had above average possibilit-ies for medium term growth, or were likely to generate steady but increasing income. Yesterday the shares closed at 21.5p, up 1p.</p>

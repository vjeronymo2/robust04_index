			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets: After the storms, the calm . . . - Wall Street SIGHS OF relief rumbled round Wall Street all week. First, there were no more riots, only the sad repairwork which followed one of America's most uneasy weekends. Second, there were no surprises on the economic front, just further confirmation that the nation is inching its way out of recession. The one disappointment was the absence of any additional reduction in interest rates. By mid-week, hopes that the authorities would insure against any slackening in the recovery by easing credit further had become widespread. This could have had the effect of pushing down competing yields, giving the stock market a compensating fillip. But it was not to be - and on the economic evidence unveiled last week, such action would barely have been justified, weakness in US money supply figures notwithstanding. On Thursday, for example, the nation's retailers, reporting April sales figures, showed fairly heartening advances. A day later, the April jobs data also demonstrated a more healthy trend. On the retail front, comparisons are muddied by the shift in Easter spending from March in 1991 to April this year; to the lousy spring weather so far in 1992; and to the impact of the Gulf War on consumer confidence last year. But those caveats aside, most of the big retail chains saw same-store sales rise by anything from 5 to 13 per cent. Only Sears, Roebuck, the troubled Chicago-based group whose management has been the target of shareholder dissatisfaction, moved in the wrong direction, posting a 2.1 per cent drop. It was scarcely the best augury ahead of Sears' annual meeting next Thursday, and the group's shares eased to Dollars 42 3/8 on Friday morning, down Dollars 1 on the week. Friday's unemployment figures were equally upbeat. Non-farm payrolls grew by 126,000 last month, while most pundits had pitched their forecasts at about half this number. March non-farm payrolls were revised upwards. And the overall unemployment rate fell to 7.2 per cent in April, compared with 7.3 per cent in the previous month. Some analysts had suggested that it would remain static. Not surprisingly, the bond market weakened initially - although, by lunchtime, the long bond yield was still shy of the 8 per cent mark. Most pundits believe that the relatively strong employment report will stay the Federal Reserve's hand in the immediate future, although views differ on whether another easing is now ruled out in the future. If interest rate reductions are postponed (or omitted), it seems unlikely that Wall Street will show much progress. The Dow Jones Industrial Index moved to a new high of 3,378.13 by Monday's close - in part, a reaction to Friday's sell-off and relief that rioting in Los Angeles had stopped. But, despite the subsequent interest rate speculation, the stock market failed to follow through in any of the following sessions. Instead, the Dow yo-yoed its way to the 3,365 mark by Friday lunchtime. 'Even the rampant bulls have to be concerned about the lack of follow-through,' commented one trader. Signs that a plateau has been reached may be most apparent in the new issue market. In the first few months of the year, this became a hubbub of activity as companies rushed new equity to the market, tapping eager investors for much-needed capital. This week, however, Payless Cashways, a well-known building materials retailer which was taken private via a management buyout in 1988, joined a lengthening list of companies which have recently cancelled stock market flotations. The company, which had planned to raise over Dollars 400m, cited market conditions. The Payless action follows that of GPM Gas, a unit of Phillips Petroleum, and seems to confirm fears that the new issue market is turning sticky. There is, moreover, the huge Dollars 2bn-plus General Motors issue to get away later this month, while recent estimates have suggested that the total backlog of shares still up for sale tops Dollars 13bn. Somehow, supply and demand do not seem to be in the same happy proportions which drove the market upwards earlier this year.  --------------------------------------- Monday      3378.13   +   42.04 Tuesday     3359.35   -   18.78 Wednesday   3369.41   +   10.06 Thursday    3363.37   -    6.04 Friday      3369.41   +    6.04  ---------------------------------------</p>

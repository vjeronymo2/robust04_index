			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 13 May (NOTIMEX) -- Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Fernando Naranjo has called the appointment of Emile  Jonassaint as acting president of Haiti disgraceful. Jonassaint  took the oath of office last Wednesday.    Naranjo told the media that "the international democratic  community cannot accept this maneuver by the Haitian military,  led by General Raoul Cedras. It is intended to impose upon the  country a president who does not represent the will of the  people."    He added that "we cannot accept this new show of force by  the  Haitian military. We condemn the arbitrary appointment of  Jonassaint and share the hope for a return to democracy in this  Caribbean nation."    Naranjo affirmed that the Haitian crisis has had a  detrimental affect on the people, who "grow ever poorer and  suffer the tragedy of watching their civil rights diminished and  violated every day."</p>

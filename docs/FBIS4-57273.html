			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 16 May (EFE) -- A car bomb exploded today,  Monday, in front of the Bank of Credit in San Borja district in  Lima. There were no reports of injuries. The explosion affected  nearby shops and residences, and the police have cordoned off  the area to establish the amount of explosives used.    The car used in the attack was a 1970 "Hillman" that was  stolen yesterday from a noncommissioned police officer.    Another car bomb exploded on 15 May in the Miraflores  residential district, causing damage to a pension fund building  and to nearby shops and residences, but there were no reports of  injuries, either.    The series of attacks are attributed to the armed Maoist  group Shining Path, on the eve of 17 May, the 14th anniversary  of its first attack. In those 14 years, more than 30,000 have  died and $20 million have been reported in losses caused by  attacks or acts of sabotage.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA-ISRAEL MILITARY TIES  </P> <P> Jack Salem (letter, Feb. 14) criticizes Halford Fairchild ("Overcoming  Captivity to the Worst in Us," Op-Ed Page, Feb. 2) for "singling out Israel"  and its ties to South Africa. No matter how vehemently Salem and others seek to  deny this, the history of Israel and South Africa manifests a bond between the  two nations that distinguishes them from all others.  </P> <P> In 1976, comprehensive accords were signed by Israel and South Africa that  created a standing ministerial committee that meets annually. Pursuant to some  of these agreements, South Africa underwrites Israeli military research and  development in exchange for a full range of modern weaponry.  </P> <P> In 1977, the United Nations passed a mandatory arms embargo against South  Africa. Israel has repeatedly violated this mandate, equipping the white  minority government with a number of weapons, including missiles, several kinds  of aircraft, long-range missile boats and other lethal equipment. Israelis have  also trained South African troops and provided advisers to the apartheid state  in its military attacks against Angola.  </P> <P> The dollar value of Israel's military trade with South Africa have been  published in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. In 1985, the  figure provided was $250 million, while the estimate for 1986 was $400-$800  million.  </P> <P> More than any other nation, Israel has provided South Africa with the military  wherewithal to oppress its black majority. African Americans who raise this  issue are not anti-Semitic; they simply do not understand how Jews can justify  cooperating with a government, many of whose members are not only racist, but  also blatant Nazi sympathizers.  </P> <P> DAVID L.

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metals soar in hectic trading at LME In one of the most frenetic days on the London Metal Exchange in living memory, prices soared yesterday as wave after wave of investment fund and speculative buying took copper, aluminium and lead to fresh four-year peaks and nickel and zinc to their highest levels for two years. Copper started the charge, surging by 3 per cent from its overnight price level, and this triggered new enthusiasm for other LME metals. 'Everything went berserk,' said one trader. There were good fundamental reasons for copper's price rise, analysts suggested. But they questioned the ability of the other metals to sustain last night's price levels for long. 'There has been indiscriminate buying by the funds because metals are supposed to be an attractive investment,' said Mr Jim Lennon, analyst at Macquarie Equities. He pointed out that only copper and aluminium stocks on the LME were lower now than at the end of 1993. Lead, nickel, tin and zinc stocks were all 20 per cent higher and nickel stocks were close to their record. Questions were also being asked about when the funds might take their considerable profits on copper and aluminium and possibly send prices plummeting. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said it would be reasonable to expect a great deal of profit-taking by December 16 so that the funds could include the benefits in their December-quarter results. 'But maybe they have protected their profits by option trading and we might go into the New Year and face an even bigger eventual drop.' Mr Arnold added, however: 'It takes a brave man to predict when the drop will come and by how much'. There were some suggestions that copper's price was being manipulated by an artificially-created squeeze. There were rumours that a large Japanese trading house and one or two US financial institutions were involved. The tightness of supply was indicated by the premium being paid last night for copper for immediate delivery compared with three months metal - Dollars 71.5 a tonne. Asked if the LME was worried, Mr David King, the chief executive, said: 'We are always monitoring all markets but we are looking at copper more closely at the moment'. The exchange has the power to intervene if it believes a 'disorderly' market is developing. Nevertheless, most analysts insisted that the copper supply tightness was genuine. Mr Lennon pointed out that there had been a fall of 336,000 tonnes in combined LME and New York Commodity Exchange stocks since the start of the year. 'Stocks could be at their lowest for 30 years in the first half of 1995,' he warned. The squeeze would only ease when new production capacity came into operation in the second half of next year. In the meantime copper's price could rise to more than Dollars 1.50 a pound (Dollars 3,306 a tonne).</p>

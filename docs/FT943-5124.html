			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Westland to bid for UK contract - FT reporters on projects unveiled yesterday at the Farnborough Air Show Westland, the UK helicopter maker, has formed a team to bid for the Pounds 2bn (Dollars 3.1bn) contract for 91 attack helicopters for the British Army. The group, called Team Apache, brings together McDonnell Douglas, Martin Marietta and Westinghouse of the US with Westland and Shorts of Belfast to offer the Longbow Apache helicopter for the Ministry of Defence competition. Mr Alan Jones, Westland's chief executive, said that if the Apache won the contract Pounds 1bn of work would come directly to UK companies working on the programme, with a further Pounds 1bn of contracts placed for other work. Over 100 UK companies have already committed themselves to bids for the 300 work packages available of the Apache, including Rolls-Royce, Lucas, Racal Electronics, Smiths Industries, Hunting Engineering and Royal Ordnance. The competition is between the Apache, the Bell Cobra Venom in co-operation with GEC, the BAe-Eurocopter Tiger and the Denel-Marshalls Rooi-valk from South Africa. The Apache is thought to be the favourite with the army. Final bids must be in early in the autumn, with a final decision expected to be made next spring. 'Westland Apache can be delivered to meet the British Army's preferred in-service date of 1998,' said Mr Jones. He also stressed that with the Apache in service with the US army and other forces worldwide, the helicopter was a low-risk choice. The Apache was on show at Farnborough, having been flown in from the US in a giant C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Industrial unrest could be serious, Jakarta told Indonesia, under the spotlight as the US ponders whether to remove trading privileges, is facing its worst industrial unrest in recent years, diplomats and labour experts said yesterday, Reuter reports from Jakarta. Thousands of workers went on strike this week accusing employers of failing to pay the new minimum wage, forcing President Suharto and his army chief to enter the fray by warning businessmen to abide by the new ruling. Indonesia's main independent union has called for a nationwide strike next week. 'It's going to get worse before it gets better. It's clear the government is worried about the extent of this (unrest),' a diplomat said. Washington, critical of Indonesia's labour policy, will decide on February 15 whether to suspend trading privileges under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). Indonesia, afraid of similar sanctions from Europe, has passed a flurry of reforms in the hope of convincing Washington not to act. Last month it repealed a controversial decree allowing the armed forces to intervene in labour disputes. It has reformed the only officially recognised union, the All Indonesia Labour Union, or SPSI, in the hope of broadening its role. It has ordered a 27 per cent increase in the minimum wage for workers in the industrial heartland of west Java, effective from January 1. Companies in 10 other provinces must raise their minimum wage by April 1. Executives at PT Kahatex, a textile factory in Bandung, 80 miles south-east of Jakarta, said 2,000 strikers went back to work yesterday after two days of protest in which offices were ransacked. In its annual report on human rights, Washington this week accused Indonesia of widespread abuses and included a tough criticism of its labour record. Manpower Minister Abdul Latief has given West Java companies until February 12 to comply with the new wage laws, or face fines.</p>

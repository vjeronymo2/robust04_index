			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULINARY SOS: FROM TRADER JOE'S, A BAKLAVA OF MORE HEROIC PROPORTION  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: That anemic recipe for baklava you printed won't do at all. Here is  the best one around. It originally came from Trader Joe's, back when they used  to give out occasional recipes, but most of the instructions are mine. This is  the best. Trust me.  </P> <P>  -- DEE  </P> <P> DEAR DEE: Sure, I trust you. That's because Trader Joe's baklava was a booming  success when we tested the recipe. Hardly a morsel was left after the test  kitchen tasters got through with it. So thanks for the recommendation. We'll  add the recipe to those among our best.  </P> <P> TRADER JOE'S HEROIC BAKLAVA  </P> <P> 1 pound filo dough  </P> <P> 1/2 pound margarine (preferably all-natural margarine), melted  </P> <P> Nut Filling  </P> <P> Syrup  </P> <P> Unwrap filo dough and fold in half, like pages of book. Keep covered with dry  kitchen towel while working. Turn over one sheet. Brush with melted margarine,  using soft 1 1/2- to 2-inch brush.  </P> <P> Continue turning sheets (pages) and brushing with margarine until 1/3 have been  used. Lay flat in bottom of buttered 13x9-inch baking pan. Cover with 1/2 Nut  Filling.  </P> <P> Brush another 1/3 of pages and place over nuts in pan, laying flat. Top with  remaining Nut Filling. Brush remaining pages and lay flat on top. Brush top  sheet with remaining margarine.  </P> <P> With sharp knife, score pastry into diamonds, without quite cutting through to  bottom. (To make diagonals, cut parallel horizontal cuts across pan, then cross  diagonally at each horizontal point).  </P> <P> Bake at 350 degrees 35 to 40 minutes or until puffed, crisp and deep golden in  color. Immediately remove from oven and pour cooled Syrup over baklava. Let  stand 4 hours. When cool, cut through to bottom layer in scored cuts. Makes  about 24 pieces.  </P> <P> Nut Filling  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds roasted, unsalted walnuts, coarsely chopped or ground  </P> <P> 1 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves  </P> <P> Combine nuts, sugar, cinnamon and cloves.  </P> <P> Syrup  </P> <P> 1 cup honey  </P> <P> 3/4 cup water  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sugar  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 small piece lemon peel  </P> <P> 1 small piece orange peel  </P> <P> 1 inch piece cinnamon stick  </P> <P> Combine honey, water, sugar, lemon juice, lemon and orange peels and cinnamon  stick in saucepan. Simmer 10 minutes. When syrup has cooled, discard peels and  cinnamon stick.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I gave my recipe for Corn Beef to my daughter who lives in Japan. It  contains parsnips and hope you can locate it.  </P> <P>  -- CELINE  </P> <P> DEAR CELINE: Here's the recipe from a column by Merle Ellis, "The Butcher."  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER'S CORNED BEEF WITH VEGETABLES  </P> <P> 5 or 6 pounds corned beef brisket or rump  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, slivered  </P> <P> 1 onion studded with 2 cloves  </P> <P> 7 to 9 carrots  </P> <P> 6 to 8 small white onions  </P> <P> 6 to 8 turnips and/or parsnips  </P> <P> 6 to 8 potatoes, peeled  </P> <P> 1 head cabbage, cut into 6 to 8 pieces (do not remove core)  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Rinse meat in cold running water. Slash in several places with point of sharp  knife and insert slivers of garlic. Place in large pot, cover with cold water  and bring to boil over high heat. Add onions and 1 carrot, cover and simmer 2  hours, removing any scum that forms.  </P> <P> Rinse and scrub or peel remaining carrots, onions, turnips, potatoes and  cabbage. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover with water and set aside.  </P> <P> Forty-five minutes before corned beef is done, place all vegetables except  cabbage in separate pot. Bring to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer. About 20  minutes before corn beef is done, add cabbage.  </P> <P> To serve, drain and slice corned beef. Drain vegetables and arrange around  sliced meat on hot serving platter or in big pot. Makes about 20 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Serve with variety of mustards, pickles, black bread and beer.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: Now that school is resumed, how about a granola bar recipe like the  ones you find in the stores. Homemade ones should be a lot more economical and  nutritious.  </P> <P>  -- MONICA  </P> <P> DEAR MONICA: You said it.  </P> <P> GRANOLA BARS  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1/4 cup honey  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1 cup flour  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon baking powder  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups bite-size crispy bran squares, crushed to 1/2 cup  </P> <P> 1/2 cup raisins  </P> <P> 1/2 cup flake coconut  </P> <P> 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons sunflower nuts  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons sesame seeds  </P> <P> Cream together butter and brown sugar. Beat in honey, egg and vanilla.  </P> <P> Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, soda and cereal. Add to creamed  mixture. Stir in raisins, coconut and 1/4 cup sunflower nuts.  </P> <P> Spread evenly in greased 13x9-inch baking pan. Sprinkle sesame seeds and  remaining 3 tablespoons sunflower nuts evenly over top.  </P> <P> Bake at 350 degrees 15 to 20 minutes or until wood pick inserted in center  comes out clean and top is lightly browned. Cool. Cut into bars. Makes 24 bars.  </P></p>

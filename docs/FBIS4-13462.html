			<p>BFN     [Text] Ismailia, 20 Apr (MENA) -- Qatari Foreign Minister  Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani stressed that his country favors  the Suez Canal as an Arab and international maritime route and  supports the efforts to increase Egypt's revenue from it.    In a telephone call he made today to the Suez Canal  Authority  [SCA] chairman, Engineer Muhammad 'Izzat 'Adil, the Qatari  minister said that Qatar has postponed discussion of a project  to build a pipeline to carry Qatar's natural gas to Italy  following a recent offer from the SCA giving a 30.5 percent  reduction to Qatari gas tankers using the Suez Canal.    Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim added that the project to build a  pipeline to carry Qatari gas to Europe through Israel is merely  a project, the implementation of which is linked with Israel's  withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and  does not aim to damage the Suez Canal, because the latter "is  all the Arabs' canal."    The Qatari foreign minister stressed that his country will  take no step on this project without considering the interests  of the Arab countries, especially Egypt. He added that Arab and  foreign media have exaggerated this issue.    The Qatari foreign minister's telephone call was made  following press statements by Engineer Muhammad 'Izzat 'Adil in  which he expressed his concern about the negative consequences  of building a pipeline to carry Qatari natural gas to Europe  through Israel.</p>

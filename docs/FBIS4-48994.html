			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 30 (XINHUA)--Chinese and British  airport experts are contacting each other on the issue of Hong  Kong's new airport and some progress has been made, a Hong  Kong-based Chinese official said here today.    Guo Fengmin, senior representative of the Chinese team of  the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), told reporters that the  JLG Airport Committee will meet in a few weeks but the specific  date has yet to be decided.    Guo said he was optimistic about future agreements on the  airport issue although differences remain between the two sides.    The airport issue is quite complicated and covers a wide  range of fields including investments, debts, land approval,  management ordinance and other issues, which are interrelated,  Guo noted.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market report Three-month COPPER fell below expected support around Dollars 2,420 a tonne on the LME as New York opened lower yesterday afternoon. Sentiment was depressed by Chinese liquidation and increased supplies of Russian metal. Prices stabilised on the late kerb, but still closed at Dollars 2,414, down Dollars 46 from Wednesday and only Dollars 2 above the day's low. Analysts say the next major downside objective is Dollars 2,380. ZINC also weakened with sentiment depressed by this week's general decline in the base metals. The premium for cash metal over three-month narrowed, but traders still see the market vulnerable to renewed tightness in the final quarter. Analysts say there is a band of technical support between Dollars 1,310 and Dollars 1,320, which is also likely to cushion declines. London's robusta COFFEE rebounded from earlier losses after New York arabicas stooped to new lows but managed to uncover some light buying. But most active near November showed little inclination to break out of its current Dollars 770 to Dollars 800 range. PLATINUM was easier in London after running into profit-taking following its advance earlier in the week.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Boeing Upgrading Plant: Boeing Co., facing booming orders for its jumbo jets,  said it will spend $300 million to upgrade its manufacturing facilities to  compete better in the aerospace industry. The Seattle-based company is  suffering from a huge backlog of orders because of burgeoning demand for its  wide-body passenger jets. Boeing said it will upgrade its assembly plant, based  in Renton, Wash., in the most extensive refurbishing since the site was  constructed during World War II. The plans call for Boeing to build a third  final-assembly structure, an extension to the assembly building for the 737, a  facility to clean, seal and paint aircraft wings, a six-story parking garage  and a 580-foot blast fence on north Renton Field to protect workers testing  planes' engines.  </P></p>

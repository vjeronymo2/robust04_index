			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Dalgety in talks to buy BP petcare business DALGETY, the food and agriculture group, is in talks with British Petroleum over the purchase of its Paragon Petcare business for between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m. The company hopes to complete the purchase within the next five weeks. Paragon is one of the few remaining businesses in the BP Nutrition division, which the company put up for sale a year ago. Paragon has sales of Pounds 103m spread across Europe and makes a profit, although neither company would reveal how much. Dalgety holds a 25 per cent share of the UK market with its Spillers Petfoods group and its main Winalot brand, with roughly 8 per cent of the European market. 'There are several elements we find attractive . . . it will give us a much wider geographical spread throughout Europe and a management presence in Europe,' said Mr John Martin, Dalgety's finance director. Paragon has its headquarters in Bunnick, the Netherlands, with plants in the UK, Germany and France. It will also add to Dalgety's presence in branded dry petfoods with its Beta product in the UK market where the agriculture company has not such a strong presence. BP has sold its main nutrition businesses leaving a few peripheral companies active in fish farming and chicken breeding still to sell. Earlier this year, it sold Purina Mills, the largest supplier of animal feeds in the US, to the Sterling group, a venture capital organisation.</p>

Addressing members of the Italian community on Sunday [13  March], in Durban, Mr Schutte said the National Party would  accomodate some of the IFP leaders in the candidate list for the  national assembly. He said several IFP leaders have indicated  willingness to join the National Party, but declined to say who  had made approaches to join the NP.    Meanwhile, it appears the NP is not the only party which has  been approached by top level IFP members. Democratic Party  candidate for the national list, Kobus Jordaan, said his party  has also been approached.</p>

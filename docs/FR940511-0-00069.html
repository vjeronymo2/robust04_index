			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fifth activity prohibited is drilling into, dredging or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise altering the seabed of the Sanctuary; or constructing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placing or abandoning any structure, material or other matter on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the seabed of the Sanctuary, except if any of the above results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidentally from: (1) Anchoring vessels; (2) traditional fishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations; (3) installation of navigation aids; (4) harbor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance in the areas necessarily associated with Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects in existence on the effective date of Sanctuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation, including dredging of entrance channels and harbors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and repair, replacement or rehabilitation of breakwaters and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jetties; (5) construction, repair, replacement, enhancement or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation of boat launches, docks or piers and associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breakwaters and jetties; or (6) beach nourishment projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to harbor maintenance activities. Federal projects are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any water resources development projects conducted by the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Army Corps of Engineers or operating under a permit or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization issued by the Corps of Engineers and authorized by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of this prohibition is to protect the resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and qualities of the Sanctuary from the harmful effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities such as, but not limited to, archaeological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excavations, drilling into the seabed, strip mining, laying of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pipelines and outfalls, and offshore commercial development,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which may disrupt and/or destroy sensitive marine benthic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitats, such as kelp beds, invertebrate populations, fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitats and estuaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sixth activity prohibited is taking marine mammals, sea  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turtles or seabirds in or above the Sanctuary, except as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized by NMFS or USFWS under the authority of the Marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mammal Protection Act, as amended, (MMPA), 16 U.S.C. 1361  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Endangered Species Act, as amended, (ESA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended, (MBTA), 16 U.S.C. 703  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or pursuant to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treaty with an Indian tribe to which the United States is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party, provided that the treaty right is exercised in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the MMPA, ESA and MBTA, to the extent that they apply. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term ``taking'' includes all forms of harassment. The MMPA, ESA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and MBTA prohibit the taking of species protected under those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acts. The prohibition overlaps with the MMPA, ESA and MBTA but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also extends protection for Sanctuary resources on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmentally holistic basis and provides a greater deterrent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with civil penalties of up to $100,000 per taking. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition covers all marine mammals, sea turtles and seabirds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in or above the Sanctuary. The prohibition recognizes existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treaty rights to hunt marine mammals, sea turtles and seabirds to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extent that the treaty rights have not been abrogated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the MMPA, ESA or MBTA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The seventh activity prohibited is flying motorized aircraft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at less than 2,000 feet (610m) both above the Sanctuary within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one nautical mile of the Flattery Rocks, Quillayute Needles or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copalis National Wildlife Refuge, or within one nautical mile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seaward of the coastal boundary of the Sanctuary, except as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for valid law enforcement purposes, for activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to tribal timber operations conducted on reservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands, or to transport persons or supplies to or from reservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands as authorized by a governing body of an Indian tribe. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition is designed to limit potential noise impacts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly those that might startle hauled-out seals and sea  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lions, and colonial seabirds along the shoreline margins of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sanctuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the eighth and ninth prohibitions serve to facilitate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement actions for violations of Sanctuary regulations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eighth prohibition is the possession within the Sanctuary of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historical resource or marine mammal, sea turtle or seabird,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of where the resource was taken, except in compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the MMPA, ESA and MBTA and the ninth prohibition is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interfering with, obstructing, delaying or preventing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigations, searches, seizures or disposition of seized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property in connection with enforcement of the Act or any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation or permit issued under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 925.6 authorizes the regulation, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition, on a temporary basis of any activity where necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to prevent or minimize the destruction of, loss of, or injury to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a Sanctuary resource or quality, or minimize the imminent risk of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such destruction, loss or injury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 925.7 sets for the maximum statutory civil penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for violating a regulation_$100,000. Each day of a continuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation constitutes a separate violation. Section 925.8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeats the provision in section 312 of the Act that any person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who destroys, causes the loss of, or injures any sanctuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource is liable to the United States for response costs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damages resulting from such destruction, loss or injury, and any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel used to destroy, cause the loss of, or injure any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctuary resource is liable in rem to the United States for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response costs and damages resulting from such destruction, loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or injury. The purpose of these sections is to draw the public's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attention to the liability for violating a Sanctuary regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations setting forth the procedures governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative proceedings for assessment of civil penalties,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit sanctions and denials for enforcement reasons, issuance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and use of written warnings, and release or forfeiture of seized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property appear in 15 CFR part 904.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

"The foreign ministers of the Russian Federation and the  Republic of Uzbekistan confirm the principled stand of their  states on non- interference in internal affairs of Afghanistan  and express profound concern with a new outburst of armed  confrontation there...    "They call for termination of fratricidal war in Afghanistan  and insistently urge all Afghan military-political forces to  abandon the stake on force methods and begin a joint search for  political compromises in the name of national consolidation and  reconciliation.    "The sides believe that the conflict in Afghanistan is a  consequence of domestic contradictions and it threatens to  security and stability in the region.

The sides intend to keep  to strict neutrality and the principle of non-interference in  internal affairs of Afghanistan."    Russia and Uzbekistan expressed their readiness for maximum  assistance to the settlement of Afghan differences and the  search for way of further Afghan development "within the  framework of international efforts, on coordination with the  United Nations Organization and all interested states".</p>

Debabov; Scientific Research Institute of  Genetics and Selection of Industrial Microorganims, Moscow] UDC  579.841.11 [Signed to press 26 Jan 93]    [Abstract] Derivativesof endotoxin A, in which the recept  or-recognizing domain is absent, were nontoxic for eukaryotic  cells. Such proteins may be used as a catalytic component of  immunotoxins if they are connected with proteins capable of  recognizing specific receptors of eukaryotic cells. Hybrid  proteins, which contain, in addition to fragments of endotoxin  A, either a fragment of protein A of staphylococcus or  interleukin-2 were used to create proteins which may be used as  the catalytic components of immunotoxins or as already pepared  immunotoxin. Analysis of the stability of these hybrid proteins  and their derivatives showed that all the hybrid proteins except  one proved to be stable in E. coli cells. Figures 5; references  18 Western.</p>

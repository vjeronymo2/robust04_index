			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Halifax risks court over free shares Halifax Building Society's plans to give free shares to members when it converts to a public limited company and becomes a bank after merging with Leeds Permanent Building Society are likely to be challenged in the High Court early next year. Unless Halifax, the UK's biggest society, decides to follow the 'flat rate' formula used by Abbey National, which became a bank in 1989, there is a strong prospect that its proposals will not fall clearly within the 1986 legislation regulating societies. The Building Societies Commission, the sector's regulator, has to be satisfied that the plans are squarely within the law for them to go ahead. If it has any doubts then the issue must go to the High Court. Abbey gave 100 free shares to each borrower and each investor, but Halifax has signalled that it wants to look at other options. These include treating borrowers and investors differently, and relating the number of free shares to the length of relationship with the society or the money in an investor's account. The commission is likely to insist that Halifax outlines its intended approach before the two societies' 10m members vote on the merger, which is the first stage of the process. The special meetings of the two societies, when members will vote, are expected to take place in the spring. They could be delayed by a court hearing. The 1986 act says that if members are given priority in acquiring shares these rights are restricted to investors of more than two years' standing. Earlier this year a court ruling on a similar restriction forced Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society to change its plans for sharing among its 1m-plus members the Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for the society by Lloyds Bank. C&amp;G's new arrangement excludes borrowers and recent investors from the cash, although they can still vote on whether to accept the offer. This has focused the dissatisfaction of a small proportion of members. Halifax and Leeds both stopped accepting new investing members when they announced their plans last month, but the most likely timescale for the deal could create a further complication. If the two societies merge next summer and the flotation is in early 1997, former Leeds members will not have been Halifax members for two years. Guidance from the commission says that when societies merge members of the one taken over must be treated as members of the surviving society. It does not inevitably follow, however, that this would apply to share distribution. Mr Rob Thomas, societies analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said plans for Halifax to offer a full range of personal financial services would make it harder for the organisation to keep its edge in mortgage lending.</p>

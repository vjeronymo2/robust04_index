			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TEEN-AGER HELD OVER RASH OF FIRES, BUT 4 MORE ARE SET  </P> <P> Arson investigators arrested a teen-ager this week for setting at least six of  the more than 25 rubbish and tree fires that have plagued the Reseda-Northridge  area since last month.  </P> <P> But while the youth was in custody Tuesday night, four similar fires were set  in the area, authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Fire Department officials said that indicates the fires may be the  work of several people, who may or may not know each other.  </P> <P> "There are still a lot of unsolved fires," Inspector Ed Reed said.  </P> <P> The investigation began Dec. 3 when 13 fires were set in neighborhoods near  Reseda Boulevard north of Saticoy Street. The next night 12 more fires were  reported in the same general area.  </P> <P> The fires burned mostly trash and trees, though two cars and part of the roof  of an apartment complex also were damaged, investigators said.  </P> <P> On Dec. 8, a $1.3-million fire damaged the Terry Lumber Co. complex in the  area, but it was unclear if it was related to the smaller fires, Reed said. In  any case, the rubbish fires continued sporadically through the Christmas  holidays, he said.  </P> <P> Investigators arrested a 16-year-old Reseda boy on Tuesday morning after  witnesses said he set one of the fires, Reed said. He initially became a  suspect when fire inspectors learned that he lived in the area and had a prior  history of vandalism and theft, Reed said. After his arrest, the boy admitted  to having set six of the fires, Reed said. "But those are the only fires he  set. He adamantly denies responsibility for any others."  </P> <P> Reed said the boy definitely was not responsible for four fires set Tuesday  night in the area of Reseda Boulevard south of Saticoy Street between 10 p.m.  and midnight because he was in Sylmar Juvenile Hall at the time.  </P> <P> Reed said investigators have no evidence indicating the fires are the work of a  group of people acting in unison. "We don't know if it is a gang or a copycat  situation involving several individuals," said Reed, who noted the boy who was  arrested is not believed to be a gang member.  </P> <P> In what may be an unrelated outbreak, Reed said, arson experts also are  investigating a series of eight fires set in grass and rubbish piles and, in  one instance, a parking garage in a North Hollywood neighborhood since Jan. 5.  </P> <P> The fires -- including one per day on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday -- have  occurred in the general area of Chandler Boulevard and Bellingham Avenue.  </P></p>

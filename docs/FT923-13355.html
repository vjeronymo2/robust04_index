			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / PM's pledge spurs Serbs in Bosnia SERB forces yesterday stepped up their offensive throughout Bosnia following a promise by the Serbian prime minister, Mr Radoman Bozovic, never to cede 'one inch of territory' inhabited by Serbs. At the same time, General Lewis MacKenzie, United Nations commander in Sarajevo, warned of the perils faced by international relief flights into the besieged Bosnian capital after three French aircraft had been hit last week approaching the airport. Italian warships taking part in an international naval operation to enforce UN sanctions against Serbia have meanwhile begun interrogating freighters entering the Adriatic. Admiral Achille Zanoni, commander of Italian naval forces in the Adriatic, told reporters of the action as US and European vessels approached the region to strengthen the patrol. Despite the international pressure, Mr Radoman Bozovic, Serbia's prime minister, indicated that his republic would continue to support Bosnia's Serbs. 'Who has the right to call it aggression when citizens defend their hearths, their homes and their villages?' he was quoted as saying. 'Serbs in Bosnia would never be forgotten,' he added, vowing that 'Serbia and the Serb people could not by bought by blackmail or severe economic sanctions'. Serb forces continued to fight the mainly Moslem and Croat Bosnian forces yesterday to try to cut a corridor linking Serb-controlled territories in Bosnia with Serbia. Belgrade radio said the Serbian army was within three days of capturing Odzak, in northern Bosnia. Meanwhile, Serb forces were advancing in Hercegovina, in the west of the republic, the radio said. Sarajevo radio said Bosnian forces had launched a counter-offensive around Doboj in the north. In eastern Bosnia, houses were aflame and corpses littered the streets of Gorazde, said Mr Zoran Pirolic, an editor at Sarajevo radio. For nearly four months Serb forces have surrounded the town where some 30,000 people have sought refuge from Serb militias seeking to drive Moslems out of eastern Bosnia. A mortar bombardment shook the headquarters of the UN force in Sarajevo yesterday and the UN said the blasts killed one teenager and wounded at least four in the street outside. Thirteen mortar bombs landed outside the headquarters within four minutes, the worst bombardment of the area since fighting flared in the Bosnian capital last April. The UN Security Council yesterday approved despatch of 500 more peacekeepers for humanitarian aid work in Sarajevo, AP reports from New York. The 15-member council unanimously approved a resolution endorsing Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali's request for 500 more troops - beyond the 1,100 already requested and approved for Sarajevo relief operations. The peacekeepers are to operate the airport for relief airlifts, help deliver aid and secure the heavy artillery of combatants around the airport.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 28, IRNA -- The governor of Iran's  Central Bank Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli in a meeting with the  managing director of International Monetary Fund, Michel  Camdessus, in Washington D.C. Tuesday exchanged views on the  issues of mutual interest. 'Adeli briefed Camdessus on the  achievements and progress of the first development plan saying  that during the first five-year development plan Iran's gross  domestic product (GDP) has considerably increased. Despite  pressures from some foreign countries, Iran has succeeded in  concluding useful agreements with its trade partners, 'Adeli  said.    Camdessus said that Iran's success in rescheduling its  foreign debts would increase its credit in the fields of trade  and commerce. He also lauded Iran's stands vis-a-vis the  developing countries.    'Adeli is currently in Washington D.C. to attend the joint  session of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.</p>

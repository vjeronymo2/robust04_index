			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Opposition Politician Fears Plot </F> Between Russia and Israel Behind Estonia's Arms Purchase From  Israel"]    [Text] Tallinn, Apr 05, BNS -- Purchasing of arms from  Israel has caused Estonia major foreign political difficulties  because a collusion between Israel and Russia lies behind the  deal, says Estonia's opposition politician Hardo Aasmae.    "When the secret arms deal was enacted, our friends in the  West were interested that Estonia's governing circles wouldn't  completely fall through this into the Israeli-Russian sphere of  influence. Therefore also many secret services started trying to  find out who and how much earned from that deal at (the  government residence of) Toompea," Aasmae said.    He said Israel and Russia were not interested in the success  of Estonia's foreign policy, since the principles that the  Baltic country's foreign policy is based upon may negatively  affect the interests of Russia and Israel. In Aasmae's words  Israel had also gained a certain lead on the weapons market  before the Western countries, especially the United States, who  only recently lifted its arms sales embargo on the Baltics and  three Balkan states.    "There have also been reports that Russian banks are buying  up the bills of exchange issued by the Estonian side to cover  the cost of the arms deal, and which Russia can use as an  argument against Estonia at the talks," the Estonian opposition  politician said.    Aasmae said both Russia and Israel are likely to have  certain  common interests on the international arena in prospect, because  also Israel will have to start defending the interests of its  settlers in its so-called near abroad, in view of the  possibility that Palestine may gain its independence.    Aasmae also pointed out common features in the development  of  the town of Sillamae in Estonia and the Israeli settlements on  the occupied territories.    Taking into account the whole background of the arms deal,  we  can state that this became the nail in the coffin of the  Estonian foreign policy, he said.    The Estonian Government signed the 60 million U.S. dollar  arms deal with TAAS Israel Industries Ltd. on Jan. 7, 1993.</p>

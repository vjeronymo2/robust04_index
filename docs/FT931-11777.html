			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / US group to run BhS data processing THE CLOTHING and housewares retailer, BhS, is turning over its data processing operations to a US computing services company in a deal that will constitute one of the biggest facilities management contracts in Europe. Computing Sciences Corporation of the US will take over BhS's data processing centres, computers and 120 data processing staff. A few BhS computing staff will remain to monitor developments. The deal is worth about Pounds 10m a year over 10 years and is expected to save BhS (formerly British Home Stores) a minimum of Pounds 33m over the term of the contract. In an unusual development, the two companies plan jointly to market data processing services and software systems to other companies. Mr Simon Hughes, BhS logistics director, said the relationship with CSC was more of a partnership than a commercial contract. The aim was not simply to save money but to ally the company with a world-class computer group capable of developing the most advanced technology. CSC will be responsible for every aspect of BhS's computing operations, including the management of its computerised cash registers, electronic transmission of information to suppliers, management and accounting systems, personal computers and its data transmission network. Facilities management or 'outsourcing' of computing oper-ations is becoming increasingly popular with companies and organisations in the public sector as they seek to cut costs and concentrate on core business. BhS, with 130 high street stores and annual sales of more than Pounds 600m, is making a strong comeback after some years of stagnation and falling profits as part of the Storehouse conglomerate. CSC in the US has an outsourcing deal with General Dynamics worth Dollars 3bn.</p>

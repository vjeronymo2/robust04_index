			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Nigeria's thwarted poll victor sees danger of turmoil NIGERIAN presidential candidate Moshood Abiola and his party warned yesterday that peace and stability would be at risk unless the military government announced the result of last Saturday's election. They asserted that Mr Abiola had clearly won the election. Their plea for an official result to be announced came amid rising tension, but they called on Nigerians to remain calm. The authorities suspended announcement of the poll result pending a court ruling on a lawsuit brought by a group supporting the military ruler, Gen Ibrahim Babangida. A human rights group, the Campaign for Democracy, yesterday defied the ban, declaring that the final tally showed Mr Abiola had won 19 of Nigeria's 30 states to 11 for his rival, Mr Bashir Othman Tofa. Soldiers and riot police have been posted to some of the more volatile parts of the country. There has been stunned disbelief since the National Electoral Commission announced on Wednesday it had been restrained from publishing the election results by a court ruling. Three times since 1991 President Babangida has delayed the transition to democracy, now scheduled for August 27 - the eighth anniversary of his seizure of power. 'Two years ago I would not have believed this possible in Nigeria, it was something that happened in other African states, but we've had so many changes that Nigerians have become docile,' said one businessman in Lagos, the commercial capital. The mood of the Yoruba, who dominate the Social Democratic Party's stronghold in the south-west, turned from celebration of the expected success of Mr Abiola to outrage at the legal sophistry that may deny him victory. 'Babangida took power by force, playing martial music and telling Nigerians to stay calm,' said a young trader from Edo state in the mid-west. 'He didn't worry about law courts and judges in those days. I just don't think he wants to go.' Although victory for Mr Abiola could mean a shift of power to the south, northern Nigerians also regard the belated vote-rigging allegations by the rival National Republican Convention (NRC) with contempt. The indignation cuts across party lines: 'The SDP is not my party, but Abiola won it fairly and he should get his chance,' said one NRC supporter from Delta state. 'A lot of people don't care if it's Abiola or Tofa. They just want a change.' Nigeria is run down. Strikes have hit schools and hospitals, rubbish piles up in the streets of the Lagos business district, power cuts and water shortages are common, drains and roads are collapsing, and armed robbery is unchecked by an incompetent and demoralised police force. During recent fuel shortages, the prices of basic goods in the market and public transport in Lagos rose by up to 200 per cent and have yet to come down. Outside the Central Bank of Nigeria, which has halved the value of the naira in the past year, black market traders sell the currency for 60 per cent less. If uncertainty over the election continues, they will mark the naira down further.</p>

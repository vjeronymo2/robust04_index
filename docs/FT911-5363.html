			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Delhi gives pledge on debt repayments MR Yaswant Sinha, the Indian finance minister, yesterday assured the country's international creditors that India would not default on its debt repayments during the next critical three-and-a-half months before a new government can present a budget. At a press conference in New Delhi, Mr Sinha said: 'Whatever it takes will be done to see that India meets its commitments. We shall not allow any default.' He also ruled out a debt rescheduling. Mr Sinha was speaking after returning from Tokyo where he secured Dollars 150m (Pounds 84.7m) in immediate foreign exchange assistance from Japan as part of an Asian Development Bank co-financing of petroleum imports. He also said that Japan had promised to speed up other other aid - worth about Dollars 350m. But he said that this would be finalised in discussions with Japan and other donor nations in Washington at the end of the month during the spring meetings of the World Bank and the IMF. The finance minister said that he expected other donor nations to come to India's support, but declined to be specific. 'We are not quite bereft of friends,' he said. Mr Sinha made his announcement as the general election campaign got underway with Mr VP Singh's National Front being the first major party yesterday to present its manifesto. The Front, which is contesting the election in alliance with the left, confirmed that the central plank in its platform would be implementing Mr Singh's promise of 55-59 per cent central government job reservation for the poor and the lower castes.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Abtrust Preferred placing ABTRUST Preferred Investment Trust is attempting to more than double its size via a placing of ordinary income and zero dividend preference shares which will raise Pounds 16.4m after expenses. The new ordinary income shares will be issued at 83p each and if the trust's assets and income grow at 1 per cent a year, will have a prospective gross redemption yield of 16.5 per cent. The new zeros will be placed at 142p, giving a prospective gross redemption yield of 8.5 per cent. The zeros will be covered 1.22 times by total assets. The shares have been conditionally placed but existing shareholders will be entitled to claw them back on a 1-for-1 basis in the case of the zeros and on a 10-for-9 basis in the case of the ordinary shares. The board believes that the outlook for low inflation plus recovery in corporate profits will present profitable opportunities to achieve growth.</p>

Generally, it is promising to revitalize state enterprises,  CPPCC members said at a press conference here today.    "Large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have made  important contributions to the state in the past decades and  served as the main pillars in the national economy. During the  current reform, they have remarkable advantages, too, such as  advanced equipment, strong technical force and rich experience,  and state policy support," said Wan Guoquan, vice chairman of  the Central Committee of the China Democratic National  Construction Association.    At the press conference held by the news center of the  current session of the CPPCC National Committee, Wan said that  the central government's reform measures have provided favorable  conditions for the revitalization of the state enterprises.    Li Gang, adviser to the China National Automotive Industry  Corporation, said though one-third of state enterprises are  losing money, the state coffers derive 67 percent of the  revenues from the state enterprises.    Professor Wang Yu, a well known economist, said that poor  performance of state enterprises are attributed to many factors.  Their burdens of debts, pension, medical care and various levies  swallow a considerable part of the enterprises' income. But,  the fundamental reasons are drawbacks in the management and  operational system.    He said that the central government has set clear target and  formulated concrete measures to restructure state enterprises.  The planned modern enterprise system will clearly define the  property rights and responsibilities of enterprises, separate  the functions of the government from those of enterprises, and  put enterprise management on a scientific track.    In the process of building a modern enterprise system,  "state  enterprises will play a role as the major impetus for growth of  the national economy," he said.    Asked about the consequences of resumption of China's status  in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Zhang Jusheng,  chairman of the Heifei Meiling Company, said the resumption of  China's status in GATT will promote China's economic development  as well as producing impact on its national industry. He  believes his refrigerator company is competitive in the world.    Wan Guoquan said that state enterprise cannot live on  government "blood transfusion" loans forever.    "If an enterprise keeps losing money for a long time, the  government will have to leave it and let it go bankrupt," he  said.    Asked whether the contradictions between enterprises and  workers will become serious when more companies go bankrupt, Wan  answered the Chinese Government and enterprises have always made  their best to guarantee the livelihood of workers and the  workers are also cooperative with the government and enterprises.    He said the difficulty will be temporary. The state will  continuously provide preferential policies to enterprises so as  to ensure the livelihood of workers during the transition period.</p>

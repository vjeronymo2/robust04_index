			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FERRY BLAMED FOR TEAM'S LOSS  </P> <P> Italian newspapers are blaming Danny Ferry for Messaggero Rome's seventh loss  in the Italian basketball league Sunday.  </P> <P> Milan's Gazzetta dello Sport and Rome's Corriere dello Sport, Italy's two  largest sports dailies, both criticized Ferry for a streak of unforced errors  in a 75-74 loss to Benetton Treviso at Rome's Palaeur. Massaggero led by seven  points with two minutes to play.  </P> <P> Ferry elected to play in Italy after failing to come to terms with the Clippers  of the NBA. The Clippers have since traded his rights to the Cleveland  Cavaliers.  </P> <P> Gazzetta wrote that Ferry could be blamed for his team's defeat. "The American  had an inglorious day," the sports daily said.  </P> <P> Ferry, who made one of six 3-point goals, scored 17 points.  </P></p>

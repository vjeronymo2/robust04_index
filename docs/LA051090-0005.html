			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELLESLEY CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Granted that the discussion surrounding Barbara Bush's commencement speech at  Wellesley College is a healthy process as your editorial suggested ("First Lady  vs. Wellesley: Good Debate," May 7), but the nature of that discussion reflects  very poorly on the women there.  </P> <P> First, it is shortsighted of the women at Wellesley to limit accomplishment and  leadership in society to the realms of business and government. And secondly,  it is very insecure and defensive behavior that has to speak ill of another  woman's choice in order to affirm the value of her own.  </P> <P> The family is a vitally significant and foundational institution of this  nation, upon which the success of many of our other pursuits (including George  Bush's) depends. A full-time, even lifetime, commitment to nurturing and  building the family is influence and leadership in the fullest sense of the  role.  </P> <P> The choice between a career in the work force or a career in the home is a  difficult and emotional one. To hear women on both sides of that choice  continually downgrading the other as if the choice were actually a plain and  simple one only makes one wonder how sure of their personal choices these women  actually are.  </P> <P> Women have the potential to provide significant leadership in more than one  role. What's so horrible about that? These efforts would be better served if  women stopped viewing other women's choices as negative comments about their  own and went about the business of providing leadership in their respective  roles.  </P> <P> KARL D. EDWARDS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BIT OF NAVY HISTORY IS FOUND INTACT ON SEA FLOOR OFF S.D.  </P> <P> Although searching the ocean floor for a downed helicopter 9 miles off the San  Diego coast last fall, sailors found a rare F-3 biplane, a pre-World War II  fighter that crashed 50 years ago, the Navy said Monday.  </P> <P> Though a civilian model is now housed in the Smithsonian Museum, this plane is  believed to be the first military F-3 aircraft to survive the years, said  Senior Chief Bob Howard, spokesman for the Pacific Fleet Naval Air Force.  </P> <P> "This is a real find," Howard said. "The pilot settled it down on the water,  then it sunk. You've got this gorgeous old plane sitting down there in  marvelous condition."  </P> <P> The plane was piloted by then-Lt. Robert Edward Galer, now 76 and a Dallas  resident, who was not hurt in the crash. Galer later won the Medal of Honor for  leading his squadron to shoot down 27 Japanese planes during World War II. In  Oct. 1942, Galer -- a member of Marine Unit 223 that was dubbed the "Flying  Fools" -- downed 11 enemy bomber and fighter aircraft.  </P> <P> As Galer, who retired from the Marine Corps as a brigadier general, looks back  on his 23 years of service, he is almost nostalgic about the F-3 crash, which  he believes prepared him for being shot down several times in combat.  </P> <P> "The biplane is very nice to fly -- it's very stable, though it's not very  fast," said Galer. "And it's very forgiving. You could make a mistake and still  recover."  </P> <P> But on Aug. 29, 1940 at 12:30 p.m., Galer made no mistake. Two pilots had  reported having trouble aboard the aircraft. The engineering crew on the  aircraft carrier Saratoga believed they had fixed the ill-fated plane and Galer  was assigned to try it out.  </P> <P> After taking off, he checked the fuel tanks several times, according to an  accident report filed after the crash. Galer took off using the reserve fuel  supply and flew several minutes before attempting to switch to the auxiliary  fuel supply. As he tried to switch from one tank to another, the engine began  to sputter, according to the report. Still switching from tank to tank, Galer  realized he was in trouble and gave the forced-landing signal. At about 1,000  feet, he was able to hold to the landing pattern.  </P> <P> "I had gone through all the procedures, and it would not re-start. I had been  flying long enough and seen enough planes go down that it wasn't a complete  surprise," Galer said. "I figured I would make a smooth landing in the water  and the destroyer would pick me up. You're too busy to be afraid."  </P> <P> As Galer struggled, another pilot -- Marine LtN. Endweiss -- spotted black  smoke coming from Galer's plane. Unable to help, Endweiss watched as Galer  smacked into the water. Circling in the air, he waited to see Galer, who  signaled that he wasn't hurt.  </P> <P> "It was typical San Diego water -- it was very nice," said Galer, who hit the  water about 300 yards astern of the carrier.  </P> <P> At the time of the crash, the biplane had 16 gallons of fuel. It stayed afloat  five minutes before sinking. On Oct. 31, the Navy gave up on the plane and  struck it from their records as lost.  </P> <P> And it stayed on the sea bottom. Last fall, a deep submergence vehicle, called  a "turtle," stumbled upon the airplane as sailors were conducting routine  operations and searching for a helicopter that had crashed in October, claiming  two lives.  </P> <P> Navy officials expect to pluck the plane from the water during early April,  after they retrieve the sunken helicopter. The plane will be taken first to  North Island Naval Air Station's Naval Depot for preliminary rehabilitative  work and then to San Diego's Air and Space Museum for further attention.  Eventually, it will be housed in the Naval Air Museum in Pensacola, Fla.,  Howard said.  </P> <P> During 23 years in the Marines, Galer was shot down three times during World  War II and another time in Korea.  </P> <P> Counting the ocean landing near San Diego, "that makes five times, and my son  says that makes me an ace," joked Galer, laughing.  </P></p>

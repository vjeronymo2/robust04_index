			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhalis Kaitantzidhis: "We Get Together With </F> the Russians Again"]    [Excerpt] According to all indications, Russia and Greece  are in agreement over the terms of natural gas purchases as  these evolved following the addendum to the initial agreement  signed last summer during President Yeltsin's visit to Athens.    The obstacle to the smooth implementation of the agreement  was the right it granted the Russians to build an electricity  plant in Thraki and sell energy to the Greek Power Corporation  (DEI), as well as the right to sell to third parties any surplus  quantities of natural gas not absorbed by the Public Natural Gas  Enterprise (DEPA).    According to available information, the two sides have  agreed  in principle that the Thraki electricity plant will be built by  the Russians on the classic DEI "turnkey" system or a similar  one so as not to contradict Panhellenic Socialist Movement  (PASOK) preelectoral statements, rather than on a self-financing  basis as was originally envisioned.    With regard to another obstacle to the agreement (access by  the Russians to the Greek delivery network), it seems that the  two sides have reached an agreement, according to which DEPA  will have the right to determine the volume of surplus  quantities that the Russians will be able to sell to third  parties.    Finally, the remaining terms of the addendum, according to  which the Russians will build the branches of the central  pipeline toward Lavrion, etc., and the agreement will be  lengthened by six years are definitely in Greece's interest.

Security forces were slow in responding to what started as a  peaceful march to the downtown embassy, where demonstrators  wanted to protest the killing of three of their countrymen at  the Afghan embassy in Islamabad.    Two badly beaten and bleeding Pakistani staffers narrowly  escaped a lynching when they were dragged outside by the enraged  crowd. Another beaten man and two physically unhurt but severely  shocked staffers were escorted out of the building after the  arrival of security forces.    On arrival the demonstrators, after yelling insults at the  embassy, quickly became emboldened and began throwing rocks at  windows, then wrenched the brass name-plaque from the embassy  wall and smashed it.    Soon after a wild stream of Afghans began climbing the  sandbags lining the embassy walls for protection against  incoming artillery, and began sacking the premises.    "The Pakistanis disgraced our embassy in Islamabad. This is  our response," one demonstrator told AFP.    "We are determined to have our revenge for our three killed  countrymen," another of the furious demonstrators added.    Three Afghan gunmen, who held children hostage in the Afghan  embassy in Islamabad, were killed Monday when Pakistani  commandos assaulted the diplomatic compound.</p>

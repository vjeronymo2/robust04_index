			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on press conference by Northern League </F> Secretary Umberto Bossi on 15 June; place not given: "Bossi:  Who Cares?"]    [Text] Rome -- "Oh, yes? Who cares?" This is how [League  Secretary] Umberto Bossi dismissed [Prime Minister] Silvio  Berlusconi's demand for a clarification of the League's policy  line. And with regard to [Interior Minister] Roberto Maroni's  proposal to federate the three allies of the Freedom Alliance  into a single party, the League leader said: "That must be some  journalist's invention. The League will never be a fragment of  Forza Italia. I realize that there are some people who are  accustomed to saying, `we are all men on horseback,' but we are  not men on horseback; we are ordinary people who go on foot."    Yesterday was a tough day for Bossi. The decision, announced  Tuesday [14 June], to make the League a workers' party by the  end of 1995 prompted a great many responses both inside and  outside the movement. Starting yesterday morning thousands of  members telephoned their local officials to demand explanations  and to protest the feared swing to the Left. Meanwhile, an  unofficial poll in the lower house and the Senate showed that  some 80 percent of members of the League's parliamentary groups  agree with the present government and are in favor of the  majority that supports it. These are two bad signs for the  leader, who did not try to evade the issue of this minor  earthquake, and spoke to journalists at length to explain his  thoughts about a single party, the government, and the future of  the League. And he altered his stance somewhat on some of the  most controversial aspects.    The single party -- "So Berlusconi said that there should be  a clarification within the League. Who cares? Let him  concentrate on clarifying his own party. In any case, a prime  minister should not interfere... Why does he not himself become  absorbed into his `Forza-thing'? It is the facts that count,  and the facts are that he wants to turn the Freedom Alliance --  which we invented -- into the single party. There can never be  a single party, for ideological reasons, because of the values  and traditions that divide us, and because of the issue of  democracy."    The government -- "I spent three months in intellectual  isolation before the Assago and Bologna congresses that chose  the path of joining the government. Now there is no alternative  to the Freedom Alliance, and it is bound to govern for at least  a few years in order to ensure the country's stability, and to  avert very serious confusion. An election in November would  create confusion, and would entail a return to intellectual  isolation. Instead, we must strengthen our option for  differentiation within this alliance and within this government."    The League's role -- "Within this alliance and within this  government we must represent the working class, on the basis of  the values that are part of our tradition. We do not represent  the papist and conservative component, and we can never do so.  Forza Italia and the National Alliance, on the other hand,  represent the conservative movement."    Flirtation with the Left -- "There is no flirtation with the  Left, as has been said hitherto. If you like, there is a signal  that we are issuing to the forces that are now on the other side  and that are disintegrating, particularly following [Democratic  Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto's resignation, to let them  know that, if there is an acceptance of common liberal  democratic and federalist values, there is a force within the  alignment that is not conservative. In a few years' time we  will see who the real working class is who and the elitist and  superficial forces are. Meanwhile, Sunday I am going to  Pontida, but I am certainly not going there to appear on  television, as Berlusconi does."</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Hicks Muse to lead Dollars 850m buy-out Hicks Muse, a Texas-based buy-out firm, is to lead a Dollars 850m acquisition of Home Interiors and Gifts, a privately owned direct-sales company, making it one of the biggest US buy-outs of the 1990s so far. Home Interiors and Gifts, which has annual revenues of Dollars 850m, sells decorative accessories and gifts through 42,000 independent sales agents. The agents make sales from their homes, using techniques made famous by Tupperware in the 1960s. The deal will be backed by Dollars 400m of bank debt, Dollars 300m of junk bonds and Dollars 150m of equity finance, according to Hicks Muse. The company has still to receive a firm commitment for the bank debt, but is in discussions with four institutions. The junk bond issue will be led by Bear Stearns. The high debt level would make the deal one of the most highly leveraged of the decade. While the equity portion in many 1980s buy-outs accounted for as little as 10 per cent of the total financing, it has made up between a quarter and a third of many transactions since, reflecting a more cautious attitude on the part of lenders. Under the terms of the deal, Hicks Muse would acquire 51 per cent of Home Interiors. The rest of the shares would be retained by members of the Carter family, including the son and three grandchildren of the company's founder, Ms Mary Crowley. The family owns a majority of the company's shares. The total purchase price for Home Interiors is Dollars 1bn, although the company has net cash of Dollars 150m. Hicks Muse said it planned to take the company public, though no timetable has been set. Hicks Muse's equity investment in Home Interiors is being made from a Dollars 625m private equity fund raised last year. The deal, if completed, will be the biggest yet initiated by Hicks Muse.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee frost brings back chilling memories Yesterday's meteoric rise in international coffee futures triggered comparisons with previous Brazilian frost dramas - and aspirations towards previous market records. Ms Judith Ganes, softs analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, had her eye on the all-time highs of the late 1970s. 'It's too early to pinpoint, but people should be aware that this market has the potential to get there,' she said. 'In the past we had a freeze and the trees were healthy. When you take a crop that hasn't been fertilised for four years and was unhealthy to begin with because of a lack of care, the damage could be untold.' The excitement was heightened by the fact that the crop damage has hit early, with a further six weeks to go when frost can occur in Brazil. Ms Ganes was highlighting the lack of investment in world coffee production that has resulted from the five years of low prices that followed the collapse of market intervention measures in 1989. The inability of coffee producers to respond rapidly to the current shortfall in world supply has fuelled the market's bull run this year. But prices still have a long way to go. Second position robusta coffee futures in London peaked at over Pounds 4,000 - or more than Dollars 7,000 a tonne at the prevailing exchange rate - in March 1977. Yesterday's surge took the second position to a day's peak of Dollars 3,150 a tonne, the highest level since November 1986 when it hit Dollars 3,700. That gap is also reflected in retail coffee prices. A 100g jar of Nescafe in the UK, for example, is still about 3p cheaper than in March 1986, even after a 12 1/2 per cent rise in January, according to its manufacturer, Nestle. Whether prices continue upwards will depend partly on the extent of the frost damage at the weekend, which could only be guessed at yesterday. It was described by one Brazilian broker as the worst since the 'very grave' frost of July 1975, which triggered the rise in prices to all-time highs. Next year's coffee harvest is expected to be substantially reduced but no clear figures are available yet, according to growers and brokers. Predictions yesterday ranged from a loss of fewer than 1m bags to as much as 5m bags. Production this year in Brazil, which accounts for around a quarter of world output, is expected to be about 24m bags. Coffee broker Mr Eduardo Carvalhaes Jnr said most of Brazil's important production areas in the states of Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and Parana were hit. He said the 1995-96 and 1996-97 harvests would be smaller and the quality of the 1994-95 coffee crop could be affected. 'It seems that some areas in Parana were 100 per cent hit while parts of Sao Paulo lost 20-25 per cent.' Carlos Duarte de Conceicao cedilla accent on last c, tilde accent on a , president of the Coplan coffee growers co-operative in Campinas, Sao Paulo, said it was too early to tell how much production would be lost but he estimated losses could reach 4m bags. Some of the sting has been taken out of Brazilian frost scares by the fact production has moved northwards since 1975. Whereas Parana was once the main producer, it now accounts for 2m to 3m bags of annual output. Most production takes place in Minas Gerais state, southern parts of which have apparently been badly hit by the latest frost. Moreover, although Brazil is the world's biggest producer, its dominance is much less than a decade ago. None the less, the frost damage comes at a sensitive time for the world market. The International Coffee Organisation predicts a shortfall in world supplies of about 2m bags this year, compared with demand, and now says that 'further drops (in supplies) are likely next year'. Supply tightness has led to a run-down in consumer stocks. The ICO estimates these have fallen by about 2m bags this year to some 15m bags. How far the frost drives prices will also depend on how producer countries' stocks are released on to the world market, said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, the London commodity brokers. The Brazilian government is sitting on a stockpile of 17m bags and further coffee is due to be released by other members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries.</p>

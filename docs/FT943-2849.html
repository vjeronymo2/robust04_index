			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wood chip shortage threat to BC pulp mills A severe shortage of wood chips is threatening the closure of several British Columbia pulp mills, and has given a further twist to the upward spiral in pulp and paper prices. Chip prices on Canada's west coast have doubled since May from CDollars 60 (Pounds 28) to about CDollars 120 per bone-dry unit (BDU), which weighs about two tonnes. One sign of the shortage is a sharp drop in chip exports, mainly to Japan. Mr Tony Jarrett, president of Fibreco Export of Vancouver, estimated that shipments next year would fall to 185,000 BDUs in 1995 from 400,000 BDUs in 1992. According to Pulp and Paper Week, a trade publication, two mills in British Columbia have already closed due to a shortage of chips. BC is the world's biggest producer of pulp traded on open markets. Mr David Pineault, an economist at Resource Information Systems, a US consultancy, said that other mills were considering shutting down to build up chip stocks. A number of mills are also said to be investigating the feasibility of importing chips or of installing their own chipping machines. Most chips are presently produced by saw mills as a by-product. The fibre shortage has been caused by a variety of commercial and environmental pressures. With lumber prices relatively high over the past 2-3 years, many saw mills have moved away from chips in favour of low-grade timber products, such as wooden pallets. Declining chip production was masked until earlier this year by the deep slump in the pulp market. However, Canadian pulp mills' operating rates have climbed from around 80 per cent in mid-1993 to 98 per cent last July, reflecting a jump in pulp prices from USDollars 390 (Pounds 252) per tonne to the present level of Dollars 700 per tonne.</p>

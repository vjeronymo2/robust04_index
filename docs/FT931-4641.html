			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy Yesterday's producer price figures make it difficult to avoid the conclusion that inflation looks set to remain low despite the devaluation. Thanks partly to productivity gains, the underlying rate of output price growth was only 2.7 per cent in the year to February. Retail price inflation may thus stay within the government's target range, reducing upward pressure on interest rates as recovery takes hold. That augurs well for growth which should, in turn, boost government revenues, easing its PSBR problem. But lower than expected inflation has drawbacks in this respect too. Tax revenues are affected quickly; many spending benefits only accrue later. Nor is there much scope for pushing public sector pay increases below the government's existing 1.5 per cent target. Success on the inflation front will force the government to work extra hard to contain its deficit. But it does, at least, provide cover for measures such as the non-indexation of tax allowances, clawback of spending increases and extending the reach of VAT.</p>

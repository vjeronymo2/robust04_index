			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Nortel benefits from restructuring Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, is starting to see the benefits of its restructuring and growing exposure to overseas markets. Highlights of the Toronto-based company's third-quarter earnings included a 2 per cent improvement in margins, and a rising share of the market for office switchboards (PBXs). Revenues grew by 6 per cent, in spite of the disposal of several businesses last year and a substantial decline in revenues from Canada. Net earnings were USDollars 56m, or 22 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 35m, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings were boosted by a Dollars 43m, one-time jump in investment income. Revenues advanced to just over Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.88bn. Northern told analysts yesterday that revenues would have risen by 14 per cent if divested businesses were included. New orders in the quarter slipped to Dollars 1.95bn from Dollars 2.34bn a year earlier. 'We don't view this with any alarm,' a Northern official said. Customers have indicated that their order cycles are shortening. The company forecast higher orders in the traditionally strong fourth quarter. The improved margins were ascribed to cost cutting, and to a more profitable product mix, such as high-margin PBXs. Northern told analysts that catch-up work on its transmission software was now a week ahead of schedule. Delays in this area contributed to a slide in investor confidence early last year. But its share price has recovered sharply since then. The shares were down 50 cents at CDollars 48.50 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange, compared with last year's low of about CDollars 30. One analyst said that he was encouraged by Northern's growing emphasis on broadband 'information highway' products and on fast-growing overseas markets, such as Latin America, China and Taiwan.</p>

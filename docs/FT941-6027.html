			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 15m Sanderson Bramall buy Sanderson Bramall is increasing its involvement in the commercial vehicle market with the acquisition of Petrogate Group, the commercial vehicle and car distributor. The Yorkshire-based motor distribution group has conditionally agreed to pay a sum equal to the net asset value of Petrogate at completion, which is expected to be about Pounds 400,000, plus a profit-related maximum of Pounds 5.25m. The initial consideration of Pounds 4.75m is to be satisfied by the issue of 1m new shares worth Pounds 2m with the balance payable in cash. Sanderson is also assuming bank borrowings of about Pounds 9.7m. In the year to July 31, Petrogate, which operates in the Midlands and the north of England, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 852,000 on sales of Pounds 70.4m. Of its Pounds 1.9m operating profit some 70 per cent was derived from commercial vehicle operations.</p>

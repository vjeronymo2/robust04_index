			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / There's life in it yet: European union will go forward, but it needs a route map Reports of the death of the European exchange rate mechanism are exaggerated, but not greatly. Reports of the death of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union are, to say the least, premature. Reports that the European idea has run its course and can now be consigned to the dustbin of history are pure fantasy, whether the fantasy of morbid continental Spenglerians or that of euphoric 'Anglo-Saxon' Cobdenites. There are two overwhelming reasons why the drive for greater European integration will continue: security and the single market. Take the latter first, since it is supposed to be less controversial, although I believe it is the more troublesome of the two. Most anti-Maastricht Eurosceptics say they are in favour of the single market. They fail to realise that the single market is responsible for nearly all the things ordinary people dislike, or think they dislike, about the EC. Everyone has a favourite horror story about the manic desire of 'Brussels bureaucrats' to regulate everything, from the colour of flamingoes to the size of honeypots. Often these stories are accompanied by bitter complaints about the effect of the EC in dismantling national regulations and exposing the citizen to bigger lorries or lower standards of consumer protection. Similarly, most businessmen have one list of complaints about the unfair competition to which the EC exposes them in their domestic market from rivals that are subject to less stringent national regulation, and another about the grotesque national regulations or business practices that still prevent them from exporting to, or investing in, the market of another EC member state. The single market only became remotely feasible when it was agreed, in the mid-1980s, to adopt the principle of mutual recognition of national regulations in preference to complete harmonisation. But hundreds of EC directives were still needed to make it a reality, because so many national regulations were seen in other member states either as inadequate protection for consumers or as non-tariff barriers to trade and investment. There is no elegant, global solution to this problem. 'Subsidiarity', meaning that whatever can be should be left to national or local regulation, is a good principle, but you still have to agree on how it applies in each particular case. Most of the pressure to harmonise does not come from 'Brussels bureaucrats', but from consumer and producer lobbies in member states. It will continue. Even the quest for a single currency arises partly from a desire to eliminate uncertainties and transaction costs which fragment the market, and partly from fear that the single market leaves producers defenceless against competing products priced in a national currency which may depreciate against their own. Recent events have shown that the attempt to maintain fixed parities between separate currencies also imposes intolerable strains, but that will only increase many people's eagerness to move to an arrangement where monetary policy for the whole market is decided by consensus, rather than unilaterally by the country with the strongest currency. Security is a simpler matter, because the idea that states need to band together in a league or confederacy for the common defence of their separate national sovereignties, sacrificing a degree of autonomy for the sake of preserv-ing the rest, is familiar and well understood. If the EC's contribution to security has up to now been indirect rather than direct, that is because its members looked to the Atlantic alliance for their common defence. This was sensible so long as the main perceived threat was the expansionism of a neighbouring superpower, which western Europe and the other superpower had a common interest in resisting. Europe probably could not have defended itself without US help, and the US had no intention of leaving Europe to its fate. Things are different now. The US retains an interest in European security, but is struggling to redefine that interest in a new strategic context. The dangers Europe faces are much more diffuse than in the past. Most of them - the main exception being nuclear proliferation - are far less directly or obviously threatening to US interests than was Soviet communism. Although Europe's capacity to handle them on its own is in doubt, the doubt relates to political will and strategic vision rather than material resources; and in these areas it is not obvious that the US can make up for Europe's deficiencies. Security is not only a matter of armies and weapons, essential though those still are. As well as managing, and preferably preventing, conflicts on or near its borders, the European union (as the EC will become once Germany has ratified the treaty) faces the need to police those borders against illegal immigration and transnational crime, and to ensure order and security within them. Already these issues are the subject of intense intergovernmental co-operation, which Title VI of the treaty (on justice and home affairs) will further institutionalise. They are issues about which ordinary people throughout Europe care passionately. True, they still tend to see them mainly in a national framework, but even such a fierce nationalist as the French interior minister, Mr Charles Pasqua (a leading figure in last year's anti-Maastricht campaign), admitted recently that many aspects of them could no longer be handled by any EC member state on its own. Europe will go forward. But it badly needs a new route map. Next week I shall try to sketch in a few landmarks for the years ahead.</p>

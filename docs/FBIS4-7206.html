			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Martial arts expert Koji  Morimoto, considered a specialist in commerce and industry  issues in Komeito [Clean Government Party], was given the  construction minister's portfolio. He replaced Kozo Igarashi of  the Social Democratic Party (SDP).    Morimoto, 52, has been elected to the House of  Representatives four times by his Nara Prefecture constituency  and has served as an executive on the lower house's Steering  Committee.    Since the launching of the previous coalition government  last  August, Morimoto has been in charge of the party's Diet  management. Morimoto's post has put him in a position to  confront the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in  negotiations.    He is a close ally of party Secretary General Yuichi  Ichikawa, a coalition strategist.    Morimoto speaks in an undisguised Kansai dialect that  characterizes the natives of the Osaka-Kyoto-Nara district and  has been described as a gentle, considerate type in  interpersonal affairs. His gentle demeanor and refusal to utter  any complaints should not be confused with a lack of resolve,  however, since Morimoto is an honorary fourth degree black belt  holder in nihon kenpo, a modern version of kung fu.    In the residence for Diet members, Morimoto's room is  crowded  with physical training machines and the Kansai University  graduate also swims regularly to stay in shape.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Komatsu steps up its foreign shopping spree - The Japanese group is increasing its imports of components It may be unpalatable for many Japanese manufacturers to import components, but such a move has become increasingly attractive because of the strong yen and relatively high labour costs at home. Ending a relationship with a domestic supplier can be 'difficult to handle,' says Mr Kazuhiro Aoyagi, president of Komatsu Europe International, the Brussels-based European co-ordination centre for Japan's largest construction equipment group. But in spite of such difficulties Mr Aoyagi believes that it is inevitable that the purchase of foreign components will increase. Komatsu is well placed to spread its net wide. He notes that Komatsu imported Y7.4bn (Dollars 77m) of parts to Japan last year, accounting for 3.4 per cent of its total procurement for construction equipment. In the current financial year, this will rise to 4.95 per cent. The targets for 1995 and 1996 are 8 per cent and 10.7 per cent, respectively, he says. Komatsu is keen to bolster the competitiveness of its five domestic manufacturing plants for construction equipment and so protect its dominant position in the Japanese market and make it easier to export. To achieve this, it aims to use the supply network set up as part of its global expansion over the past two decades. That network has already been used to good effect. The group's foreign plants have been given considerable flexibility to make their own arrangements for parts, since only vital components are produced according to Komatsu drawings. Furthermore, local content agreements have obliged the company to develop links with parts suppliers in Europe, the Americas and Asia. At Komatsu UK in Birtley, north-east England, between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of each excavator is sourced 'locally', that is in the UK or continental Europe. In the past two years, Komatsu has been increasingly importing into Japan parts made by or for its foreign manufacturing plants. This began in 1983 with imports of cast steel parts from Komatsu do Brasil. Four years later, Korea's Samsung Heavy Industries began shipping cast steel parts to Komatsu  -using manufacturing facilities it had bought from Komatsu's Osaka plant. In 1990, new plants were set up in Indonesia enabling Komatsu to import casting and fabricated components from Komatsu Indonesia, while a joint venture two years later with Hokuriku United Forging Industry in Indonesia saw the beginning of imports of forgings for undercarriages. The aim of these initiatives was to take advantage of lower costs in Japan's neighbouring countries, says Mr Aoyagi. Also in 1992, undercarriage parts from Berco of Italy became the first European components to be imported to Komatsu in Japan. Berco had been supplying replacement parts for Komatsu's European distribution network. This year, the Japanese factories began taking seats and floor mats from Kab and T-Mat, two UK companies which supply the Birtley plant, and started importing hydraulic hoses from Gates in the US, a supplier to Komatsu Dresser, a US unit. Imports of sheet metal and fabricated parts from China will double next year, says Mr Aoyagi, and there will be a big increase of parts from Cummins Engine of the US to produce its engines in Japan - an important element of the two companies' business alliance announced last year. For its Japanese plants, Komatsu will mainly source castings and fabrications from Asian countries because of their low labour and transportation costs, and the relatively lower production technology needed. More sophisticated machined components will be sourced mainly from the US and Europe. Mr Aoyagi says that one possibility would be to export wheeled-loader transmissions and axles produced by its Hanomag subsidiary in Germany to Japan and the US. Direct export of parts from eastern Europe to Japan is unlikely because of high transport costs. However, Komatsu would benefit indirectly from eastern Europe's low labour rates because of the network of suppliers Hanomag has developed in countries such as Hungary and the Czech Republic. The procurement initiative is an important element in Komatsu's broad globalisation policy, which involves producing machines and sourcing components where it makes best sense to do so, while minimising new investment on manufacturing facilities. Inevitably, this has meant that complete machines - articulated dumptrucks from Norway and big all-terrain cranes from Germany - are being imported into Japan. Production of other models has been switched from Japan to plants in their main markets, from which they can be exported worldwide. In the most recent changes, announced last year, production of big dozer-tractors and wheeled loaders has moved to the US, and that of small crawler-tractors to Brazil to serve the US and South American market. Making big excavators (over 30 tonnes) at Birtley is also under review. The result is that Komatsu's highly capital-intensive Japanese plants accounted for only 89.4 per cent of its global construction equipment sales last year, down from 98.9 per cent a decade ago. Komatsu will not say how much money it is saving by importing components to Japan. Mr Aoyagi says in each case it takes three to four years to calculate the benefits. But doubtlessly it will expect to reduce the cost of the component by increasing the volume - wherever it does its shopping.</p>

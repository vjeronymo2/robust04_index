			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: A stronger pound THE FOCUS in currency markets may be back on sterling this week after several months in which the pound has been in the doldrums, writes James Blitz. In the last week, the pound has shown new strength against the dollar and the D-Mark. On Thursday evening, it closed at DM2.4500 against the D-Mark and at 80.1 per cent on the Bank of England's sterling exchange rate index, which measures the pound against its 1985 value. This was only the third time since January that the currency has been above 80 per cent on the ERI. A raft of economic indicators could take the pound even higher this week. The inflation figures due out on Friday are expected to be more or less unchanged, while manufacturing output and industrial production numbers, due out on Wednesday, should show a modest rise. But several factors could also undermine sterling's rise. First, a stronger currency may trigger new speculation in the money markets that the UK authorities will cut interest rates. With the Bundesbank easing rates in what one analyst calls 'weekly salami slices,' any thought of an easing in UK monetary policy will undermine the currency. Secondly, the UK authorities may not want the pound to rise too far. Recent surveys have highlighted the importance of sterling's devaluation in boosting the confidence of exporters. In the view of economists at NatWest Markets in London, sterling may also be undermined by the Bank of England's continuing need to build up its foreign currency reserves following the Black Wednesday debacle. As the currency approaches DM2.50 against the D-Mark, the Bank of England may take the opportunity to sell the pound and buy the German currency.</p>

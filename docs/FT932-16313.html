			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Tough times for Sanyo as electronics loses its spark - The man charged with piloting a company which has posted a Y1.2bn pre-tax loss THERE is a sense of urgency in the tone of Mr Yasuaki Takano, president of Sanyo Electric, as he outlines the challenges facing the Japanese electronics company. 'We must all make sacrifices to overcome the current difficulties, otherwise the Japanese consumer electronics industry will be shattered,' he warns. As the newly-installed president of a diversified consumer electronics company which recently reported a Y1.29bn (Dollars 10.66m) pre-tax annual loss, Mr Takano is well aware of the magnitude of the problems the industry faces. Although there is some talk that the Japanese economy is showing signs of recovery, 'the future is still very uncertain,' Mr Takano says. For Sanyo, that uncertainty looms large. Sales have already fallen by 10 per cent in the first two months of this year. The company is expecting flat revenues in the current year, 'but even achieving that is going to be tough,' Mr Takano says. Sanyo is dependent for nearly 30 per cent of its revenues on audio-visual equipment, a market that has been one of the hardest hit by the downturn in consumer spending. It has also been slow to rationalise and reduce costs at a time when the long-term growth trend of the Japanese consumer electronics market is expected to slow. The urgency of the company's problems is reflected in Mr Takano's sudden appointment as president in December. He replaced Mr Satoshi Iue, son of the company's founder, and was given the specific task of overseeing Sanyo's restructuring and rationalisation programmes. Mr Iue became chairman and chief executive in charge of global operations. The new president has an unenviable task. In a country where companies have pursued market-share rather than profits, and where compulsory redundancies are socially unacceptable, Sanyo's rationalisation and restructuring will require a shake-up of ingrained attitudes and business practices. 'We are still very soft on ourselves,' Mr Takano says. The situation, he believes, is worse than people realise. Mr Takano says the recession stems in large part from changes in consumer attitudes in Japan and a number of external pressures which will take several years for the industry to deal with. In the past, even when there was a huge drop in consumer demand, there were still many consumer durables that people wanted, Mr Takano explains. Most households had only a small refrigerator, maybe one air conditioner and at most a 20-inch television set. So, coming out of recession, there was always demand for larger refrigerators and TVs and more air conditioners. This time, however, the industry is seeing very weak consumer spending, even though people still have substantial disposable income. 'That is because there is little they want to buy and that means this recession is not going to be over soon.' At the same time, Japanese companies will be forced to change the way they operate. One factor forcing change is the need to transfer manufacturing abroad because of the yen's continuing appreciation. Sanyo has been shifting manufacturing of its mature products overseas. About 90 per cent of its tape recorders, for example, are now manufactured outside Japan. Mr Takano is worried that as manufacturing moves overseas, there will be a growing surplus of older employees in Japan. Since compulsory redundancy is difficult, companies will have to find ways of employing these people while reducing their workforces. Sanyo plans to reduce its staff of 30,600 to about 27,000 by 1995. Mr Takano sees higher social costs becoming a growing burden on Japanese companies. These include the cost of reducing working hours to 1,800 a year by 1994, as targetted by the Japanese government, and meeting stricter product liability rules and environmental issues. 'From now on, these costs will have to be included in a company's budget,' he says. But this is not the end of Mr Takano's list of difficulties facing Sanyo. Sanyo has introduced a decentralised management system with separate profit centres, aimed at raising profitability. 'From now on we have to focus on profits rather than sales,' Mr Takano says. The company is trying to shift operations to value-added products. Instead of making everything itself, Sanyo will buy in more manufactured items, particularly commodity products and those in which it has lagged other companies, such as camcorders and office equipment. It is focusing on areas where it is ahead of its competitors, such as nickel cadmium batteries which are used in portable goods, clean energy products, compressors, home appliances and cordless phones. But in case these moves prove insufficient, Sanyo has also been diversifying into services ranging from doughnut shops, golf driving ranges and karaoke bars, to property and computer software. However, all these measures will not produce results in a short time, although in the longer term Mr Takano believes the company's future is bright. 'The consumer electronics industry is such a major one that it is not going to disappear,' he says.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Union Carbide and Enichemin polyethylene venture Union Carbide of the US and Enichem, the chronically lossmaking petrochemicals arm of Italy's Eni energy and chemicals group, yesterday announced their intention to set up a joint venture which would create Europe's largest manufacturer of polyethylene, the most widely used plastic. Enichem will put its entire 1.1m tonnes a year polyethylene capacity into the 50-50 joint venture, as well as its ethylene plants at Brindisi, Italy, and Dunkirk, France. Union Carbide will supply its leading Unipol technology and contribute to the cost of constructing a new 400,000 tonnes a year polyethylene plant in Brindisi. Mr Marcello Colitti, Enichem chairman, said the deal was 'a real turning point for Enichem'. It will be Union Carbide's first direct foreign investment since the 1984 Bhopal disaster in India, when more than 3,000 people died. The companies expect the 50-50 joint venture, which has taken three years to negotiate, to begin operation during the first quarter next year. The deal is subject to European Commission approval. The move will be a blow for BP Chemicals which had been negotiating a technology licensing deal with Enichem for polyethylene. The decision to build a polyethylene plant using Union Carbide's technology would also be a setback for Montell, the venture between the Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch/Shell and Italy's Montedison. The deal will make it more difficult for Montell to justify building a plant with its competing technology. The new Brindisi plant, making mostly modern linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) could allow the joint venture to close some small and unprofitable plants manufacturing older generation low-density polyethylene. Most of such factories are in southern Italy, but any attempt to close them is likely to run into political opposition. Mr Colitti has said his aim is to focus on fewer sites. Union Carbide said the new plant would replace existing capacity of about 240,000 tonnes a year. Mr David Oxley, director of polymers at consultants Chem Systems, said the European LLDPE market was suffering 20 per cent overcapacity. Union Carbide will contribute half of the DM650m equity capital of the new company in cash, while Enichem's share will comprise part of its petrochemicals plant. The rest of Enichem's polyethylene capacity will be put into the company in the form of subordinated loans. Union Carbide and Enichem are also understood to be negotiating a venture in ethylene glycol, a raw material for PET, a plastic used in in bottles and polyester fibre. Analysts expect the Brindisi plant to cost about Dollars 450m to construct.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Vasilenko, chief of the council of experts </F> for issues of social ecology, the Nevada-Semipalatinsk  International Antinuclear Movement, in the "Opinion" column:  "Atom in Our House. The Ecological Status of Test Sites and the  Nuclear Industry"]    [Text] ...Still new instances of dangerous pollution of  territories are being revealed, whereas the elimination of the  risk zones is proceeding slowly because old "debtors" are in no  hurry to assume responsibility for their mistakes before the  people. Moreover, even the relapses and stereotypes of a  militarist ideology survive.    The public has become aware of draft agreements between the  Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan concerning  procedures for the use of test sites and joint activities for  the conversion and subsequent use of the facilities of the  former Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. An analysis of the draft  agreements indicates that no review of the documents by  ecological-law experts has been administered, i.e. the  conformity of the documents to the principles, norms, and  articles of the laws of the Russian Federation and the Republic  of Kazakhstan concerning environmental protection has not been  evaluated.    We cannot fail to take into account the fact that, from the  ecological point of view, military test sites form a specific  and specialized type of use of natural resources within the  Earth's biosphere whereby the means of the forcible conduct of  politics, armaments, and all technologies (nuclear, chemical,  physical, mechanical, bacteriological, climatic, and possibly  others) are used to destroy natural components and eliminate  live species and people within their active zone, which means  are extremely dangerous for humanity.    Following Rio-92, which adopted new principles of ecological  security, all countries of the world should revise the  principles of their international relations, all the more so  because the problem of the survival of civilization has become  an absolute priority from the point of view of the global  problems of humanity, of which the ecological problem is one.    The ideology for the joint use of territories (ecosystems)  for test sites should be ecological rather than military  (militarist). The peculiarities and specialization of each test  site should be clearly specified, set forth, and mapped out in  terms of all characteristics and parameters. The special  ecological status of this type and form of the use of natural  resources shall be based on a strict regulatory ecological  framework, ecological and legal control norms, and instruments  firmly restricting possible and permissible military and other  destruction so as to preserve nature and to not damage the  ecological systems of the Earth's biosphere and man on a local  scale, to say nothing of global.    Kazakhstan has already paid too dearly for the militarist  ambitions of the totalitarian system, and it is still paying.  This will be a forced payment until such time as Kazakhstan and  the Russian Federation implement an ecological conversion of the  nuclear power industry and the nuclear industry in general,  including such facilities as the Semipalatinsk nuclear test  site. Kazakhstan in whose lands a war has never originated could  become an international center for the ecologically safe  (natural) development of nuclear technologies, at any rate for  the period in which the raw materials accumulated in the course  of the nuclear race are used by nuclear power stations.  Therefore, for this idea to be implemented, all test sites in  Kazakhstan and Russia should be transparent to the public,  independent expert review. This is why the agreements should  provide for ecological observers. This will facilitate the  demilitarization of the consciousness of the politicians, the  military, and the public alike and the overall ecological  friendliness of the use of national resources. In general,  military test sites should have the necessary engineering and  ecological equipment and instruments for all types and forms of  the evaluation of the impact of explosions and all technologies  on the biospheric environment, ecosystems, and man within them.  In this sense, former military test sites should functionally  become ecological test sites.    In conjunction with this, the issue of the ecological status  of the Semipalatinsk test site (SIP) acquires particular social,  political, and legal significance. With the issue of the SIP  raised in this manner, we should be discussing joint activities  in the ecological retrofitting and ecological conversion of the  SIP facilities rather than their transformation. This is also a  fundamental issue because the forms and methods of eliminating  the consequences of explosions, prospects, priorities, and  directions for the development of nuclear power generation and  the nuclear industry in general hinge on it.    Taking into account the above arguments, we believe that it  is legally justified to raise the issue of openly carrying out  an independent, public ecological expert review and public  control in the area of environmental protection under the aegis  of the Nevada-Semipalatinsk International Antinuclear Movement,  its committee on issues and expert councils of scientists.  Articles 40, 42, 48, 49, 55, 59, 61, and 62 of the Law of the  Republic of Kazakhstan on the Protection of the Natural  Environment give us this right, and we are informing the  population about this.    As we see it, all the enumerated problems compel us to make  fundamental revisions in general in the "Management and Planning  Chart for Conducting Research and Testing by the Ecology and  Emergency Scientific-Research Complex," which does not even make  a reference to either the Ministry of Ecology and Biological  Resources or the International Antinuclear Movement.    We propose a different version of the management chart  which,  in addition to taking into account the place and role of the  Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources, the  Nevada-Semipalatinsk International Antinuclear Movement, should  provide for subdivisions to not just control ecological  consequences but to provide ecological services to the test site  and its zone of impact in general.    In view of the "contribution" of nuclear energy to the grave  ecological situation in Kazakhstan, we consider the issue of  setting forth the ecological status of the Republic of  Kazakhstan National Nuclear Center as an institute and sector  for special use of natural resources to be topical. In the legal  and political aspect, this issue is topical for the corporation  of the nuclear power industry and the nuclear agency because it  is associated with the issue of developing the concept of  nuclear law as law on the specific use of natural resources by  the sector.    This issue is politically and legally topical for Kazakhstan  and CIS countries in general because no effective special  institutions have been created in them to defend the ecological  rights of the population in the zones of extreme impact of  technical origin and even in the already announced disaster  zones. As a result, for example, ecological rights of the  citizens of Kazakhstan proclaimed in Article 7 of the Law on the  Protection of the Natural Environment are not actually defended  by anyone, and are violated right and left. In the sector and at  the enterprises of nuclear power generation and in the nuclear  industry this violation is currently expressed in the extremely  slow elimination of radioactive contamination and the  consequences of pollution and radioactive exposure of the  population; control over the use safety is lacking at the  locations of mining, processing, and even transportation and  burial of waste.    At present, the ecological situation in the republic and the  sector is such that, in our view, it is necessary to develop and  pass a law on the liquidation of the consequences of nuclear  explosions (military and regular industrial) carried out in  Kazakhstan, socioecological rehabilitation of the population and  disaster territories, zones, and regions, ecological conversion  of defense installations, and ecological retrofitting of the  nuclear industry. This law should provide for a comprehensive  ecological regimentation of all work in the sector and the  development of nuclear power generation and the nuclear industry  in general; from the socioecological point of view, they have  been developing by the trial and error method to this day. The  first legal act of ecological law has been passed (for now, only  with regard to sufferers in the Aral Sea area). However, this is  merely the beginning of a gigantic effort to solve the most  complex problems of social ecology.</p>

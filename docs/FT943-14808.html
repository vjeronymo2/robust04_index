			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / The Dollar in Decline: Watching the yen; ignoring the dollar 'You're kidding me,' said Morris, a T-shirt and video salesman with a street stall in downtown Washington, on being told that the dollar has been falling recently. 'I thought the dollar would have been rising against other currencies.' His reaction was not untypical. On the sunny streets of the US capital yesterday, the plight of the greenback was way down - usually off - people's list of concerns. Morris had firm views on pretty much everything: 'This government is pathetic; they wanna do something about the homeless problem. And crime.' But the dollar? 'That doesn't really affect me day to day,' he said. The folk of Tokyo see things differently. From breakfast table, to taxi, to front-page headlines, the Japanese are relentlessly focused on the yen's climb against the dollar. They are more likely to know the daily rate to two decimal points than not at all. Made dollar-weary by this national obsession, Mr Hiroshi Kume, a popular Tokyo TV presenter, yesterday related the news of the yen's rise to another record with a note of apology. 'We have relayed the news so many times already, but the yen has again posted a record high,' he said. 'Yeah, sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down,' said Mr Randy Briolat, visiting Washington yesterday with his family from Portsmouth, New Hampshire. 'It's really not a matter of serious concern - at least, I hope not.' Mr Briolat makes optical fibre and underwater cable, much of it for export. He acknowledged that a weaker dollar could help the export side of his business. Buttonholed just around the corner from the Treasury, Mr Briolat did not have any idea of the yen/dollar rate, like most respondents yesterday. One man who did know the rate was Mr Jim Stinger, a technician with Xerox. 'The dollar has been going down fast - crashing,' he said. 'It's a good thing. It's going to shake up people in this country and make us realise how screwed up we are. People have gotten too lazy.' 'It's bad,' agreed Mr Cristopher Henry, a hotel receptionist. 'But it's weird too, because the economy is doing better, especially compared with Europe. European money should be way down. But the Japanese, they work harder at selling their products.' Elsewhere, it was largely blank looks, shrugs and stares - and this in one of the most cosmopolitan US cities. But a Metro supervisor at McPherson Square - 'can't give you my name: it's against the rules' - shared the view that the dollar's weakness was bad for America. 'It weakens our buying power and makes it harder for us to stand up and say we are number one,' he said. Alfred, a homeless man begging on 14th Street, agreed: 'The dollar ain't like it used to be,' he said. Japanese PM assailed: Page 6</p>

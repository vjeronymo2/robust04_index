			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Schering-Plough wins approval from FDA for anti-allergy drug Schering-Plough became only the second company in the US to win approval for a prescription drug which combines an antihistamine with a decongestant, strengthening its position in the growing market for anti-allergy products. Claritin-D, which was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration late on Monday, will compete with Seldane-D, a Marion Merrell Dow drug. Launched in the US in August 1991, Seldane-D had sales of Dollars 142m last year. The basic form of Claritin, which does not contain a decongestant, has become one of the fastest-growing new products for Schering-Plough. Sales of the drug around the world, together with sales of Claritin-D in those countries where it already has approval, grew to Dollars 380m in the first nine months of this year, from Dollars 295m in the whole of 1993. Schering-Plough estimates that 14m of the 35m hay fever sufferers in the US also experience congestion as a significant symptom, and therefore could benefit from the new drug. Both Claritin and Seldane are non-sedating drugs, which unlike traditional antihistamines do not induce drowsiness in patients. According to IMS, a research firm, the total market for such drugs last year was worth around Dollars 1bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Morocco, Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo  Cabrisas signed the final document of the Urugauy Round and the  document for the creation of the World Trade Organization.  According to information from the Ministry of Foreign Trade, in  the declaration the ministers that represent 124 governments and  the EEC salute the historic achievement that the conclusion of  the round represents with the conviction that it will strengthen  the world economy.    In his speech before the ministerial meeting, Cabrisas  described the creation of the World Trade Organization as  positive, but warned that the economies of the South will  continue to be subject to inequalities if the foundation of the  current rules of the game are not changed. He pointed out that  Cuba will not benefit from the agreements reached in one of the  most important markets, the U.S. market, because of the U.S.  economic, trade, and financial blockade imposed on Cuba for more  than 30 years.</p>

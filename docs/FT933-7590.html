			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Willis Corroon On an optimistic view of the insurance cycle, Willis Corroon is now more geared to the upturn than its rival Sedgwick. Following the acquisition of Noble Lowndes this week, around 25 per cent of the latter's revenue comes from benefits consulting - a business more likely to show steady growth than spectacular cyclical recovery. While Willis also has ambitions in consulting, its operations are proportionately smaller. On that basis Willis might now deserve the higher rating. Despite yesterday's encouraging figures, though, it is too early to argue that all insurance markets have turned. The large rise in first-half profits was due to early insurance renewals. That hints at an equal measure of disappointment to come in the second half. Adjusting for this and the benefit of exchange rates, growth in insurance broking revenue was modest. The creditable underlying decline in expenses also owes something to history. Having acquired the US broker Corroon &amp; Black in 1990, Willis still has room to cut costs. When that process comes to an end upward pressure on expenses will be more difficult to resist. Underwriting losses are a reminder that brokers have been no more successful at the business of insurance than insurers themselves. These factors will barely dent the earnings recovery if US insurance premiums stage the kind of recovery seen in the mid-1980s. But with no sign of US rates hardening other than in specialist areas, that looks a distant hope. A price earnings ratio more than 20 times this years forecast earnings demands something more substantial.</p>

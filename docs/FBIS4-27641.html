			<p>CSO     [Text] Although taxes have become the largest source of  revenue for state coffers, the tax burden should continue to be  scrutinized to make sure that it does not discourage interest in  investment. That is why the government is always trying to keep  Indonesian taxes at a level which is attractive to foreign and  domestic investors.    These were the statements made by Minister of Finance Mar'ie  Muhammad at the dedication of the Tax Service Office in Batam on  Saturday (23 April). "We need investments because investments  can create the 11 million jobs which we have targeted up to the  end of PELITA [Five-Year Development Plan] VI," he asserted.    He reminded the audience that there are two dependable  sources of funding for the continuation of national development,  i.e., raising tax revenues and seeking increased private  investment. Both of these play an increasingly important role  given the fact that the price of oil has continued to fall and  that the market is saturated.    The deregulation package recently launched by the government  has caused a continued drop in state revenues from excises and  import duties. "Some import goods have been given relief and  even freedom from import duties in order to support  export-oriented industries," he added.    For that reason, tax revenues have assumed an increasingly  important role strategically. Safeguarding tax revenues is no  longer just the business of the Directorate General of Tax or  the Department of Finance, but has become a problem for the  whole nation and state in order to continue our national  development.    "We are not going to play games with taxes. We are past the  time when we can play games or engage in shady deals with the  tax officials, and stealing tax revenues, such as occurred in  Surabaya and Tangerang, will no longer be tolerated," he  asserted.    He acknowledged that almost every province is aware of the  need to pay taxes. Tax obligation is required in order to comply  with tax regulations and laws. On the other hand, tax officials  should not overdo it but should provide service which is proper  and humane in accordance with existing provisions of the law.    Tax Relief    On this occasion, the Governor of Riau Soeripto requested  tax  relief for local businesses in the Batam region so that they  could play a role in the Batam Federated Region. "If foreign  companies can be free from taxes, why can't they [local  companies] be given tax relief?" he asked, when he was confirmed  [as published] by reporters.    The governor said that businesses in the Batam region, such  as those on Bintan Island and Balai Karimun Cape, could actually  supply quartz sand or food to take part in building up Batam.  However, up to now the economic costs have been considered too  high because there have been too many fees involved. "Up to now  they have tended to ship their products to Singapore, even  though Batam also needs them," he asserted.    Governor Soeripto acknowledged that he had discussed the  request for tax relief with the central government, but that no  decision had been reached yet. The governor was unwilling to  give a detailed explanation about the types of fees which local  companies in the federated region have to pay.    In his report, the Governor of Riau stated that Riau's  economic growth averaged 9.25 percent a year and had taken in  11.13 trillion rupiahs in investments during PELITA V. This was  due to industry, mining, agriculture, services and other  enterprises in Riau.    Tax revenues in Riau reached 369.6 billion rupiahs, an  increase of 262 percent over the previous year. Tax revenues in  Batam reached 84.7 billion rupiahs, and are expected to reach  more than 100 billion rupiahs at the beginning of REPELITA VI,  in line with economic growth in that federated region.</p>

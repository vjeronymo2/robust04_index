			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dakar, 15 Jun (AFP) -- Three Malian Tuareg  movements have called on their fighters integrated into the  Malian Army to quit their barracks following recent clashes  within the Tuareg community, a reliable source told AFP today.    This decision certainly nullifies the April 1992 national  peace pact signed between the Malian Government and the Tuaregs.  The pact notably stipulated the incorporation of former rebels  into the regular national Army. "The risk of an outbreak of  violence has never been so high since two years but in-fighting  within the Tuareg community explains the attitude adopted by  each group toward the pact," the same source added.    The 10 and 12 June clashes led to the death of 30 Tuaregs  belonging to the Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad [MFUA].  During the incidents one of the movement's component groups, the  Popular Movement of the Azaouad [MPA], was targeted by the three  others and now the MPA remains the only group the government can  negotiate with.    The three other MFUA member groups -- the Islamic Arab Front  of the Azaouad [FIAA], the Revolutionary Army for the Liberation  of Azaouad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Azaouad  have asked their "fighters" integrated into the Army to return  to their bases in northern Mali. Furthermore, the FIAA's  representative to the government, Zaha Bi, is no longer in  Bamako.    The Malian Government, which is criticized by the political  parties for being lax about Tuareg demands, has for several  months been pressurized by MFUA, notably over the issue of  integrating former rebels into the Army. [passage omitted]    The military hierarchy has always been reticent about  incorporating Tuaregs into the Army and is opposed to their  recruitment to the grade of officers. The MFUA puts the number  of former fighters at 7,000 and says that "massive  incorporation" is the only way to stop the attacks. [passage  omitted]</p>

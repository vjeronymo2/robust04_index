			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Worst of friends: Foreign critics of Clinton have been unfair, argues Jurek Martin There is a jumpiness about America's friends and allies in the early days of the Clinton administration that has been widely noted. It needs to be held in check. The European Community, Britain and Japan have all been guilty of excess nervousness above and beyond that which is normal when the US acquires a new government. That the US is now the world's only superpower is not an excuse. Narrowing the general to the particular, those accused include Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, and unnamed Japanese 'officials'. Excluded from the charge sheet, however, is Lord David Owen, the EC's Balkan negotiator, for reasons that will be explained later. The evidence is as follows: last week, at his 'town meeting' in Detroit, President Bill Clinton was asked by a questioner from Seattle, where Boeing is the number one employer, what needed to be done about lay-offs in the US aerospace industry. He replied, probably for the 73rd time, that one of the competitive problems facing the US industry was subsidised foreign competition, viz Airbus Industrie. In the opinion of the EC and Sir Leon, he thus overlooked the fact that the US and the Community had temporarily buried the hatchet on Airbus subsidies last year. That agreement may well be the equivalent of the Magna Carta in European bureaucratic and industrial eyes, but it is doubtful that it has entered Mr Clinton's consciousness yet. It is, therefore, ridiculous to assume that he was making policy on the hoof, which seems to have been the reflex reaction in European capitals last Friday. This was not Sir Leon's first offence. He had leapt all over the Clinton administration, accusing it of 'unilateral bullying', when the steel dumping rulings were announced in the first week of the new US government. He may have done so for tactical reasons, but he also did so in the certain knowledge that this was a process, unfair as it may be, set in train under President Bush and, regardless of the occupant of the White House, unalterable under US procedures. Mr Hurd, by reputation so cool, calm and collected, also has charges to answer. He knew perfectly well, because the British embassy in Washington had told him so, that there was nothing sinister in Mr Warren Christopher's comments a while back about the composition of the UN Security Council. The secretary of state had been asked, at his own 'town meeting' with his new staff, if it was not the case that the Security Council's composition should reflect the global power structure of today and not that of 1945 when it was established. He replied that of course it should reflect contemporary realities, but, in hedging his answer with many qualifications, he did not leave the impression that he wanted Britain kicked off it. Mr Hurd, however, needlessly rose to the British tabloid bait, huffing and puffing about the importance of British membership, after a perhaps gratuitous reference to US financial arrears to the UN. It is hard to keep track of the Japanese egregiousness in a fistful of mostly anonymous Tokyo briefings questioning US trade policy. This is a legitimate concern though mostly derived from reading what once liberated academics such as Laura Tyson have written over the years and which conveniently forgets that few heads of the Council of Economic Advisers, which she now is, have exercised real policy clout in living memory. More than that, these same sources have been questioning the moral fibre of American society. There are reasons for such questions, especially when Japanese visitors to the US have suffered violent physical attacks. But the extrapolation of specific incidents into a general decay takes a little stomaching on this side of the Pacific, where people are aware not only of Japan's trade practices but also of its unwillingness to sully itself by taking more than the bare minimum of the 18m refugees now littered around the world. Lord Owen, whose excoriation of the presumed US policies towards Bosnia were, until last week, conspicuous, at least had both legitimate grievances (lack of consultation by the new administration and the blackening of the reputation of his negotiating partner, Cyrus Vance) and an immediate purpose. This was to try and dissuade Washington from rearming the Bosnian Moslems, which, he was convinced, would have scuppered the Vance-Owen peace process. He played his thin deck of cards for all it was worth, not only with the administration, with success, but also, exquisitely if with mixed results, with the pundits of The New York Times. But the combination of all the above, excepting Lord Owen, guilty only of typically bad manners, has not exactly been to make friends and influence people in Washington. America's friends and allies have seemed petulant and self-serving rather than recognising reality - which is that they need the new US administration as much as, if not more than, at any time since the reconstruction after the last world war. What should be borne in mind is that, for the first time in 12 years, the US has a government from a different party. Its instincts, its priorities and its value judgments may well be some miles removed from its immediate predecessors, especially from President Bush, schooled almost exclusively in the clubby and cold war-dominated world of international affairs still inhabited by so many western leaders. Europe, the UK and Japan have to learn that this administration may take its time to make up its mind on policy issues and that, to paraphrase LBJ on J Edgar Hoover, it is better to be on the inside of the tent urinating out than vice versa. Given the fractured state of Europe and Japan's uncertainty, the only nation currently capable of putting up the tent is the US. And if Mr Clinton is too polite or too canny to say so, then there are a lot of Americans with influence who are not. Just for starters, most consider Bosnia to be 'a European war'.</p>

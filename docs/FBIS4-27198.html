			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 29 KYODO -- The second largest  opposition Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ]  adopted a declaration Sunday [29 May] calling for general  elections in case the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  resigns en bloc voluntarily.    The declaration by the SDPJ's central committee came at the  end of a two-day meeting in Tokyo.    The SDPJ is demanding the disbanding of Hata's fragile  minority coalition government and the formation of a new  coalition supported by a majority of parties, including itself.    The SDPJ did not join the Hata government when it was formed  a month ago after his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, backed by  the party, resigned in a dispute over the former premier's  personal financial dealings.</p>

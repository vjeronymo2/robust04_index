			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / International Press Review: Fretting about Fidel Castro - Florida A slow-motion Mariel, as the current exodus of hundreds of Cuban migrants to the US has been called because it resembles the 1980 boatlift of 125,000 refugees, was a human interest story early last week. The press, in chorus, registered admiration for the courage of those crossing the Florida Strait. Reference was made to the Mariel crisis, but the consensus appeared to be that the news was about Cuban people, not US policy-makers. There was, even so, perhaps some disagreement over policy. In a scrap that seemed to go against type, a Wall Street Journal editorial advised against lifting the US trade embargo against Cuba for fear of reviving President Fidel Castro, while the Washington Post leader suggested that the US trade embargo against the Caribbean republic, hand-in-hand with a US policy of welcoming Cuban refugees, was responsible for the accelerating flow of migrants and that US policy needed a rethink. In general, however, there was not much to differentiate US newspaper coverage of the flight from Cuba. But last Thursday night, when Ms Janet Reno, US attorney-general, announced a reversal of Washington's 30-year-old policy on Cuban immigration and said that would-be immigrants picked up off the Florida coast would be detained at third-country safe havens, all that changed. President Bill Clinton closed the door on Cuban refugees, but opened the debate on US relations with Cuba. On Friday morning, the Miami Herald, Florida's largest English-language daily, endorsed a hard-line on immigration and called on the federal government to relieve Florida of the burden of Cuban refugees. The editorial revolved around a demand from Dade County, which incorporates Miami, to be reimbursed for state and county expenditure on refugees, claimed to be Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) since the mid-1980s. The Miami Herald responded to Ms Reno's comment that the federal government has spent Dollars 44m on refugees this year by saying: 'Since Mariel, Dade and Florida have spent many times that sum on refugees. They're a federal responsibility, not ours.' The fact that Mariel is a 'sad memory for many political North Americans' was acknowledged by El Nuevo Herald, the Miami Herald's Spanish-language counterpart. Although El Nuevo Herald comes folded into the English daily, the thrust of its editorial was different. No reference was made to the state's finances or the federal government's duties to protect Florida residents. Rather, attention was on how to deal with Mr Castro. Headlined 'What are the Americans waiting for?', the leader railed against the US administration, Was it waiting for 'television pictures of the bodies of women, children and old people, massacred on Cuba's shores, before they denounce the genocide before the United Nations?' El Nuevo Herald called on Mr Clinton to take a 'golden opportunity' to use the US 'free hand in the UN security council' to get a transition in Cuba to free elections, the organisation of political parties and observation of human rights - supervised by the UN. In Diario Las Americas, a Florida Spanish-language daily, Monsignor Agustn Roman, Auxilary Bishop to the Miami diocese and spiritual leader to most of the Latin community there, concurred that the central issue is what happens in Cuba. He warned against addressing the effects of the problem (the exodus, one presumes) 'without dealing with its cause' (Mr Castro). However, the divisions in Florida's coverage are by no means clearly along Cuban-American vs. North American lines. Even in one edition of the Miami Herald, there appears to be a variety of opinion over the merits of the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act by which, until Thursday, the US had granted Cubans fleeing their country refuge in the US and eligibility for permanent residence status after one year. On the Herald's front page, an article implied this was unfair: 'Cuban refugees have been the privileged few, accorded rights no other group receives', adding reference to the thousands of Haitians who have been detained lately while trying to enter the US. On the inside pages, however, barring access to the Cubans is represented as an injustice: 'For 30 years it has been unthinkable to refuse asylum to refugees from Cuba who crossed the liquid Berlin Wall that is the Florida Straits  .. Clinton labeled the flight of refugees from Cuba 'illegal', a word no-one would have used in the past to describe those fleeing hard-line countries that were part of the Soviet bloc.' But, after all, it's vacation time. The Citizen, the broadsheet in Key West on the southern tip of Florida, reported holidaymakers' reactions under the headline: 'A state of emergency, where?'</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Tandy to create 3,600 jobs with 30 new stores Tandy, the US electronics retailer, is to open 30 new stores this year, creating more than 3,600 jobs in the US. The company forecast increased growth and profitability for the year. Last year, Tandy divested its manufacturing operations to focus on retailing. The company is the largest electronics retailer in the US with around 6,900 stores and dealer franchise outlets. 'Driven by new store openings and innovative services ideas, 1994 should provide excellent sales growth for Tandy,' said Mr John Roach, chairman and chief executive. Tandy's expansion plans reflect strong sales of personal computers and related products. The new stores to be opened this year include 24 new Computer City SuperCenters, which will employ approximately 1,600 people. In addition, Tandy will open six new Incredible Universe consumer electronics superstores, creating about 1,800 jobs. The company added that it would add about 200 employees to its infrastructure and financial departments. Tandy recently reported an 18 per cent increase in sales at its US retail operations to Dollars 687m for the month of December 1993, compared with Dollars 581.4m in the same month a year earlier.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-SHA'B in Arabic in its issues  of 11 and 14 January carries several articles highlighting an  apparent dispute between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Labor  Party in connection with a recent call by the government for a  dialogue with the opposition and the opposition's response to it.    In a 1,500-word article on page 5 of the 11 January edition,  Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi notes that the  Brotherhood welcomes the call for national dialogue and refers  to the consensus among political parties and other political  forces that "political reform is the true introduction to any  earnest reformation of our dear country's affairs."    He expresses astonishment at published statements saying  that  the dialogue will be restricted to five political parties the  representatives of which will talk with the National Democratic  Party's [NDP] representatives and that some political forces,  notably the Muslim Brotherhood, have been excluded, at least  from the initial stages of the dialogue.    He asks: "Who permitted these parties to speak for the  nation and the people or even to speak for other political  parties and forces, some of which, notably the Muslim  Brotherhood, have a real presence in several associations and  institutions, a presence that rivals--even exceeds--the  political weight and influence of these parties? I am afraid  the gambit has succeeded and the government's party [NDP] has  lured other parties into doing exactly the same thing they used  to criticize the government and its party for doing. Each of  these parties used to proclaim, for all the world to hear, that  those who can speak on behalf of the people or make decisions  pertaining to any public affair must be freely elected by the  people in an integrated democratic process. How can these  parties now participate in choosing the delegates to a  conference that will discuss political, economic, and  intellectual problems, et cetera? Is it enough to bestow  legitimacy on them that the delegates are chosen by six  political parties?"    Al-Hudaybi continues: "We say frankly that each of these six  political parties represents only itself."    He cites the Wafd Party's newspaper [AL-WAFD] as reporting  on  8 January 1994 that the 12 licensed political parties represent  only 15 percent of the groups that speak for the nation.    In a special 300-word message to Labor Party Secretary  General 'Adil Husayn published inside a box below the AL-SHA'B  article, al- Hudaybi blames him for ignoring the Muslim  Brotherhood in a recent article in which Husayn spoke of the  need for political reform to enable the legal political parties  to participate in elections.    Al-Hudaybi says: "I found that you limited the issue of  political reform to expediting the exercise of political rights  (elections). You repeatedly said that the elections should be  held with the participation of what you called the legal  parties. You did not say one word about the need to recognize  other political forces, notably the Muslim Brotherhood. Your  party carried it to the People's Assembly and it carried your  party to the People's Assembly in the 1987 election. The same  happened during the local elections of 1992. The Brotherhood  established an Islamic alliance with your party, contesting the  elections under the slogan 'Islam is the Solution.' This was  originally a Muslim Brotherhood slogan."    Al-Hudaybi adds: "You also referred in your article to the  State Security detectives' pursuit of the members of what you  described as the legitimate parties. You did not say one word  about their pursuit of and injustice to other political forces,  as if you believe that these forces--not having obtained what  you refer to as legitimacy--have no immunity and that their  pursuit and confiscation of their means of livelihood no longer  concern you, and that this is why you neglected to refer to them  in any of the 10 principles mentioned in your article."    'Adil Husayn responds in a 700-word message published inside  a box on page 5 of the 14 January edition of AL-SHA'B addressed  to: "My brother Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi."    He says he can find no explanation for al-Hudaybi's remark  that the political parties represent only themselves and reminds  him that in their statement responding to the government's call  for dialogue, the political parties agreed that the leaders and  accredited representatives of the political parties and forces  would take part in the dialogue. He advises him to resist the  attempt to exclude the Muslim Brotherhood but not to reject the  very idea of dialogue among the political parties and forces and  the ruling party.    He declares: "Honorable brother, my opinion is known. It is  that the Muslim Brotherhood must participate in any earnest  political dialogue as an independent body, not via another  party."    He adds: "It is strange that you should infer from my  discussion of the legal guarantees we are demanding for the  political parties that I am permitting the persecution of the  Muslim Brotherhood. My dear sir, we are seeking to expand  democracy so that the political forces that have not been  recognized can be recognized, since they do have an undeniable  presence."    Husayn expresses dissatisfaction with the "tone" of  al-Hudaybi's article from "beginning to end."    He continues: "I did not feel comfortable with what you said  about the Islamic alliance, particularly that the slogan 'Islam  is the solution' is the Muslim Brotherhood's exclusive slogan.  Actually it is the slogan of Muslims everywhere and in every  age."    Husayn ends his response with a reference to the Labor  Party's long-established Islamic credentials and addresses  al-Hudaybi: "Concluding, my brother Counselor: The enemies of  Islam are lying in wait for its advocates and concocting plots  and sedition. We must be wary and vigilant. I still believe  that what joins us together is the declaration: There is no God  but God and Muhammad is his messenger. This is much more  important than any differences between us. Brother counselor, I  pray that God will clear the differences between you and me  according to righteousness. May this chapter be closed."</p>

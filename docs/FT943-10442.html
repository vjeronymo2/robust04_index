			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Ballot deals blow to rail strikers: Third of network likely to remain open as supervisors vote not to join dispute A severe blow was dealt last night to the strike strategy of the RMT transport union when its rail supervisors voted decisively against joining the signalling staff's dispute. The 225-157 result, announced after a postal ballot with a high turnout of 72 per cent, will please ministers and Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible for running the network. They had feared that involvement by the supervisors and managers in the eight-week-old dispute would have led to a serious intensification of the conflict. The firm rejection by the supervisors and managers means that Railtrack will be able to keep at least a third of the network open for normal business over the 72 hours of stoppages planned around next weekend. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said: 'The result is an obvious disappointment to the union but in some respects was not a total surprise.' He blamed what he called 'interference in the balloting process' by Railtrack through its attempts to put pressure on the supervisors and managers into voting against industrial action. However, Mr Knapp added that the result was 'not critical to the conduct of the dispute'. Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack's chairman, said last night he was 'very pleased' with the outcome of the supervisors' ballot. 'Clearly RMT members are very dispirited with this futile and unnecessary action by the signalling staff,' he said. 'It is time that the RMT ended this charade, listened to their members and worked to resolve the dispute.' Mr Knapp also announced that the RMT union executive had decided to ballot 500 level-crossing keepers who belong to the RMT union, calling on them to support the signalling staff. However, any such ballot would take at least three weeks and it would be unlikely to make any important difference to the outcome of the dispute. The rejection by the signal box supervisors is bound to increase the pressure on the RMT union as it tries to find ways of returning to the negotiating table with Railtrack. Yesterday Mr Knapp wrote to Mr Horton asking for clarification of the company's letter to signalling staff, in which it said it was ready to reshape the pay productivity package to meet the union's concerns about the level of basic pay rates. Railtrack added it was prepared to consolidate half a 6 per cent unconsolidated supplement that is part of its offer to the union which would ensure an immediate increase in earnings for the signalling staff of 4.7 per cent. This is only 1 percentage point less than the union alleged Railtrack had offered on June 8 before the government stepped in to veto it. Meanwhile, Mr David Matthew, head of the Freight Transport Federation's rail freight division, warned that many companies were likely to no longer use the railway network because of uncertainty about the reliability of the service. Mr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, said he believed that the ingredients for a settlement of the dispute were in place and that a deal could be reached.

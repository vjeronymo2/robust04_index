			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAD TRASH MAKES GOOD POLITICS  </P> <P> The subject, trash, may seem prosaic. But the Los Angeles City Council's  unanimous approval Wednesday of the nation's largest mandatory trash recycling  program easily stands as a landmark in Southern California's recycling history.  </P> <P> In the nearly 30 years since Sam Yorty was elected mayor of Los Angeles, mainly  on the strength of his opposition to curbside trash separation, elected  officials throughout the region have been fearful of fooling with people's  garbage. But, as this week's vote demonstrates, there has been a change of  heart. To some extent, this shift is a recognition of the undeniable fact that  California as a whole is running out of landfills in which to bury its solid  waste. It was that reality that lead the last session of the Legislature to  create a full-time state solid waste management board with broad powers to cut  California's trash in half by the turn of the century.  </P> <P> More important, the public has changed its mind. In fact, 90% of the Southern  Californians surveyed in a recent Times Poll endorsed recycling. Pilot trash  separation programs in Los Angeles and San Diego have enjoyed remarkable levels  of voluntary participation. Smaller communities, such as Santa Monica,  Pasadena, Burbank and Glendale already have successful recycling programs in  place.  </P> <P> Under Los Angeles' approach, which will be phased in over three years, each of  the city's 720,000 single-family households will be given a 16-gallon bin for  cans and bottles and a 90-gallon container for other refuse. Newspapers are to  be tied and placed on top of the bins at curbside. A separate program is to be  developed for the private trash haulers who serve businesses and apartment  buildings with more than four units.  </P> <P> When Yorty was elected in 1961, a majority of Southern Californians viewed the  prospect of having to separate their refuse as a nuisance. Today, most people  see trash separation as an act of conscience -- an important and necessary  admission that material affluence brings responsibility as well as ease and  that we no longer can live heedlessly on this land.  </P></p>

U.S. private sector entities including industry, universities, foundations and other organizations which have a strong interest in promoting, and investing in, commercial relationships between U.S. entities and NIS institutes are invited to attend.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the workshop is to describe to academia and U.S. private sector entities (1) the scope of the NIS Industrial Partnering Program, (2) the terms of a DOE-U. S. Industry Coalition (USIC) partnership arrangement, (3) the opportunities available to USIC members, and (4) the terms and conditions of USIC membership. Suggestions for improving the program will also be solicited. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  DOE will hold a workshop on April 25, 1994, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The Secretary of Energy has been charged with the implementation of the program, which allowed for the inclusion of the other New Independent States (NIS), and is now referred to as the ``NIS Industrial Partnering Program.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The program will have two principal components. Both are intended to assist NIS institutes with converting from defense to commercial applications thereby reducing the potential for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The first component is designed to engage the scientists and engineers at key technical and scientific institutes of the NIS in non-defense activities. This component is an expansion of unclassified cooperative non-defense research and development activities that have been conducted for some time between individual DOE National Laboratories and individual NIS institutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second component is designed to assist in stabilizing the NIS technical and scientific infrastructure, to encourage the commercialization of NIS technologies, and promote the development in the NIS of market-oriented economies. A number of cost-shared international industrial partnerships will be formed, each involving at least one DOE National Laboratory, one NIS institute, and at least one U.S. industrial entity, whose contribution to the success of the partnership will be critical. A significant portion of the U.S. Government contribution to support the program is intended for NIS institutes to spur follow-on trade and investment by U.S. industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In July 1993, DOE sponsored a meeting, involving representatives from the National Laboratories and representatives of U.S. private sector entities with experience in NIS-to-U.S. technology transfer and commercialization. As a result of that, and subsequent meetings, it was concluded that a program of commercial industry-selected partnerships to invest in NIS technologies would be facilitated if a consortium of U.S. private sector entities could be established. The Secretary of Energy would then enter into a cooperative agreement with such a consortium, using the authority, and under the terms set out in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, the Cooperative Research Act of 1984, and other applicable statutes. The consortium would be required to give special attention to the needs of small businesses under the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, U.S. industry representatives have voluntarily formed and incorporated the U.S. Industry Coalition (USIC) with an interim Board of Directors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Membership in USIC will be required for participation in cost-sharing projects that involve the section 575 funds. Membership in USIC will be open to all U.S. entities, including universities, consortia, and corporations incorporated in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program questions may be raised during the Question and Answer periods of the Workshop. Questions that would be of interest to multiple attendees may be included in the Workshop Minutes which will be distributed to attendees after the Workshop. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Albuquerque, NM, April 7, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard A.

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (30): A better way to raise funds - How an animal charity targets its mailings more closely THE RSPCA, Britain's famous animal charity, has been working to protect animals since 1824. Today, direct mailing is its lifeline: its activities are funded entirely through donations from the public, which last year reached Pounds 30m, a remarkable Pounds 10m increase on the previous year, writes Claire Gooding. The aim of its marketing database project is to increasing revenue by producing focused mailings. Like any charity, the RSPCA is concerned with getting good value for money. Its new marketing database is dedicated to producing market statistics and tailored membership lists, so that direct mailing becomes more efficient and cost-effective, the main aim being to release funds for the animal welfare work. From the RSPCA headquarters in Horsham, where its fund-raising and membership activities are based, project manager David Stechler explains the problems that faced him. 'We had 40 different databases, which we wanted to consolidate into one source of information for in-house control and reduced cost.' It was not just a matter of co-ordinating the various sources for the 450,000 names on the RSPCA lists, but also of bringing together three separate services, the Axciom bureau, which produced the lists, the Brand Direct direct marketing house, and Mail Marketing, which would analyse and deliver response information back to Axciom. Costs were considerable, as the RSPCA was mailing at least one campaign monthly, and a major mailing every three months, and paying each time for the use of the Axciom data. Mr Stechler sent his 'wish list' of features to 26 suppliers of packaged solutions. These whittled down to a shortlist of six who were able to offer systems for charities: CMG, the Specialist Computer Group, Donorbase, Minerva, Systemteam and Care Business Solutions. The plan was to integrate all the older systems for payroll, library and membership, currently on different DEC and Data General hardware. This scheme eliminated the PC-only solutions for the marketing database. The RSPCA users felt most comfortable with the proposal from Care, essentially a bespoke system based on the Empress relational database. 'We liked the people, they were local, close, and the users felt that this product would be theirs rather than anyone else's because it could be tailored to our requirements so closely. We felt this might give us an edge, and we wanted an advantage over the competition.' Now all the core systems, donation, accounts, contacts and membership, are in one integrated system. 'We've rationalised on one HP 9000 with a PC network for all our applications,' explains Mr Stechler. 'Our objective was to create a system where any authorised user could access any application from any terminal.' The RSPCA refused to reveal how much the entire project cost, but is convinced of its benefits. 'This system is cheaper to run, and it is more effective at getting donations because we can identify the hierarchy: people who are just interested, those who have given members, active members. If we know who all our contacts are, it's easier to convert a one-off contact into an active member.' The RSPCA's own data includes details of donations, legacies, covenants and legacies, responses to mailshots and information from mail order trading operations. In addition, it buys in 'cold lists' from third parties such as list broker Dudley Jenkins. The Care system links with GB Mailing which draws on Royal Mail address files for postcodes, and is then linked with the Mosaic system for s ocio-demographic analysis of postcoded addresses. The next step, now that the system is in place, is to sample the database, an exercise which will allow the RSPCA to target its mailings more closely, and achieve its aim of bringing in more funds, spending less on information technology - and more on rescuing animals in distress.</p>

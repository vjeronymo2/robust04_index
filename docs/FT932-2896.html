			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Government climbs down on tax relief for oil companies THE GOVERNMENT yesterday bowed to pressure from Tory backbench MPs over proposed changes to North Sea oil taxes, extending short-term help for companies worst affected by the changes. Although the Treasury said no new government spending would be involved, the change means that companies will find it easier to claim the Pounds 200m in aid which was earmarked - with tight restrictions - in the March Budget. But the amendments proposed by the Treasury may not go far enough to stem a backbench rebellion and the government may be forced to make further concessions. Mr John Butterfill, one of the leading Tory campaigners against the original Budget proposal, called the concession a very small move in the right direction. Mr John Watts, the Tory chairman of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs, welcomed the move but said he hoped the government could be persuaded to move a bit further. The proposed changes to petroleum revenue taxes announced in the Budget caused a furore among many smaller companies in the oil industry because they abolished relief for exploration work. Companies said it would lead to a halving of exploration activity and the loss of up to 30,000 jobs. But larger companies such as British Petroleum welcomed the proposed reduction in the tax rate for existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. The Treasury yesterday admitted its original Budget proposals had made it too difficult for companies to claim transitional help to cushion them from the initial effects of the tax changes. In yesterday's amendment, the government said it would allow companies to claim up to Pounds 10m each until the end of next year for exploration work that will be affected by the abolition of tax relief. Mr Butterfill said he and others would press for the relief to be extended until 1996. 'It's a helpful step but far too modest,' he said yesterday. 'It will help one or two companies but it won't solve the fundamental problem.' Companies will be able to claim interim relief on wells they had committed to drill as part of obligations made to the Department of Trade and Industry in order to win licences to explore in the North Sea. The DTI was understood to be pushing the Treasury to loosen its restrictions on transitional aid. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said this week that applications for seven blocks in the latest oil licensing round had been withdrawn as a result of the PRT changes and that some companies had scaled back the number of wells they planned to drill. Backbenchers are likely to discuss the change with the oil companies before deciding how much further to press the government.</p>

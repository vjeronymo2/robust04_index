			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Japanese 'godfather' under pressure MR Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced 'godfather' of Japanese politics, was under increasing pressure last night from within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party to respond to public criticism of his behaviour by making a ritualistic show of remorse. The ruling party has been shaken by continuing public protests and polls reflecting deep disgust with the lenient treatment of Mr Kanemaru, who was given a Y200,000 (Pounds 984) fine for accepting an illegal donation of Y500m from a parcel delivery company. There is also public anger over his apparently frequent dealings with gangster groups. Mr Kanemaru was under attack yesterday on two fronts, from within his own faction, the party's largest, and from other LDP factions. Seven MPs from three different factions yesterday urged the 'godfather' to resign from the party, while others have suggested privately that he should give up his parliamentary seat. Members of Mr Kanemaru's faction have been meeting over the past three days to discuss his plight, and it is clear that senior members see the present turmoil as an opportunity to improve their own standing and challenge Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former party secretary-general and Mr Kanemaru's chosen successor. Meanwhile, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, has watched helplessly from the sidelines. Reliant on Mr Kanemaru to raise the numbers necessary for his appointment last year, he is unable to take action against him. Mr Miyazawa's lack of leadership has been condemned in Japanese editorials, while the LDP has been distracted from issues such as the ailing economy and the troubled relationship with Russia. When he first confessed in late August to taking the illegal funds, Mr Kanemaru resigned as vice-president of the party and said he would resign as chairman of the faction, which is the more powerful of the two positions. But he has since been encouraged to keep that position for fear that his departure would create a bitter fight for control of the faction. However, fighting has anyway erupted within the faction, as senior officials opposed to Mr Ozawa's 'arrogant' management style have attempted to blame him for the problems faced by the 'godfather'. At the same time, public demands for Mr Kanemaru's resignation have failed to dissipate. The Mainichi Shimbun, a leading Japanese daily newspaper, has opened an 'action line' to encourage readers to complain. A 54-year-old real estate agent warned that 'the administrators of justice, the politicians and organised crime' have been co-operating with each other and 'we can't let this situation continue'. A 57-year-old housewife said she was 'disillusioned' by the handling of Mr Kanemaru's case, and suggested the Social Democratic Party, the leading opposition party, had been cowardly. The SDP is reluctant to get involved in the dispute because its own members have received illegal funds from the same parcel delivery company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin.</p>

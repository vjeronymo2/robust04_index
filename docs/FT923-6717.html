			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Holiday industry on alert for cuts WITH MUCH of Britain still on holiday, tour operators will next week start announcing their 1993 programmes, giving an early indication of whether the industry's price battles are set to continue. Operators and travel agents will be looking at any reduction in the number of holidays offered. Mr Roger Allard, managing director of Owners Abroad, the UK's second-largest operator, estimated that the supply of 1992 holidays exceeded demand by 1m in February and March. By the summer fierce price competition and some trimming of capacity had reduced this to 500,000. The industry will focus particularly on the brochures of Thomson, the market leader, which announces its 1993 offerings on Tuesday. Ms Rosemary Astles, Thomson's marketing director, said the company was determined to restore its market share to a third. Oversupply of holidays this year saw Thomson's share fall to 30 per cent, she said. Owners Abroad announced at the start of this year's high season that it had cut 100,000 holidays from its programme. Mr Allard said the company would reduce capacity by a further 5 per cent next year. Ms Astles said Thomson had no intention of doing the same. 'We will not be contributing generously to the reduction of the oversupply because we didn't start the oversupply,' she said. As to price, she said Thomson would not be too concerned if other companies offered cut-price holidays 'as a gimmicky come-on - as long as there are not too many available'. Thomson's price policy would be 'made with our market-share objective in mind'. In the past this has meant Thomson reacting to oversupply or cheap offerings from rivals with a warning burst of price-cutting. Mr George Marcall, sales director of Airtours, the third-largest operator, said his company's 1993 prices were likely to be at the same level as this year's. Mr Allard expected prices to rise by 2 per cent or 3 per cent. Both forecasts imply a price cut in real terms. The falling dollar has, however, reduced the cost of providing US holidays. As aircraft fuel is priced in dollars, savings are also available to other destinations. In addition, Mr Marcall said, the Mediterranean had had a difficult summer and tour operators would be able to drive a hard bargain with hoteliers. Mr Peter Rothwell, marketing director of Lunn Poly, the biggest chain of travel agents, said he expected some eye-catching promotional offers, such as free holidays for children. 'But really, these will tend to be price skirmishes rather than fully-fledged battles.' Operators will try to capture that proportion of the market which tends to book holidays early. Factory workers who have to take their holidays during plant shutdowns are among those booking early. This usually means strong early bookings from the north, which has proved to be a more resilient market than the south during the recession.</p>

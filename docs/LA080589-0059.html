			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REILLY TOURS ALASKA, EXPECTS CLEANUP TO CONTINUE IN 1990;  </P> <P> EPA CHIEF WANTS EXXON TO HONOR PLEDGE  </P> <P> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly said here Friday  that Exxon should not abandon its efforts to clean up the nation's largest oil  spill until the job is done.  </P> <P> In the most forceful language he has yet employed, Reilly said that despite  Exxon's claims that the cleanup will be completed by Sept. 15 it was "quite  clear this job is not going to be done this year.  </P> <P> Reilly, in response to a question, said Exxon should be held to its original  pledge not to quit until the cleanup was complete.  </P> <P> "I believe Exxon ought to be here next year. I'll say that right now," Reilly  said as he stepped off a float plane onto one of the most heavily oiled islands  in Prince William Sound.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Take It Step by Step'  </P> <P> "It's clearly not the task of one summer and probably even not a couple of  years. But we'll take it step by step," Reilly said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Reilly said that Exxon's response so far to the nation's largest  oil spill has been "positive" and that "we expect them to continue to do that."  </P> <P> Reilly's remarks come at a time of lingering confusion over Exxon's future  cleanup plans, and on the same day that the U.S. Coast Guard reported that  1,355 miles of Alaskan shoreline -- nearly twice the earlier estimate -- had  been affected by the March 24 oil spill of 11 million gallons from the tanker  Exxon Valdez.  </P> <P> As recently as Friday, Otto Harrison, general manager of Exxon's cleanup  effort, told a hearing in Anchorage that the company would make no commitments  to fund more oil removal efforts next year, according to a United Press  International report.  </P> <P> Exxon has came under fire in Congress and from Alaskan officials after the  disclosure of a July 19 company memo written by Harrison that said there were  no guarantees the cleanup would be resumed next spring after winter storms  subside.  </P> <P> Later, in testimony before a Senate committee, Exxon President William D.  Stevens appeared to retreat from that position, calling the memo's wording  unfortunate.  </P> <P> Stevens said the company would comply with any "reasonable" request from the  U.S. Coast Guard, which is overseeing the federal government's response to the  spill.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, many viewed the testimony as giving the oil company breathing room  not to return.  </P> <P> Exxon also issued a statement July 28 quoting from a statement by Lawrence G.  Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp., at Exxon's May 18 annual shareholders meeting:  </P> <P> "Our objective is to complete the job by mid-September, and milestones have  been established to measure our progress. In any event, we will return to the  area in the spring of 1990 to reinspect the area, to assure that the job has  been properly done, and if not, to put it right."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Toll of Beaches  </P> <P> The Coast Guard said Friday that less than a third of the 1,355 miles of  beaches have been treated by Exxon.  </P> <P> Exxon reported late last month that it would spend $1.28 billion on the  cleanup.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Exxon's decision to quit for the winter because of adverse weather  conditions came under fire again from Alaska officials.  </P> <P> Alaska Environmental Commissioner Dennis Kelso, in testimony before the Alaska  Oil Spill Commission meeting in Anchorage, said the decision called into  question the industry's ability to deal with a spill during winter.  </P> <P> "If it really is Exxon's position that an effective response cannot be safely  maintained during the winter months, then what does that say about the  transport of oil in Prince William Sound or in other parts of the Alaskan  environment during those same months?" Kelso asked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Visits Two Islands  </P> <P> Meanwhile, EPA Administrator Reilly, in his first inspection of Prince William  Sound since the cleanup mobilization, visited Knight and Green islands, which  were among the hardest hit by the spill.  </P> <P> Reilly said that he was encouraged by the cleanup progress and by preliminary  results which show that applying fertilizers on the oiled beaches accelerates  the breakdown of the oil.  </P> <P> Reilly declined, however, to comment at length on a controversial proposal to  use a chemical dispersant on or near beaches to break up the oil.  </P> <P> On Thursday, eight environmental organizations urged Reilly to forbid the use  of the dispersant, known as Corexit 9580, because of its potential toxicity to  marine life.  </P> <P> "We're taking it seriously," Reilly said. He said toxicological tests would be  completed by Aug. 10. "There's time for a decision," he said.  </P> <P> Reilly also met with Exxon officials here, as well as local, state and federal  officials. Later, he was scheduled to fly to Cordova, a fishing community hard  hit by the loss of the salmon season.  </P> <P> Reilly, who is scheduled to fly Sunday to Mexico City for preparations for the  summit between the U.S. and Mexico, said he will report his Alaskan findings to  President Bush.  </P></p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / BT-MCI deal to get go-ahead British Telecommunications is set to gain the consent of US regulatory authorities for its Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.5bn) alliance with MCI, the second largest US operator. The US Department of Justice, and the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecommunications regulator, may clear the BT deal as soon as this week, following a year-long inquiry. 'All the lights are green,' said an industry source. Regulatory approval for the BT/MCI deal, signed last June, has taken far longer than expected, leading to repeated postponements of the launch of a joint venture between the two operators. The European Commission cleared the alliance last September. A Dollars 1bn joint venture company, geared to the international telecoms needs of multinationals, will be launched soon, based in Washington. BT will also be free to complete its Dollars 4.3bn purchase of 20 per cent of MCI. The FCC's ruling will be tied to conditions, but they are not believed to be onerous on BT. Disputes between rival US/UK operators as to the openness of their respective telecoms markets have dogged the approval process. AT&amp;T, which competes fiercely with MCI in the US long-distance market and with BT internationally, claimed the UK to be less favourable to new operators than the US. Consent for the BT/MCI deal does not finally resolve the issue. A separate BT application to resell leased telecoms lines in the US is still pending, as is an application by Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK's second largest telecoms group, for a waiver allowing it to have stakes exceeding 25 per cent in US cellular mobile operations. AT&amp;T also has an application pending in the UK for full access to the UK public network. Regulatory authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have privately expressed optimism that each will soon be able to pronounce the other broadly equivalent in terms of openness. That would permit the granting of consent to the outstanding applications, and open the way to 'international simple resale' between the US and UK - competition by leased-line operators offering services across the public networks in both countries, which could significantly reduce transatlantic telecoms prices. Several large US telecoms operators are active in the UK's cable and cellular mobile markets. Two of them - Nynex and US West - have supported Cable &amp; Wireless's waiver application before the FCC.</p>

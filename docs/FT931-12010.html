			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Decline in moves from London THE NUMBER of companies moving out of central London fell by a third last year because of the recession and oversupply in the office market, according to a report on decentralisation by Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors, Vanessa Houlder writes. The report found that: Only 14 organisations plan to relocate from central London in the next four years. In 1992, 23 organisations and 10,938 jobs moved out of central London. That compares with nearly 14,000 jobs and 30 companies in 1991. Property cost savings remain the most important motive for moving out of central London. However their importance is diminishing as a result of the narrowing of rent differentials between central London and suburban office markets. Companies are moving longer distances to achieve greater cost savings. Only 35 per cent of moving companies stayed in the south-east in 1992, compared with 79 per cent between 1983 and 1991.

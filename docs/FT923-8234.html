			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Dumping appeal by Norsk Hydro NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest publicly quoted company, said yesterday it would appeal against a US International Trade Commission (ITC) decision to levy tariffs on magnesium exports from its Canadian plant to the US. The ITC ruled that unfairly low-priced pure and alloy magnesium exported to the US from Norsk Hydro's Becancour plant was damaging the US magnesium industry, with production subsidised through cheap energy prices from Hydro Quebec, the Canadian electricity producer. Hydro Quebec is not part of the Norsk Hydro group. In July, the US Commerce Department cleared Norsk Hydro of allegations of dumping magnesium from Norway in the US. The new ITC ruling seeks a 21.61 per cent countervailing duty on Norsk Hydro's Canadian pure and alloy magnesium exports to the US, with a 32.33 per cent dumping duty on pure magnesium. The company will appeal against the ITC decisions at a panel under the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement, and believed it would prevail. Norsk Hydro wanted a review of the countervailing duty rate, taking into account an amendment to an electricity deal signed this week with Hydro Quebec. The new contract met all criteria spelled out in a July decision for risk and profit-sharing electricity contracts not to be subject to countervailing duties. 'This should allow elimination of the 14 per cent part of the countervailing duty erroneously attributed to the electricity contract,' Norsk Hydro said; the review should be completed before the year ended. In July, the company said the Commerce Department had accepted its offer to renegotiate power-supply contracts with Hydro Quebec and repay some CDollars 20m of provincial investment funds from Canada and Quebec to establish its Becancour plant. Since the charges were made last September, Norsk Hydro has cut output to half the Canadian plant's 45,000-tonne-a-year capacity.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article copyrighted by EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] </F>   [Editorial Report] Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in  Spanish on 1 June publishes on page 28, under the heading  "Lacalle's Administration Was at the Height of Popularity in May  in the Eyes of Public Opinion," an 800-word unattributed article  on the results of a public opinion poll by Equipos Consultores  for EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO on President Luis Alberto Lacalle  and Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vazquez.    The article notes that 20 percent of voters approved of  Lacalle's administration while 50 percent disapproved. It adds  that although the net result "continues to be negative," this is  "the best result ever scored by the president nationwide" in all  public opinion surveys conducted by Equipos Consultores during  Lacalle's term. The second highest was in August 1990 with 33  percent.    The article remarks that this growth in Lacalle's popularity  is contrary to the general trend in Uruguay since presidents'  popularity generally deteriorates at the end of their term.    With regard to Mayor Tabare Vazquez, the article states that  he continues to command "the approval of more than half" of  Montevideo residents. The survey shows that "52 percent" of  Montevideo residents approved of Vazquez' administration "while  26 percent disapproved of it." The article remarks that this  approval rate was "slightly lower than in previous months."    The article concludes by saying: "The information analyzed  suggests that, for the time being, the assessment of the  president's and mayor's administrations does not show the loss  of face that is allegedly expected during the election campaign."</p>

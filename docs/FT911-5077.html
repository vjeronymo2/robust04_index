			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Small businesses yet to sense recovery SIGNS OF an economic recovery are not filtering through to small businesses, according to the Confederation of British Industry. Most companies in the sector report that the economy remains 'on the bottom' with only faint signs of an improvement before the end of the year, according to Mr Tom O'Connor, chairman of the CBI's small-business council. Some industries such as engineering, aviation supply and construction have not seen any improvement in business during the first quarter and no signs of a recovery. Mr O'Connor said yesterday that many small companies were still experiencing difficulties. 'We hope and expect that business will pick up as the year progresses but there is no doubting the severity of the current recession,' he said after a meeting of the council in London. Companies in the West Midlands that relied on the vehicle industry were 'hanging on by their fingertips'. He said the high level of exports that had helped sustain the industry had been depressed by slower economic growth among Britain's trade partners, while the VAT increase and higher tax on company cars was helping to curb domestic demand. There were faint signs of optimism among companies in the south-east where recession was first felt. Regions where recession had bitten later in the cycle would take longer to recover, he said.

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Fed-watchers kept guessing on rates: George Graham assesses the impact of the latest jobs figures on the likelihood of another interest rate rise If the Federal Reserve's policy makers wanted a nice, clear indication of the pace of the US economy's expansion from last month's employment statistics, they will have been disappointed. That means that Fed-watchers, too, will have to wait a while longer before they see whether the US central bank will move short-term interest rates still higher in an effort to slow the economy's momentum before inflationary pressures build up. Yesterday's announcement offered a battery of contradictions. A drop in the unemployment rate to 5.9 per cent, from 6.1 per cent in August, was balanced by a relatively modest increase of 239,000 in September in the number of non-farm jobs; that in turn was offset by a sharp revision upwards in the number of jobs created in August to 246,000, rather than the weak 179,000 originally reported a month ago. These conflicting signals confused the financial markets yesterday, and did little to change the opinions of private sector economists who have, for the most part, already placed their bets on the likelihood that the Fed will decide to raise interest rates another notch before the next meeting of its policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee on November 15. And they appear unlikely to have changed many minds at the Fed, whose last FOMC meeting 10 days ago decided to leave rates unchanged, leaving more time to see whether its increase of half a percentage point on August 16 will have its intended effect of slowing the economy's momentum. The delay will irritate many in the financial markets, which have shown increasing impatience at what they see as irrefutable signs that the economy is still growing at an unsustainably fast pace in the third quarter, and have made clear their view that the Fed is 'behind the curve' by pushing long term interest rates above 8 per cent. But they may be underestimating the degree to which Fed officials believe they have acted in advance of inflationary pressures this year. Fed officials warn that monetary policy is an uncertain business, with long and variable lags between a change in interest rates and its effect on the economy, and point out that they have already raised the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight balances, by 1 3/4 percentage points this year. Senior members of the FOMC, in recent speeches around the country, have appeared more worried about justifying to business leaders the fact that they have raised interest rates so far and so fast than about justifying to Wall Street their failure to move even further and faster. Mr Robert Forrestal, president of the Atlanta Fed, told a meeting in Alabama this week that he expects growth to slow to around 3 1/2 per cent for the whole of this year and to around 3 per cent in 1995. And Mr Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed, told the Los Angeles Bond Club on Wednesday that the FOMC had been 'a little bold to move this early.' The effects of the most recent increase, he added, had 'yet to be felt'. 'Such forward-looking monetary policy helps avoid the go-stop economic environment of the late '70s and early '80s, and it's much more likely to produce a lasting economic expansion,' Mr Parry said. Nevertheless, two of the indicators to which the Fed is generally believed to pay particular attention - the unemployment rate and the industrial capacity utilisation rate - are now signalling that the economy is running at or beyond a pace which it can sustain without succumbing to inflation. Calculations of the natural rate of unemployment, below which wage pressures start to build, vary. Few estimates, however, are much lower than September's rate of 5.9 per cent, and most Fed estimates are above 6 per cent. Similarly, the Fed reported last month that the rate of capacity utilisation rose to 84.7 per cent in August, nearly one percentage point higher than reported in July and close to the level of 85 per cent at which industry is conventionally believed to start facing production bottlenecks and raising prices. In fact, some Fed economists calculate that inflationary pressures begin even earlier, at around 81.8 per cent utilisation. September's capacity utilisation rate is due to be reported next Friday. But the financial markets may have to wait a little longer to see whether the Fed feels that it needs to raise interest rates further to take some more steam out of the economy.</p>

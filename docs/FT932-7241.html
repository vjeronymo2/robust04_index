			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Letter: Closing Tecs would be a political nonsense Sir, No doubt Mr Ansel Harris finds it enjoyably diverting to write (Letters, May 18), as he so often does, suggesting Training and Enterprise Councils should be closed down, but that is a practical, as well as a political, nonsense. If he really cares about training and enterprise he should make constructive and practical suggestions on how Tecs can deliver even more than they do already. In the meantime a few facts. Tecs are making real progress in training. Forty-three per cent of adults leaving employment training last July were qualified, compared with 36 per cent the year before under schemes run by the employment department. In September 1992, 32,000 young people awaited training under the youth training system. In April 1993 this number had been reduced to 5,300. In a typical year there are some 40,000 business start-ups under Tec support. Some 85 per cent of these are still successfully trading and growing after one year of operation, making a significant contribution to employment and economic development. All Tecs have economic regeneration as the cornerstone of their strategies, based on investment in the business community and inward investment. Raising skills of the workforce through training is fundamental to this. Our targets are ambitious and rightly so if we are to achieve international competitiveness. Tecs are here to stay. And with their partners in education, local authorities, chambers of commerce, and enterprise agencies they are tackling an immense task with increasing success.

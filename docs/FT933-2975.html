			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Truck and van sector shows signs of upturn THE first cautious signs appeared last month that commercial vehicles as a whole may be starting to follow the UK market for new cars out of recession. Recovery is already well under way in the truck industry. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that last month's sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes jumped by 19.8 per cent to 4,910, compared with 4,097 in the same period last year. The August total lifted total truck sales for the first eight months of the year to 22,392, an 8.53 per cent increase over last year's 20,633. Sales of light vans and panel vans - such as the Ford Escort and Transit respectively - continued below last year's severely depressed levels, but by a smaller margin than earlier in the year. Light van sales were 6.72 per cent lower in August than in the same month last year, at 8,913 compared with 9,545, but this was an improvement on the first eight months as a whole, during which sales were 8.01 per cent lower than the equivalent period last year. Similarly, sales of panel vans in August, at 14,536, were only 4.08 per cent lower than a year ago, compared with the 5.55 per cent cut recorded for the the first eight months. The commercial vehicles statistics reinforce figures covering the market for used cars, which also indicate that economic activity is picking up. Overall, 31,085 commercial vehicles were sold in August - a drop of only 1.95 per cent on the 31,707 achieved in the same month last year. Total sales for the first eight months of the year were 4.76 per cent below the period last year, at 135,340 compared with 142,098. The share taken by imports last month was sharply higher, at 44.87 per cent compared with 40.81 per cent, and 40.78 per cent for the first eight months compared with 35.86 per cent a year ago. The small vans sector is seeing a sharply increased challenge from Renault, whose sales jumped 72 per cent in August and by 35 per cent in the first eight months of the year. The main market casualty has been Rover, with sales of the ageing Maestro van falling by 36 per cent so far this year. The share of panel van sales taken by LDV, the management buy-out led manufacturer of Leyland Daf vans, fell sharply in August compared with a year ago, from 10.8 per cent to 7.8 per cent. But with August by far the biggest sales month for commercial vehicles - as with cars, because of the new registration prefix - LDV maintains that the drop reflects the still relatively low production after LDV emerged from receivership in May. The Iveco Ford group has been able to strengthen its hold on the truck sector, with its share rising to 25.9 per cent in August compared with 17.98 per cent for the once market-leading Leyland Daf.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-AUGUST 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Volume      Volume   Share (%)   Share (%)                            (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Aug 93  Jan-Aug 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*              135,340       -4.76       100.0       100.0 Imports                     55,186       +8.29       40.78       35.86  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                       41,223       -8.01       100.0       100.0 Imports                     14,832      +48.75       35.98       22.35 Ford                        18,529       -4.27       44.95       43.19 Vauxhall (GM)               12,770      -13.83       30.98       33.07 Peugeot (incl.

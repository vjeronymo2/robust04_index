			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP WEEKEND;  </P> <P> LISA LISA: BY THE END, SHE WAS EXTORTING APPLAUSE BY SAYING SHE WOULD CALL IT A  NIGHT UNLESS THE CROWD MADE HER FEEL WELCOME.  </P> <P> Lisa Velez figured that lasting six years on the pop-R&amp;B scene was a  milestone worth noting during a pause in her show Friday night at the Celebrity  Theatre. Judging from the blandness of her hour's work, becoming a seasoned  trouper has taken some of the spice out of Lisa Lisa's once-peppery stage  persona.  </P> <P> Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam has some of the stuff it takes to keep things fresh,  with its blend of hip-hop beats, Latin rhythmic accents and rock-style guitar  all folded into a polished urban pop package. The New York group presented the  package proficiently enough, but it didn't contain much sass or personality.  </P> <P> The tiny, cutely chunky Lisa Lisa has played the role of an emphatic young  woman determined to hold on to her independence in romantic relationships,  while still keeping a soft spot open for a lover who would be respectful and  true.  </P> <P> But, artistically at least, Velez doesn't have much independence. Her music is  crafted by the New York songwriting-record producing team known as Full Force.  And while the best of the songs that Full Force gives Velez feature catchy,  hit-making hooks, the Lisa Lisa repertoire is generic pop product that doesn't  form much of a basis for her to communicate a story or an identity of her own.  On stage at the Celebrity, Lisa Lisa hardly even tried.  </P> <P> The smoothly tuneful funk hits, "Head to Toe" and "I Wonder if I Take You  Home," and the bouncy pop fluff of "Little Jackie Wants to Be a Star" were  pleasant enough diversions. An attempt at a rap-dance workout was the flattest  number, with Velez and most of the rest of her ensemble (except for  percussionist Mike Hughes) proving to be unremarkable dancers.  </P> <P> Velez, originally one of those thin-voiced Madonna clones, has improved her  singing over the years, but she still doesn't have anything approaching the  range or authority to elevate routine material on vocal power alone.  </P> <P> With nothing much to say with their music, Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam (Velez's  regular sidekicks, Hughes and guitarist Alex "Spanador" Mosely, were joined by  six other singers and players) spent an inordinate amount of time trying to  stroke the crowd or cajole applause.  </P> <P> By the end, Lisa Lisa had turned downright schoolmarmish, extorting applause by  saying she would call it a night unless the crowd made her feel sufficiently  welcome to continue. After singing a brisk "Head to Toe" as their reward, Velez  ended with another teacher-like command: "Everybody say good night to Lisa."  </P> <P> By that time, many in an audience that was definitely not interested in an  encore had already bid a tacit adieu by heading for the exits.  </P></p>

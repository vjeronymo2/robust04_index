			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fernando Fernandez from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] After two weeks, the contentious Bill No. 41 is  still on the Legislative Assembly's agenda. The bill seeks to  reform laws related to intellectual property. A group of  lawyers considers the bill to have serious flaws because it was  not proposed by the Executive or Judicial Branches as stipulated  by the Constitution.    [Begin lawyer Alvaro Cedeno recording] First, this law is  unconstitutional. According to our Constitution, a law of this  nature has to be proposed by the Executive Branch. Furthermore,  this law annuls articles, chapters, and entire sections of our  codes. Laws that annul or modify national codes are organic  laws, and they, specifically the ones that annul our codes, have  to be proposed by either the Supreme Court, the attorney  general, or the solicitor general. [end recording]    Lawyer Cedeno said that the bill had been proposed by a  Legislative Assembly commission and that it was not empowered to  do so by the Constitution. This, he added, is another factor  that makes the bill under discussion unconstitutional. The bill  attempts to create a confiscation penalty, and the criminal code  indicates that a confiscation is an accessory penalty. The  bill, thus, violates the pretrial concept, Cedeno observed.    [Begin Cedeno recording] Apparently, the law intends to give  authors protection. [end recording]    Cedeno said he would promote protests from several sectors  if  the legislators insist on passing this bill.</p>

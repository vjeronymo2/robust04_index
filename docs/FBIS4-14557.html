			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [SEGODNYA report: "Liberal Democratic Party of Russia </F> Chairman Called `Paid Informant'"]    [Text] Yesterday, addressing a vast throng of journalists,  a leader of the "Yabloko" parliamentary bloc took revenge on the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] faction chief, who had  earlier publicly accused him of collaborating with the CIA.  "The reason Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] knows so much  about who is whose agent and who is not is because he was the  KGB's paid informant and had access to secret documents," Mr.  Lukin said. "As for me, indeed -- sooner or later one has to  own up, after all -- I sometimes do hand important information  over to the U.S. secret services. For instance, recently I  passed accurate information about the state of Vladimir  Volfovich's health. So now the CIA knows for sure what all  others can only guess."</p>

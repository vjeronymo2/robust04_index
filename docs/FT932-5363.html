			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Cambodian Elections: God-king finds a role as conciliator - Victor Mallet observes the prince acting with characteristic panache IT WAS vintage Sihanouk. With characteristic panache and flowery language, Cambodia's former 'god-king' yesterday appointed himself prime minister without consulting the United Nations peacekeepers charged with bringing peace and democracy to his country. The 70-year-old Prince Norodom Sihanouk - gourmet, wit and amateur film-maker - had been waiting for his moment of glory since being overthrown by Gen Lon Nol 23 years ago. His friends and associates had long remarked on his obsession with righting the wrongs of the coup, which he blamed on the Americans, and restoring himself to legitimate power. The prince, yearning for a popular mandate, had tried to have himself elected president before the general election organised last week by the UN as part of the 1991 Paris peace accords. He abandoned the idea when it failed to inspire much enthusiasm among the foreign countries supporting the peace plan, but took power yesterday on the grounds that his authority was needed to reconcile the country's rival factions while a new constitution is debated. Basking in his role as conciliator, he described himself in yesterday's statement in French to his people as 'Father of the Nation, Father of National Unity, Father of National Reconciliation.' He said: 'My beloved and respected compatriots, I am very old and sick. But your untrammelled love, your confidence, your incomparable faithfulness and your noble sense of justice towards me give me the strength to assume once again the leadership of our venerated fatherland.' Officials of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) could barely suppress their groans. It was not so much that Prince Sihanouk had acted irrationally - his new government is seen as a sensible way of reconciling the royalists and the old communist administration which between them took most of the votes in the election - as that he had acted hastily. It was not clear last night if Prince Sihanouk's new government had even received the endorsement of his son Prince Ranariddh, leader of the royalist party Funcinpec. Prince Sihanouk certainly did not talk about his plans to Mr Yasushi Akashi, the long-suffering Untac chief. The prince's attitude towards Untac and the peace plan which he himself helped to negotiate has been typically fickle. He spent most of the past few months at his home in Beijing instead of in Cambodia and at one point withdrew his support from Untac altogether. UN officials were obliged to woo him constantly and UN Security Council resolutions contained clauses lauding the prince to try to keep him happy. On the eve of the election, when it became obvious that the polling would go ahead in spite of threats by Khmer Rouge guerrillas to disrupt it, he suddenly returned home to Cambodia. And when nearly 90 per cent of registered voters ignored the Khmer Rouge threats, Prince Sihanouk completely reversed his policy of accommodating the Khmer Rouge, saying it would have no part in a future government. Prince Sihanouk's performance in his new incarnation as head of state will be judged partly on how he handles the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, still a powerful military force in parts of the country. Yesterday he again suggested that he might attempt to reintegrate them into Cambodian life. He will also be judged on his attitude towards the democratic institutions which the UN has tried so hard to introduce. 'As Sihanouk's capacity to influence events diminished, so did his interest in governing the country,' wrote historian Mr David Chandler in The Tragedy of Cambodian History in a reference to the period before the coup. 'He took refuge in the company of his entourage, in feverish provincial tours, in making films, and occasionally in his passion for haute cuisine.'</p>

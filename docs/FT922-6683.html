			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Strong demand for US dollar-denominated issues THE INTERNATIONAL bond market witnessed further strong demand for US dollar-denominated issues yesterday, as the Province of British Columbia launched a successful Dollars 500m deal close on the heels of large dollar issues from the Province of Ontario and Toyota. In addition, two borrowers tapped the Eurosterling sector - an area which has been almost devoid of new issues in recent months, while a handful of Latin American borrowers launched issues aimed at investors in search of high-yielding paper. British Columbia's 10-year bond carries a coupon of 7 3/4 per cent and was priced at 98.61 to yield 48 basis points over the ten-year US Treasury bond. The yield spread narrowed to 46 basis points, and syndicate managers generally agreed that the pricing was 'sensible'. The issue was well-received - despite the weakness in the US Treasury bond market overnight - and about half the issue was sold to European institutions, with the rest split between the Far East and US. British Columbia has a AA1 rating from Moody's Investors Service. The bond issue is part of the Province's CDollars 4.7bn general funding programme: including this issue, it will have completed CDollars 2.2bn of the funding programme in the first two months of its financial year, according to Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, the lead manager. The European Investment Bank and BP America both chose to launch medium-sized Eurosterling issues, a sector of the market which has seen few new deals largely due to the lack of attractive swap opportunities. The EIB's Pounds 200m 10-year bond with a coupon of 9 per cent is fungible with an existing Pounds 200m issue. Samuel Montagu, the lead manager, said the borrower decided to tap the sterling market again because its existing issue was becoming illiquid. According to the lead manager, the existing paper has been yielding between 10-15 basis points less than the 10-year gilt, and the new tranche was priced to yield 5 basis points below the gilt. The deal is intended to attract investors interested in sterling assets rather than a 'spread play'. Samuel Montagu said some continental investors prefer such paper to gilts, especially if they cannot receive their coupons gross on the comparable UK government bonds. The issue, which was launched at 99.403, traded at 99.45-99.55 later in the day, yielding between 7-8 basis points below the 10-year gilt. The deal was not swapped and constitutes funding for the EIB to lend out. BP America increased its initial Pounds 100m issue to Pounds 125m as the deal was fairly well received, dealers said. The six-year bond, which has a coupon of 9 1/2 per cent, was reoffered at 99.125, and traded at 99.125-99.18 later in the day, according to lead manager Hambros Bank. The issue was swapped out of sterling. Investor interest came mainly from Germany and Switzerland. The deal was priced to yield 40 basis points over the six-year gilt and the spread narrowed to 37.5 basis points over. Investors in search of high-yielding paper witnessed a flood of Latin American issues yesterday, with bonds launched by Pemex (the Mexican oil group) and Aerovias De Mexico (the airline), as well as Bariven, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petroleos De Venezuela. The two-year FFr500m issue from Pemex yielded 180 basis points over the two-year BTAN and was swapped into dollars. Paribas, the lead manager, reported strong demand for short-dated, high-yielding French franc paper. Such issues appeal both to so-called 'flight capital' investors (Latin American investors with offshore assets who want the anonymity of bearer bonds) and to European retail investors in search of high-yielding paper. Meanwhile, Aerovias De Mexico's Dollars 100m issue was priced to yield 437 basis points over three-year US Treasury bonds.</p>

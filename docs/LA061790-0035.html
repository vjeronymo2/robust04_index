			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME TO READY POOL, HOT TUB FOR SUMMER  </P> <P> The warm summer months are closing in, so it may be time to think about getting  the pool, spa or hot tub ready. Otherwise, it might be difficult to enjoy any  of them if you are constantly fretting about maintenance.  </P> <P> But it doesn't take much time or effort to get any of them in shape for the  season, says Kirk Mitchell, chief chemist for Hydrotech Chemical Corp., a  supplier of pool products.  </P> <P> Mitchell offered the following steps for preparing and maintaining pools, spas  and hot tubs:  </P> <P> Pools: "First and foremost, arm yourself with a test kit that has fresh  reagents, or your readings could prove misleading," Mitchell said.  </P> <P> At the minimum, the kit should enable you to check the bromine or chlorine  sanitizer, the pH and total alkalinity. It's also a good idea to equip your  test kit to measure calcium hardness and acid and base demand, he said.  </P> <P> "Especially at pool opening time, you should double-check your own findings by  scooping up a 1-quart sample of water into a clean plastic container and taking  it to your professional pool dealer for analysis," Mitchell said.  </P> <P> If the dealer's findings match yours, you're OK; if not, find out why the test  results don't agree and make the necessary adjustments.  </P> <P> If you aren't happy with your present sanitizing system because of an  unpleasant odor or skin irritation, Mitchell suggested using brominated  sanitizers that contain Chlorfree.  </P> <P> "You're less likely to get either the smell or itching that sometimes results  when chlorine combines with waste products to form contaminants known as  chloramines," he said.  </P> <P> It's also a good idea to "shock" the pool to make sure all organic wastes have  been treated, Mitchell said. Traditionally, pool contaminants such as  chloramines are treated by adding more chlorine, a process known as  super-chlorination or break-point chlorination.  </P> <P> In order to prevent algae growth, he recommended adding an algaecide. Since you  must first injure algae or slime growth before you can kill it, Mitchell  suggested that before applying any chemicals, you give the walls of the pool a  good scrubbing with a strong brush.  </P> <P> Hot tubs and spas: The first step involves determining the hot tub or spa's  exact capacity so the right amount of chemicals are used, and getting a water  test kit that measures bromine and pH level as well as for total alkalinity.  </P> <P> Next comes the task of balancing five factors: the water's pH, total  alkalinity, calcium hardness, temperature and total dissolved solids. The pH or  acid-base balance should range from 7.4 to 8.0  </P> <P> "Never should the pH go below 7.0 or above 8.4," said Mitchell.  </P> <P> Should calcium hardness or total alkalinity get too high, he said, "Just drain  part of the water and refill with fresh tap water, until tests show you've  reached the manufacturer's recommended levels."  </P> <P> For sanitizing, Mitchell believes bromine rather than chlorine-based products  should be used because bromine works without imparting either the smell or skin  and eye irritations commonly associated with chlorine.  </P> <P> The actual dosage of bromine will vary depending on the size of the tub, but a  general rule is to maintain a bromine residual of 2 to 4 parts per million.  </P> <P> One exception to that rule is with new hot tubs, Mitchell said.  </P> <P> "A new hot tub will leach tannic acid and a natural wood component called  lignin into the water, giving it a brown, murky look," he said. "This is  expected, and should stop within six to eight weeks.  </P> <P> "In the meantime, the bromine residual should be kept somewhat higher, at 3 to  5 parts per million, and the water drained and refilled at least once a week  until the leaching stops."  </P></p>

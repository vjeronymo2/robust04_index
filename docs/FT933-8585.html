			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Seoul suffers biggest ever one-day fall THE sharp rise in the yen to a record high against the dollar triggered profit-taking, erasing earlier gains, and the Nikkei index posted its first fall in five trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Japanese shares fell further in London later, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index falling 9.65 to 1,272.18 on evidence of rising real estate debts and news of fresh probes into dubious securities deals, both emerging after the Tokyo close. In Tokyo, the Nikkei ended 20.11 down at 20,745.17, 2.5 per cent higher on the week, after fluctuating between 20,686.77 and 20,921.89. Trading was hardly affected by the settlement of August futures option contracts. Volume totaled 480m shares against 505m. Dealers sought large-capital issues, while foreign and institutional investors took profits. Advances led declines by 497 to 483 with 178 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 3.10 to 1,683.08 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 9.65 to 1,272.18. A fall in the bond market was a further cause for pessimism among stock market participants. The yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark rose 0.085 percentage points to 4.08 per cent. Utilities turned lower on increased calls for price cuts on the back of the higher yen. Ms Manae Kubota, head of the economic planning agency, said that the benefits of a higher yen were not filtering through to consumers as energy suppliers were maintaining electricity and gas prices. Tokyo Electric Power fell Y60 to Y3,760. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 17.21 to 22,745.01 in volume of 33.9m shares. Rohm, a semiconductor maker, fell Y60 to Y1,970 on profit taking. Roundup THE region produced some distinct contrasts, investors reacting badly to a key reform in South Korea, but appreciating bank results in Singapore and improved prospects in India. SEOUL saw its greatest one-day tumble since it was founded in 1977 on the government's ban on trading under false or borrowed names. The composite index ended 32.37, or 4.5 per cent lower at 693.57, 3.9 per cent down on the week. A total of 917 shares went limit down, and brokers said the general fall was stemmed by the system of daily permitted lows; they said that the reform could depress the market for some time but that, in the long run, it was very good news for the market. However, trading was thin, only Won23.34bn against Thursday's 221.68bn after the finance minister ordered the market to be closed yesterday morning, and institutions kept largely to the sidelines. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index ended at a record closing high of 1,917.87, up 15.07 on the day and 1.8 per cent up a week which featured some good bank interims. BOMBAY rose 38.68 to a five-month high of 2,522.48, 6.2 per cent up on the week, on the removal of political uncertainties, improved prospects for the economy and heavy foreign buying. HONG KONG rose on a climb in index futures and in Hutchison, which sold a News Corp ADRs holding. The Hang Seng index closed 52.70 higher at 7,392.25, little changed on the week. Turnover dipped from HK4.85bn to HKDollars 4.50bn. AUSTRALIA's gold index dropped 123.9, or 5.7 per cent, to 2,040.6 as bullion eased offshore, and the All Ordinaries ended 17.4 lower at 1,855.9, 0.7 per cent down on the week. NEW ZEALAND showed a 1.9 per cent fall on the week as the NZSE-40 index closed 28.23 lower at 1,860.28.</p>

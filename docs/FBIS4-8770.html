			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Srpska foreign minister Aleksa Buha by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "The Whole  World Does Not Care"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] During the weekend, the Serbs had  their troops advance further toward Gorazde. UN soldiers  abandoned the city as untenable. Did you take new NATO attacks  into account?    [Buha] We are at a turning point, either toward peace or  toward a dramatic escalation of this war. I have the impression  that NATO is, meanwhile, irritated at its spirit of adventure.  However, should it continue its bombardments, a world war will  begin.    [DER SPIEGEL] Serbia against the rest of the world?    [Buha] This might develop into an uncontrollable avalanche.  We are only a ball in the game of the international community.    [DER SPIEGEL] However, it was your decision to fire at the  UN protection zone of Gorazde.    [Buha] Gorazde is not a protection zone for us -- the  inhabitants were neither disarmed nor have the borders of this  zone been fixed.    [DER SPIEGEL] This is not true. Even Russian President  Boris Yeltsin accused the Serbs of aggression.    [Buha] Gorazde has outskirts with a Serbian population. If  the Muslims attack them, we will, of course, strike back. These  are counterattacks.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why did you prohibit UN General Rose and  foreign journalists from convincing themselves of the situation  on the spot?    [Buha] We only warned General Rose against the danger.  Foreign journalists have no business there.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your artillery is also shelling the protection  zone of Tuzla again.    [Buha] Only the airport, which, as agreed upon, may only be  used for humanitarian help. The packets have to be controlled  by the Russians. None of these conditions was fulfilled;  therefore, we bombed it.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do the Serbs want to oust the blue helmets  from Bosnia?    [Buha] If the United Nations orders further bombardments,  our people will see to it themselves.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why did you place more than 200 blue helmets  as hostages under house arrest?    [Buha] It is better that we protect them, instead of leaving  them to the rage of our people.    [DER SPIEGEL] Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic has called for  the withdrawal of Western mediators from the peace talks on  Bosnia. Who is to take over this task?    [Buha] If the international community withdraws Lord Owen  and Stoltenberg, we will determine our new, impartial mediators  -- Russians, Japanese, Chinese, Indians, and -- you will be  surprised -- Germans.    [DER SPIEGEL] I beg your pardon? Which Germans are you  thinking of?    [Buha] Peter Glotz, Hans Modrow, Graf Lambsdorff, retired  General Schmueckle. I hope very much for an improvement of the  relations between Germans and Serbs.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your only hope is currently based on the  Russians. Did Yeltsin's special envoy Churkin encourage you to  continue your fight for the independent Serbian state during his  mediation last week?    [Buha] No, just like the whole world, the Russians do not  care about the price that we have to pay. They only want peace  quickly. I also do not believe that Yeltsin would risk a war for  a greater Serbia. However, since the Muslims and Croats were  able to conclude a federation without us, we have the same right  to a Serbian state and its international recognition. The  inclusion of the Srpska republic in Bosnia in this  Muslim-Croatian federation is completely out of the question.</p>

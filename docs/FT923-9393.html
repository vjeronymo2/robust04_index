			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Arts: A mixed crop from the garden gurus - Television GARDENING on TV makes perfect sense on a winter's night, but what about summer evenings, when most gardeners want to be outside just as long as the light holds? Pricking out, dead-heading, taking cuttings, catching the groundsel before it seeds itself - there is a terrifying amount to do. Or you may relent and simply sit, sniffing the phloxes as you plan the autumn bulb-order. Measured against pleasure of such a high order, any summertime gardening programme has to offer its audience something quite special. At least, it must do if it is to lure the keen, critically-minded gardener indoors. There are, of course, plenty of couch-potato viewers who switch to gardening simply because it offers pretty colours and a soothing break from the sweaty exertions of the Olympics. I have been inspecting this summer's crop of horticultural programmes, and find it extremely mixed. One hardy perennial has been with us for almost 20 years and yet I had never watched it before. Gardener's World (BBC 2, Friday) is magnificent. Presented by Geoffrey Hamilton and Liz Rigby, it is completely straight, without any of the tiresome gimmickry programme-makers so often use to jazz up what they imagine might otherwise be tediously or frighteningly technical. Expert talks to expert and to us in a natural, unforced way. The audience is a large one, fluctuating between 3m and more than over 4m, and the assumption is that it consists of keen gardeners who thirst to do it better. Far from being fazed by Latin names, they will have pen and paper poised to note down Papaver nudicaule 'Constance Finnis' as it is flashed on to the screen. Where do you find this delectable poppy? Geoff airily refers viewers to their copies of The Plant Finder, the gazetteer of plants and specialist nurseries which has become something like a badge of the serious-minded gardener. You would have to be a very good gardener indeed not to pick up something from most episodes of Gardener's World - even if it is only quibbling with Adrian Bloom's choice of plants which look well grown beside hostas. Good taste, and not just know-how, is part of the Gardener's World philosophy. Over its long run, this programme must surely have had a considerable impact on standards of gardening. Quite stiff competition on Channel 4 comes from The Garden Club, a relative newcomer which will be starting a new run on August 28. Some 3m watched it last year, and there is an actual club with 8,000 members and a newsletter. Principal presenter is Roy Lancaster, the distinguished horticulturalist and plant-collector, and each programme takes one region and focuses on a selection of club-members' gardens - problematic gardens, perhaps, needing a spot of advice from Roy, but well and interestingly gardened all the same. The format works beautifully because, as every gardener knows, people love to chat about what they grow. 'My garden means everything to me', confessed one lady in a windswept Shropshire garden which was not my taste at all but was thoroughly admirable in its own way. Compared with Gardener's World, this more democratic format is more likely to unearth gardeners with idiosyncratic ideas, in particular splendid money-saving dodges dreamed up by cost-conscious OAPs. The two-parter, Le Manoir (C4), has to be one of the most fatuous programmes of the year. Recession has clobbered garden designers - and not before time given how perfectly awful your run-of-the-mill designer is. So garden designer Alan Mason must have been unable to believe his luck when someone decided it was worth making a film of how he 'created an English garden' at the medieval manor-house plus eight acre garden he bought in Brittany for Pounds 100,0000. Six months was all it took to create what Alan intended as a shop-window for his talents, the French having recently developed quite a taste for le jardin Anglais. But the problem was, Alan's garden looked so utterly dismal at the end of this period that one cannot imagine any self-respecting French gardener would cross the road to visit it, except perhaps to jeer. Of course, the idea was misconceived. No garden created from scratch looks like much inside four years, two if you really go for broke with big shrubs and trees. Alan's trusty student helpers had created the bare bones, with a vast lawn and a lake with bubbling ooze and a large population of frogs. Some nasty colour combinations - lavateras, geums, and red potentillas - showed Alan had achieved instant colour only at the expense of colour sense. Presumably whoever had this bright idea was no gardener, and was dismayed by the highly unphotogenic result. Why else did programme two shift tack so abruptly, turning into a glorified Breton estate-agent's advertisement to lure ever more garden-designers and restaurateurs to expatriate while there are still barns, railway-stations and schoolrooms crying out to be chintzified - and given English gardens? However, garden making on TV can be quite interesting, given a spectacular garden and a sensible time-frame. The World in a Garden (C4, Wednesday), is a four-part series recording the National Trust's expensive restoration programme at Biddulph Grange, Staffordshire. The most monstrous, astonishing mid-Victorian garden to have survived, Biddulph Grange is a fascinating place. Roy Lancaster does a typically good job of presenting the different aspects of this project, historical, botanical, and horticultural. Now and then there is tricksy camera work and the music is absurd. One of the better moments showed the trust's advisers (oddly, everyone involved in the project is male) locked in heated argument over which 'authentic' colour to paint the pagoda. I always suspected the business of analysing paint-scrapes was bogus.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F> Review"]    [Text] Cuban authorities have truth as their main weapon,  and, therefore, a swift and forceful denial of a newspaper  report on an alledged meeting of Colombian guerrilla groups in  Havana achieved its objective -- to nip in the bud a spectacular  maneuver to stop the swift enhancement of ties between Cuba and  Colombia. Nevertheless, Cuba's initial explanations were ignored  by the right-wing Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO and other forces  that strive, both within and outside of the South American  nation, to spoil the friendly atmosphere between the two nations.    The highest-ranking Cuban authorities confirmed that no  rebel  leader, or even Bishop Nel Beltran, attended the fourth  solidarity meeting held in Havana in June when, according to EL  TIEMPO's version, they reportedly held a summit. Cuba's swift  investigation of the Colombian newspaper's allegations, which  were repeated by some of that country's officials, shows the  Cuban Government's intention to expose a maneuver that could  very well be connected with the extremist groups of Cuban  immigrants in the United States.    One cannot forget the reaction, tinged with hysteria, of  ultra-conservative members of that community who are threatening  to boycott Colombian products in the United States. Miami radio  stations that respond to the interests of the extreme right-wing  groups in the Cuban immigrant community have not stopped  speaking about the eventual sale of Colombian oil to Cuba, which  both parties were negotiating to the subsequent disgust of those  who struggle to paralyze the island by the lack of fuel.    The Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO's allegations have many  dark facets, including attributing them to a military  intelligence report which was later denied by the head of that  department, Gen. Fernando Tapia. Also, Bishop Nel Beltran and  other witnesses that remained with him in Miami during the time  of his alledged stay in Havana with guerrilla leaders have  rejected the prelate's participation in a meeting or his trip to  the Cuban capital.    The scandal unleashed by EL TIEMPO has two chapters, the  last  of which has the character of a counteroffensive. It is to be  expected that truth will prevail and that the newspaper will not  subject its readers to a third episode of such a destructive  story.</p>

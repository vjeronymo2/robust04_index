			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> BEYOND THE REVOLUTION: My Life and Times Since Famous Long Ago by Ray Mungo  (Contemporary Books: $10.95). One of the founders of the Liberation News  Service and a minor '60s icon, Ray Mungo tells what he's been doing since the  heady days of the student revolution.  </P> <P> (Apparently not much.) He comes across as a not very likeable opportunist,  smoking dope and partying at other people's expense. Mungo gushes over former  members of the counterculture he feels have remained true to its ideals (Dick  Gregory is "a saint") and glosses over the fact that many of them are now  lawyers, businessmen and real estate agents -- exactly what they swore never to  become. This former champion of anarchic freedom reports H. Rap Brown's recent  condemnation of Salman Rushdie without a word of anger or dismay, although the  reader gets the impression he would rush to defend an author attacked by  Protestant fundamentalists. Mungo concludes with his credo that Baby Boomers  "need to stay in touch" and "will be family" -- the Addams Family, perhaps.  Charles Solomon  </P></p>

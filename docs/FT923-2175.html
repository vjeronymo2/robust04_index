			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Spurs back in black with Pounds 2.7m TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR, the football club controlled by Mr Alan Sugar and Mr Terry Venables, turned round from a Pounds 1.78m pre-tax loss to a profit of Pounds 2.66m in the year to May 31. Mr Sugar, chairman, whose other company Amstrad sells satellite dishes, commented on the opportunities offered to Tottenham from the deal between the Premier League and BSkyB. Mr Colin Sandy, finance director, said the club could earn anything from Pounds 1m to over Pounds 2m, compared with hundreds of thousands from the previous deal for league games. Borrowings were reduced from nearly Pounds 11m to Pounds 4.3m, with the help of a Pounds 7m rights issue, and net assets improved to Pounds 22m (Pounds 12.1m). The interest bill declined to Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 2.29m). Turnover rose to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 18.2m) and operating profit amounted to Pounds 3.84m (Pounds 512,000). Earnings per share emerged at 20.2p (losses of 17.3p). No dividend could be paid because of a lack of distributable reserves on May 31. A transfer from the share premium account has since righted this and Mr Sugar said there would be a special interim dividend. The figures did not include the Pounds 5.4m received from Lazio of Italy for Paul Gascoigne. Mr Sandy said that since the year-end a total of Pounds 8.15m had come in from player sales while Pounds 6.25m had been spent on seven players.</p>

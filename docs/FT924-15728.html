			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Picking up the pieces Major has started making peace with Germany, and has stuck his neck out over Maastricht The question of the hour is not: 'Will Mr Norman Lamont resign?' It is: 'Will Mr John Major recover his authority?' Last night he began to make the attempt. He announced that the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty will return to the Commons, where it awaits a hostile reception from Conservative Europhobes. It is a start, but the prime minister has much more to do. He must learn to talk less like a party fixer and more like a national leader - and he had better think about reshuffling his cabinet. The chancellor's survival in an office whose duties he can no longer properly fulfil suggests that Mr Major is more nervous about the political consequences of letting him go than he is of what might happen to the economy if he keeps him on. A Lamont departure right now might look like an admission of guilt, an acknowledgement that it was the British government's ineptitude, and not careless comments by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, that led to the collapse of sterling on September 16. In the perfervid atmosphere of Downing Street the golden rule is: never admit that you were wrong, not even slightly. The government's initially schoolboyish reaction to the publication of Mr Schlesinger's celebrated note is, however, only one explanation for Mr Lamont's nine lives. The fragile condition of the Conservative party is another. Mr Major is deeply unwilling to disturb the political balance of his administration. This was made clear last week, when he plucked the inoffensive Mr Peter Brooke out of retirement and put him in to succeed Mr David Mellor at the Ministry of National Heritage. Poor Mr Brooke. A good soldier in his time, he has done nothing to deserve being forced to share the agony. That little decision was, however, merely embarrassing. The appointment of a new chancellor would be serious. It would constitute a political statement. It would indicate whether the government was moving backwards, forwards or sideways on the exchange rate mechanism and the management of the economy. That would not be all loss. It would at least suggest that the government knew whether it was moving backwards, forwards or sideways. Alas, the prime minister is evidently not ready to make any such statement. He should not be so cautious. He must know that he is secure enough. No challenger for his job has stepped forward. Even if next week's Conservative party conference is as dismal an affair as it currently threatens to be, he occupies a position from which he can rebuild his reputation. He is, after all, only a few months into what could still be a five-year term. The only discernible medium-term threat to his tenure is a hypothetical rebellion of his own backbenchers of a size sufficient to shame him out of office. That could take place if the Maastricht bill was brought back to the House without adequate preparation, but the Whip in Mr Major will surely prevail. These are, however, picayune considerations. Both as prime minister and as current president of the European Community Mr Major has to rebuild his reputation piece by piece. Unfortunately for him, the pieces are scattered across a continent. As he well knows, Britain is not an island; it is merely surrounded by water. What Chancellor Kohl, President Mitterrand or Mr Schlesinger say or do is as much a part of British political life as the pronouncements or actions of an English cabinet minister, or a Scottish leader of the opposition. What British politicians say at home must be the same as what they say when abroad, and vice versa. In short, a British prime minister has to conduct himself as a European statesman at all times. If he does not, he will be crunched between the demands of Europe and the demands of his local electorate. Mr Major must therefore always speak and act like a European. That is his only option if he is to serve his country's national interests. At yesterday's cabinet meeting it was quickly realised that, as a first step, he must make peace with the German government and the Bundesbank. The new friendly approach was adopted by the prime minister in TV interviews last night. It is to be hoped that every member of the cabinet has been invited to take the oath of consistency. (Mr Lamont should be the exception. On this matter an oath of silence would be best.) As a second step, Mr Major has begun to undertake a task for which he is by temperament unsuited. He is making a stand within his own party. Not in the centre of the road (where, one of his colleagues recently remarked, he attracts bullets from both sides), but at the head of one of the two warring Tory factions. His choice could only be the so-called 'pro-Europeans'. To go the other way would be to disown everything he has said since coming to prominence. In short, Mr Major must now take on the Europhobes, the disgruntled Thatcher-worshippers, and disarm them. He might protest that he signalled his intentions in the House of Commons last week. But his presentation was so weak, and the declarations so hedged about with prevarication and placatory sentiments, that it was to no avail. He is still wriggling out of any commitment to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism. That is his offering to the right, and a negation of Maastricht. His firmness of purpose is not absolute. It could never be. He is a technocratic salesman. He looks for deals. He seeks to accommodate various points of view. The method is often superficially effective, but on big issues it is a weakness. One of his strengths is that he is persistent. Last night he said flatly that he would bring the Maastricht ratification bill back at the end of the year. He may have done pencilled-in deals with the Danes, Germans, French and Dutch, along the lines suggested by the foreign secretary yesterday. A clause on subsidiarity and a statement of intent on how the Commission and the Council of Ministers will work in future may be seen as the magic solution. We must hope that all this does not reflect the salesman's natural optimism. Mr Major's patient methodology has achieved results in the past, and may again this time. But those results have a price. Last year, after a period during which he was accused of 'dither', Mr Major produced the council tax to replace the poll tax. It did not take us straightforwardly back to domestic property taxes, but contained some head-tax elements to win over the recalcitrant right. It is beginning to look as if it will be a disaster when it is introduced next year. A second long pragmatic period of back-office work by Mr Major's civil servants and ministerial colleagues produced the Maastricht deal. It is now having to be renegotiated. If Mr Major is truly ambitious, there is no alternative to becoming a national leader who points to the distant horizon and asks his supporters to follow him. He must stand up unequivocally for Europe, for the early ratification of Maastricht and for the eventual return of the pound to the exchange rate mechanism, and shape his cabinet accordingly. If he does so, he certainly risks defeat. It is, however, his best chance. Next week in Brighton we will see if he takes it further than he did last night.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S LABS OPEN AT LAST;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: WE CLAMORED FOR ACCESS, AND JAPAN FINALLY AGREED. GUESS WHO'S  LIKELY TO GAIN MOST?  </P> <P> After decades of scouring the world for new technology while keeping its own  research closeted, Japan is sliding open the doors to its laboratories and  letting outsiders take a peek.  </P> <P> Hundreds of foreign scientists are ensconced in Japanese university and  government laboratories, supported by newly established Japanese government  fellowships. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has invited  foreign firms to join in strategic national projects in such areas as factory  automation, hypersonic jet engines and superconductors.  </P> <P> And Japanese corporations are for the first time beginning to hire foreign  researchers, in some cases placing them in charge of important research.  </P> <P> But just as U.S. pressure to open markets has ended up making Japanese  companies more competitive in finance and computers, Japan -- not the United  States -- may ultimately be the primary beneficiary of this U.S.-pressured  perestroika in Japanese research.  </P> <P> Foreign scientists are helping to bring fresh ideas to Japan's insular labs --  while alleviating its chronic shortage of researchers. Japan also needs  innovative foreigners to help it in its push into new frontiers of science and  technology.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the United States is only partially taking advantage of  Japan's new openness. Although American researchers are learning about how  Japan organizes its research, few American researchers speak Japanese or are  willing to relocate to Japan, making it difficult for the United States to  fully benefit from Japan's annual $80-billion expenditure in research and  development.  </P> <P> Another key barrier to Americans is Japan's heavy reliance on private  corporations to conduct not only their own research but also much of the  publicly funded research. Private corporations simply are not as open as the  government with their research.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Japan grows more aggressive in drawing on U.S. research.  </P> <P> Although Japan has caught or surpassed the United States in a growing number of  technologies, including new materials and semiconductors, the country's  "technology trade balance" remains sharply weighted toward imports. In 1988,  Japan paid $1.52 billion for U.S. technology. The United States paid only $590  million for Japanese technology.  </P> <P> With half the population, Japan has nearly 10 times the manpower for tapping  U.S. efforts. Although 52,000 Japanese spent time studying or researching in  the United States last year, only a few thousand Americans spent time in Japan,  and few are conversant in Japanese.  </P> <P> Cynics think that's why Japan has finally agreed to swing open its research  doors.  </P> <P> "They called our bluff," says an executive at a U.S. technology company's Tokyo  office. "They know that even if they opened up, there wouldn't be that many  researchers who had the Japanese language ability to take advantage of it."  </P> <P> Suggests a U.S. science official with a more chilling rationale: "Japan is no  longer worried about U.S. competition." Instead, Japan is eager to counter the  American perception that Japan is getting a free ride on U.S. research  spending, just as it has on U.S. defense spending.  </P> <P> Japan also has more selfish reasons for bringing outsiders into its research  effort. Japan's Science and Technology Agency estimates that the nation will  face a shortage of 510,000 researchers by 2005.  </P> <P> And while Japan could rely on its own research community to play catch-up to  the West, it needs the West's creative, free-thinking minds as it moves into  frontier technologies.  </P> <P> Take MITI's hypersonic engine program, a seven-year, $220-million Japanese  government project to build a hypersonic jet that would cut the New York-Tokyo  flight time to about four hours from the current 13 1/2. Japanese engineers,  far behind in aerospace research, will work regularly with America's best jet  engine scientists. No matter how cautious U.S. companies try to be, Japanese  engineers will absorb a wealth of information, executives experienced with such  joint ventures say.  </P> <P> There is also a deeper, structural problem that obstructs the flow of  technology from Japan to the United States. Although 40% of U.S. research is  government financed, takes place in easily accessible university laboratories  and represents the best America has to offer, only 20% of Japan's research is  publicly financed -- and it is probably the poorest Japan has to offer.  </P> <P> Despite well-publicized calls for increased spending in basic research,  Japanese public funding in science has been progressively scaled back during  the past 10 years, leaving universities under-funded and ill-equipped.  </P> <P> "University research is dying in Japan," says Yoshitsugu Nakagawa, a Tokyo  University physics professor.  </P> <P> Government laboratories have a wealth of equipment, buy they have few  researchers and technicians, according to Cristian P. Schulthess, a U.S.  scientist doing environmental research at the National Chemical Laboratory for  Industry in Tsukuba.  </P> <P> Schulthess works with an Indian and a Japanese researcher. The small group has  almost exclusive use of such costly equipment as a $250,000 inductively coupled  plasma spectrometer for analyzing the presence of metals in water. But it  seldom uses the machine more than once a month.  </P> <P> A 15% drop in the budget for MITI's 16 laboratories has forced cutbacks in  full-time employees, administrators say.  </P> <P> "At this rate, we aren't going to be able to support these international  projects like the Human Frontiers project," says Masahiko Kobayashi, deputy  director for large scale projects at MITI.  </P> <P> The project was initially conceived several years ago by then-Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone as a grand $8-billion effort to illustrate Japan's commitment  to basic science. The project, based in Strasbourg, France, is still considered  a serious effort in basic science. But its total budget this year is a scant  $10 million.  </P> <P> Japanese corporations are increasingly doing impressive science. But their  private laboratories are harder to get access to.  </P> <P> W. D. Gould, of the Extractive Metallurgy Laboratory in Ontario, Canada,  couldn't get a Japanese mining company to talk about its new process for  preventing coal mines from leaching acid into underground streams until he  worked side by side with the company's researchers in a Japanese government  laboratory.  </P> <P> Yoshikazu Goto, deputy director of MITI's International Research and  Development Cooperation Division, says he wants to see private labs more open  and is working on a program to offer scholarships to U.S. scientists so they  can spend time in corporate laboratories. A recent study by the Japanese office  of the U.S. National Science Foundation found roughly half the corporate  respondents receptive to taking in foreign "investigators."  </P> <P> Japan's NEC Corp. has hired several foreigners as research managers at its  fundamental research laboratory in Tsukuba, north of Tokyo. In the past,  Japanese companies have been too fearful of bringing "job-hopping" foreigners  into their laboratories.  </P> <P> Still, even if Japan were to completely swing open the doors to its private  laboratories, it is unclear how effectively the United States could take  advantage of the opportunity.  </P> <P> Even the substantial amounts of information published in English do not reach  the people in the United States who would find it interesting, says David  Kahaner, a National Institute of Standards and Technology researcher now  working at the Office of Naval Research's Tokyo office.  </P> <P> The Japan Information Center of Science and Technology provides a database of  more than 1 million Japanese technical papers and abstracts translated into  English. The service, however, was used by only 300 people last year, triple  the level in 1988 but still substantially below the estimated 8,000 researchers  in Japan who are paying for access to U.S. database services.  </P> <P> With the exception of such companies as DuPont, International Business Machines  and Eastman Kodak, which have substantial research operations in Japan, few  companies have the resources or the interest to commit to Japan.  </P> <P> But U.S. researchers and companies who work in Japan are learning about Japan's  own unique way of organizing research, while making their way through Japanese  research institutions like explorers in a new world.  </P> <P> One such researcher is Stephen Peters, an expert on intelligent robots from the  Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. He changes from shoes to slippers as he  guides a visitor into a room equipped with a wealth of robots and computers in  the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan's largest government  laboratory.  </P> <P> Peters, who has attended conferences, visited companies and became the first  foreigner to participate in the laboratory's planning sessions, says he was  mystified when he kept running across the same people.  </P> <P> His surprising discovery: Japan is at roughly the same level as its U.S.  counterparts in robotics research but, he figures, the country has about one  tenth the number of scientists in the field.  </P> <P> Although researchers work separately in their own laboratories, Peters  explains, they tend to divvy up the work to avoid redundancy. U.S. scientists,  by comparison, often do the same research in an effort to compete for the same  funds.  </P> <P> U.S. companies are getting hands-on experience in that system by participating  in government projects that coordinate research between university, government  and business labs.  </P> <P> United Technologies and General Electric, for example, plan to participate in  the hypersonic jet program in cooperation with three Japanese and two European  firms.  </P> <P> "It's an extraordinary thing to have arch-competitors setting down in an  environment of cooperation," says Stanley Krueger, president of United  Technologies' Japan office. In the United States, because of antitrust laws and  competitive pressures, "there hasn't been a forum" for such cooperation,  Krueger says.  </P> <P> In the United States, for example, a contractor has sole access to technology  it develops for the Department of Defense. But in Japan the results of the  engine project will belong to all members of the project.  </P> <P> "In the end everybody has the same nugget of technology," Krueger says. "Then  the question is, who gets to the market first."  </P> <P> "This is Japan's secret," says MITI's Goto. "This is what the (U.S.) companies  will learn."  </P> <P> THE U.S.-JAPAN RESEARCH GAP  </P> <P> The value of U.S. technology imported by Japan far outpaces that traveling from  Japan to the United States.  </P> <P> U.S. Technology Imported by Japan billions of yen.  </P> <P>  '85: 4,772  </P> <P> '86: 4,825  </P> <P> '87: 4,667  </P> <P> '88: 5,495  </P> <P> Japanese Technology Exported to U.S. billions of yen.  </P> <P> '85: 896  </P> <P> '86: 826  </P> <P> '87: 912  </P> <P> '88: 1,080  </P> <P> Source: Japan Management and Coordination Agency.  </P> <P> SOURCES OF JAPANESE RESEARCH FUNDING  </P> <P> Unlike U.S. research, which is 40% financed by the government, Japanese  research draws funding primarily from private sources. In 1988, for example,  the government was the source of only 19.9% of research funds, compared with  80% from the private sector. Percentage changes are from the previous year.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.33IN:2.22IN:1.89IN:1.89IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C"

			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS FOUND TO BE 1990'S TOP STORY  </P> <P> The crisis in the Persian Gulf was by far the biggest news story of 1990, with  more than 60% of Americans participating in monthly surveys saying they have  "closely followed" developments since Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August.  </P> <P> According to a year-end assessment issued Friday, the only domestic development  that drew similarly close attention was a direct spin-off of the gulf crisis:  the rise in gasoline prices caused by the invasion's impact on world petroleum  markets.  </P> <P> Each month, the Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; The Press surveys a  sample of Americans to determine what news stories attracted the most attention  and what the public learned from them.  </P> <P> In its year-end report, the center said the gulf crisis had generated unusually  intense and prolonged interest among news consumers.  </P> <P> With one exception, the only news stories that attracted more than 40% interest  in this year's monthly surveys were those involving the U.S. military buildup  in the gulf, the hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait and the steep rise in  gasoline prices at home.  </P> <P> The single exception was the U.S. invasion of Panama, which was closely  followed by 60% of those who participated in last January's survey.  </P> <P> By contrast, the peaceful revolution in Eastern Europe and turmoil within the  Soviet Union attracted relatively little attention. In no month were stories on  these topics closely followed by 30% of those surveyed.  </P> <P> The intense focus on the gulf conflict appeared to divert attention from news  closer to home. Besides the gasoline price rise, the top-rated domestic stories  were the decline of the economy and sensational crimes.  </P> <P> News interest intensified as the U.S. economy began to slip in late summer,  according to the surveys. By November, 39% of respondents said they were  closely following economic news.  </P> <P> Only sensational crime stories tended to attract as much attention. The  September murders of five people near the University of Florida campus  registered 36% on the "closely followed" index, and 29% of survey participants  said they focused on the bizarre Boston suicide and murder of Charles Stuart  and his wife.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, there was a clear consensus on the most over-covered story of the  year: the marital troubles of Donald and Ivana Trump. In March, a record 55% of  those surveyed said they were fed up with news about the Trumps' travails.  </P> <P> The center also tallies how many respondents can correctly identify names in  the news. The results suggest that even the key figures in the most closely  followed stories are not well known. Only 17% could correctly identify Gen.  Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the nation's top  military leader. However, 37% were able to correctly identify Marla Maples,  Donald Trump's paramour.  </P></p>

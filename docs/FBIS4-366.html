			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Before I begin this news bulletin, please listen  to an official government communique read by the minister of  human rights and refugees, the interim spokesman for the  government, Issa Ngendakumana:    [Ngendakumana] Here is an official government communique:  This morning, 7 April 1994, Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko  held an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Ministers and  members of the government. The meeting was to brief council  members on the tragedy in which the president of the Republic of  Burundi died. [passage omitted] The meeting participants  studied steps to be taken immediately to maintain calm and peace  in our country.    The Council of Ministers first of all observed one minute's  silence in memory of the distinguished man and his aides who  died.    Analyzing the facts, the Council of Ministers noted that the  tragic event leading to the deaths of the Burundian head of  state and some of his close aides was caused by an accident that  occurred when the Rwandan presidential aircraft aboard which  they were traveling exploded. That is why the members of the  government once again urge the Burundian people to remain calm  and ignore any rumor intended to divide them for purely  political reasons. Similarly, the Council of Ministers urges  all political and administrative officials to stand aside from  party positions and motivated reporting in the face of the  present sad event. This call is also addressed to the state and  private media.    As everyone knows, this tragedy has occurred unfortunately  just when our country was beginning to emerge from its last  crisis, which was brought about by the death of Melchior Ndadaye  during the night of 20-21 October 1993. The work ethic was  beginning to reassert itself and industry was reviving. In the  light of this new tragedy and the resumption of a socioeconomic  situation which has already been noted, the Council of Ministers  deems it relevant to take the following steps:    First: A period of national morning is declared from today,  7 April 1994, until the day of the funeral. Work will be  suspended for three days; that is, Thursday, Friday and Saturday  of the current week.    Second: Flags will be flown at half-mast throughout the  national territory and at our diplomatic missions abroad.    Third: Suitable music and biographies of the distinguished  people who died will be broadcast on Bujumbura Radio-Television  Nationale du Burundi Radio.    Fourth: Books of condolences will be opened.    Fifth: Missions composed of the people's representatives and  security force officials will proceed on working tours of the  provinces to support local governments during these difficult  times.    Finally: The members of the government take this occasion to  send sincere condolences to the wives of the distinguished  figures who died and to the Rwandan Government and people.    [Dated] 7 April 1994, Bujumbura.</p>

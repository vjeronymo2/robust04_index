			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claus Reitan: "New Opinion Poll -- Largest </F> Majority So Far in Favor of EU"]    [Excerpt] Chancellor Franz Vranitzky was right. The  latest Euro-barometer by the Gallup research institute confirms  his view that the referendum on Austria's accession to the  European Union [EU] can only produce a clear majority in favor:  Never before have those in favor led by such a clear majority  as last week. If the Austrians were to vote on EU membership  next Sunday, 49 percent would be in favor. Only 34 percent said  they would vote against EU membership. In 400 telephone  interviews, Gallup found that while there was a neck-and-neck  race a year ago, the share of those in favor has increased by 15  percent. At the beginning of March, when the outcome of the  membership negotiations in Brussels was not yet known, only 47  percent favored EU membership, while 40 percent were against it.  Admittedly, the number of those still undecided has increased  over the past few weeks -- from 13 percent at the beginning of  March to 17 percent last week.    The question of how many people have taken a final decision  on which way to vote in the June referendum has produced even  more dramatic results. Only 60 percent have made up their minds  so far -- 32 percent want to decide at the last minute. But 92  percent want to take part in the referendum.    The increase in "pro-EU" voters might be so pronounced  because the majority of Austrians hold a positive view on the  outcome of the membership negotiations in Brussels. Exactly 50  percent think that the politicians have achieved a great deal in  the negotiations. Yet 39 percent judge the talks negatively,  saying that "too little was achieved" in Brussels.    Public interest in Europe has increased enormously: 53  percent of Austrians are "very" interested in the EU (March: 39  percent), while only 18 percent are not interested in it at all  (March: 29 percent). But only a quarter (24 percent) feel  well-informed about EU membership, while 42 percent of Austrians  consider themselves poorly informed or not informed at all.  [passage omitted]</p>

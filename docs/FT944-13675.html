			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (12): Wireless office beckons - Prospects for cordless business communications By the end of the decade, market analysts predict that up to a fifth of new office telecommunications equipment installed will be cordless. 'Wireless office equipment will grow from virtually nothing in 1993 to nearly 20 per cent of the market by the year 2000 while wireline-based PABXs (switchboards) and key systems dip correspondingly,' said Frost &amp; Sullivan, the US-based market research firm in a recent report. Systems manufacturers such as GPT Communications Systems, a joint venture between Germany's Siemens group and Britain's GPT, tend to be more cautious suggesting that cordless systems could take between 10 and 15 per cent of the market by the turn of the century. Either way, the projected growth of cordless business communications systems is impressive - driven by falling hardware prices and the perceived benefits in terms of mobility, flexibility and productivity. The Frost &amp; Sullivan report predicted: 'The wireless office will gain popularity as the price of systems decline. Prime target end-users include salespersons, top management, employees in distribution and manufacturing firms and healthcare personnel. 'The popularity of cellular phones and the emergence of personal communications systems will stimulate use of wireless handsets for in-building use as users increasingly seek the same convenience they are used to outside the office inside buildings.' Basic cordless telephones have been available for use in the home since the early 1980s. Generally these systems include a portable handset which communicates by radio with a single fixed base-station which is then in turn connected to the public telephone network. In recent years technical advances, particularly the switch from analogue to digital radio transmission, has greatly increased the scope of cordless office systems enabling high-capacity systems using multiple micro-cellular base stations and capable of serving hundreds or even thousands of business users to be constructed. The first large-scale business cordless systems were launched in 1992. The advantages of cordless business telephone systems are fairly obvious. In particular, workers are no longer tied to the location of a particular hard-wired telephone extension and incoming calls have a much better chance of reaching their intended recipient. Surveys have shown that up to 70 per cent of all business calls fail to reach their target on the first attempt often leading to what has been dubbed 'telephone tag'. Cordless systems can reduce this call failure rate substantially, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction while cutting cost by removing the need to return calls. Ericsson, the European telecommunications equipment manufacturer, claims that cordless business systems can save customers up to 30 per cent of their bills as a result. Cordless systems can also save on the costs of rewiring and other configuration operations which can be around 10 per cent of the capital cost of the system for organisations running medium-sized or large PABX systems. In addition, as Multitone, the UK-based pager and cordless telephone system supplier, points out, cordless systems are extremely cost-effective to run once installed since there are no airtime charges, internal calls are free and external calls cost the same as from an ordinary desk telephone. Multitone's CS500 system connects directly to a PABX and so no expensive changes need to be made to an existing hard-wired system and the same desk telephones and extension numbers can continue to be used. Recognising that many companies cannot justify the cost of covering a whole site with a cordless system, the CS500 also comes with paging software enabling handset users to roam outside cordless coverage and still stay in touch. However, if cordless business systems are to flourish, there are several obstacles to overcome. In particular there are two main rival cordless business system technology standards, CT2 (Cordless Telephony 2) and Dect (Digital European Cordless telecommunications.) CT2 was the first digital cordless technology to be developed in the UK during the 1980s and has been adopted as an interim European standard. It is the same technology used for Telepoint services in Europe and elsewhere. GPT Communications Systems and Canada's Northern Telecom have been supplying cordless office systems which are based upon CT2 digital technology - BT also supplies re-badged Northern Telecom systems and Multitone's CS500 cordless system is supplied under an agreement with Northern Telecom. The Canadian group, which is also developing a Dect system for up to 1,000-users in conjunction with Olivetti, launched its Companion CT2 cordless business systems in Europe in March last year and has sold over 1,000 systems in 13 European countries and the Middle East since then and over 2,000 systems worldwide. CT2's supporters claim that it is a proven and cost-effective technology ideally suited to small and medium-sized offices. CT2 handsets currently cost about a third of the price of their Dect rivals and are likely to retain a price advantage because of the adoption of the technology outside Europe - for example, in the Far East. The rival Dect standard is backed by ETSI (the European Telecoms Standards Institute) and was designed to solve the problem of providing cordless phones in high-density business environments such as offices. Five of Europe's largest telecommunications equipment suppliers - Alcatel, Ericsson, Nokia, Philips and Siemens - which between them represent nearly 70 per cent of the European PABX market adopted the Dect standard in March 1993 and the first Dect systems begun to appear shortly afterwards. Ericsson has been one of the most active promotors of Dect systems and launched its Freeset system in Europe last autumn although it has been selling similar systems outside Europe for some time. Freeset systems have already been installed in manufacturing factories, hospitals and 'offices of the future' such as Digital Equipment's futuristic headquarters in Stockholm. In time, telecommunications strategists believe cordless office telecommunications systems will be integrated with other digital telecoms services including GSM (global system for mobile) and PCN services, and with wireless local area networks linking desktop computers, workstations and other devices.</p>

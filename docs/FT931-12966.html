			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sales estimates low, says report THE AMOUNT of money the planned national lottery could raise has been seriously underestimated, according to Opax International, the security printing group which supplies tickets for 40 state lotteries around the world. Opax says suggestions that ticket sales could be Pounds 1.5bn a year in the UK are much too low - sales could exceed Pounds 3bn and continue to climb 'with the right product mix, organisation and marketing'. Mr Glyn Owen Hughes, director of operations for the Leeds-based group, says its estimates are based on the experience of other lotteries. He points out that German lottery sales before the integration of the former East German lotteries totalled Pounds 4.8bn in 1991 - Pounds 81 per head each year. The equivalent spending per head in the UK would generate lottery sales of Pounds 4.6bn. 'People do not seem to realise how big the UK national lottery could be,' Mr Owen Hughes says. The proceeds of the lottery are intended to be allocated to five 'good causes': sport, the arts, national heritage, charities and a number of projects to mark the millenium. Opax International, part of the Bowater group, said a lottery should not affect charities adversely. And evidence from countries such as Italy, Denmark and Finland suggested that the lottery and football pools could co-exist. It argues that levels of taxation are important to the success of a national lottery. 'Where the level of taxation begins to affect the value of the prize fund, the lottery's . . . success is put at risk,' Opax says.</p>

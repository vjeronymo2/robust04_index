			<p>BFN     [Text] Let us now report on President Gonzalo Sanchez de  Lozada's participation in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] President Gonzalo  Sanchez de Lozada held a working breakfast meeting with Chilean  President Eduardo Frei this morning. The two presidents  discussed such issues as exports and the Bolivian claim to the  sea coast.    [Sanchez] We discussed it, we looked at it, and we said that  this is a current problem. How can we solve it? The solution  has not... [Sanchez recording ends abruptly]    [Reporter] The foreign media asked President Sanchez if a  sea  outlet was the only way for Bolivia to integrate itself into a  modern economy.    [Sanchez] The sea outlet is the only way, but this is not  necessarily related to... [Sanchez recording ends abruptly]    [Reporter] In addition to the issue of the sea outlet, other  important issues for the two countries were also discussed.    [Frei] Issues such as economic complementation, physical  integration, seeking common positions on matters of education,  and joint binational projects such as natural gas, which is an  important energy issue for Bolivia.    [Reporter] How would you label this meeting?    [Frei] Positive and very cordial.    [Reporter] The result of the working breakfast meeting  between the two presidents was the preparation of an agenda for  the two foreign ministries. [end recording]    The meeting was positive and cordial, an important meeting.  There are differences, and we are under the impression that  President Frei recognizes them despite the Chilean official  position that Chile has nothing pending with Bolivia. There is  a long way to go, but this process, which we believe is  loosening up, is a good one, without illusions but with clear  ideas. Let us now listen to Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at the  Ibero-American Summit:    [Begin recording] [Reporter] Are there plans for a new  meeting between the Bolivian and Chilean presidents next  September?    [Sanchez] Yes, that is true, and a request was made to the  foreign ministries to prepare an agenda for the different  committees to start working, looking at the problems. The sea  issue was raised, but we did not make any progress on that  point. We want to make progress on all issues, including the  sea issue.    [Reporter] What about natural gas?    [Sanchez] The natural gas issue was also definitely raised,  and there seems to be a very good predisposition and some  contacts with Chilean state companies. This kind of negotiation  seems to be the best way for people who are used to working on  projects, and not to getting involved in diplomatic subtleties.    [Reporter] Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada labeled the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit positive. [end recording]</p>

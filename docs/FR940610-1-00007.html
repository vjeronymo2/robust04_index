			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FDIC believes that this approach would not have a detrimental impact on insured institutions. Significantly, approximately 75 percent of incorrect assessment payments result from errors made by institutions in filling out their certified statement forms. Such errors would be virtually eliminated under the proposed procedure. Moreover, it is anticipated that any remaining adjustments would be processed more quickly, and that institutions would actually pay less interest from underpayment errors_and would receive credit for overpayments more quickly_than under the existing arrangement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Fail-Safe Payment Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the proposed payment procedure relies on computerized systems, it seems prudent to provide for a back-up plan to be triggered in the event of a system failure or similar but less global circumstances. The fail-safe plan incorporated into the proposed rule provides that any institution that does not receive its quarterly assessment invoice by the beginning of the month in which payment is due is to promptly notify the FDIC. It is anticipated that, in most cases, the FDIC would provide a duplicate invoice to the institution. However, in the event that could not be done, the institution would, as a preliminary matter, make its quarterly payment in the amount shown on its assessment invoice for the preceding quarter. Any necessary adjustments to that payment would be reflected on the next quarterly invoice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Mergers Resulting in the Termination of Insured Status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Assessment Base Adjustments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;327.6(a) sets forth the rules for computing institutions' assessment bases when one institution (a seller) transfers its deposits to one or more other institutions (buyers), and then goes out of business. Transactions of this kind (transfers) can take many forms: they include statutory mergers, consolidations, statutory assumptions, and contractual arrangements in which buyers purchase assets and assume deposits from a seller. Proposed &sect;327.6(a) would cover all such cases. But it would not cover cases where the seller continues to survive (such as cases in which a seller only sells some but not all of its branches). Nor would it cover cases in which buyers assume deposits from the receivership for a failed institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sometimes the buyers complete a transfer (or related series of transfers) in the first quarter of a semiannual period (January through March, or July through September). In that case, the buyers assume all the seller's deposits before the end of the quarter. The buyers report the transferred deposits in their first-quarter reports of condition. Under the proposed rule, the second-quarter payments made by the buyers would be based (in part) on the transferred deposits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> But many transfers take place in the second quarter of a semiannual period (April through June, or October through December). A seller still has deposits at the end of the first quarter, and reports the deposits in its first-quarter report of condition. Under the proposed quarterly-payment schedule described herein, an institution continuing in business would make a second-quarter payment based on these deposits, and that payment would represent an installment on the assessment for the upcoming semiannual period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, where a seller has gone out of business before the start of the upcoming semiannual period, there may be a risk that neither the seller nor the buyers would pay any assessments on these deposits under the proposed quarterly-payment plan. The buyers would not have included these deposits in their first-quarter reports of condition, and would not have counted the deposits in their first-quarter assessment bases. The net effect could be that neither the seller nor the buyers would compensate the FDIC for insuring these deposits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

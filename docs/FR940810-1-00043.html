a proposed change removing the special protection afforded program income in revolving funds; a proposed change to the &sect;570.207(b)(4) definition of ineligible income payments; a proposed change to reorganize the section of the rule describing the statement of community development objectives, to prescribe the manner of its submission, to permit consolidation of amendment submissions, and to add a provision for describing ``float-funded'' activities in the statement; a proposed change specifying three situations in which income earned on grant funds must be remitted to the U.S. Treasury; a proposed change restricting use of CDBG funds outside the jurisdiction of the recipient; a proposed change to require transfer of excess program income to the line of credit; a proposed change to authorize the Department to delay making a CDBG grant to any community whose Grantee Performance Report (GPR), at the time the grant is to be awarded, has not been submitted in a manner consistent with the GPR Form Instructions; and proposed performance standards to replace the Housing Assistance Plan (HAP) standards at &sect;570.903, for determining whether a grantee has carried out its certification concerning following its Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the described changes are proposed in response to problems HUD has identified in its administration of the program.

This rule contains: 1) a proposed definition of ``income'' for families and households that will continue to allow some grantee discretion in the selection of a definition while setting the parameters of the choices; 2) a proposed change in the calculation of the planning and administration limitation to establish the specific, exclusive method for calculation; 3) a proposed change removing the special protection afforded program income in revolving funds; 4) a proposed change to &sect;570.207(b)(4) clarifying the definition of ineligible income payments and lessening its coverage; 5) a proposed change to reorganize the section of the rule describing the statement of community development objectives, to prescribe its content and the manner of its submission, to permit consolidation of amendment submissions, and to add a provision for describing how ``float-funded'' activities must be shown in the statement; 6) a proposed change to specify when income earned on grant funds must be remitted to the U.S. Treasury; 7) a proposed change restricting use of CDBG funds outside the jurisdiction of the recipient to instances in which such use will principally benefit residents of the recipient; 8) a proposed change that will remove an incentive for grantees to make loans to earn income by requiring transfer of excess program income to the line of credit; 9) a proposed change to authorize the Department to delay making a CDBG grant to any community whose Grantee Performance Report (GPR), at the time the grant is to be awarded, has not been submitted in a manner consistent with the GPR Form Instructions; and 10) proposed performance standards to replace the Housing Assistance Plan (HAP) standards at &sect;570.903, for determining whether a grantee has carried out its certification concerning following its Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS). Many of these proposals are the direct recommendations or suggestions of the Department's Inspector General.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recently published consolidated submission and reporting requirements, in another proposed rule. Differences between this program-specific rule and that more broad-based rule be resolved before final regulations are issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

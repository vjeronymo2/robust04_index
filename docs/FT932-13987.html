			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Management: Self-styled hero in a kipper tie - Sir John Harvey Jones is popular with the punters, but is his reputation justified 'HOW shall I describe you in the picture caption?', the FT photographer asks Sir John Harvey Jones. Ex-ICI boss? Troubleshooter? Philanthropist? Best selling author? Showbiz personality? One man think-tank for Britain plc? Protector of wildfowl? Chairman of the Economist? 'Businessman,' he replies. 'It's a title of honour, and it's all I want to be. But if you want to be really nice you could call me manager as well.' Looking quite at home with the pony-tailed media set at London's Groucho Club, Sir John is being modest. Yet such modesty seems out of place from perhaps the best-known manager Britain has had. Every week Sir John gets letters from hundreds of 'poor buggers' wanting advice on how to run their businesses. Companies clamour to have him on their boards: there was a time when he felt insulted if a day went past without a fresh invitation. Next week he publishes yet another business book, described by its publisher as a 'bible of 90s management'. But how good has his record really been? Does it justify so much fuss? Sir John foils all such inquiry by complaining that he has never set out to solve everyone's business problems. He insists that he is no management consultant, and when it comes to his own record - well, he has made 'every mistake in the book'. In any case, to criticise Sir John's past adds grist to his mill: the problem with the British, he never tires of saying, is that they hate business and hate success. He might further argue that any examination of his own history misses the point: he is not setting himself up as a perfect businessman, but championing a cause. 'Bad management lies at the root of all this country's problems,' he says. 'We need management heroes to make it seem exciting and glamorous.' He reckons that at the moment he is doing the job almost single-handedly, with a bit of help from Richard Branson. And as management hero he is superb. More than 3m people watched him deliver painful home truths to companies in his Troubleshooter television series. The British may hate businessmen, but they love a character, and Sir John, with his wayward appearance and even more wayward vocabulary, has made sure he is that. At ICI, the long-haired ex-boss is remembered by the top people with mixed feelings. Indeed, Cecil (now Lord) Parkinson once said that the best way to cause a silence at an ICI lunch was to say something nice about Harvey Jones. Much of that antipathy is jealousy. ICI is a grey-suited organisation whose retired directors are meant to grow dahlias quietly, not to take on the problems of British manufacturing single-handed. Sir John quotes with glee his successor, Sir Denys Henderson, prudishly telling someone that appearing on the Wogan chat show was not how he saw the duties of the head of ICI. 'My peers think there is something disreputable in what I do,' Sir John says. They also feel resentment that he received the credit for a turnround in profitability at ICI that was not altogether his doing. Sir John became chairman in 1982, close to the bottom of the cycle, and left five years later, just before the top. His predecessor, Sir Maurice Hodgson, had done the hard part first, and had made a third of the workforce redundant without losing a single day's work. One rarely hears of Sir Maurice now. With the firing done, Sir John had a head start in one of his main tasks at chairman, to get costs under control. In this he was largely successful and some argue that ICI's cost competitiveness has slipped a little since he left, although Sir Denys might well blame the cycle again. Not being responsible for the lay-offs also helped him become a hero with the workforce. One analyst recalls a visit to ICI on Merseyside in the early 1980s and being told by the workers that the new chairman came on to the shop floor to talk to them and that they would follow him to the ends of the earth. Sir John will also go down in history as the man who took on ICI's bureaucracy. Before his rule, almost a year might pass between an investment plan being put forward by a divisional chairman and the board taking the final decision. He cut out many layers, halved the number of directors on the board, simplified committees and decentralised the organisation, passing power down the line. Some argue that the process, although desperately needed, went too far. 'The board began to lose touch with what was going on. Denys Henderson has had to push the pendulum back the other way,' says Stuart Wamsley, a chemicals industry analyst. A new tier has subsequently been set up beneath board level to provide a stronger link to the divisions. Sir John also took a hard strategic look at ICI, boldly moving the company out of oil and out of some polymers. He also embarked on a Pounds 2bn-plus spending spree on speciality chemicals companies - which recently has been judged a mistake and has been partly undone. The idea was that speciality chemicals would offset the cyclical commodities business, but ICI found its management style clashed with that needed to run smaller entrepreneurial companies, and the new division saw its profitability fall to nothing. The experiment casts doubt on whether ICI really knows how to modernise itself - the latest scheme being to cut itself into two. What does Sir John make of all this? As ever, he professes ignorance about what has happened at ICI since his departure, but his refusal to comment smacks more of disapproval than of a desire to let the present management get on with it. 'Companies always have a tendency to add levels,' he says, shaking his head. As far as his acquisitions go, Sir John is unrepentant. 'The alternative was to have invested more in heavy chemicals,' he scoffs, as if any fool should have been able to see he had done the right thing. And on the bisection of the company, well, he thought of it himself. He does admit to some mistakes at ICI, though these were mainly of timing: 'There were a number of things that we did, but did too slowly,' he says. 'We should have got out of oil sooner.' Sir John is a little quicker to own up to shortcomings as a non-executive director. Despite the hundreds of posts offered and despite the lengthy advice he gives on the subject in his first book, his record is middling. Three of the four positions he has taken up since leaving ICI have been fraught with problems. He was non-executive chairman of the now bankrupt Burns Anderson, overseeing a master plan of expensive acquisitions in recruitment and financial services, carried out at the top of the market. He sat on the board of GPA, the aircraft leasing company, during its spectacular journey from a proposed Pounds 1.5bn listing last summer to its present struggle for survival. At Nimbus records, the idiosyncratic maker of CDs, Sir John's directorship lasted only a few months. 'The best thing he did for us was introduce us to Peter Laister, who took over from him,' says Nimbus joint founder, Gerald Reynolds. In the case of both Burns Anderson and GPA, Sir John says he joined the board 'primarily because I knew and liked the people'. At Burns Anderson he admits that 'we were caught by trying to expand too fast'. At GPA the problem was putting off for too long its transition to a public company. For this Sir John accepts no responsibility: 'I was urging it to go earlier than it did.' At Grand Met and The Economist his non-executive jobs have been happier. From the time when he tap danced on the table during a stuffy Economist dinner - under the uncomfortable gaze of the editor Rupert Pennant Rea - he has been welcomed as a rejuvenating force. Meanwhile, most of the Troubleshooter companies which subjected themselves to a televised flogging seem to have enjoyed and benefited from the experience. Their reports on him share common themes: he is long on charm, long on charisma and common sense. He is short on detail, short on understanding of small business concerns and hard to shift once he has made up his mind. 'He drew quick and intelligent conclusions - although things were not always quite as simple as his projections,' says Bob Wales of Tolly Cobbold, the Suffolk brewery. According to David Sugden of Double 2, the shirtmaker, Sir John 'didn't quite get to grips with what our business was about. But he was good for us. He didn't tell us anything we didn't know, but he laid a challenge'. Only the Morgan Motor Company refused to follow his advice to expand - a course of action which Sir John cites as evidence of the poverty of ambition of small and medium-sized British companies. Whether successful or not, his Troubleshooting days are over, and his corporate days are also numbered. Seventy next year, Sir John plans to retire all his posts. That will leave him more time to do what he is really good at - selling business to the greater public and writing clear books on management. This makes him no management guru in the traditional sense. As John Kay of London Business School, says: 'He is not a Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. In this country there is no serious science of management, but in the absence of that a sensible person offering sensible views is the best you can hope for.' But Sir John is more than that. The same team who produced Troubleshooter have just made an equally sensible lookalike series called The Adventurers without Sir John, but the result was dull. There was a great vacuum where the kipper tie and the boys' comic expletives should have been.</p>

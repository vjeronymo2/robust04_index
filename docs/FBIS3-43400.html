			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The shelling of Malanje by the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] killed one person and  wounded nine people, one seriously. Francisco Kuringana reports.    The action took place precisely at a time when the aircraft  which was carrying U.S. congressmen -- who were expected in  Malanje today -- was about to land. Local circles view this as  another maneuver aimed at interrupting on-the-ground  observations of the main problems affecting thousands of  citizens in this part of the country because of the war caused  by UNITA and the problems experienced by the Angolan people in  all fields.</p>

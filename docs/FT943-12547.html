			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Sinn Fein stresses positive side of response Sinn Fein officials were last night keen to stress the positive elements of their official reaction to the Downing Street declaration - particularly after widespread negative comment in Ireland and the UK. The party's special conference yesterday failed to recommend that the IRA end its campaign of violence. Had it done so it is likely that Sinn Fein would have have been invited to join cross-party talks in the autumn. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, hinted after the conference that an IRA ceasefire could still be on the cards, enabling the peace process to continue. He said: 'Sinn Fein is working with others to bridge the gap. I want a situation where violence can be diminished - the IRA has to make a contribution.' Asked whether current conditions might be sufficient for the IRA to call a ceasefire, he said: 'I am not prepared to say whether they do or do not exist - it is an area we are working on.' Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, spoke in his closing speech of a 'climate of change' and indicated that he believed the IRA could be persuaded to end its violence 'if the proper conditions can be created'. He said the challenge for Sinn Fein was to 'create the conditions in which the IRA can act upon its clearly stated commitments and others will act upon their responsibilities so that a negotiated settlement can be agreed'. However it is clear that one of Sinn Fein's main priorities guiding its response to the declaration has been to avoid a split in its own ranks. One official said that the party, in arriving at its position, had travelled a long way. Mr Adams told the conference: 'I can assure you that we will endeavour with your help and guidance to achieve the political objectives which we have set ourselves. This struggle is united, confident and strong.' He stressed that the British government should now view the ball as being back in its court. He called on it 'to accept its responsibility to pro-actively create the conditions which will make this possible'. He added that de-militarisation was not 'a one-way street' and warned: 'Sinn Fein has a duty to our electorate north and south and we are commited to upholding their rights.' In a detailed breakdown of the party's criticisms of the declaration, the so-called unionist veto stands out as the biggest sticking-point. The conference stated that 'the veto is a barrier to the consideration or achievement of democratic options for all the Irish people. It has no legal, constitutional or democratic basis'. However another motion passed by the conference displayed Sinn Fein's optimism. It said: 'We have identified these negative elements in the Downing Street declaration in the hope that these difficulties can be overcome. Sinn Fein is convinced that, despite the inadequacies of the declaration, the potential to build upon a real peace process still exists.'</p>

The inspection group had just returned from Belgrade. They  said the United Nations had not yet determined the necessary  number of personnel, or working and living conditions for the  Russian staff.    After examining the Tuzla airport's runway, the Russian  group  came to the conclusion that it was ready to handle planes.  Flight navigation equipment must be set up soon, fences must be  restored, and some areas still have to be de-mined.    Because of the complicated military situation in the Tuzla  area, humanitarian aid should not be flown into the airport  before an agreement on safety guarantees is reached with all the  sides involved in the conflict, the Russians recommended.  Humanitarian flights should begin no earlier than one week  after the airport is reopened.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Keqian (0491 0344 6197) and Zhang Fengxi </F> (1728 7685 0823): "Open Market Operations--A Major Reform of  China's Central Bank Regulation and Control of the Money Supply"]    [Text] One of China's "major" monetary reforms in 1994 is  the central bank's [PBC] practice of open market operations.  The news coming from the gold-ingot-shaped PBC tower on  Beijing's Fuxingmen confirms that: the central bank's  management of monetary and credit funds in 1994 will change to  mostly control of the money supply and oversight of financial  institution operations, with its regulation and control of the  money supply gradually introducing the international practice of  open market operations. Authoritative figures claim that open  market operations are a major reform of China's Central Bank  style of macroeconomic regulation and control of the national  economy, as well as a key market economy style of coordinating  monetary and fiscal policies.    What are open market operations? They refer to actions by a  country's central bank, through open market buying and selling  of financial commodities, such as government bonds, to regulate  money-market money supply and interest rates. When money  market funds are tight, the Central Bank buys government  securities on open markets, pouring basic currency into markets;  when too much currency is in circulation on markets, the Central  Bank sells government securities on open markets, withdrawing  funds from circulation, to deflate the currency.  <H5>  One of the "Magic Weapons" of Indirect Regulation and Control </H5>   The three monetary policies of open market operations,  rediscounting, and legal deposit reserves, are called in  international monetary circles the "three key magic weapons" for  exercising macroeconomic regulation and control of a national  economy. In certain economically developed countries, open  market operations are regularly used by the Central Bank to ease  or tighten credit.    The reason that China did not take this step [practice open  market operations] in the past, in addition to system factors,  was that we had not yet met two objective terms:    1. The Central Bank has to hold sizeable amounts of  government bonds, without which open market operations are mere  empty talk. In certain developed countries, 50 to 60 percent  of Central Bank assets are national treasury bonds, while in  China, central fiscal deficits can be made up directly through  PBC overdrafts, so that Central Bank assets do not include  control of national treasury bonds.    2. There has to be a quite deep, broad, and flexible  national treasury bond market. In such a market, commercial  banks, stock companies, and other individuals and institutions  all hold sizeable amounts of treasury bonds, and there is also a  complete transaction system and standards. Otherwise, it is hard  for the regulation of credit to have any impact.    So beginning in 1994, open market operations will take a  developmental step, with central finance no longer directly  overdrawing on and borrowing from the Central Bank, but rather  selling treasury bonds to the public, to raise the needed  national construction funds. In conjunction with these  monetary and fiscal reform steps, the Central Bank will set  percentage requirements for the liquid assets of financial  institutions, stipulating that all types of financial  institutions hold a set amount of treasury bonds and  policy-finance bonds. Meanwhile, we will allow all commercial  banks or their authorized branches, based on the minimum assets  liquidity percentage set by the central bank, to buy and sell  treasury bonds on secondary markets, or through forms, such as  outside dealings, central bank collateral, and "buy-back  agreements," to adjust the percentages of their own liquid  reserve fund structures.    Based on this overall principle, we sold Central Bank  financing bonds in 1993, and will expand treasury bond sales in  1994 to 100 billion yuan, all of which bodes well for open  market operations to reach a higher level. On 31 January 1994,  our first batch of 15 billion yuan worth of treasury bills was  completely underwritten by an exclusive sales group composed of  35 financial institutions. The overall coordinator of this  exclusive treasury bond sales group was the PBC. The joint  sale of treasury bonds by the Ministry of Finance and the PBC  was a historical first. It is understood that the Central Bank  has recently begun to buy treasury bonds, beginning to practice  open market operations, which will also be a historical first.    The operating tools of open market operations are treasury  bonds and foreign exchange, with the ultimate aim being to  stabilize the value of the RMB. Our choice of treasury bonds  as our open market operating tool in 1994 will first: help us  to draw on international practice to avoid detours and second;  coordinate well fiscal and monetary policies through buying and  selling treasury bonds.    The experts involved in the planning of this new monetary  policy hold that the Central Bank use of open market operations  to indirectly regulate and control the money supply will be  like a trickling stream, which can effectively prevent the  social and economic repercussions caused by the past forms of  direct regulation and control, such as relending and  controlling credit scope. This is because only when it is  necessary to regulate and control the economy will the Central  Bank handle basic currency through the three major channels of  its discount collateral window, treasury bond market, and  foreign exchange market, transmitting basic currency through  these channels to financial institutions to produce the  regulation and control effect, so that all financial  institutions certainly do not deal directly with the central  bank, but rather with money markets. Meanwhile, this policy  will operate with constancy and continuity, in that once money  markets experience changes, the Central Bank can quickly change  its operating direction, to quickly adjust the market money  supply.  <H5>  Welcome News for Our Whole Society </H5>   Central Bank initiation of open market operations is good  news for financial institutions, as well as for enterprises and  individuals. Ensuring that open market operations work to  achieve the desired regulation and control impact will require  the sale of large amounts of treasury bonds, which will sharply  increase public investment opportunities. Banks and nonbank  financial institutions can also, when funds are abundant or in  short supply, directly or indirectly adjust their assets  structures through treasury bond transactions with the Central  Bank. As the Shenzhen Development Bank is a listed corporation,  the relevant provisions do not allow it to invest in the stock  market, so that for many years, treasury bonds have been a key  part of its capital structure. Open market operations will  undoubtedly provide fine opportunities for such institutions.  A figure affiliated with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of  China, which is acting as a major underwriter for the first  batch of voluntary treasury bond sales, states that: "We  particularly welcome the reform of treasury bond sales. Since  many commercial bank assets are now credit loans, current  lending seems to be a bottomless pit. But if we buy treasury  bills, we can effectively change our former assets structure."    Central bank initiation of open market operations will also  have a certain impact on current and future stock market prices  and returns. For instance, when the PBC is buying large amounts  of treasury bonds, this means that it is easing money and  expanding credit, which will generally raise bond prices,  lowering their yields. But when the PBC is selling large  amounts of treasury bonds, this means that the central bank is  tightening money and shrinking credit, creating the impression  that interest rates will go up, thus lowering demand for  investment bonds, causing bond prices to slide. For the  investor, correctly grasping these "signals" for timely  purchases or sales of treasury bonds, will sharply increase  investment returns.  <H5>  Open Market Operations Are a Heavy Responsibility </H5>   Central Bank open market operations are intertwined and  mutually promotional with treasury bond markets.    China's treasury bond circulation is less than ideal, one of  the signs of which is a low turnover rate. For U.S. treasury  bond sales, the turnover rate can reach 100 percent in about one  week, while the turnover rate for China's treasury bonds was  less than 100 percent for all of 1993. We are facing a similar  problem in 1994. The Shanghai Stock Exchange offers a series of  treasury bond services, such as buybacks, futures, and spots,  for which trading volume and turnover rates are all low, with  almost noone using its treasury bond buyback service for capital  financing. In other words, China's open market operations still  depend on the size and vigor of the secondary bond market, as  well as on related central bank steps, without which their  initiation will be negatively affected.    In another area, China's open market operations are just  beginning in 1994, with few possible means of regulation and  control, meaning that for some time to come, it will be  impossible for them to become the Central Bank's major means of  macroeconomic regulation and control, and that it will be hard  for them to have much impact on macroeconomic conditions. It  is predictable that as the Central Bank's monetary policy tools  increase, and its regulation and control means improve, it will  not be too long before indirect means of regulation and control,  such as open market operations, will play the key economic  regulation role, to replace direct means of regulation and  control.</p>

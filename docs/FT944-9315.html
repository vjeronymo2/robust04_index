			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Result lacked decisiveness Sir, 'Sweden gives clear Yes to EU' said your headline (November 14). No, it did not. It gave only a very dubious Yes. Nearly half the voters (47 per cent) said No. Your story describes Finland's vote as 'decisive approval'. In fact 43 per cent voted No in the Finnish referendum. Neither country has accepted EU membership wholeheartedly. John Stanning, St Mary's, Sleepers Hill, Winchester, Hampshire SO22 4ND</p>

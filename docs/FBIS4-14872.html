			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Chinese Diplomacy Frustrates </F> Approval of Tough Resolution Against Pyongyang"]    [Text] Beijing -- The statement on North Korea that the UN  Security Council approved 1 April was the result of a compromise  between the United States and its Western supporters on the one  hand and China on the other. Thus the PRC once again  demonstrated that the West will not succeed in forcing Pyongyang  to open up its nuclear installations for inspection without its  consent.    What is more, the New York debate enabled Beijing to display  the consistency of its policy. It has after all from the very  start of the crisis claimed that methods of pressure and diktat  are unacceptable.    But whereas Chinese diplomacy can enter a point in its  favor,  military strategists hardly have cause to be delighted. As long  as the nature of the DPRK's nuclear program remains a secret and  as long as Pyongyang continues to violate its nonproliferation  treaty pledges there is still a threat to the security of all  Korea's neighbors, including China.    Why then are they doggedly opposing attempts to include even  a reference to sanctions in the UN ruling? Are they afraid of  an unpredictable response from Kim Il-song and his offspring if  things reach the point of an economic blockade against North  Korea? That is unlikely. This state's leaders are not crazy,  and they will not risk their own annihilation by unleashing  another war on the peninsula.    Some foreign observers in Beijing are saying that the  Chinese  leadership is not united on the North Korean problem. Army  representatives are alarmed not just by the nuclear ambitions of  China's former ally in the socialist camp, they are afraid that  Tokyo may follow Pyongyang with nuclear rearmament.    However, the army establishment is opposed by party  ideologists, who are convinced that economic sanctions must not  be allowed. They would after all ultimately bring about the  collapse of another communist regime, which would be bound to  affect Chinese Communists' morale. Moreover, the success of  sanctions against the DPRK would create a bad international  precedent. We would remind you that the United States is  threatening economic repression against China itself in an  effort to secure concessions from it in the human rights field.    There is also another viewpoint: Chinese intelligence is  fairly well informed on the progress of nuclear research in the  DPRK and believes that this country is incapable of  manufacturing a bomb on its own. That is why Beijing is not  inclined to overdramatize the conflict.</p>

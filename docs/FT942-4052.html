			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Enterprise/Lasmo It would be easy to knock Lasmo's assessment that it is worth at least 180p a share. Though the figure was produced by consultants DeGoyler and MacNaughton, the key assumptions were provided by Lasmo itself. The projected crude price of Dollars 17.50 in real terms is on the generous side, while the discount rate of 10 to 12 per cent looks low. Use more realistic assumptions and the net asset value comes tumbling down. But such calculations of Lasmo's absolute value are of little interest to the company's shareholders. Much more important is the company's relative value vis-a-vis Enterprise Oil. Following yesterday's statement that it would not underwrite a cash offer unless a third party entered the bidding, the battle is increasingly likely to be decided by the relative value of the two companies' paper. Altering the assumptions on crude prices or discount rates makes little difference, as the companies' values would move up or down in tandem. Most independent analysts estimate Enterprise's net asset value at one and a half times Lasmo's, which is exactly how Enterprise's current offer values Lasmo. That, though, gives Lasmo shareholders no incentive to swap their shares for Enterprise's. The larger company's problem is that it has little room to improve its offer. It has failed to demonstrate any significant value to be created from putting the companies together. A paper offer that appealed to Lasmo shareholders would probably end up harming its own investors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry has sent us a note to clarify a  diplomatic incongruity emphasized in our "Political Lobby"  column on our country's policy on Cuba and Haiti. The Foreign  Ministry Information and Culture Department explained that the  two countries involve different situations.    Concerning Haiti's case, the Foreign Ministry indicated that  a UN resolution on a blockade against Haiti was complied with.  In other words, Chile, as a UN member, had to comply with this  resolution.    Concerning Cuba, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the  United States alone has imposed a unilateral embargo, which has  not been confirmed by the United Nations. Concerning its trade  relations with the Caribbean nation, Chile has free action.</p>

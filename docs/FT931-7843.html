			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / CSFB pre-tax profits rise to Dollars 277m CS FIRST Boston, the New York-based global investment bank, has announced pre-tax profits of Dollars 277m (Pounds 195m) for last year, up from Dollars 266m in 1991. An unusually heavy tax burden, however, meant net profits for the year were Dollars 175m, well below the Dollars 215m earned after taxes in 1991. The largest contribution to earnings came from fixed-income sales and trading, where the lowest US interest rates in 30 years and buoyant domestic government and corporate bond markets created favourable conditions for all the main investment banking houses. CSFB said debt and equity underwriting revenues were also strong - a reflection of the record-breaking amounts of new corporate stock and bonds sold in the US markets during 1992 as companies took advantage of low interest rates and heavy demand for equity from investors. The bank's worldwide privatisation and mergers and acquisitions businesses also thrived last year. CSFB topped the rankings in 1992 as the busiest adviser among international investment banks. Yet, in spite of low interest rates, booming US stock and bond markets, and extraordinary levels of new debt and equity issuance, earnings growth at CSFB in 1992 was well below that of other big US-based investment banks and securities houses, most of which reported record profits last year. Observers said that the relatively modest growth in CSFB's pre-tax income in 1992 was partly because of its decision to invest large amounts of money in new business development, technology and people, and partly because of the firm's small equity base. CSFB's equity capitalisation last year was Dollars 1.07bn, small by the standards of big Wall Street investment banks. The equity capitalisation last year of Morgan Stanley, for example, was almost three times as large as CSFB's. The figures confirm that CSFB has recovered from its problems of two years ago, when its Dollars 1.2bn exposure to troubled corporate 'bridge loans' forced its parent, the Swiss banking group Credit Suisse, to launch a financial bail-out of CSFB in 1990. That year CSFB lost Dollars 587m, but returned to profitability in 1991.</p>

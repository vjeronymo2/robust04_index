			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Urumqi, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Construction for three  main railways in Xinjiang has entered a crucial stage. The  railways are the double-tracking of the Lanzhou-Urumqi Railway,  the Northern Xinjiang Railway and Southern Xinjiang Railway.    With financial allocations from the central government, and  investment from Gansu Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Region, workers have so far completed 600 km of double-tracking  on the Lanzhou-Urumqi line, of which 200 km has already been put  into operation.    The double-track railway line, with a length of 1,622 km, is  expected to be completed and put into use this September, said  the officials.    The railway line in northern Xinjiang, as an important part  of the second Eurasian continental bridge, has entered the final  stage of construction and will soon be put into operation.    Construction of the railway line in southern Xinjiang, which  is designed to transport oil out of the Tarim Basin and to  promote the local economy, started late last year. It will take  three years to complete building of this railway line, with a  length of about 1,000 km.    At the same time, nine major highways, which have a total  length of over 3,000 km and were jointly invested in by the  central government and different localities in northwest China,  were completed and put into operation last year.    Meanwhile, a border highway linking 14 outlets on the 5,400  km border in northwest China, and 23 highways extending to  neighboring countries for transportation of goods and passengers  have been completed and put into use.    The building or rebuilding of a dozen airports in Xinjiang,  which will require a total investment of about two billion yuan  from the central government and different localities, have all  started.    Local officials said the projects will finish construction  and become operational over the coming two years.    The laying of several optical telecommunication cables in  northwest China, with a total length of 3,200 km, has been  speeded up. When completed, they will link up with optical  fiber cable systems in 13 west Asian and European countries and  other optical cable systems in China.    A digital hyperfrequency wave transmission line has been put  into operation since last year.</p>

However, because existing HUD regulations do not clearly apply enterprise zone criteria to census tracts, the portion of new paragraph (4) concerning census tracts that meet the Federal enterprise zone eligibility criteria will not become effective until regulations are established identifying the specific criteria that must be met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Housing Strategies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any applicant which plans to undertake a housing activity with Fiscal Year 1994 funds under the HUD-administered Small Cities Program must prepare and submit a comprehensive housing affordability strategy (CHAS) to be eligible to apply for such assistance. In order to receive funding if the Small Cities application is approved, the housing strategy must be approved by HUD. Further, any Small Cities application for which a housing strategy is required must include a certification that the application is consistent with the housing strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current CHAS regulations were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 1, 1992, at 57 FR 40038, as amended, in part, on March 12, 1993 at 58 FR 13686. These regulations are codified in 24 CFR part 91. Applicants under this NOFA are permitted to use an abbreviated housing strategy, as set forth in &sect;91.25 of the CHAS regulations. Applicants are advised to begin preparation of the abbreviated strategy at the earliest possible time in order to have sufficient time to fulfill the applicable citizen participation requirements, which provide that the strategy must be available to the public for at least thirty days before its submission to HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If possible, applicants should endeavor to submit the abbreviated strategy in advance of the Small Cities application due date. The latest time at which the abbreviated strategy will be accepted by HUD for the HUD-administered Small Cities Program in New York will be the application due date for the Small Cities application. Failure to submit the abbreviated strategy by the due date is not a curable technical deficiency. Questions regarding the housing strategies should be directed to the appropriate HUD field office. Complete Small Cities applications for which the abbreviated strategy has been submitted but not yet approved will still be rated and ranked with the other applications; if determined to be fundable, those applications will receive a conditional approval subject to approval of the abbreviated strategy. However, such an approval will be rescinded if the abbreviated strategy has not been approved by HUD within 60 days from the date that the conditional approval has been announced. In such event the funding will be awarded to the highest rated fundable applicant that did not receive funding under this competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 was amended substantially by section 915 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, and the issuance of regulations to implement the new requirements was mandated. The following policy was set forth in the statute: ``It is *&blank;*&blank;* the purpose of this section to ensure that the employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and very low-income persons *&blank;*&blank;* ''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD published a proposed rule October 8, 1993 (24 CFR part 135) with a public comment period extended to December 8, 1993. Upon publication of the interim rule, requirements (including reporting requirements) relative to section 3 (for the purpose of determining the effectiveness of section 3) will be applicable to the HUD-administered Small Cities Program. At the time of publication of the interim rule, HUD will provide further information and instructions to applicants concerning the requirements of section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance: Documentation and Public Access Requirements; Applicant/Recipient Disclosures. HUD has promulgated a final rule to implement section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 12. Section 102 contains a number of provisions that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance administered by HUD. (See also Section II.D. of this NOFA.) On January 16, 1992, HUD published at 57 FR 1942, additional information that gave the public (including applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information on the implementation of section 102. The documentation, public access, and applicant and recipient disclosure requirements of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD responsibilities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Documentation and public access.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disclosures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period of less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Units of General Local Government Responsibilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Units of general local government awarded assistance under this NOFA are subject to the provisions of either paragraph b(1), or paragraph (b)(2) and (b)(3). For units of local government awarded assistance under this NOFA which in turn make the assistance available on a non-competitive basis for a specific project or activity to a subrecipient, paragraph b(1) applies. For units of local government awarded assistance under this NOFA, which in turn make the assistance available on a competitive basis for a specific project or activity to a subrecipient, paragraphs b(2) and (3) apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disclosures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The units of general local government receiving assistance under this NOFA must make all applicant disclosure reports available to the public for three years. Required update reports must be made available along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. Each unit of general local government may use HUD Form 2880 to collect the disclosures, or may develop its own form. (See 24 CFR 12 subpart C, and the notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for further information on these disclosure requirements.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

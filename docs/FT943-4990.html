			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Speedo swimwear helps Pentland jump to Pounds 16.8m Pentland Group yesterday claimed a share in recent Commonwealth Game victories as the branded consumer goods company announced a sharp jump in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 16.8m. The 96 medal winners in the 32 swimming events were all wearing Speedo swimsuits, according to Mr Frank Farrant, finance director. 'It is the first time that has happened and shows our strength in the performance-related swimwear market.' Strong growth in the Speedo division, which manufactures and distributes swimwear, was partly behind the sharp rise for the six months to June 30 withacquisitions, on which Pentland spent Pounds 20m in the first half, also helping. The advance was further fuelled by the absence of Pounds 9.5m in losses and charges arising from the closure of the US trade finance business in 1993. At the operating level, profits rose from Pounds 5m to Pounds 10.2m. Sales rose by 42 per cent to Pounds 280.9m (Pounds 198.4m), or by 43 per cent on a continuing basis. Pentland was disappointed by the performance of its US footwear business, which incurred losses of Pounds 5m for the whole of last year. Mr Farrant said the group was behind its target to halve losses for 1994, but was confident the division could break even next year. The consumer goods division suffered from higher prices for commodities such as copper, used in the manufacture of extension cords. This is the largest part of the business at Woods Wire, the cables maker and distributor acquired last year. Woods, which accounts for about half of total turnover, had been unable to pass on price increases to retailers, Mr Farrant said. However, increases of between 5 and 10 per cent had recently been introduced and there would be further rises in the second half. Pentland finished the first half with net cash of Pounds 145m, against Pounds 185 at the December year-end. The drop in cash and lower interest rates accounted for a fall in net interest income from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 4.2m. Mr Farrant said the group's strategy of making medium-sized acquisitions had been vindicated by the results. 'We have come a long way and people have not recognised that fact because we have not done one major acquisition.' Although Pentland would continue to be acquisitive, the group now intended to focus more on managing brands, Mr Farrant said. The dividend was increased by 7.8 per cent to 1.25p (1.16p) from earnings up from 0.41p to 2.71p, although the rise was a more restrained 19 per cent when non-recurring items were excluded. Analysts upgraded forecasts for full-year profits before exceptionals from about Pounds 31m to Pounds 35m, compared with Pounds 28.3m before exceptionals. The shares were marked up 4p to close at 108p.</p>

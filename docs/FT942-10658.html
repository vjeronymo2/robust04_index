			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Honda plans Mexican factory Honda, the Japanese car company, said yesterday it intended to build a car plant in Mexico, a further sign of growing international interest in the country's vehicle sector. The move will make it the eighth vehicle producer in the country. Mr Yoshihido Munekuni, vice-president of Honda, told the Mexican government the plant would initially produce 15,000 cars a year, and employ some 250 workers. Honda said it plans eventually to double the plant's initial 15,000-unit capacity. Honda's decision to build a Mexican plant follows a similar announcement by BMW last month. BMW intends to assembly luxury cars in Mexico from the middle of next year, and bring parts producers to Mexico to supply its planned car plant in South Carolina, US. The total production of Honda's plant is small even by Mexican standards, with planned production just a fraction of the more than 100,000 cars a year each of the five main companies sell in the domestic market. According to Mr Miguel Angle Olea, a Mexican consultant to car companies, Honda is preparing for liberalisation of Mexico's car sector, when it will be able to import cars into Mexico. 'They know that in 10 years' time the market will be free,' says Mr Olea. 'They are coming to establish their presence. This is just a penetration strategy.' Mexico has agreed under the North American Free Trade Agreement gradually to remove current restrictions on car imports and eliminate tariffs on parts and finished vehicles. Companies that do not produce cars in Mexico are currently prohibited from exporting to Mexico. The car plant will be built in the western state of Jalisco where Honda already produces motorcycles.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of  Cambodia, said at a news conference in the Royal Palace on the  morning of 5 May that there are two neutral venues for a  roundtable meeting, namely, the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh and  his residence in North Korea.    His Majesty added that Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh  and Samdech Hun Sen, respectively first and second prime  ministers of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC], and  National Assembly Chairmen Samdech Chea Sim have supported his  proposal both totally and unconditionally. He further said that  the RGC has agreed to let a Khmer Rouge [KR] delegation stay in  the Royal Palace if the Khmer Rouge [KR] group chooses to take  part in a roundtable meeting in Cambodia. The RGC has also  stated that if the Khmer Rouge does not want to meet in  Cambodia, a roundtable meeting can take place at the king's  residence near Pyongyang in North Korea.    Commenting on the Khmer Rouge stance, His Majesty King  Norodom Sihanouk said that the Khmer Rouge is now not interested  in a roundtable meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, April 11 (AFP)--An agreement for a  200-million-dollar export credit line was signed in Beijing  Monday between Portugal and China aimed at boosting Portuguese  exports to the mainland, according to a report here. LUSA news  agency reported the signing was attended by Portuguese Prime  Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, who arrived Sunday on a seven-day  official visit, and Chinese counterpart Li Peng. The credit  line was negotiated between Portugal's Banco Nacional  Ultramarino and the Bank of China, the Portuguese news agency  said. The aim of the credit line was to increase Portuguese  exports to China, LUSA said.    Earlier, Cavaco Silva and Li issued a joint declaration on  cooperation over the transition of Macau, which reverts to  Chinese sovereignty in 1999.    "The Sino-Portuguese joint declaration on the question of  Macau is an historic document and a good example to solve  questions left by history," Li was quoted as saying by LUSA.    Cavaco Silva was quoted as saying that the application of  the  joint declaration "has been smooth" and "corresponds to the  wishes of the two countries."    Cavaco Silva and then prime minister Zhao Ziyang agreed in  1987 on the return of the Portuguese colony by the end of the  century, at which time it would become a "special administrative  region" of China.    Portuguese diplomatic sources told LUSA that the aim of the  visit was to "consolidate the excellent political understanding"  between the two countries and to "inject new dynamism" in their  trade relations.    Cavaco Silva has in his entourage 60 businessmen as well as  the ministers for foreign affairs, trade, and tourism.</p>

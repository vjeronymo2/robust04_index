			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, member of </F> the Palestinian National Authority, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place and  date not given; from the "With the Midday Events" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi: You and your FIDA  [Palestinian Democratic Federation Party] colleague, Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh, are threatening to resign from the Palestinian  National Authority [PNA]. Why?    [Al-Shu'aybi] It is not a threat, but an expression of our  party's stand on the preparations under way by the PNA. We have  serious observations about the PNA's procrastination in the  adoption of sufficient and necessary measures to seriously and  directly assume its role, so that an authority vacuum does not  occur in the territories from which the Israeli authority has  withdrawn.    [Mu'addi] What are these reservations, doctor?    [Al-Shu'aybi] First, brother Yasir 'Arafat and the essential  PLO leading cadre should quickly return to the territories.  This particularly applies to the group that followed up the  negotiations with Israel on the Cairo agreement. Now that  brothers Nabil Sha'th and 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya have returned,  it is necessary that other brothers who took part in the  formulation on this agreement return so they can directly  supervise its immediate implementation. Administrative and  financial issues should be completed so this authority can  assume its role. So far, we still feel there is procrastination  and that the question is not taken seriously.    [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Azmi, is this stand by you perhaps because of  the marginalization of the FIDA status in the PNA?    [Al-Shu'aybi] This is irrelevant, for FIDA has willingly  selected its two portfolios. Brother Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh has  selected the culture and arts portfolio. I selected the youth  care and sports portfolios. In fact, all those involved have  selected their portfolios with complete freedom. So far, we  cannot say that serious work has started in either of these two  fields, or any other field. When we have made some observations  public, they were intended to be addressed to all fields of  Palestinian authority rather than those two fields only. I  believe the vacuum resulting from the PNA's failure so far to  assume its role seriously damages more than only FIDA and its  representatives on the PNA.    [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Azmi, a last question: Have contacts been  held with the PLO leadership, particularly Yasir 'Arafat in this  regard?    [Al-Shu'aybi] The FIDA representatives in Tunis are  authorized to raise this issue with brother Yasir 'Arafat. I  believe a special session was held in Tunis yesterday to discuss  these issues, including the FIDA observations about the  preparations so far.    [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, member of the PNA, thank  you  very much.    [Al-Shu'aybi] Not at all.</p>

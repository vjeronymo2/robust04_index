			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is not short of oil and is ready to export  more, the Ministry of Fuel and Energy said in a report prepared  by its experts. By the beginning of last month the country had  more than 6.5 million barrels of crude oil unsold. This is more  than average reserves. Among the factors restricting the sale  of oil are disproportionately high government taxes and prices.  As a result, the experts say, even oil exports have become  ineffective.</p>

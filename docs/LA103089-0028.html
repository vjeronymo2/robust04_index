			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILM REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'REVERIES' SERIES AT MELNITZ HALL  </P> <P> "Reveries" is the umbrella title given to four UCLA student films screening on  campus tonight at 7:30 and 9:30, and it's a good choice. Though quite different  in tone, ranging from childlike whimsy to grown-up doom 'n' gloom, all four  feature protagonists who are profoundly alone in one way or another, given to  daydreaming or wishes that can't come true. It's a lonely ol' night in Melnitz  Hall.  </P> <P> The best and most haunting of these is Bruce Muller's "Caruthers," which puts a  severe, almost cruel spin on its theme of unrequited longing by making its hero  a limping, disabled lounge drummer and the object of his affection a beautiful  woman who leads him on and spurns him in equally potent doses. Set in two  different desert towns, Muller's astonishing, aching mood piece isn't big on  story but contains two great characterizations -- of yearning from Tom McCray,  who beguiles with a smile both compassionate and nervous, and teasing from  looker Audrey Wells, who suggests tragic pain beneath the uncaring mood swings.  </P> <P> Also recommended are Suzanne Smith's "One Book, One Summer," about a schoolgirl  in love with a book about pioneers, and Keping Qiu's "Au Pair," about a Chinese  student working for an elderly Beverly Hills man. Robert Castle's "The Water  Man" completes the bill. Famed director Robert Wise ("West Side Story") will  speak as part of tonight's program.  </P></p>

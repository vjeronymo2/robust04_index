			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Fyodor Angeliy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau February 16 TASS -- The future Moldovan  parliament, which will be elected on February 27, should begin  its work by solving the Dniester and Gagauz problems, should  seek ways to surmount the country's deep crisis by political  methods alone, taking into account the interests of all the  sides involved and making concessions to each other for the sake  of Moldova's integrity and independence," speaker of the  Moldovan parliament Petr Luchinsky told TASS. Luchinsky is  taking part in the election race as candidate from the  Agrarian-Democratic Party of Moldova.    "The people of Moldova," he noted, "had to pay a high price  for the adventurism and incompetence of politicians of the  national- patriotic hue, who landed in the republic's governing  structures by sheer chance. Blood was spilled. It will take  not only the present generation, but many generations to come to  disentangle this tangle. This is why the problem of the Dniester  area and the southern part of the country should be regarded as  the two most important issues," the speaker believes.    In his opinion, there are ways to solve the Dniester  problem.  One of them presupposes a gradual elimination of crisis  phenomena within the bounds of an integral Moldovan state. "The  Chisinau authorities should offer the Tiraspol leaders to  restore a single budget and thereby lay the foundation for an  early stabilisation of industrial production. A law should be  drawn up at the same time guaranteeing a special legal status to  the left-bank areas of Moldova, Luchinsky stated. He favours  the eventual transfer of many governing functions to the  regional authorities, which will placate the people.    The speaker of the Moldovan parliament noted that initially  the Tiraspol leaders seemed to accept this idea. "But somewhat  later their unwillingness to bring this seemingly found solution  of the Dniester conflict to a logical end became apparent again.  Ambitiousness, typical for them, and unwillingness to cooperate  in the spirit of consensus, has obviously taken the upper hand  and they are going out of their way to secure the republic's  final dismemberment," he stated.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 11 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has  received a message from King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, monarch of  Saudi Arabia and custodian of the two holy mosques. The  message, dealing with bilateral ties and the continuing  coordination between the two leaders over matters related to the  current Arab situation, was delivered by Saudi Foreign Minister  Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, who arrived in Cairo earlier today.    After the meeting, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said that Egypt  and  Saudi Arabia are very concerned about stopping the fighting in  Yemen. He said events in that country are very critical,  declaring: We are devoting our efforts and energies to ensure a  successful cease-fire for the good of all parties.    Regarding north Yemen's noncompliance with the UN Security  Council resolution to observe a cease-fire, al-Faysal said that  continued fighting hinders everything and does not merely hurt  Yemen but its neighboring Arab countries as well.    Remarking that the wish to end the fighting in Yemen is  shared by all the Arab countries, he voiced hope that this wish  will find a favorable response, particularly during the current  mission of the UN secretary general's envoy there.    Asked about the Gulf Cooperation Council's [GCC] position on  the Yemeni crisis, the Saudi Foreign minister referred to the  GCC statement on the issue and explained that its stance is  clear. The GCC believes that continued fighting will force the  GCC countries to adopt measures against the party that refuses  the cease-fire. He said: Let us give the UN envoy a chance to  make some efforts in this matter.</p>

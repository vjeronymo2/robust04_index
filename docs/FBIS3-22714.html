Assistant Regional Health Director Jose Rodriguez said the  health department's disease surveillance center reported 28  confirmed cases of typhoid fever admitted in at least six  hospitals in the city.    Of the 28 confirmed cases, 11 are from Cebu City, eight from  Lapulapu City, four from Mandaue City, one from Toledo City, and  two each from Liloan and Talisay towns.    As this developed, Rodriguez said they have sent an  epidemiological team to Cordova in Mactan Island to check  reports that 18 people are suspected to have been afflicted by  typhoid fever.    Rodriguez said that the number of typhoid cases for the  period from January to middle of February is very much higher  than that recorded for the same period last year.    Typhoid fever is caused by the fever-causing bacteria called  "Salmonella typhi." Its symptoms, aside from fever, include  headaches and abdominal pains.    Rodriguez said typhoid fever is dangerous in that, if not  immediately detected and cured, could lead to the rupture of the  intestines.    Regional Health Director Consuelo Aranas signed directives  asking health officers in every city and municipality in the  region to monitor the situation and conduct epidemiological  investigation.</p>

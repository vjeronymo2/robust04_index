			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Paramount and QVC show bid battle scars Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group being acquired by Viacom after a Dollars 10bn takeover battle, yesterday reported a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 36.6m, due largely to disappointing audience figures for some recent film and television shows. The loss was in line with a forecast loss of Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m which Paramount made last month in the final stages of the takeover battle between Viacom and QVC Network, the television home shopping channel. QVC yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 2.8m, or 6 cents a share, down from Dollars 18.9m, or 40 cents, in the same period of last year, after taking Dollars 34.8m of pre-tax costs (an Dollars 18.8m net loss) for its unsuccessful Paramount offer. However, QVC's operating income in the fourth quarter was 34 per cent higher, at Dollars 53.2m, compared with Dollars 39.5m, on revenues up 9 per cent at Dollars 372.5m, compared with Dollars 341.8m. Fourth-quarter net income also included a Dollars 1.1m extraordinary charge from the accelerated write-off of debt placement fees. Mr Barry Diller, chairman, said the results confirmed QVC's core business was strong and 'though obviously somewhat distracted while pursuing Paramount, we have not been deterred from our strategy to put in place an aggressive plan for growth in both our basic business and the emerging world of inter-activity'. For the full year, QVC reported net income of Dollars 59.3m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, compared with Dollars 55.1m, or Dollars 1.24, on sales 14.2 per cent higher at Dollars 1.22bn. Paramount's third-quarter net loss, which worked through at 31 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 66.8m, or 56 cents, in the same period of last year, when it took a Dollars 66.9m one-time charge for an accounting change. Revenues were Dollars 1.01bn, up from Dollars 943.7m. For the first nine months, earnings totalled Dollars 180.6m, or Dollars 1.50, against Dollars 149.9m, or Dollars 1.26, the previous year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 27 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari admitted today that the state's information  system "did not work" in preventing the conflict in southeastern  Chiapas State. "I spoke about what didn't work, and there were  fundamentally two things," Salinas de Gortari said during a  meeting at the presidential residence with the cabinet,  governors, and legislators.    The president noted first "the remoteness of authorities and  the resulting lack of communication and information on what was  happening there, and second the state information system."  Salinas appointed a commissioner for peace and reconciliation in  Chiapas on 10 January during a reshuffling of his cabinet, which  he described as "a recognition of what didn't work." The  president told the officials and legislators with whom he had  breakfast that a deep reflection on political matters was  necessary.    "Now more than ever we need politics in the best concept of  the word, meaning as a task, an endeavor, a commitment in favor  of the loftiest causes of the people, and as the art of avoiding  confrontation," Salinas stated. Local authorities must not be  satisfied with saying that they know about the problems of their  regions, the president indicated. "They have to be there; they  have to get out more."    The president urged officials "to work, go out more to all  the states of the republic, be closer to the people and their  problems, and be closer with solutions in favor of our  countrymen." The Mexican head of state stressed that "political  circustances that we need to acknowledge" are among the causes  that led to the situation in Chiapas.    "Many cases of abuse... have turned into narratives and  stories. On occasions there has been a lack of political  homework by the authorities and organizations to be close to  their fellow citizens, as well as a lack of opportunities."  President Salinas de Gortari stressed that "it is truly wrong  to try to link poverty and needs with violence. If that were  the case, one-third of mankind would be up in arms today."    "We must explicitly recognize it. That is why we said this  is not an Indian uprising but an uprising with the participation  of Indians, several of them facing hardships, others practically  tricked into it." After noting that the only surprise in  Chiapas has been the attempt to use violence as a method to  remedy the situation, he added: "That is indeed alien to the  institution building we have been engaged in for several  generations."    "There is nothing the aggressor group can do that can exceed  the Mexican state's capacity to react with a response committed  to peace, justice, liberty, and democracy," the president said.  Salinas reiterated that the Mexican Army "acted and has been  working ably and loyally in line with its constitutional  responsibility in response to the request by the authorities" of  Chiapas State. There are some indicators in Chiapas that point  to "major lags accumulated over decades, even centuries," the  president admitted. He has supported actions to overcome social  backwardness in that state and the damage of the conflict.    On 1 January, an armed group arose in Chiapas to press the  demands of Indians who took over towns, thus necessitating Army  intervention. On 10 January the government adopted  reconciliatory measures to seek a political solution to the  conflict.</p>

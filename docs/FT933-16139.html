			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Bosnia sniper kills British aid worker A BRITISH woman aid worker and an 11-year-old girl were killed yesterday in fresh violence in Sarajevo, as conditions continued to deteriorate in the besieged Bosnian capital, report Laura Silber and Agencies. The aid worker, named by the Foreign Office in London as Christine Witcutt, 56, was shot by a sniper as she was driving out of the city in a truck emblazoned with the words 'Don't shoot'. She worked for the Edinburgh Direct Aid private charity. Her husband was driving another truck in a convoy of six vehicles that had taken relief supplies to Sarajevo at the weekend. The girl who died was one of 12 children hit by exploding mortar bombs during a renewed Serbian bombardment of the city. She died on the operating table of a hospital. Relief workers said the situation in the city was becoming unbearable, with hospitals unable to keep blood plasma without power to run refrigerators. UN officials have expressed grave concern about the possible outbreak of typhoid and cholera because of the lack of electricity and running water. Meanwhile, Gen Rasim Delic, commander of the Moslem-led Bosnian army, ordered his troops to grant safe passage to two Bosnian Croat commanders blockaded inside a Canadian UN base in central Bosnia. Sarajevo radio said United Nations officials mediated their release in exchange for four Moslems held by Croat troops. Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the French president, arrived in Belgrade yesterday to appeal for the release of arrested opposition chief Vuk Draskovic and his wife Danica.</p>

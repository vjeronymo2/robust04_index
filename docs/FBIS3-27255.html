			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang] </F>   [Text] Apparently denouncing Beijing's repeated warnings  on economics in recent weeks, the leadership in Shanghai is set  to continue fast-paced economic growth and push forward bold  reform packages. The move emphasised a wide split between the  local government of China's largest industrial city and the  central authorities in the Chinese capital, according to  Shanghai-based China analysts.    With support from paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, local  authorities even dared to defy directives from their former  bosses, the Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang  Zemin and economic supremo Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, Shanghai  sources told The Hongkong Standard yesterday.    Both Mr Jiang and Mr Zhu were Shanghai party chiefs and  mayors before they were promoted to Beijing after a 1989  military crackdown on nation-wide pro-democracy movements.    The municipal party authorities reached a consensus recently  to seize the historic opportunity to continue its economic  momentum despite the fact Mr Jiang and Mr Zhu recently warned  the locality to sincerely implement Beijing's latest directives  on economics.    Fearing social instability from increasingly inflationary  pressure, Beijing has decided to suspend some sweeping reforms  and slow down the growth in a bid to cool down the economic  overheatings. Mr Zhu also ordered all reform packages and  development plans that might spur inflation temporarily shelved  until a more "favourable environment was created."    But in a municipal economic conference early this month, the  secretary of Shanghai's Communist Party Municipal Committee, Wu  Bangguo, assured local officials that the city was to maintain  its pace in reform with its "three no's" policy.    The list promoted no changes to previous policies and plans;  no withdrawal of economic power delegating to lower authorities  under economic liberalisation; and no publicising what the city  did.    Meanwhile, the party authorities have agreed on an ambitious  development plan for 1994, revealed yesterday by mayor Huang Ju  to the ongoing annual session of the municipal law-making body.  Brushing aside problems of inflation and overheating, Mr Huang  said Shanghai would continue to maintain high growth rates this  year. Describing 1994 as a crucial year for reform in the city,  Mr Huang said: "If we want to speed up development we must dare  to face challenges." Mr Huang made no mention of Beijing's  austere measures for creating credit and 'investment. The mayor  called for a growth of 12 percent this year which is much higher  than the national average of nine per cent set by Beijing.    Mr Huang's speech reflected all the priorities of paramount  Chinese Ieader Dcng Xiaoping, who wanted the city to pioneer  China's reforms and development in the 1990's and used the city  as a platform to campaign for his ideas.    However, Mr Huang also warned of the danger of unemployment  which, along with inflation, is the biggest worry for Chinese  workers.    Many Shanghai factories have reduced working hours or are  paying staff a minimum wage to stay at home.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lobbyists bring Australian uranium debate back to the surface - The issue could be raised from the floor at the ruling Labor Party's conference in Hobart next week Could Australia be about to relax its constraint on uranium mining, which limits production to three mine sites? The question has arisen with the approach of the ruling Australian Labor Party's impending national conference in Hobart, Tasmania, next week. Uranium policy is not on the formal agenda but there is a real possibility that uranium supporters will raise the issue from the floor, to urge modifications. Over recent weeks, intense background lobbying has been under way. On the mining side, the Uranium Producers Group has commissioned Access Economics, a forecasting and consultancy organisation, to assess the implications of expanding the industry. Environmentalists, by contrast, have taken to the streets, demonstrating outside state ALP headquarters and warning of voter defections to minor parties if the rules do shift. Aboriginal representatives have also been voicing their case, both in the Northern Territory and in Canberra. Australia's current uranium policy dates back to the early 1980s, when the ALP moved away from its stated aim of banning uranium mining altogether and endorsed a new mine at Roxby Downs, in South Australia, where uranium was to be produced alongside copper and other metals. The party came to power the following year. After some internal battles, the 'three mines policy' evolved. Essentially, this limits uranium production to the Ranger mine in the Northern Territory, operated by Energy Resources of Australia (which, in turn, is controlled by North Broken Hill Peko); Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam, which is now wholly-owned by Western Mining Corporation; and at Nabarlek, in Queensland. However, Nabarlek has been worked out, and finished the processing and exporting of stockpiled ore in 1990. This, advocates of a more permissive approach argue, means that the 'three mines' policy has become a nonsense. Australia, they point out, has about 30 per cent of the western world's low-cost uranium reserves, yet produces only about 10 per cent of western output. This contrasts sharply with Canada's share of 40 per cent, derived from only about 18 per cent of reserves. In its study, Access Economics estimates that output from known deposits could almost double the country's production during the next 10 years if the 'three mines policy' were abandoned. Australia, it predicts, could come to account for 30 per cent of western output by 2004. Such expansion would have two favourable consequences. Firstly, export earnings would rise significantly, from ADollars 120.2m (56m) - excluding government stockpile sales - in 1994, to ADollars 752.6m - in 1994 price terms - in a decade's time. Secondly, the economic benefits would accrue mainly to Western Australia and the Northern Territory. (The deposits most likely to be assessed in the event of a change in ALP policy are North Ranger/Jabiluka in the NT; WMC's Yeelirrie in WA; Kintyre, also in WA and owned by CRA; and Koongarra in the NT.) 'The value of NT uranium exports in 1994 prices would be over ADollars 450m in 2004, or equal to more than 10 per cent of the current total output of the NT,' the Access report suggests. Anti-nuclear campaigners see things very differently. Greenpeace, the environmental group, has countered with its own report, which argues that Australia's bilateral trade agreements give 'advance generic consent' for plutonium to be separated from Australian-sourced uranium and used or stockpiled in pre-approved facilities, and that government assurances that Australian-sourced uranium and plutonium will be used for peaceful purposes cannot be guaranteed. Accident risks, it adds, may not be so far away. The report raises the possibility that Australian uranium may eventually be sold to Indonesia, which despite its considerable coal reserves, seems anxious to build a number of nuclear power reactors. Expanding trade and diplomatic relations with Indonesia is a key element in the Keating government's effort to forge a meaningful role in the Asia-Pacific region. But Greenpeace argues: 'The site of the first of these proposed reactors is in an area of high seismic activity, increasing the risk of an accident that could spread radioactive contamination over much of South-east Asia, including Australia.' Meanwhile, Australia's indigenous community appears to be divided on the issue. Any development of large Koongarra deposit in the Northern Territory  -jointly owned by Canada's Denison and Cogema, the French nuclear fuels agency - would allow the 'traditional owners' of the mine site to earn a significant economic interest in the project. Accordingly, some members of the Northern Land Council, which represents aboriginal interests in the region, have urged a relaxation of the current three mines policy. But it is unclear whether this stance is representative of opinion within the broader indigenous community: 'The majority of people have not been given the opportunity or the information to make an informed opinion on whether we do or do not want uranium mining,' Mr John Christopherson, an executive member of the NLC from West Arnham Land, said in Canberra this week. In the midst of the ideological debate, the commercial considerations are sometimes overlooked. There is currently an oversupply situation in the uranium market, and spot prices, which stood at more than USDollars 40 a pound in the late 1970s, have fallen to a quarter of that level. The Access report suggests that excess commercial inventories will disappear by the end of this decade, although it admits that estimates of when this might happen differ, and that western governments will be loathe to become too dependant on non-western supplies. Other analysts tend to agree - although they also warn that the timing is hard to predict. 'If you're asking will it be economic to expand production, the answer is probably yes,' comments one analyst at Sydney-based AME Mineral Economics, for example. 'If the three-mines policy was removed, it wouldn't be 'open-go', but there are two or three ore bodies which would be reviewed, with companies looking to long-term contracts.' Finally, there is the question of whether the issue will be raised at all. Any debate would come towards the end of next week's conference, and in the factional wheeling and dealing that goes on, uranium policy could yet fall by the wayside. Public opinion polls suggest that Australians tend to support the retention of a 'three mines' policy - although not by a vast margin - so the domestic political advantage in unleashing the issue may not be high.</p>

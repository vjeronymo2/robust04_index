			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Soviet newspaper called Yuri V. Andropov the "last Stalinist" boss in the  first open criticism of the former Soviet leader, considered at home and in the  West as a reformer and mentor of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Komsomolskaya  Pravda, the daily of the Communist Youth League, also pulled the wraps off  Andropov's 15-year career as the head of the KGB secret police, calling him  "the most enigmatic figure" of the Leonid I. Brezhnev era. Andropov, who ruled  just 15 months in 1982-83, instituted a crackdown on loafers by sending police  into movie houses, bathhouses and stores to nab the idlers.  </P></p>

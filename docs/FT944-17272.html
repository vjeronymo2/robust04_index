			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil ends 2.1% down Sao Paulo shares pared losses to end off 2.1 per cent in heavy trade here as a mild late buying spree was not enough to take the market into positive territory. The Bovespa index of the 55 most-actives shares fell for the fourth straight day to close down 1,027 at 48,767 points. Turnover was RDollars 375.8m (Dollars 445.7m). Stocks have dropped 11.1 per cent since Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso became president-elect in Monday's elections. Analysts said prices dropped on concerns about possible government restrictions on foreign funds entering Brazil combined with speculation ahead of futures settlements. Brokers said rumours that some small banks were facing financial difficulties also weighed on prices. Telebras TEL. SA preferred closed down 3.1 per cent at RDollars 45.50.</p>

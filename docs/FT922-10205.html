			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / East Germans find their homes are no longer their castles: Many live in fear of being forced out by their western neighbours FRED HAUPT hanged himself from a tree outside his small wooden house in east Berlin this week. He was found by the bailiff who had come to evict him. His is the second east German suicide within a month related to properties lived in by east Germans but claimed by west Germans. Mr Detlef Dalk, a local politician, from the east Berlin suburb of Zepernick where Mr Haupt lived, killed himself after his house was claimed by a west German. Mr Dalk left an open letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl protesting at the government's principle of returning eastern property to western owners instead of indemnifying them. East Germans occupying more than 1m houses and apartments claimed by westerners have been plagued by similar worries. Confrontation over the contested properties has done more to alienate 'Wessies' and 'Ossies' than any other development since unification in October 1990. Demands by west Germans for access to 'our homes' have been met by east German signs proclaiming the properties 'out of bounds for Wessies'. Mr Wilfried Wahner and his wife Ingeborg say they live in perpetual fear of the west German owners of the house they have rented from the state for 32 years. They claim the owners are using every means to evict them, and blame their predicament on German unity. 'At first we were happy about unification but now we feel victims of an attack,' Mr Wahner said. During the owner's long absence, Mr Wahner repaired the roof, built a garage, and meticulously tended the garden, at a time when building materials were obtainable only on the black market. The Wahners live in Kleinmachnow, a leafy east German suburb of west Berlin with 11,000 residents. Until 1989 the town, whose streets ended at the Berlin Wall, was known locally as the 'end of the world'. Now 66 per cent of the houses have claims on them by former western owners. When a representative of the owners first visited the Wahners in early 1990, he assured them they would be allowed to remain in the house permanently. The following spring, the first eviction notice arrived ordering the Wahners to vacate the house within 10 days. 'It is ruining my nerves,' said Mr Wahner, a 65-year-old former electrical engineer. Despite assurances by the local tenants' association that the couple could not be evicted under the terms of the unification treaty, the heirs threatened them with legal action, claiming they had not paid the rent, a charge they deny. 'We expected capitalism to be more social but it is awful for many of us,' Mr Wahner concluded. East German houses are frequently sold by the west German owners to other westerners who, in Kleinmachnow, will typically pay up to DM700,000 (Pounds 238,095) for a small house and are then faced with sitting tenants paying a rent-controlled DM300 a month. While the rent has doubled since last year, it is only one-seventh of that for a similar house in west Berlin. The westerners hope they can either eventually evict the tenants or raise the rent. 'The conflicts of interest are awful,' Mr Klaus Nitzsche, mayor of Kleinmachnow, said. 'New owners harass the tenants who regard their homes as social housing.' Mr Horst Abraham of the tenants' association in Kleinmachnow said the prospects for the Wahners and others will depend on whether the protection against eviction guaranteed by the unification treaty expires this year as planned. He warned that, if it is not extended, owners will issue wholesale notices of eviction saying they need the houses. East Germans forced to leave their homes will have little chance of finding affordable flats as virtually no new lower rental housing is being built. Houses which belonged to Jews forced to leave Nazi Germany after 1935 often have several conflicting claims on them. They were expropriated and usually sold to Nazis, then expropriated again in 1945 and resold, often several times, to people who later left east Germany. The heirs of the original Jewish owners have been told by the government they will eventually get the houses if they submit claims. But this can take years. People such as the Wahners were assigned their house by the state after the owner had left for the west. Although the owner retained title to the property, the house was taken over by a state trusteeship agency into whose special accounts, protected against withdrawals by the owner, the tenant paid his extremely low rent. East Germans had the right to buy the houses from the state. Those who did before October 18, 1989, the day Mr Erich Honecker, the east German leader, resigned, were deemed by the German government to have 'honestly' bought their homes and cannot be dispossessed by former owners in the west. The cut-off date was designed to stop former Communist officials and company directors, who had an inside track on obtaining state properties, from keeping the real estate they purchased after this date. But many an official villa was sold cheaply to influential east Germans after October 1989. Even those easterners who bought their houses before the cut-off have not been spared headaches. Their house purchases did not include title to the property on which the home stood, which under east German law remained state-owned. Many former western owners have submitted claims to get back these properties, if not the houses on them. Bonn is considering a solution whereby easterners will be able to keep their houses as hereditary tenants. But this is of little help to tenants of contested houses such as the Wahners who see themselves as the losers of history.</p>

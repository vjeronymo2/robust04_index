			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France To Sell off Nuclear Power </F> Group"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS Database]    [Text] The French Government have launched the process of  privatising FRAMATOME, the nuclear power station group.  FRAMATOME, which also has activities in computer services and  electronic components, is not on the list of 21 publicly-owned  groups which the centre-right Government has slated for  privatisation. It will be sold through a limited tender offer.  The likely candidates to take a controlling stake in the group  include ALCATEL-ALSTHOM, the engineering, transport and  communications group, which already holds 44 percent of the  shares. In 1990, ALCATEL-ALSTHOM briefly managed to acquire a  majority stake in FRAMATOME, raising its investment from 40  percent to 52 percent. FRAMATOME was formed in 1958 to design  and build light pressurised water reactors and nuclear  components. It has since diversified and expanded sales to more  than FF12 billion a year.    In 1992, the latest year for which figures are available, it  reported net profits of FF900 million.</p>

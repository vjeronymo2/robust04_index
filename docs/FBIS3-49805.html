			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] After a month's break,  Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic had a meeting  with Momcilo Krajisnik [president of the Bosnian Serb assembly]  at Sarajevo airport.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Mr Prime Minister, which  issues did you discuss today?    [Silajdzic] We discussed political issues, electricity and  gas supplies and prisoner exchanges.    [Correspondent] What did you agree to?    [Silajdzic] Let us begin with easier issues. Concerning  electricity supply, we agreed to repair the power line between  Sarajevo and Buca Potok. Repair teams have tried to go out to  do the repairs four times, but the Serb side did not allow them  to do anything. However, it was said this time that they would  allow it. We will see.    It is important for both sides to respect their mutual  interests [words indistinct]. Concerning the exchange of  prisoners, the big problem is that we are not sure that the  number of prisoners registered by the Red Cross is correct. We  think that there are prisoners [words indistinct]    Therefore, I think that a partial exchange of prisoners is  possible, which means that we will exchange as many prisoners as  possible, but that an exchange according to the all-for-all  principle -- according to Red Cross lists -- is not possible for  the time being because we think that this would not be an  all-for-all exchange. We believe that the Red Cross has not  registered all prisoners.    The gas supplies were interrupted yesterday. I hope that we  solved that problem too, and that this will not happen in the  future.    Concerning political issues, I must say that we met after a  long time, but there are no results, no changes. Our positions  have remained unchanged. We will meet in Geneva soon. I cannot  say whether any progress will be made there. Both sides want  peace, at least judging by statements. However, we do not want  the peace which is being offered to us, which is unacceptable.  I do not know whether any progress in that respect will be  made. I also must say that our side stressed the problem of  bombing the city [Sarajevo], and the actions taken despite  promises that they would not be taken in other parts of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, I must say that the other side  voiced the same complaints concerning the territories under  occupation. [passage indistinct] [end recording]</p>

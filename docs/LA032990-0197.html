			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP VOLLEYBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EDISON TOPPLES HUNTINGTON BEACH  </P> <P> After watching his boys' volleyball team upset top-ranked Huntington Beach  Wednesday night, Edison Coach Brian Rofer wasn't about to rate the Chargers as  Orange County's best.  </P> <P> "If we do wind up ranked No. 1 you won't find me reading about it," Rofer said.  "What does it mean? One day you're up and the next day you're a dog."  </P> <P> The third-ranked Chargers were up Wednesday, cruising to a 16-14, 15-8, 12-15,  15-9 victory in the Sunset League opener for both teams at Edison's gym.  </P> <P> Edison (4-1 overall, 1-0 in league) avenged its loss to Huntington Beach  earlier this month in the Dos Pueblos tournament final.  </P> <P> "Our outside hitting and our blocking had a lot to do with our win," Rofer  said.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli said Edison is the best team the Oilers  have played this season.  </P> <P> "We beat (second-ranked) Woodbridge and Edison beat us," Ciarelli said. "I  think Edison is probably No. 1."  </P> <P> Karl Van Reusen and Steve Snyder each had 17 kills for Edison. Snyder had four  kills, including three aces, in an 8-0 run to open the second game and added  six kills in the final game.  </P> <P> "Steve got a little dehydrated in the fourth game and I had to call a timeout,"  Rofer said. "I told him he had to pull a little harder and he did."  </P> <P> Steve Lucas had 16 kills and Doug Cunningham had 11 for Huntington Beach, the  defending league champion. The Oilers (4-1, 0-1) played without starting  outside hitter Matt Taylor, who is out with a hernia injury until Easter.  </P> <P> "We didn't get a particularly good match from Doug," Ciarelli said. "And when  we're missing Matt, that means a lot. Edison keyed a lot of blocks on Doug and  our other players didn't pick it up."  </P> <P> Edison's supporting cast included Joe McCarthy (10 kills, two ace serves),  Jason Curry (10 kills), Daryl Ayers (eight kills) and Aaron Boone (five kills).  </P> <P> "I told the kids before the game 'You're in the upper echelon now, with  Huntington Beach and Mira Costa,' " Rofer said. "I told them that I can't coach  that. They had to find it within themselves to play at that level."  </P> <P> On Wednesday night, they did.  </P> <P> In another Sunset League game:  </P> <P> Ocean View 3, Fountain Valley 0 -- Chris Hocker had 15 kills and Greg Evans had  12 kills to lead visiting Ocean View (6-3, 1-0) to a 15-10, 15-12, 15-12  victory.  </P> <P> In the Empire League:  </P> <P> El Dorado 3, Cypress 0 -- Jerome Facione had nine kills to lead host El Dorado  (3-2, 1-0) to a 15-2, 15-5, 15-6 victory.  </P> <P> Esperanza 3, Santa Ana 0 -- Jason Galeener had 12 kills and Rocky Jones had 10  for host Esperanza (9-0, 1-0) in a 15-12, 15-8, 15-5 sweep.  </P> <P> Foothill 3, Los Alamitos 0 -- Jeff Janis had 10 kills as host Foothill (5-1,  1-0) swept, 15-4, 15-7, 15-2.  </P> <P> In the Garden Grove League:  </P> <P> La Quinta 3, Santiago 0 -- Paul Price and Chris Doherty each had 11 kills as  host La Quinta (6-1, 5-0) swept, 15-7, 15-6, 15-6.  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos 3, Garden Grove 0 -- Richard Pierce had 15 kills and six blocks  to lead host Rancho Alamitos (5-6, 4-1) to a 16-14, 15-4, 15-7 victory. Garden  Grove is 3-2 in league.  </P> <P> In the Pacific Coast League:  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills 3, Costa Mesa 0 -- Greg Stone had 10 kills to lead Trabuco Hills  (6-5, 2-3) to a 15-3, 15-9, 15-9 victory at Costa Mesa (0-5 in league).  </P> <P> In nonleague:  </P> <P> Valencia 3, Whittier Christian 0 -- Jeff Rick had 12 kills to lead host  Valencia (7-5) to a 15-8, 15-10, 15-12 victory.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE URGENCY FACTOR FOR MIDDLE EAST PEACE  </P> <P> Absorbed by the demands of organizing a new Administration, George Bush may not  have noticed the dark cloud that blew in over the Middle East a few weeks ago,  begging some show of urgency of a President who has refused to be hurried.  </P> <P> The cloud blew in from Paris, where 150 nations met to consider proposals for  reducing the dangers of the apparent spread of chemical and, perhaps,  biological weapons.  </P> <P> To the surprise of the major powers, the meeting turned out to be a contest  between the haves and have-nots -- the measure in this case being the bomb. The  have-nots were a shade unhappy with rules proposed by the nuclear club: In  addition to closing its ranks to further members, it wanted no competing (and  much less exclusive) poison-gas club to be set up, either.  </P> <P> The issue takes on particular gravity as it applies to the Middle East. The  Arabs accept the premise -- as does most of the rest of the world -- that  Israel already possesses nuclear arms. The Israelis do not deny it. In  response, the Arabs have articulated the rather troublesome doctrine that they  are entitled to possess chemical weapons as a balance.  </P> <P> "It is unacceptable," said Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh in Paris,  "given continued Israeli occupation and the disequilibrium existing in our  region, to adopt selective concepts and methods aimed at disarmament concerning  only one kind of mass-destruction weapon without taking into account the need  of disarmament concerning other forms."  </P> <P> The problem in the Middle East, as we know from painful experience, is that the  people who issue deadly threats are probably not bluffing.  </P> <P> The Israelis have never enunciated a nuclear doctrine, but it is generally  assumed that if Israel were about to be overwhelmed in a war, they would draw  the Big One out of the arsenal. They have also shown that they have the  missiles to deliver it.  </P> <P> What the Arabs are saying now is that if Israel gives in to such a temptation,  they will come right back with a nasty dose of chemicals. The Iraqis  demonstrated during their war with Iran that they know how to use them.  </P> <P> The fact is, if a war were to start, a messy exchange between nukes and gas is  not a far-fetched scenario. And until a peace is reached, the prospect of  another war remains alive.  </P> <P> Within the State Department, there is a school of thought -- for which, I  suppose, we should thank Henry A. Kissinger, who founded it in the years before  the Yom Kippur War -- which holds that it makes sense to try for an  Arab-Israeli settlement only after the two sides have bloodied each other. An  argument could be made that the theory was validated after thousands died in  1973. But that was when wars between Arabs and Israelis were waged quickly and  on battlefields, not in cities where millions of noncombatants on both sides  are likely to die.  </P> <P> As long as these wars were contained, the superpowers could assist their  clients while themselves sitting back, growling at each other. What we do not  know is how Washington and Moscow would respond toeach other in a massive war,  which would spread poison as well as death. It is a good bet that the next one  will be massive, jeopardizing more than the Middle East.  </P> <P> Moreover, since young Palestinians hurled the first stones of the intifada more  than a year ago, the region has been transformed. Replacing the heavy despair  that pervaded the Palestinians for two decades is a heady sense of expectation,  fostered by the American decision last December to begin talks with the  Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> Many Israelis, too, have -- with a sigh of relief -- taken Washington's  decision to mean that it has at least chosen to shift its weight from the  status quo to promotion of a peace settlement. In the minds of most Middle  Easterners, the only question that remains is when Bush will drop the other  shoe. If he takes too long, inviting back despair, he risks expanding the  intifada into a full-scale war of terror. He also encourages Arab extremists,  particularly the dissidents within the PLO, to believe that their cause is not  lost. The consequences of both to achieving peace could be grievous.  </P> <P> The President must have a major peace initiative ready for Israel's prime  minister, Yitzak Shamir, when he arrives here for a visit next month. The  chance of an Arab-Israeli settlement has never been so promising, but if he  allows American involvement to drift, the prospect will be lost.  </P> <P> The Middle East cannot afford another war. Neither can the United States.  </P></p>

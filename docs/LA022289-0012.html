			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS LOSE AGAIN TO WASHINGTON, 123-109  </P> <P> Bernard King scored 33 points and Jeff Malone had 27 Tuesday night as the  Washington Bullets handed the Clippers' their sixth straight defeat, 123-109.  </P> <P> The loss was the Clippers' 25th in their last 26 games. They have now lost 35  straight in Eastern Conference cities.  </P> <P> The victory was the second straight for the Bullets, who defeated the Clippers  at Los Angeles Saturday night.  </P> <P> The Clippers, who have not won at the Capital Centre since December 1979, led  by as many as 11 points in the first half. But after the Clippers opened a  44-33 lead early in the second quarter, the Bullets put together a 20-8 run to  go in front, 53-52, as Jeff Malone, Steve Colter and Harvey Grant each scored  six points. The game was tied at 66 at the half.  </P> <P> The Bullets took an 87-76 lead with 5:40 left in the third period, and were in  front, 98-87, going into the final quarter. King and Malone scored the first 16  Washington points in the second half.  </P> <P> The Clippers, who got no closer than eight points in the final period, were led  by Ken Norman's 24 points and 13 rebounds. Benoit Benjamin had 21 points,  Reggie Williams 15 and Gary Grant 14.  </P> <P> John Williams added 20 points for the Bullets.  </P> <P> "We lost our composure and intensity," Williams said. "They had too many open  shots."  </P> <P> The Bullets shot 57.3% from the field, led by Malone's 11 for 13. The only shot  Malone missed in the first half was a heave from halfcourt at the buzzer.  </P> <P> "I wanted to come back out and fire it up," said Malone, who caught an elbow in  the mouth early in the first quarter and had to go to the locker room for  examination. "I was able to get my shots where I wanted them tonight."  </P> <P> The Bullets shot well all night, but the Clippers cooled off quickly after  shooting 67% in the first half and made only 30 of 70 the rest of the way.  </P> <P> "They did a pretty good job of getting the shots they wanted in the first half,  but we picked up the defense in the second half," King said.  </P> <P> "The offense was clicking all night, but we weren't doing anything on defense.  In the second half, we put some pressure on defensively and took over the  ballgame," Malone said.  </P> <P> "I think we're not a fourth-quarter team, said Clipper Coach Don Casey. "Our  shooting was great in the first half, but the defense dropped off in the second  half.  </P> <P> Malone and King "were the difference," Casey said. "We didn't defense them as  well tonight as we did in L.A. Their experience was the difference tonight."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of various classes of shares representing interests in the same Fund might be deemed: (a) To result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g); (b) prohibited by section 18(f)(1); and (c) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement will better enable the Funds to meet the competitive demands of today's financial services industry. Under the multi-class arrangement, an investor will be able to choose the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment risks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants further believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the Plans in the manner described in the application is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. In addition, such arrangements should not give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges of each class of shares are substantially identical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants submit that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present any concerns that section 18 was designed to ameliorate. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowings, does not affect a Fund's existing assets or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure. The multi-class arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the Funds. No class of shares will have preference or priority over any other class of shares in a Fund with respect to particular assets, and no class of shares will be protected by any reserve or other account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Applicants submit that the requested exemption to permit the Funds to implement the proposed CDSC is appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. The proposed CDSC arrangements will provide shareholders the option of having greater investment dollars working for them from the time of their purchase than if a sales load had been imposed at such time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of the Fund; (b) expenses assessed to a class as a result of a Plan providing for Plan Fees; (c) different expenses which the board of directors of a Fund may in the future determine to allocate to a specific class, which will be limited to: (i) Transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (d) voting rights on matters exclusively affecting one class of shares ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the adoption, amendment, or termination of a Plan) in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1, except as provided in condition 15 below; (e) the different exchange privileges of the various classes of shares as described in the prospectuses (and as more fully described in the statements of additional information) of the Funds; and (f) classes that impose a Plan Fee may convert to another Class. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The directors of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, shall have approved the multi-class distribution system prior to the implementation thereof by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the directors of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the multi-class distribution system will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed multi-class distribution system is in the best interest of both the Fund and its shareholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The initial determination of the class expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of the affected Fund, including a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures were made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

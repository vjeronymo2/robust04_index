			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Fashion: Couture - the very best of British - In spite of the recession, UK fashion houses are reporting brisk business THE Duchess of Windsor once remarked to Sir Hardy Amies that 'there is no point going to a great designer unless he has a brilliant fitter'. She well understood the investment of time and money and the personal interaction that both customer and design house makes in each made-to-measure couture outfit. Ken Fleetwood, Sir Hardy's design director, says: 'The great luxury of couture is time - for us to make it and for the client to have it properly fitted.' But in an era of instant everything and recession, who, one might ask, has that time, let alone the money and the inclination? With the venerable house of Hartnell now in administrative receivership and the spectacular French couture collections recognised as mainly a publicity exercise to sell perfumes and lipsticks, the omens are bad. But in Britain a nucleus of old-style couturiers includes, apart from those mentioned here, Catherine Walker, David Sassoon, Franka and Tomasz Starzewski. Their business is to sell the designs they create and they are doing better than expected, perhaps because they advance a cogent argument for value for money. The bottom line is now from around Pounds 3,000 for a suit and Pounds 4,000 for an evening dress. But compare that with the Pounds 10,000 Paris minimum and the Pounds 1,600 you now pay for a top designer off-the-peg suit - and moreover, at these prices you enter a world where there is no such thing as stock sizes (a 'wholesaler's convenience', Fleetwood calls them), where up to three fittings will ensure your garment is perfectly moulded and properly structured, where the designer will personally oversee the initial concept and probably at least one fitting, and where that concept may be only the starting point of your fashion fantasy. As Fleetwood says: 'In couture, anything is possible. That is why I enjoy working with mature, assured women who know who they are and what they want. We develop my suggestions together.' Alternatively, you may rely totally on the designer's talent. Anouska Hempel, aka Lady Weinberg, wife of industrialist Sir Mark, is the ultimate perfectionist who produces the most precise cut and finest finish in London. 'I know exactly which skirt length is right for each client,' she says. 'At present, my line is long but I will do short if the client really wants it. I alter all the proportions so the whole effect is right.' But to supply such dreams at a realistic price, overheads must be kept down. 'We can't make money out of couture but we're happy to break even,' says Fleetwood. Amies is the only UK house run on vaguely French lines, with its grand headquarters in Savile Row funded by menswear and accessories licensed worldwide. The couture remains essential as a prestige headline-maker, and still has 2000 'in touch' customers, including the Queen, though not all buy every season. Hartnell, without such a licensing network, was trying to do the impossible in keeping a gracious Mayfair house and a top former Paris designer, used to an expensive lifestyle, only on couture sales. Its ready-to-wear label has long since been sold off to a licensee. Smaller couture firms work from less glamorous locations and run a very tight operation. Victor Edelstein, who has been in couture for ten years, works from a mews in Kensington, London. He has about 100 regular clients in the UK, including the Princess of Wales, another 40 in the US, and finds his dinner dresses most popular. 'The overriding factor is labour costs,' he says. 'Fabric may be up to Pounds 100 a metre but it is irrelevant compared with the overall cost of top fitters, seamstresses and tailors.' There is no shortage of good craftspeople - Edelstein has already received calls from members of Hartnell's workroom - but they expect, and get, top wages. As Lady Weinberg says: 'The team is the heart of the workroom - good people who work well together.' Her team includes the wife of a Spanish matador who does rich-textured embroidery, yet the final effect of her designs is invariably understated, however dramatic the shape. Despite 800 'irregular' clients, she observes that 'couture won't make you a fortune'. This is not surprising when a show costs, says Edelstein, at least Pounds 20,000 a time and far more if you want top models. For Edelstein, the show, and selling trips to New York (the last netted 41 orders), are essential to maintain the glamorous image. Fleetwood agrees that 'seeing the clothes on beautiful young models is part of the client's fantasy, even if she only orders a plain little silk dress'. To get the best from this fantasy, a client needs to be organised. With an average wait of six to eight weeks for delivery, she will order after the shows in January or July and slot fittings into her international schedule. Edelstein says there are two types of order: 'The seasonal wardrobe of several outfits round which everything else is planned, and the one-off for a special event.' Either is built to last. 'We find ourselves remodelling ten-year-old suits,' says Edelstein, 'and the dodge with evening dresses is to have several and alternate the years when you wear them. Memories are very short.' Lady Weinberg describes her designs as 'classic, with a touch of the avant-garde. The quality lasts and simplicity can be dressed up or down. Accessories are what makes them topical'. As Fleetwood says: 'Something you can only wear once is a bad dress.' Even in this rarified world, time is getting shorter. 'Some women hate fittings,' says Edelstein. 'Doing the hem on a big evening dress is slow and tiring for the client. Some regular customers now expect only one fitting.' Fleetwood says he now produces a more finished-looking outfit, even for the first fitting, 'because everyone is now so used to ready-to-wear they are less able to judge a garment in the early stages'. Bruce Oldfield, who calls his collection custom-made rather than couture, finds women prefer fewer fittings and often want an outfit far quicker than the usual wait. 'We specialise in quick turnarounds,' he says. His system is different from most in that the sample collection hangs, with prices writ large, in his Knightsbridge, London, shop for anyone's perusal. Potential clients then arrange an appointment with him. Best sellers are interchangeable evening separates that are relatively reasonable, from about Pounds 1,400. Oldfield has experienced his bad times. Two years ago, the British backers making his middle-price diffusion range pulled the plug. 'That range could not survive in a crowded market without substantial promotion for which there was no finance,' he says. Now he is back to what he does best - special orders for 180 customers from pop singer Betty Boo to Viscountess Astor, 'a lot from north of Watford' and a foreign contingent mainly from America and the Middle East. He is totally in control, has doubled his turnover in a year and aims to be self-funding next year. His charm takes him to the smart events that give him a glamorous lifestyle without draining resources. His way points to a viable future for British couture. It is a pity that such methods could not have been adopted by Hartnell.</p>

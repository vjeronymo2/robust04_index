			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Strong advertising boosts TVB - Hong Kong Results TELEVISION Broadcasts (TVB), Hong Kong's leading television company, yesterday announced a 46 per cent jump in net profits to HKDollars 365.6m (USDollars 47m) for 1992, up from HKDollars 249.7m the year before. The results were ahead of expectations and reflected strong demand for advertising airtime, due to the buoyant local economy. The outlook remains positive as the government has lifted restrictions on advertising property and financial services, and is also reducing the company's royalty payments for its franchise. However, TVB is facing increasing competition from Star TV, a regional satellite broadcaster, and from a cable TV network which is due to be launched in Hong Kong by the end of 1993. TVB's full-year profits were made on turnover of HKDollars 1.82bn, up from HKDollars 1.55bn in 1991. Profit margins have improved, due to a rationalisation of the company's cost base and improved production efficiency. Companies controlled by Sir Run Run Shaw own 35 per cent of TVB, and an equal stake is owned by Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok. TVB recommended a final dividend of 47.5 cents a share for 1992, up from 40 cents in 1991.</p>

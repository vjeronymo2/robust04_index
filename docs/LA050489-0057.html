			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARHOL'S 'MARILYN MONROE' FETCHES RECORD $4 MILLION  </P> <P> Like a wave in the high seas of a rising art market, an international crowd of  contemporary art aficionados left Sotheby's in its wake and rolled on to  Christie's Wednesday night to witness the opening of the second half of a  series of big-ticket auctions.  </P> <P> The crowd of about 1,200 was rewarded with a few moments of high drama when  "Shot Red Marilyn," a vibrantly colored painting of Marilyn Monroe by Andy  Warhol, brought $4 million from Kazuo Fujii, a Tokyo dealer. The quintessential  Pop painting, from the collection of Los Angeles philanthropist Max Palevsky,  was valued at $1.5 million to $2.5 million, but bidding soon soared past that  figure. A few seconds later, the final bid passed the artist's record of $3.96  million set last November. Applause burst out as Christopher Burge, Christie's  president and auctioneer, brought down the gavel.  </P> <P> "I wasn't surprised. There was tremendous interest in the Warhol, but I just  wanted it to set a record and it did," said Martha Baer, head of the auction  house's contemporary art department.  </P> <P> The 1964 painting bears an oft-repeated image in Warhol's work, but it has the  distinction of being one of four "Shot" canvases, named for a shooting incident  in the late artist's studio. "Shot Red Marilyn" was actually shot -- right  between the eyes -- and repaired later. The canvas was in the collection of  artist Robert Rauschenberg before Palevsky bought it at the Leo Castelli  Gallery in Manhattan.  </P> <P> Another high point in the evening occured when Jasper Johns' tiny  (12-inch-by-10 1/2-inch) canvas, called "Colored Alphabet," brought $3.5  million from an unidentified European dealer. Burge almost knocked down the  painting at around $2 million, but suddenly a cry rang out from the back of the  crowded sale room indicating that another bidder had entered the competition.  When the sale was complete, a man in the audience whipped out his pocket  calculator and announced that the painting cost more than $25,000 per square  inch.  </P> <P> Despite such excitement, Wednesday night's numbers were not as big as  Tuesday's. Christie's sold 60 artworks for a total of $31.76 million. That  figure was well above the most optimistic estimate of $28.8 million but far  less than Sotheby's record-setting $78.6-million sale of 103 items the previous  evening. But most pieces offered at Christie's met or exceeded their estimates  -- 15 of them setting records -- and only six lots failed to sell.  </P> <P> Together, the two sales indicate the continuing strength of the contemporary  art market, a riskier territory than older periods of art that have been  securely established in history. While auction watchers often gasp at sharply  escalating contemporary art prices, auction house experts insist that the  market is behaving in a controlled manner.  </P> <P> "It's not berserk. It's just very, very strong," Berge said.  </P> <P> One area of strength was seen Wednesday night in works by Abstract  Expressionist Franz Kline, which twice broke his record of $2.3 million. No  sooner did Kline's "August Day" sell for $2.75 million than "Scudera," said to  be his last complete painting, brought $2.86 million from New York dealer Allan  Stone.  </P> <P> A Jackson Pollock triptych from the Los Angeles collection of Stanley K. and  Betty W. Sheinbaum, valued at $1.5 million to $2.5 million, sold for $2.2  million to an anonymous American dealer.  </P> <P> Roy Lichtenstein's playful 1972 painting, "Things on the Wall," fetched its  predicted price of $1 million from an unidentified American collector.  </P> <P> Among the 15 records, three were claimed by well established women and all  three sales roughly doubled estimates. Helen Frankenthaler's 1973 stained  canvas, "Cravat," valued at $80,000 to $120,000, brought $220,000. Agnes  Martin's pale striped painting, "Untitled 5," fetched $264,000 instead of the  predicted price of $100,000 to $150,000. "King of Spades" by Joan Mitchell, an  energetic abstraction valued at $180,000 to $250,000, commanded a price of  $462,000.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, the second part of Sotheby's contemporary art auction  brought $19 million for 323 artworks, bringing the total for Sotheby's entire  sale to $98.3 million.  </P> <P> Christie's contemporary art sale continues today when 350 paintings, sculptures  and drawings, valued at $6 million to $8 million, go under the gavel.  </P> <P> Next week a new wave of art collector and dealers will roll into Manhattan for  sales of Impressionist and modern art expected to total as much as $422  million. Sotheby's will begin the new round of sales on Tuesday night and the  following day. Christie's will take over on Wednesday evening and Thursday.  </P></p>

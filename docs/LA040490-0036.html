			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2ND MCMARTIN TRIAL TO BEGIN NEXT WEEK  </P> <P> The second trial of McMartin Pre-School molestation defendant Ray Buckey will  begin next week as planned, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg  announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> Buckey, who was acquitted of 40 charges of child molestation last January,  still faces eight counts of sexually abusing three girls who attended his  family's Manhattan Beach school.  </P> <P> The judge had postponed the start of jury selection for two weeks, until  Monday, because Buckey's lawyer, Danny Davis, was suffering back problems.  Davis had asked for a continuance of several months to undergo surgery, but a  second expert who examined him at the court's request said that rest, physical  therapy and a mild pain-killer probably would be sufficient.  </P> <P> The trial is expected to last six months.  </P></p>

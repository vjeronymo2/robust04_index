			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: PICTURE THE SUMMIT AS A TV TALK FEST;  </P> <P> MEDIA: CNN AND THE NETWORKS VALUABLY CONCENTRATE ON THE SOVIETS. BUT VIEWS VARY  WITH THE ANCHOR AND THE EXPERT.  </P> <P> Forget about the Simpsons and break out the new T-shirts. It's Mr. and Mrs.  Gorby, dude.  </P> <P> Yes, Friday morning's diverting appearance of First Ladies Barbara Bush and  Raisa Gorbachev at Wellesley College -- covered live by CNN and the Big 3  networks -- was not only great fun, but also a tribute to Barbara Bush's  ability to spin success from controversy. And what about those earlier TV  pictures from the Bush-Gorbachev summit?  </P> <P> Click.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Raisa touch down Wednesday at Andrews  Air Force Base.  </P> <P> Click.  </P> <P> President Bush and Gorbachev give their opening speeches Thursday at the White  House.  </P> <P> Click.  </P> <P> Gorbachev addresses luncheon guests at the Soviet Embassy.  </P> <P> Click.  </P> <P> Raisa is a guest at the Library of Congress.  </P> <P> Click.  </P> <P> Outside the White House, Gorbachev gives an impromptu press conference after  his first meeting with Bush.  </P> <P> Click.  </P> <P> In an unscheduled handshaking tour, Gorbachev springs from his limo and  disappears into a throng of Washingtonians. "Now he's working both sides of  15th Street," reports CNN's Bernard Shaw.  </P> <P> Click.  </P> <P> Bush and Gorbachev toast each other at a White House banquet.  </P> <P> Click.  </P> <P> Gorbachev addresses -- at times even lectures and debates with -- congressional  leaders at breakfast Friday in the Soviet Embassy.  </P> <P> All very nice, sometimes even fascinating. What makes television coverage of  the summit so compelling is not the pictures, however. It's the talk.  </P> <P> Not so much the talk of Bush and Gorbachev, but the talk of those watching  them.  </P> <P> Accompanying this gathering of world leaders is an even larger TV gathering of  professional Soviet watchers. It's as if some Eastern universities and think  tanks gave their specialists time off this week to appear on TV. From CBS to  C-SPAN, they fill the screen.  </P> <P> As usual on Soviet-related topics, CBS gives you Stephen Cohen of Princeton  while ABC offers Robert Legvold of Columbia, as well as Marshall Goldman of  Harvard and journalist Hedrick Smith. NBC has the oft-seen Soviet foreign  ministry official Vitaly Churkin and William Hyland,editor of Foreign Affairs.  And there are others.  </P> <P> At no other time than summits does TV offer such a concentrated discussion of  the Soviet Union, and it's all wonderfully entertaining. It's also important,  for this intense focusing -- as CNN and, to a lesser extent, the other networks  weave through the summit -- is invaluable in centering our attention on crucial  issues.  </P> <P> When watching the summit coverage, however, channel hopping is the best course.  </P> <P> That's because there has been no consensus here, and what strikes you most  about the experts -- as well as the media covering this event -- is that they  disagree frequently:  </P> <P> Gorbachev is politically strong at home; he's weak at home. He's about to be  toppled; he'll survive indefinitely. Boris Yeltsen will supplant Gorbachev;  Yeltsen is more bark than bite. Gorbachev needs to look good with Bush to  impress the people at home; the average Soviet at home doesn't give a hoot  about the summit. Gorbachev is pretending to deal from strength; Gorbachev is  feigning weakness to gain concessions from an American President who wants to  keep him in power.  </P> <P> Even on small things, there are clashing observations. When Gorbachev went on  his handshaking tour Thursday, CNN's Bernard Shaw found it ironic that the  Soviet leader could go out among the people in the United States, where his  popularity is high, but not in his own nation, where his popularity is low.  </P> <P> When ABC's "World News Tonight" covered the same story, however, Peter Jennings  said that Gorbachev does go out among the people at home.  </P> <P> Among other things, the summit coverage has exposed the meaninglessness of  political labels. The talk on TV has been that Gorbachev is less liberal than  Yeltsen, who has called for faster democratic reforms, and less conservative  than Kremlin hard-liners, who seek a return to old repressive ways.  </P> <P> In other other words, proponents of democracy in the Soviet Union are  left-wingers and Marxists are right-wingers. Get it? Conservatives are pinko  and liberals are reactionary. And the President of the Soviet Union is somehow  a centrist. Or something like that.  </P> <P> We need experts to interpret speeches, right? Gorbachev's opening address  contained a reference to the suffering of the Soviet people during World War  II. On ABC, Goldman interpreted this as Gorbachev justifying Soviet fears of a  more-powerful united Germany facing the Soviet Union as a member of NATO.  </P> <P> Probably so. Yet why didn't Gorbachev just come out and say it? In fact, why do  world leaders and diplomats speak an obtuse language that has to be dissected  under a microscope, leaving open the possibility of misinterpretation?  </P> <P> Things that pass unnoticed: One was Soviet  journalist/reporter/you-pick-the-label Vladimir Pozner saying on CNN's  "Crossfire" that he recently prepared a story on Yeltsen but "Soviet television  wouldn't put it on." Another was Bush and Gorbachev, who supposedly are meeting  to make the world a safer place, getting a traditional salute -- from cannon.  </P> <P> The summit has not been without humor. From Johnny Carson on NBC, about his  audience waiting in line to attend "The Tonight Show": "If you stood in line  that long in the Soviet Union, you could have gotten a potato." From Dan Rather  on CBS: "It's been said about Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, he could talk a  dog off a meat wagon."  </P> <P> After Wellesley, Barbara Bush could too.  </P></p>

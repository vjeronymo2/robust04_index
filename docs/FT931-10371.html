			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / China signs accounting standards contract THE international accounting network, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (DTT), has won a Dollars 2.6m (Pounds 1.7m) contract to develop accounting standards for China. The award has been signed with the Chinese Ministry of Finance, and is designed to bring accounting and auditing practices 'into harmony with international standards' over the next three years. DTT consultants will work with a Chinese team to develop general and industry-specific standards, and to establish a system of continuing education for the country's 10,000 certified public accountants. Mr Ted Lee, managing director of the firm in China, said that existing standards in the country were suitable for a centrally-planned economy with limited decision-making by individuals or enterprises. He stressed that the new standards would help provide transparency in financial information, but would also reflect the unique characteristics of business in China. The contract has been funded through a World Bank credit to China, and is part of the Bank's financial sector technical assistance project. Ms Heather Skilling, from DTT's office in Washington, said the firm would be devising a work-plan over the next few months, but expected to develop up to 30 general accounting standards. She said the aim was to bring them in line as far as possible with the standards published by the International Accounting Standards Committee.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: Strategy Salomon Brothers has forecast that Asian stock indices will rise by a average of 20 per cent next year, agencies report. Salomon said that while trading condition in 1995 were likely to be difficult, following depressed activity throughout this year, higher index levels were still likely. Growth in earnings per share should be strong, but lower than in 1994, with valuations remaining near the upper end of historical ranges. The liquidity outlook was not as favourable, with fund inflows more modest than in 1994, Salomon said. Salomon added that it expected volatile market movements in the near term, an early rally in the new year triggered by the next rise in US rates and a steady bond market. There would be stronger and more sustained gains as confidence returned once US rates reached their peak. Edited by John Pitt.

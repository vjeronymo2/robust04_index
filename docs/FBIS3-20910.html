			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by EU [European Union] correspondent in Brussels </F> Philippe Lemaitre: "Aid to State-Owned Companies: Brussels Puts  Pressure on France to Disclose Bull's Recovery Program"--first  paragraph is LE MONDE introduction]    [Text] Through its commissioner to competition, Karel Van  Miert, the European Commission expressed its impatience at the  French government's apparent reluctance to disclose Bull's and  Air France's recovery programs.    Bull, Air France: the French government is paying  considerable sums to these state-owned companies without  submitting to the European Commission the recovery programs it  is preparing. Before giving its green light, the EC must  evaluate whether the efforts undertaken are likely to restore  the viability of the troubled groups. Karel Van Miert, the  commissioner in charge of competition, is losing patience at the  French government's procrastination, especially in Bull's case.    "We have reached a completely illegal situation," he told LE  MONDE. "The French government has been promising us a  restructuring plan for months, but nothing is coming and there  are complaints from competing manufacturers in other Community  countries. This puts the Commission in an impossible position.  The Commission cannot approve any more payments, or it will have  to refer the case to the European Court."  <H5>  Unpleasant Surprise </H5>   The commissioner noted that the French are quick to protest  when they find that Brussels is not diligent enough in going  after abusive state subsidies: Francis Mer, the Usinor-Sacilor  CEO [chief executive officer], recently regretted that the  Commission does not impose a more severe rationalization of  state-owned steelmakers in Italy, Spain, and the East German  provinces. It was also at France's and the United Kingdom's  request that the Commission demanded--and obtained--that the  Austrian government recover two-thirds of the subsidies granted  to Grundig to build a plant in Austria. "The Commission must be  able to act consistently," he said.    Mr. Van Miert recalled the episodes of the Bull serial: 4  billion francs [Fr] in 1992, which the French government  presented as a capital increase but which the Commission  actually viewed as state subsidies; Fr2.5 billion in February  1993, paid by the State and France Telecom. In October, after  many contacts with the French government, the Commission started  the procedure on state subsidies contained in the treaty. The  plan promised by Mr. Longuet before the summer holidays, then  after the summer, was not disclosed. The Brussels departments  were given "broad orientations"!    In December, the Commission was unpleasantly surprised to  learn that a new Fr4 billion instalment was granted to Bull. "In  addition, new payments are scheduled for this year, so that  total subsidies might reach Fr15 billion, i.e. Fr1,000 per  taxpaying household!," Mr. Van Miert worries; he is obviously  determined to prevent France from allowing itself to follow that  course.    Abel Matutes, the transportation commissioner, is in charge  of the Air France case, but Mr. Van Miert observed that, in this  case too, the French government is doing exactly as it likes.  The State already paid Fr1.5 billion and intends to grant a  total of Fr6 billion to Fr7 billion. However, under pressure  from strikers, the restructuring plan devised by Bernard Attali,  the former Air France CEO, was abandoned. What will his  successor, Christian Blanc's plan be like? Will it be convincing  enough for the Commission to approve the injection of the  billions required to save the national airline? Mr. Van Miert  seems skeptical, noting in passing that Lufthansa, the German  company, eliminated 7,000 jobs but is about to restore its  financial balance. Without state subsidies.</p>

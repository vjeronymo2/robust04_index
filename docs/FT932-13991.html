			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Environmental Achievement 1993: Filter-tipped cars - Johnson Matthey JOHNSON MATTHEY, the world's largest manufacturer of autocatalysts to remove pollution from car exhausts, has won two awards: for exports and environmental achievement, writes Clive Cookson. The company used its background in precious metals to develop catalytic converters in the early 1970s, in anticipation of legislation in the US and Japan to limit exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These gases are important contributors to acid rain and photochemical smog and they exacerbate health problems, especially respiratory disorders. Autocatalysts contain a cylindrical honeycomb coated with precious metals (typically platinum and rhodium) which convert the pollutants, by means of chemical reactions on the metal surface, to a relatively harmless mixture of carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen. Johnson Matthey won a Queen's Award for Technological Achievement in 1977 for its autocatalyst research and development. Since then researchers at the Johnson Matthey Technology Centre near Reading, Berkshire, have considerably improved catalytic performance, so that today's autocatalysts typically reduce harmful exhaust emissions by 90 per cent. The company has steadily geared up its marketing and manufacturing operations since the 1970s, to build on its technological expertise and the sales opportunities presented by the ever-tightening pollution controls around the world. Since January 1993, autocatalysts have had to be fitted to all petrol-engined cars manufactured in the EC. Johnson Matthey now makes 20m autocatalysts a year at five factories: Royston in the UK (world headquarters of the catalytic systems division); Brussels in Belgium; Pennsylvania in the US; Sydney in Australia; and Johannesburg in South Africa. The company says it has about one third of the world market - ahead of Engelhard, the US precious metals company which is its closest competitor. Last year Johnson Matthey's worldwide sales of catalytic systems amounted to about Pounds 210m. Although Johnson Matthey sells autocatalysts to Japanese car manufacturers for their plants outside Japan and for export production, it has not really succeeded in penetrating the Japanese domestic market, which is supplied by local catalyst companies. 'In an effort to work more closely with the Japanese manufacturers, we're opening a technical centre in Japan for the first time next October,' says Mr Rob Searles, market development director of Johnson Matthey Catalytic Systems. Many further improvements in catalyst technology are in prospect. One is simply durability. US regulations will soon require autocatalysts to have a proven lifetime of 100,000 miles rather than the 50,000 miles required today. Another big research effort is to make catalysts that will work more quickly when the car starts from cold. Johnson Matthey has developed prototype autocatalysts incorporating an electric heater which enables them to operate efficiently within a few seconds. Johnson Matthey expects catalysts for diesel exhaust to be a further growth area. An increasing number of diesel cars are fitted with autocatalysts in Europe although they are not required by EC regulations, 'because manufacturers have decided they are a good part of their environmental marketing package,' says Mr Searles. 'They are now spreading to larger diesel vehicles including buses.'</p>

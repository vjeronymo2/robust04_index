			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Government urged to look at ACT issue CORPORATE lobbyists are again pressing the government to find at least a partial solution to the problem of surplus advance corporation tax before the Budget this spring. They hope that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will go further than last year's budget speech when he merely promised to look at the issue. Since then no changes have been made. In aggregate, companies are estimated to be paying Pounds 500m a year too much in tax because their mainstream corporation tax bill is too low to offset fully the ACT paid on their dividends. However, the government is expected to be reluctant to agree to any solution that would reduce revenues given the size of the budget deficit. The ACT issue is regarded by many as a structural rather than a cyclical problem as UK companies expand abroad and earn a higher proportion of profits internationally. UK companies argue that they are increasingly at a disadvantage to rivals based elsewhere, as the ACT system effectively penalises companies which pay dividends out of non-UK profits. One British finance director said: 'If the government wants industry to have a level playing field against international companies then it would be a great help to have some relief from ACT.' There is a fear that companies, whose earnings are depressed because of high tax charges caused by unrelieved ACT, will find it more expensive to raise new equity capital needed to finance expansion. Another concern is that ACT deters international holding companies from setting up in the UK. Details, Page 21</p>

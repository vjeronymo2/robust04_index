In a statement  commenting on the incident, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said:  Egypt affirms the need to confront the extremism that has hit  numerous societies of different religions, politics, and  traditions.    The foreign minister said that the incident confirms the  importance of preserving Palestinian security and not just  Israeli security. Therefore, calls for security are not  restricted to Israel alone. He said that in light of the  dangerous nature of and the signs given by the incident, Egypt  will take part in any meetings the Security Council decides to  hold in response to a request from Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat.    The foreign minister said the incident affirms the  importance  of the subject of Jerusalem and the need to put it on the agenda  of the negotiations. The fate of Jerusalem cannot be abandoned  to the behavior of extremists, criminals, or mad men.    Elsewhere, the PLO blamed the Israeli Government for the  massacre committed by a Jewish settler against Palestinian  citizens praying at the Hebron mosque this morning. The death  toll from the massacre has risen to 45 martyrs, while four  Palestinians were killed by the bullets of the Israeli  occupation Army in Hebron during the violent clashes that  erupted after the massacre.</p>

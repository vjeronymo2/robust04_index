			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["South Side Must Show Positive Response Without Delay" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The South Korean Red  Cross must show an affirmative response without delay to our  just demand for an immediate repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham  Se-hwan, prisoners of war, says a MINJU CHOSON analyst today.    Recalling that the acting chairman of the Central Committee  of the DPRK Red Cross society sent a letter to the president of  the South Korean Red Cross on April 19 once again urging an  immediate repatriation of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan,  unconverted long-term prisoners now in detention in South Korea,  the news analyst says:    Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan were taken prisoners by the South  side during the Korean war. They, therefore, should have been  treated as pows under provisions of the Geneva conventions  adopted on August 12, 1949, and repatriated to the northern half  of the country at the time of the exchange of POWs right after  the ceasefire.    As far as their "acceptance of citizenship" is concerned, it  was against their will. They had no other choice but to do so  for the sake of their existence since the South Korean puppet  regime detained them, not returning them. They still do not  want to live in South Korea, and they themselves have already  requested the international committee of the Red Cross to help  them return to the North. Their families and relatives in the  northern half of the country are waiting on tiptoe for their  return.    The misfortunes of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan must no  more be prolonged, and their repatriation must be realized  without delay and unconditionally.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Poor results punished as bourses take profits PROFIT-taking was the theme of the day, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT extended Tuesday's post-bourse fall as the DAX index dropped 26.31, or 1.4 per cent to 1,918.58. Turnover fell from DM11bn to DM8.5n. Company results were punished again as Linde, the engineer, fell DM31, or 3.7 per cent to DM810 after Tuesday's interim report and Linotype, the printing machinery maker, dropped another DM16 to DM358, down DM52 since Monday's half year loss. Profit-taking hit most shares. Daimler, down DM15.50 at DM739.50 was said to be additionally unsettled following news that its car making subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz, was currently showing an internal operating loss. Meanwhile the electricals leader, Siemens, attracted high trading volume and a large buy order which pushed it up by DM5.50 to DM677.50 early in the day, compared with its previous post-bourse close. But the rise did not stick, and the shares closed DM4.50 lower on the official session, still relatively strong, at DM672.50. PARIS, beginning to grow a little impatient at the absence of a cut in domestic interest rates, retreated 1 per cent as the CAC-40 index closed off 24.56 at 2,191.93. Turnover dropped from FFr4.7bn to FFr3.2bn. While profit-taking was much in evidence, a 2.3 per cent fall in Elf Aquitaine, which has a heavy weighting in the index, also depressed investor confidence. The oil group's shares slipped FFr10.20 to FFr435.70 following Tuesday's disappointing first half figures. Club Mediterranee, the holiday group, attracted strong selling after warning of second half losses, although some analysts remarked that there was an element of over-reaction to the news, given the known difficulties currently being experienced in the European leisure sector. The shares ended FFr31, or 7 per cent lower at FFr405.10. LVMH and Schneider went against the trend with respective gains of FFr16 and FFr10 to FFr4,340 and FFr799, the first on rumours of a possible restructuring and the latter on possible index reweighting. ZURICH gave a positive reception to flat half-year profits at Ciba-Geigy, although analysts were not exactly impressed. The certificates rose SFr6 to SFr704 although the SMI index was 19.8 down at 2,470.4 with Roche certificates, the most active stock of the day, down SFr65 at SFr5,095. Ascom, the telecoms equipment maker, continued to fall following Monday's first-half-loss, ending SFr60 down at SFr1,070 for a drop of 19 per cent on the week so far. AMSTERDAM retreated in line with the trend elsewhere on the continent, the CBS Tendency index closing 1.3, or almost 1 per cent down at 130.1. Food and drink defied the falling market, with Heineken picking up 10 cents to Fl 187.60, Bols Wessanen 40 cents to Fl 44.30 and CSM Fl 1.80 to FL 64.00. However, among the internationals, Unilever shed Fl 1.50 to Fl 202.40. MARDID was as volatile on the downgrade as it was on the way up, the general index dropping 8.03, or 2.6 per cent to 295.09. Turnover stayed high at around Pta32bn. Profit-taking was heavier than expected and hit banks and construction shares most severely, Argentaria losing Pta300 to Pta5,900 and Uralita Pta 90, or more than 8 per cent to Pta1,000. MILAN's foreign investors, in particular, decided that the time had come to sell. The Comit index closed down 6.17 at 625.67: since the market's current rally began in the middle of June the index has gained 23 per cent. Brokers noted that the fall appeared to have been triggered by heavy selling of Fiat stock late in the session, as the shares closed off L271 at L6,972. Ferruzzi picked up L18.90 to L280 following Tuesday's approval by shareholders of its capital restructuring plans. STOCKHOLM offered a savage response to steep first half losses, a rights issue and the planned disposal of a materials handling stake at Trelleborg, the metals and industrial group, whose B shares fell by SKr5, or 8.5 per cent to SKr53.50 as the Affarsvarlden General index dropped 19.30 to 1,262.10. Turnover was high at Skr1.30bn. The bank and insurance sector index fell a sharp 4.3 per cent on worries over the possibility of continued weakness in the Swedish crown, which could dash hopes of interest rate cuts. Handelsbanken A lost SKr8 at SKr125. ISTANBUL ended a 12-day sequence of consecutive gains, the composite index closing down 185.3 at 12,171.7 in turnover of TL1,100bn. TEL AVIV rallied on peace hopes for the third day in succession, the blue chip index putting on 4.64, or 2.2 per cent to 213.40 in turnover of Shk332m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- September 1                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1312.09   1312.21   1312.51   1310.01 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1387.85   1388.38   1388.96   1387.28  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1309.20   1307.80   1305.83   1305.63 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1386.14   1386.16   1383.46   1385.51  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 31    Aug 27    Aug 26    Aug 25    Aug 24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1319.96   1308.15   1298.46   1310.93   1296.82 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1396.45   1397.66   1384.05   1385.62   1375.46  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1312.93 ; 200 -  1388.96 Low/day: 100 -  1305.07  200 -  1382.80 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Echo Bay steps up gold mines search Echo Bay Mines is searching aggressively for new gold mines in Latin America and elsewhere in order to speed growth and offset North America's costly processes for permits, according to Mr Richard Kraus, president. The Canadian company has been working for seven years to develop two gold properties near Juneau, Alaska, and now believes it can bring them into production in 1998. Total capital costs would be about USDollars 370m to Echo Bay and annual output about 500,000 oz. Echo Bay's 1993 output from producing mines in Canada, Nevada and Washington state was 874,000 oz of gold, up 14 per cent from 1992, and 12.5m oz of silver, up 57 per cent. Mr Kraus said the offshore search was being targeted at Ecuador, Peru and Chile. Reports of a joint venture in China, however, were premature. Total exploration spending this year will be USDollars 36m. This includes Dollars 1m for geophysical work and drilling for kimberlite on land Echo Bay holds near the Lac des Gras diamond deposits in Canada's Northwest Territories. 'Our properties sit in the Corridor of Hope, running about 200 miles from Lac des Gras northwest to our Lupin gold mine,' Mr Kraus said. 'We would raise the budget if we were successful, but for development we'd seek a partnership with a major international mining firm with diamond experience.'</p>

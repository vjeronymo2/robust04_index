A high-ranking Russian diplomat close to Kozyrev told  INTERFAX that this was an extremely important aspect of  Russian-American cooperation for the nonproliferation of  missiles and other dangerous know-how.    "Suffice it to recall the incident involving the export of  Russian cryogenic boosters to India and the restrictive moves of  the West in relation to Russia, to understand how important this  question is. The American side has understood at last that the  nonproliferation of dangerous know-how is our common concern and  treats Russia with more trust now," he said.    The fact that Russian experts will be involved in drafting  the concept of a new COCOM from the very start is particularly  important, he went on to say. They will not have to wait for  what America will prepare for them, he added.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Banca del Gottardo in rights issue Banca del Gottardo, the Lugano-based bank specialising in asset management, is planning to raise new capital through a rights issue of 100,000 participation certificates. Gottardo also said it was in talks with Sumitomo Bank of Japan, which holds a controlling interest in the bank, about its wish to convert all its participation certificates into bearer shares in 1996. Conversion would mean that Sumitomo would have to make an additional investment in Gottardo equity or see its holding diluted to under 50 per cent. Sumitomo holds 55 per cent of Gottardo's voting bearer shares and 12.4 per cent of the non-voting participation certificates. This represents 44 per cent of the bank's total equity capital.</p>

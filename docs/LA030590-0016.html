			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORPORATE WELFARE STATE IS ON A ROLL;  </P> <P> TAXES: FROM S&amp;L BAILOUTS TO CUT-RATE TIMBER LEASES TO TOXIC CLEANUPS, IT'S  THE INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER FOOTING THE BILL.  </P> <P> Raiding taxpayer assets is the big game in Washington, but not everyone can  play. From bailouts to outright giveaways and from military procurement fraud  to bloated subsidies, our national government has become a golden accounts  receivable for hordes of organized, corporate claimants who lobby daily to get  something for nothing or a lot for a little.  </P> <P> Taxpayers and their lobbying groups focus on tax rates and loopholes, paying  insufficient attention to misappropriation of their dollars by corporate  welfarists. One reason for this inattention is that the laws shut taxpayers out  -- they may not petition the offending agencies and departments or take them to  court for the arbitrary and capricious transfer of taxpayer assets to corporate  use and control. The stakes are enormous for both present and future  generations of Americans.  </P> <P> Four areas of abuse are booming:  </P> <P> Bailouts. The prominent bailouts of the 1970s -- the $250-million Lockheed loan  guarantee and the $1.5-billion Chrysler loan guarantee -- were legislated after  public hearings and now look like small change. The taxpayer bailout of the  wreckage caused by fraud and speculation in the savings and loan industry will  reach at least $300 billion before the dust settles. Estimates of cleanup costs  for U.S. nuclear weapons plants, managed by private firms such as DuPont and  North American Rockwell, range from $50 billion to $150 billion.  </P> <P> Bailouts are increasingly being shaped and decided with fewer and fewer  congressional standards. In December, 1988, in a secret frenzy of  round-the-clock giveaways, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board unloaded the assets  of dozens of S&amp;Ls into the laps of financiers who had to invest  comparatively tiny amounts of their own capital, while the board assumed  open-ended liability for these failing institutions. The board obligated the  taxpayers for more than $40 billion in this feeding frenzy, without any  congressional authorization. Congress turned down efforts to reopen these deals  (whose full texts are still secret) and instead retroactively ratified the  board's wildcat indebtedness.  </P> <P> To illustrate the lucrativeness of these back-room bonanzas: One financier,  Ronald Perelman, recouped 80% on his investment in a Texas S&amp;L in just the  first 90 days after concluding his deal with the board.  </P> <P> It is not corporate taxpayers who must endure the bailout burden of these  corporate scandals; it is primarily the small taxpayer, who neither caused nor  benefited from the scandals.  </P> <P> Resource depletion. Public lands make up one-third of the United States. The  laws declare them to be commonwealth: They are owned by the people in trust for  posterity and managed largely by the Departments of the Interior and  Agriculture. For a century, in a trend that accelerated under the Ronald  Reagan-James Watt regime, rich mineral rights, timberland and other wealth have  been taken from the commonwealth and leased at bargain-basement prices to  corporations. The cost to taxpayers to facilitate private cutting of virgin  timber lands is more than 10 times what they get back in royalties. One Alaskan  pulp mill paid $2.12 for a 100-foot-high spruce, while taxpayers footed the  bill for roads to make the cutting possible. Third World nations demand tougher  royalty agreements from U.S. oil companies than our own government does. The  under-reporting and under-payment of royalties, and the longer-range depletion  and destruction of public natural resources, erode these taxpayer assets.  </P> <P> Taxpayer-funded research and development. This giveaway also expanded rapidly  under the Reagan Administration. The prevailing practice is to give exclusive  patents on government-financed inventions to private contractors. Even  inventions generated by government laboratories are being given over to private  business. The National Cancer Institute, which developed the application of the  drug AZT against AIDS, allowed Burroughs Wellcome, Inc. to obtain an exclusive  patent to market the medicine without any price restraints or royalties. A  year's treatment with AZT costs from $6,000 to $10,000. Under Medicaid, the  taxpayers are paying twice for a drug their taxes developed for clinical use.  Total federal and state purchases of AZT from Burroughs Wellcome between 1982  and 1987 are estimated at $2.4 billion.  </P> <P> The federal government funds nearly half of the nation's R&amp;D. Taxpayers,  who provide the roots for this work, are denied the fruits, which mostly flow  into corporate coffers.  </P> <P> Subsidies to profit-making businesses. Perhaps the most grotesque example of  corporate welfare is the millions of dollars in Urban Development Action Grants  and other subsidies given to General Motors in 1981 to build an automated  Cadillac plant in Detroit. There are many examples of UDAG grants going to  profitable companies, along with a large menu of other direct grant and subsidy  programs. There are even subsidies for exporting nuclear power plants and  tobacco. The overall value of these corporate welfare payments is easily more  than $100 billion a year.  </P> <P> There are simply no open administrative procedures, as there are with  environmental and consumer regulations, for taxpayer participation in the use  and disposition of such public wealth. The Supreme Court has ruled that federal  taxpayers cannot appeal to the courts to stop waste, fraud and unlawful  conversion of taxpayer assets because they have "no standing to sue." The usual  argument by the court is that a taxpayer's interest is shared with millions of  others and is comparatively minute and indeterminable. When Richard Nixon's  White House aides were openly using their time and government facilities to  advance his reelection campaign in 1972, a federal court refused to admit a  taxpayer's suit to enjoin such unlawful behavior because of the standing issue.  Even 50 million taxpayers in a class action would not have made a difference to  the court.  </P> <P> Many states give taxpayers standing to sue state government. Some explicitly  authorize taxpayers to sue as private attorneys general to uphold the laws that  officials are ignoring. If President Bush and Congress really are serious about  preventing taxpayer assets from being looted, mismanaged or converted to  private parties, legislation is needed to protect the public's property from  giveaways, as in the patent area; to establish procedures that will assure more  open and accountable government policy-making regarding taxpayer assets, and  give taxpayers standing, under what constitutional lawyers call a  "participant-review provision," to defend their interests in federal courts.  </P> <P> Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax-payer assets have been squandered. It is  time to give taxpayers the means to correct these injustices. After all, they  pay the bills.  </P></p>

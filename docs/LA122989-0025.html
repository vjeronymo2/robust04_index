			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHNIC EATING: SHANGRI-LA: A SUMPTUOUS NEW OUTPOST OF CHINESE CUISINE  </P> <P> The newest of the sumptuous Hong Kong style-restaurants is not in Chinatown or  Monterey Park. Shangri-La can be found at Boylston and 3rd streets.  </P> <P> You can't miss it. Neon signs banded around the top of the low, curving  building announce this outpost of Chinese cuisine. Inside, the view of the  surrounding high-rise structures makes a striking backdrop to the midday fleet  of dim-sum carts.  </P> <P> Aside from dim sum, Shangri-La specializes in seafood. The best dish that I  encountered was a striking presentation of skewered shrimp taken fresh from the  restaurant's tanks, cooked, and doused with dark garlic sauce. The sauce was  wonderful to eat with the accompanying bowl of rice noodles.  </P> <P> Plump shrimp daubed with mayonnaise and paired with crisp, sesame sprinkled  candied walnuts offered an interesting play of textures. And a collection of  seafood -- shrimp, scallops and sea cucumber -- heaped in a potato basket was  fine. So were deep-fried flounder slices seasoned with spicy salt -- although  what the restaurant means by spicy salt escapes me. I've had two dishes with  that ingredient -- the other was sliced pork loin -- and neither was what I  would call spicy.  </P> <P> I'm not an oyster fan, but I loved a dish of braised oysters. The plump  mollusks were spooned sizzling onto a hot platter and topped with a fruity dark  sauce. Crisp on the outside, they were mellow and tender within.  </P> <P> A Chinese friend admired the simple perfection of a steamed whole small tilapia  and liked a soup made with whole shark fins and chicken. It takes special  skill, he said, to cook the fins so they don't fall apart in shreds. The soup  came in a small, covered pot and included a portion of fin and a bony chunk of  chicken that the waitress divested of meat with chopsticks. The broth is dark  and murky but full of flavor. This is not a pretty dish.  </P> <P> Looks are not generally disregarded here, however, and the kitchen can turn out  colorful platters of food. Stir-fried spinach with garlic and Chinese sausage,  for example, came ringed with orange slices, their aroma released by the heat  of the platter.  </P> <P> I've had a few failed dishes here as well, including tough slices of boiled  geoduck and an odd dish that combined tender scallops with leather-hard slices  of sea conch.  </P> <P> The only problem I've had with dim sum was being seated in a non-smoking area  and waiting in vain for the carts. The waitress explained that the area had  been set aside for customers ordering from the full menu. (No smoking, no dim  sum?) On other days, I went through quite an assortment, including velvety beef  balls, steamed buns filled with chicken, pork or lotus paste, crunchy browned  squares of shrimp toast and a lotus leaf-wrapped bundle of sticky rice mixed  with lotus seeds, Chinese sausage and barbecued pork.  </P> <P> I loved hom shi gok, a thick, faintly sweet, rice flour cake stuffed with meat  and fried until golden brown. And I enjoyed the impromptu language lesson  imparted by "fungus pork in rice noodle." There was no fungus inside the  wrapper. The word simply sounds like a Cantonese word that describes a filling  composed of pork, shrimp and vegetables.  </P> <P> Most of the dim sum is $1.60 a plate, with higher prices for special items. The  restaurant has a fax-a-lunch menu with prices for main dishes ranging from $5  to $6.50. The selection sticks to such familiar items as beef with broccoli,  kung po shrimp and sweet and sour pork. Dinner menu prices are higher. The  steamed small tilapia is $10, the shark's fin and chicken soup is $18, and the  shrimp on skewers cost $16 a pound, plus $2 for the accompanying rice noodles.  </P> <P>  Shangri-La Chinese Seafood Restaurant, 313 S. Boylston St., Los Angeles. (213)  250-2288. Open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.-9:30 p.m.; Saturday and  Sunday, 10 a.m.-9:30 p.m. American Express, Visa and MasterCard accepted.

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: VW slims losses and forecasts break-even First-quarter losses at Volkswagen narrowed to DM342m (Dollars 204.7m) from DM1.25bn last year, the Wolfsburg-based group reported yesterday. There was a good chance it would break even for the full year, it said. The German-based parent company, VW, returned a profit of DM35m in the review period, compared with a loss of DM917m last time, when the results were heavily burdened with restructuring costs and provisions. Total deliveries of VW group brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda, rose 5.7 per cent in the first three months of this year. However, turnover increased only 2.6 per cent to DM20bn. Analysts, welcoming the results as better than expected, attributed the disparity between volume and turnover growth to sharp price cuts, especially in Europe. Group vehicle output rose 4.8 per cent to almost 760,000 units, including a 0.6 per cent rise in production of flagship VW models. Output at Seat, the crippled Spanish subsidiary, rose 44 per cent, while Skoda in the Czech Republic produced 4 per cent more cars. Audi, the quality car division, managed a 6 per cent rise. According to the company, group sales in Germany fell 1.3 per cent in the first quarter, when overall demand for cars rose 2.9 per cent. VW's market share was unchanged at a dominant 29.2 per cent. Meanwhile, BMW yesterday forecast improved 1994 profits and reported a 7.4 per cent rise in turnover, to DM13bn, for the first five months. Incoming orders had risen considerably, and would have a corresponding effect on earnings. However, the end result would be diluted by the costs of launching two new models, Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman, told the annual meeting. Setting up equipment for the compact 3-Series and the new 7-Series interfered with production in the first quarter, reducing output by 1.7 per cent.</p>

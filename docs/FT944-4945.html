			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Housebuilding helps Allen jump to Pounds 2.74m Allen, the Wigan-based construction group, more than doubled pre-tax profits in the six months to October 2 as hire services and housebuilding turned in sharply improved contributions. Group profits climbed to Pounds 2.74m (Pounds 1.28m) on turnover 62 per cent ahead at Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 30.5m). The results include figures for two months from DJ Ryan, the cable laying and civil engineering company bought for about Pounds 6.9m. While Kendrick Hire, the 41-strong chain of tool hire depots bought in September for Pounds 3m, is included in the balance sheet, it makes no contribution to the profit and loss account. The shares were unchanged on the day at 163p. Mr Donald Greenhalgh, Allen chairman and managing director, said Ryan had not been as profitable as expected, but stressed that the shortfall was material to Ryan, not to the group as a whole. The contracts for North West Water and British Gas were profitable; the problems were only in the contract for Nynex, the US telecommunications group. Allen was making a claim against the Ryan warrantors. The division made operating profits of Pounds 348,000 on turnover of Pounds 7.96m. Profits from hire services, which with Kendrick comprise 78 depots, jumped to Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 472,000) on turnover of Pounds 8.04m (Pounds 5.07m). Mr Ken Fox, group deputy managing director, said increased volumes, not prices, lay behind the advance. Completions on the housebuilding side grew 46 per cent to 206 and profits were up at Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 822,000) on turnover of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 8.6m). Property development and investment made Pounds 128,000 (Pounds 83,000) on turnover of Pounds 314,000 (Pounds 395,000). Building contracting suffered the only profits downturn, from Pounds 332,000 to Pounds 238,000 on turnover ahead at Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 16.4m). Gearing rose to 58.5 per cent, against 42 per cent last time and a self-imposed 60 per cent upper limit. Earnings per share were 6.48p (3.99p) and the interim dividend is 2p (1.65p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The 30th summit of the OAU enters its second day  today in Tunis. South African President Nelson Mandela, who was  imprisoned for 27 years and has become the first black president  of a multiracial and democratic South Africa, was given a  rousing welcome as he entered the conference hall. Rwanda, with  its hundreds of thousands of deaths and refugees, became the  main topic of discussion at the opening session during which the  Egyptian president handed over the OAU chairmanship to Tunisian  President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.    General Eyadema, who is also attending the summit, saw his  mediation efforts crowned with the reconciliation between  Nigerian and Cameroonian heads of state, who were at loggerheads  over the Bakassi Peninsula. Kojovi Gbadayi reports from Tunis:    [Begin recording] [Gbadayi] There were 42 African heads of  state and monarchs present at the opening session of the 30th  summit of the pan-African organization. Among these heads of  state was President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who went to Tunis to  make Togo's voice heard. The various speakers -- from President  Ben Ali of Tunisia to President Mubarak of Egypt, passing  through President Konan Bedie of Cote d'Ivoire and Nelson  Mandela of South Africa, as well as UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali -- in turn called for the redress of Africa, the  strengthening of mutual understanding, and inter-African  cooperation.    The main event of the day, however, was the meeting in the  afternoon between Presidents Paul Biya of Cameroon and Sani  Abacha of Nigeria. This is the first time that two heads of  state, at loggerheads over their common border, are meeting at  the initiative of President Eyadema. For several months now,  the Togolese head of state has been devoting his efforts to  reconciling the views of the Nigerian and Cameroonian leaders in  order to arrive at the peaceful settlement of the conflict over  Bakassi Island. The Abacha-Biya meeting was sanctioned by a  joint communique, the French version of which was read by  Cameroonian Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono:    [Oyono] At the initiative of General Gnassingbe Eyadema,  president of the Republic of Togo, President Paul Biya,  president of the Republic of Cameroon and General Sani Abacha,  president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria met in Tunis. The  two heads of state examined the situation created by the  territorial conflict between their two states. They agreed to  set up a joint commission, under the auspices of the Togolese  President in order to seek ways and means of finding a just and  peaceful solution to the conflict, without resorting to the  International Court of Justice. To this end, a meeting, to be  preceded by a foreign ministers' conference, will take place  within the next few weeks in Lome.    [Gbadayi] The Nigerian and Cameroonian heads of state  embraced each other before leaving their host, Gen. Eyadema.  President Eyadema had earlier in the morning received Rene  Delaire, the French president's adviser on African affairs. [end  recording]</p>

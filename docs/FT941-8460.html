			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Hanson cuts Wassall stake to less than 3% Hanson has sold a further 2.75m shares in Wassall, the conglomerate run by former Hanson executives, reducing its stake to less than 3 per cent, writes Maggie Urry. Hanson took a stake in 1988 when two of its executives moved into what was then a tiny company. In the 1992 accounts Hanson was shown as holding 13.6m shares, 8.9 per cent of the total. In March last year it sold 6.18m shares for Pounds 14.5m. With Wassall shares at 284p, down 3p yesterday, the shares sold would have been worth Pounds 7.8m.</p>

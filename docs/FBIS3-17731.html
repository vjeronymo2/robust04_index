			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sharip Asuyev] </F>   [Text] Groznyy 28 Mar, TASS -- A Chechen opposition leader  praised today the State Duma's resolution on a political  settlement between Russia and its self-styled Republic of  Chechnya. The statement was adopted on Friday by Russia's lower  house.    Yaragi Mamodayev, chairman of the government of national  confidence dissolved by Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, told  ITAR-TASS that the resolution "was wise if somewhat  over-politicized."    Mamodayev praised the desire of the Russian lawmakers to  resolve the problem strictly by peaceful means without turning  to force. "That is what our government has been fighting for,  and as we see now, not in vain," he said.    On the other hand, Mamodayev criticised the resolution for  its appeal to the opposition forces in Chechnya. "We always  insisted that our compatriots should not be divided into pro-  and anti-president forces. On the contrary, we always called  for consolidation around the idea of building the Chechen  state," he said.    In its resolution, the State Duma suggested that President  Yeltsin take measures to achieve a political settlement in  relations between federal state bodies and the authorities of  the Chechen Republic.    The resolution empowered the Russian Government to hold  consultations with representatives of Chechen state bodies and  political movements in order to overcome the current social and  political problems, and to draft a powers-sharing treaty between  Moscow and Groznyy.    The Duma called for the signing of such a treaty under the  conditions that the Chechnya Republic hold free elections and  recognise itself as a subject of the Russian Federation.    According to Mamodayev, it is unlikely that the present  Chechen leadership will agree with the resolution. "For Dudayev  himself to recognise that Chechnya is a part of Russia would be  `political harakiri'," he said.    Official Groznyy is surprisingly calm. Neither Dudayev nor  any of his supporters commented on the resolution during the  weekend.    Whatever their response might be, ITAR-TASS has learnt from  a  reliable source that a rather highly-ranked Chechen delegation  is getting ready to leave for Moscow, apparently to continue the  negotiations with Russia which started last week.</p>

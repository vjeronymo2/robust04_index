			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: Pianist on the podium AMONGST pre-eminent conductors on the scene, there are usually two or three who like to strut their paces at the keyboard, once in a blue moon: Szell and Sawallisch spring to mind. Very often, in suitably chosen works - they avoid music that requires the ultimate virtuoso polish - their pianism is as satisfying as their conducting. Since the 1960s, however, there has been a surge of first-class pianists crossing over in the other direction, which some of us have found less heartening. It is one thing for a master-pianist to render his most penetrating insights into his own instrument's sound, but quite another to transmit his full intentions to fellow-musicians in concert; or again, to play upon their collective voice so that it actually speaks and thrills. Those are not a pianist's natural knacks. Bluntly: who will claim (hand on heart]) to have heard an orchestral performance under Barenboim or Ashkenazy that came near to matching their most inspired solo playing? On the evidence of his Festival Hall debut with the Philharmonia on Thursday, Mikhail Pletnev may prove an exception. He is already known here as a pianist of formidable powers; and, not incidentally, as one who has also been happy to appear as accompanist - 'mere' would not be the word - for Michael Collins' superlative clarinet. Meanwhile, at his other home in Moscow, he has founded and developed an independent 'Russian National Orchestra' of contract players. For Pletnev's first appearance on a London podium he had Collins as soloist on basset-clarinet, the historical lower instrument for which Mozart originally planned his very late Clarinet Concerto (published in a version with higher substitutes for the lowest solo passages). With flawlessly sympathetic Philharmonia support, Collins made the darker-toned instrument sound like no period curiosity, but the native voice of the concerto. Its dusky resonance seemed ideal, both for unshowy but pungent 'accompanying' passages and for intimate ruminations at centre stage. Before that we had Weber's Oberon Overture, a familiar hors-d'oeuvre which rarely gets the quick, tender attention that Pletnev gave it. Properly open-air horns, a firecracker start for the 'Allegro con fuoco', all the eager, transparent innocence the piece prescribes: that bespoke practical expertise, not just good musical intentions. Later, Chaikovsky's 'Pathetique' Symphony stretched him further, and found nothing wanting. Its initial Adagio/Allegro - both tempi read at bold extremes - was vitally alert and dramatic. The 5/4 'waltz' movement really danced, with a baleful glint, and the Scherzo-March was a brilliantly headlong affair, exciting beyond the routine norm; the final Adagio lamentoso rose to precise, poignant expression without resorting to howls or swoops. If Pletnev were unknown as a pianist, this performance would still have earned him full-blooded credentials as a conductor of notable gifts. Sponsored by AFG Automotive &amp; Financial Group</p>

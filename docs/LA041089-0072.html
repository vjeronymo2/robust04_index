			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Trump Wants Tower in Brazil: New York real estate magnate Donald J. Trump said  he wanted to construct a Trump Tower-style building in Brazil. "What I enjoy  most is building great buildings. I think my most likely investment in Brazil  would be building a Trump Tower-type building . . . a glamorous, super-quality  building," Trump told a weekend news conference in Sao Paulo. He said the tower  would be built there or in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's biggest cities. The Trump  Tower is a Fifth Avenue skyscraper where Trump has his headquarters. Trump, in  Brazil to make a donation to a hospital, said, "It is very likely I will make  an investment here. Brazil is one of the few places in this troubled world I  feel confident to make an investment in."  </P></p>

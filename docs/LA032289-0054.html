			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The U.S. government must pay more than $146,000 in lawyers' fees to the widow  of Chilean President Salvador Allende because she was wrongly denied a visa to  visit the United States six years ago, a federal judge in Boston ruled.  Hortensia de Allende, whose Marxist husband was killed in a 1973 coup, was  invited in 1983 to speak to several American universities but was denied a  non-immigrant tourist visa by then-Undersecretary of State Lawrence S.  Eagleburger. Allende challenged the State Department decision and later sought  attorneys' fees under the 1980 Equal Access to Justice Act.  </P></p>

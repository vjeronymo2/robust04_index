			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / NCP chief denies conspiracy MR GORDON LAYTON, chief executive of National Car Parks, yesterday denied taking part in a conspiracy to defraud rival company Europarks. Appearing at the preliminary hearing of an Old Bailey trial expected to last several weeks, Mr Layton and Mr Simon Hewitt, a security specialist, pleaded not guilty to conspiring between January 1987 and November 1989 to defraud Europarks by dishonestly acquiring information relating to Europarks' financial affairs. Both men are alleged, along with two former Army officers, to have sought the information with the intention of using it for the commercial benefit of NCP, putting Europarks at risk. The court dealt with legal argument yesterday after the jury was sworn in. The trial is expected to open formally next week.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Conservative Party national convention announced  today from the Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada Convention Center in  Santa Fe de Bogota that Andres Pastrana Arango had been selected  the party's candidate for president. Representatives of the  party's various factions, as well as former President Misael  Pastrana, Senator Enrique Gomez, and former Minister Cornelio  Reyes, announced the sectors' agreement.    Nearly 3,000 of the 4,000 accredited convention delegates  cast their votes at the country's 34 voting sites. All except  one voted for Pastrana and approved a proposal giving the  candidate a free hand to designate his candidate for vice  president. The National Salvation Movement released a  communique, signed by Gomez, asking the Conservative Party to  join a crusade to restore morality. Reyes delivered the opening  speech:    [Begin Reyes recording] The candidate we will support -- and  he has said this with commendable clarity -- will not be the  champion of any particular faction, but an apostle of national  reconciliation. [end recording]    Former President Belisario Bethancur delivered a message  emphasizing the national nature of Pastrana's candidacy. Former  Foreign Minister Rodrigo Lloreda also attended the convention.    [Begin Lloreda recording] The country has a great  opportunity  to overcome the darkness of corruption. [end recording]    Everything was ready very early at the convention, which  this  time resembled the great U.S. conventions. Old and experienced  party members met to proclaim a single person as candidate.  That is why there were no ballots, as the statutes stipulate,  only a ballot to vote for Andres Pastrana. The convention opened  with the entrance of former President Pastrana. He could not  contain his eagerness and excitement and nearly cried when he  referred to his son.    [Begin Misael Pastrana recording] The people who walk with  he  who walks with his own destiny are not mistaken. [end recording]    Although everything was prepared, time caught up with some  in  the afternoon. Official delegate Antonio Alvarez Restrepo  raised his voice when he saw that the sound system was off. Now  former candidate Rodrigo Llorente and the women who showed off  their hats were seated in the front. Computers worked full  steam ahead to tabulate the results of the voting in the  departments, and the organizers did not allow anyone to enter  the headquarters ahead of schedule. It took 12 hours to erect  the stage to present a light, sound, and color show to proclaim  Pastrana as the party's presidential candidate. The men  responsible for this work are the same ones who produced the  show to launch his campaign.</p>

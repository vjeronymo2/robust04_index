			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: On ritual pain and abuse - Sophie Constanti witnesses some queer traditions in the name of art What kind of radical theatre grows out of a multicultural urban sprawl where riot, arson and racially motivated killings have become the kneejerk response to perceived social injustice? As the Rodney King case so frighteningly illustrated, Los Angeles is no laid-back global village. And, as Ask the Angels - a recent selection of work imported from the city's Highways Performance Space and presented at London's ICA Theatre - revealed, only those inclined towards rampant self-expression stand a chance of being seen and heard in this melting pot of ugly tensions. That the most articulate victims of a sick society might, through performance, find some cathartic release is unsurprising. But beyond broadcasting their disadvantaged status, what are these performers trying to say? Ron Athey's 4 Scenes in a Harsh Life is not for theatregoers who are liable to pass out at the sight of blood and needles; or for those who do not wish to be anointed with body fluids; or for anyone who feels out of place in the company of the extensively tattooed and pierced. It is a show in which convulsive self-loathing is made so horrendously graphic, and acts of mutilation are carried out in such a matter of fact way, that even those people entertained by the beer-and-ketchup vomiting misfits of Jim Rose's Circus are sure to be left worried for Athey and his tribe of consenting sado-masochists, and confused as to the purpose of this spectacle of ritual pain and abuse. Athey, a former pentecostal preacher and ex-junkie, draws heavily on his chequered background and nihilist tendencies for much of the show's content. Take the prelude to the evening's four, mercifully brief scenes: this features Athey in Edna Everage-style drag, recounting his childhood interest in the phenomenon of stigmata and his parallel fascination for blood-letting on a stage littered with wooden crutches. Meanwhile, a St Sebastian figure, her flesh skewered with arrows, gazes upwards. While there is some peculiar dignity in her martyrdom, we see only frenzied self-mutilation and rabid despair in the later scene, entitled 'Tattoo Salvation', which has Athey create a chevron effect along the entire length of his forearm with some 20 diagonally inserted syringes - a mere practice run for his next task which has him ramming a set of fat needles into his forehead. Equally anxiety-inducing is the scene where another naked 'addict' enters, his head already pierced with a here's-one-I-made-earlier crown of thorns, only to have each needle removed by a surgical glove-wearing Vestal Virgin. Athey's most assured and reasoned performance - as a bespectacled minister delivering an hallelujah sermon - comes in the final episode: here, the threads of his dramatic subtext, if not the shocking, physical exorcisms it provokes, begin to make some sense. But the overall picture relies too much on the 'shabby shamanism' which Athey vehemently rejects in his call for a framework of meaningful queer traditions. In Tim Miller's Naked Breath, body fluids are talked about rather than produced. Miller, one of LA's most vociferous gay activists and co-founder of Highways, accurately describes himself as a 'loud, obnoxious fag'. He can be funny and frank, but his autobiographical texts are tediously one-dimensional. In Naked Breath, an 80 minute monologue, Miller recounts his exploits as a carpenter in New York: he built beds in hundreds of the city's apartments - 'and had sex in all the rest'. But these stories of his numerous sexual adventures are hardly untrampled ground. When Miller appeared at the same theatre during the 1986 Dance Umbrella festival, we learned a great deal about this agit-prop artist's obsession with his own sexuality. Eight years on, he is still telling us that his first boyfriend was a prostitute on Santa Monica Boulevard. Naked Breath is evidence that Miller's theatrical material has become even more self-referential and that he now frequently lapses into contrived, airy sentimentality. Like Athey, Turkish born choreographer/dancer Mehmet Sander is openly HIV-positive. But while Athey hooks into an obsession with flesh, decorating and destroying it with jewellery, tattoos and ritual scar patterns, 27 year old Sander highlights the vulnerability of corporeal matter through self-inflicted, systemised assault to bones, muscles and joints, turning the solidity and weight of his own body into both object and subject of five brief and brutal solos. Sander, whose stout physique owes more to circuit training than to any regime designed to elongate the limbs and develop flexibility, is concerned with testing the limits of the body, rather than celebrating its gymnastic capabilities, and the effect is simultaneously impressive and disturbing as, over and over again, he rockets through space and crashes to the floor with a sickening thud. But in spite of the admirable precision of Sander's work, its skull-cracking, genital-pulping cruelty registers as just another take on the inhumane activity which characterises Athey's brand of lunatic sensationalism. Whether or not we are able to understand what impels people to commit such acts of pain and risk upon themselves and others, this kind of unswervingly extreme performance work does force us to think about issues of personal freedom and choice. For if, by law, consenting adults involved in S&amp;M face criminal prosecution, does this mean that, theoretically, our bodies belong to the state? I would guess that even those of us who are not turned on by the thought of being choked with a dog lead or submitting to a good whipping do not wish to be given guidelines on permissible pleasure - in, or out, of the theatre.</p>

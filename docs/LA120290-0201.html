			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PARKING BAN LIFTED TO HELP SHOP OWNERS  </P> <P> City officials will offer a holiday gift to shop owners on western Ventura  Boulevard this week by temporarily lifting an afternoon parking ban that shop  owners said deterred potential customers.  </P> <P> For the last month and a half, parking has been prohibited on the south side of  Ventura Boulevard between Topanga Canyon Boulevard and De Soto Avenue between 3  and 7 p.m.  </P> <P> The ban was imposed by Mayor Tom Bradley as part of an effort to improve the  flow of traffic on the busy thoroughfare during peak commuter hours.  </P> <P> Similar restrictions have been enacted along other stretches of Ventura  Boulevard.  </P> <P> But Woodland Hills business owners complained that the parking ban has driven  customers away. In a meeting last month, they appealed to city officials to  lift the prohibition, at least for the holiday shopping season.  </P> <P> "They were essentially shutting their businesses down at 3 p.m.," said Bob  Gross, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization. "The  restrictions would totally destroy the holiday shopping season."  </P> <P> Area residents said they were also affected by the restrictions because  frustrated shoppers instead parked along residential streets.  </P> <P> Last week, city transportation officials lifted the parking restrictions for  the month of December in response to community concerns, said Rosalind Wayman,  a deputy for City Councilman Marvin Braude.  </P> <P> This week, workers from the Department of Transportation will cover the parts  of the signs that restrict parking in the afternoons.  </P> <P> Wayman said that city officials intend to reinstate the ban in January. Gross  said that community members hope to persuade city officials to drop the  afternoon parking restriction for good.  </P></p>

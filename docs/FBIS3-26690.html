			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Quinton Chan and Danny Gittings] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong will have its first human rights "court"  and commission if a radical new bill proposed by independent  legislator Anna Wu Hung-yuk becomes law. The new bodies would  have sweeping powers to enable them to investigate rights abuses  and penalise the perpetrators, according to a draft copy of the  bill obtained by the Sunday Morning Post.    The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Bill, to be  forwarded to the Government tomorrow, also proposes major  changes to the territory's legal system and includes a proposal  for a tribunal to deal with human rights disputes. Under the  private member's bill, a human rights and equal opportunities  commission would be set up to examine whether existing laws were  in line with the Bill of Rights. It would also investigate  complaints, advise the Government on Bill of Rights issues and  international human rights conventions, as well as educate the  public.    An equal opportunities tribunal would also be established to  deal with complaints from those who believed their rights were  being violated. "This is a human rights court," said Ms. Wu,  who estimated the new bodies would cost more than $40 million a  year to run.    Under Legislative Council standing orders, the new bill can  only be tabled with the approval of the Governor, Chris Patten,  since it involves public expenditure. But Mr. Patten has  already hinted he would not necessarily block the bill. "I'm  pretty open-minded about it, but I think there are overlapping  powers," he told the Sunday Morning Post. "We haven't yet been  persuaded of the case, but it's not for me a locked door or a  shut window."    Principal Home Affairs assistant Duncan Pescod, who meets  Ms.  Wu tomorrow to discuss the bill, said the Government wanted to  study the draft in detail before commenting further.    If the Governor backs the bill, it is expected to be  introduced to Legco in May after a two-month consultation  period. Councillors have already indicated their support for  the establishment of a rights commission through a motion last  year. But Beijing is likely to warn against the move, which  many commentators believe is primarily aimed at protecting human  rights in Hong Kong after 1997.    Pressure over the issue is expected to mount following the  return from London today of independent legislator Christine Loh  Kung-wai, who last week urged the House of Commons' foreign  affairs committee to recommend the creation of a human rights  commission. Committee members have already indicated they are  likely to do so in their report this Easter. The Governor said  he would take such a recommendation "very seriously".    Under Ms. Wu's draft bill, the rights tribunal would be  based  on a body that exists in Australia. It would consist of a  president, who must be a judge of at least seven years'  standing, and two other members.    The new court would have almost unlimited powers. It could  order human rights violators not to repeat unlawful conduct, to  pay compensation, employ, reinstate or promote victims, or "to  perform any reasonable act or course of conduct to redress the  loss and damages suffered by the complainant". The tribunal  could also impose an interim order to preserve the status quo  and protect the rights of both parties to the complaint. Those  who failed to comply with an order of the tribunal would be  liable to a fine of up to $10,000 for an individual or $50,000  for a corporate body.    Ms. Wu's proposed human rights commission would have fewer  powers than the tribunal, but a wide-ranging remit to  investigate potential human rights abuses.    It would comprise a president, human rights commissioner,  sexual discrimination commissioner, racial discrimination  commissioner and disability discrimination commissioner. All  would be appointed by the Governor from the ranks of local  judges, barristers and solicitors.    It would even have a remit to examine any proposed law for  possible human rights violations, upon request by the attorney-  general, Legislative Council president, or any group of 500 Hong  Kong people. The committee's terms of reference would allow it  to "inquire into any act or practice that may be inconsistent  with, or contrary to, any human right". Any person who believed  their rights had been violated could lodge a complaint with the  commission, either as an individual, or on behalf of a group of  victims. Complaints would be referred to the tribunal if they  could not be solved by conciliation. Complaints lodged from  detainers and prisoners could be directly referred to the  commission, overruling prison rules.    The commission would also have the power to subpoena  evidence  and examine witnesses with those who failed to comply liable to  a maximum penalty of $50,000.    Ms. Wu said the proposed new bodies would greatly improve  existing human rights conditions in Hong Kong. "The existing  court system has its own restrictions," she said. "It is too  slow and expensive and too few people can get help from the  Legal Aid Department. But it (the tribunal) would be less  costly, more efficient, and would also provide legal aid in  terms of finance and expertise."</p>

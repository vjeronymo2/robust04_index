			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Akzo's Nobel prize Another commanding height of the Swedish economy is falling into foreign hands. Yet Akzo's takeover of Nobel Industries is likely to prove far less emotive than the marriage of Renault and Volvo. The financial plight of Nobel - arising from adventures in real estate rather than lack of competence in chemicals - always demanded an overseas partner. Akzo looks as good an industrial fit as the company was likely to find. The Swedish government must welcome the prospect of a tidy exit from its unwanted 70 per cent stake in Nobel at a healthy premium to the market price. Akzo shareholders might be forgiven a few qualms. The deal will dilute earnings per share next year. It brings a large share placing now and the prospect of additional supply later, assuming the Swedish government moves to reduce its stake in the merged company. The immediate financial benefits  -such as refinancing Nobel's punitively expensive preference stock with low-yielding Akzo shares - will limit the initial damage to earnings. Writing off Nobel's acquired goodwill to the balance sheet in the Dutch manner, rather than amortising through the profit and loss, will also help. But lasting benefits depend on the promised industrial synergies and cost savings being delivered. Fortunately there is room for optimism on that score. Having started the process of cost cutting earlier than most of its continental European rivals, Akzo's management mind-set should be well adjusted to the task. If the competition authorities do not object, the merged company will overtake ICI to become top dog in European paints. That should yield easy rationalisation in marketing and distribution. With so many shares being issued to fulfil its ambition, though, Akzo will have to come up with more than a fresh lick of paint.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Hussey reappointed as BBC chairman MR Marmaduke Hussey has been reappointed chairman of the BBC for a second five-year term from November. It is the first time that a BBC chairman has been reappointed for a second full term. Mr Hussey, aged 67, former chief executive and managing director of Times Newspapers, will lead the BBC up to the renegotiation of its Royal Charter in 1996. Lord Barnett, also 67, vice-chairman of the BBC and a former Labour cabinet minister, has been reappointed for a further two years. In making the appointments, the government has opted for stability while the purpose and structure of the corporation, and the licence fee that funds it, will come under detailed scrutiny. They imply confidence in the main BBC policies pursued over the past five years. Mr Hussey's reappointment makes it more likely that Mr Michael Checkland, the BBC director general will stay on to see in the new charter. The BBC chairman receives a salary of Pounds 50,365 on the basis of working four days a week.</p>

It  turned out to be a woman form Taldy-Korgan Oblast. Her husband  is from Rostov Oblast. For this reason, in the opinion of  physicians, the possibility cannot be ruled out that this  terrible disease was brought in from a neighboring foreign  country.    Murat Saparbek, deputy director general of the republic's  Center for AIDS Control, informed us that teams of physicians  have been sent to Taldy-Korgan Oblast to carry out preventive  measures, since this is already the second case of HIV infection  noted in the region.    In all, however, we are informed by the newspaper KARAVAN  there are 19 registered HIV carriers in Kazakhstan. Three of  them are homosexuals and two are preschool children. Nine AIDS  patients are foreign students who have been deported from this  republic.</p>

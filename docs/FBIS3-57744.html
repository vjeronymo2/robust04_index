			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Nikita Yermakov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Davos (Switzerland), 29 Jan -- Kazakhstan's official  position on the problem of nuclear weapons is determined by the  agreements that were signed by us, Kazakhstan's President  Nursultan Nazarbayev stated in an interview given to the  ITAR-TASS correspondents. Kazakhstan's head of state is in  Davos to take part in the world economic forum that is being  held here.    "In December last year Kazakhstan acceded to the Treaty on  the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and ratified it," he  said. "My official visit to the United States will take place  in mid-February and there we will exchange ratification  instruments. The Supreme Council of Kazakhstan has also  ratified the START I Treaty. True, we did carry out a great  deal of work before that." This was completed during the  meeting in Moscow of the presidents of Russia, the United  States, and Ukraine; and Belarus made a contribution to this,  too.    There were several points at issue. "The first was the  guarantee by the nuclear states that there will be no nuclear  attack on Kazakhstan," Nursultan Nazarbayev continued. "We now  have this guarantee, including from China. The second point was  that the cost of the enriched uranium in the nuclear warheads  should be returned. An agreement on this has been reached with  the United States. The third point was economic matters,  investment in Kazakhstan, and economic integration with the  Western states, including the United States. When agreement was  reached on these three issues, we went ahead with the  ratification of the treaties on nuclear problems.    The president stressed that "Kazakhstan has never wanted to  be a nuclear power, if only because 500 nuclear charges were  exploded on the territory of Semipalatinsk Oblast, including 87  in the air and 107 on the surface. Hundreds of thousands of  people are still suffering and Kazakhstan was left to face their  problem alone. I closed down that test site by decree. From  this everyone will understand Kazakhstan's striving to rid  itself of these weapons and not have them on its territory."</p>

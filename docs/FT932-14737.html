			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Property sale behind Holvis profit rise HOLVIS HOLZSTOFF, the Swiss non-wovens and paper distribution group, revealed yesterday that its 8.3 per cent rise in net profit last year to SFr32.7m (Dollars 22.1m) was made possible by an SFr9m net extraordinary profit on the sale of a property. The sale more than offset the slump in profits from operations caused by a SFr12m loss at Sodoca, the group's French subsidiary. Sodoca, the company with which Holvis first began its diversification into the non-wovens business in 1969, lost orders from a large customer early in 1992 due to the inadequate quality of part of its production. Mr Pedro Reiser, chief executive, said there had been some dismissals and Sodoca was expected to return to profit next year. Holvis forecast that its net profit this year would rise despite higher invest-ment and development costs for non-woven activities. The group, which removed all restrictions on foreign ownership of its shares last year, said 44 per cent of its shares were now held by foreigners. The British Rail pension fund, with 15 per cent, and Mercury International Investment, also of the UK with 10 per cent, were the two largest. Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss aluminium group, plans a one-for-10 rights issue. The price of the new shares will be revealed on April 28.</p>

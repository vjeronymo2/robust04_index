			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: State rejects reselection of Lorentz as head of Bull THE FRENCH government has refused an attempt by Mr Francis Lorentz, the chairman of Groupe Bull, to be reselected for a second term at the head of the loss-making, state-owned computer maker. Mr Lorentz, who has had a series of disagreements with the government over Bull's strategy during the past 18 months, said yesterday he had no deep regrets about leaving the job because he was handing over to a businessman with good industrial experience who was likely to pursue the same policies. The name of Mr Lorentz's successor is due to be announced today. 'Sometimes a change of face is a good thing in itself. . . you see your credibility progressively diminishing over time,' said Mr Lorentz, aged 50. He fully accepted the right of a state shareholder to change the management. Mr Lorentz said he applied six weeks ago to renew his mandate - which expires next Monday - to ensure continuity in the three-year programme of reorganisation of the company's structure and products. 'I did not see at the time someone who would be able to replace me very fast and make the company go ahead at the same speed and at the same direction.' Bull is only half way through the plan, which lasts until 1993 and is designed to restore it to profitability by the end of this year. The change, part of a three-yearly review of the mandates of 45 public sector chairmen, was expected because of the well-publicised clashes between Mr Lorentz and Mrs Edith Cresson, the former prime minister. They differed over the acquisition of a 4.7 per cent stake in Bull by NEC, the Japanese electronics company - which Mrs Cresson tried to block - and a technical and marketing accord with IBM, in which the US computer maker took a 5.68 per cent stake in Bull. Mr Lorentz achieved his business objectives both times, but is thought to have made enemies beyond Mrs Cresson's immediate entourage. 'I have had to fight in order to make my ideas prevail inside the circle of my shareholders,' he admitted. Supporters of Mr Lorentz believe it is no coincidence the move comes at the same time as the publication of the annual results of the Cour des Comptes, France's official accounting watchdog, which criticises several aspects of Bull's management. Criticisms in the report that Bull's marketing costs were too high were based on a poor understanding of the computer industry and had no connection with the government's decision, added Mr Lorentz. Bull is one of the biggest lossmakers in the French state sector and has absorbed FFr4bn (Dollars 769m) of state capital over the past few years. It lost a record FFr6.79bn in 1990, falling to FFr3.3bn last year, in line with the experience of several competitors.</p>

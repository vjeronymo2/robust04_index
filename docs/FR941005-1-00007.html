			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff would like to inform the readers that 10 CFR 150.31 applies only to 11e(2) byproduct material (tailings and other wastes generated from the milling of ores primarily for their source material content) and reflects statutory requirements in the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, as amended. Similar requirements could be developed to apply to other byproduct material. In order to avoid confusion with the requirements for 11e(2) byproduct material, the proper location for these new requirements would need to be considered in the development of any new section in Part 150.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Petitioner's Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioner requests that 10 CFR Parts 150 and 2 be amended to overcome the problems the petitioner has itemized and recommends the following revisions to the regulations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday ruled out  a House dissolution, while government spokesman Aphisit  Wetchachiwa rejected the possibility of bringing the opposition  Chat Phatthana Party into the coalition.    A House dissolution and the inclusion of Chat Phatthana have  been floated as possible solutions to the political impasse  stemming from the hunger strike by political Chalat Worachat.    Several newspapers yesterday reported that Chuan indicated  he  would dissolve the House of Representatives when he addressed a  group of villagers in Nakhon Si Thammarat on Saturday.    Chuan had told the villagers that a House dissolution was  one  of the "ordinary" solution available under the democratic system.    Chuan, who was visiting his home province of Trang  yesterday,  said he was not planning a dissolution.    "I don't have any plan to dissolve the House," Chuan said.    "When I talked to the villagers yesterday (Saturday), I  mentioned a House dissolution and no-confidence debates. I  simply told the villagers that these two things could happen at  any time under a democratic system."    Aphisit said in a telephone interview the situation did not  yet warrant the inclusion of the Chat Phatthana Party of former  Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan in the government.    On Saturday, Seritham Party leader Athit Urairat suggested  that Chuan bring in Chat Phatthana as a way out of the problem.  [passage omitted]</p>

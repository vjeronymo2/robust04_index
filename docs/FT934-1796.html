			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / S Korean PM and cabinet resign The official who led a recent extensive investigation of bureaucratic corruption in South Korea was named yesterday as the country's new prime minister. Mr Lee Hoi-chang, the chairman of the government's board of audit and inspection (BAI), was appointed by President Kim Young-sam after the entire cabinet led by Mr Hwang In-sung, prime minister, resigned due to a controversy over rice imports. Mr Kim's announcement last week that Korea would open its rice market as part of the Gatt talks has provoked daily street demonstrations. Political analysts fault the government for having done little to prepare the public for the decision, which broke a presidential campaign promise to protect the nation's rice farmers from imports. The choice of Mr Lee as prime minister was immediately approved by the national assembly and a new cabinet is expected to be formed by the end of the week. Those who are likely to be replaced include Mr Lee Kyung-shik, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs, and Mr Kwon Young-hae, the defence minister, whose agency was a prime target of the new prime minister's anti-corruption probes. An estimated 3,000 government officials have been removed as a result of the corruption investigation that BAI has conducted since President Kim, who promised bureaucratic reform, was inaugurated in February. Mr Lee served two terms on the supreme court since 1981 before heading BAI this year. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary general, has said he is going to North Korea on a fact-finding mission only and does not need the approval of the US or any other country, Reuter adds. The US has been noticeably cool about his visit, with State Department officials neither endorsing nor publicly opposing it. Mr Boutros Ghali said he did not intend to mediate in the crisis over North Korea's refusal to allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities. 'If there is anything I can offer to the member states, to the Security Council, I will do so,' he said. 'But I have no mandate and I will not do any kind of mediation.' North Korea yesterday sounded the alarm over what it sees as growing clamour in the US for war at a time when the two countries are in confrontation over nuclear inspection. The official press carried attacks on Washington hardliners who, the official Rodong Sinmun daily said, seemed bent on destroying chances for a negotiated settlement.</p>

Most features devote particular  attention to the organizational, technical and financial issues  connected with the collapse of the USSR. That is not surprising.  Several of the command, control and telemetry complexes, after  all, have ended up on the territory of states in the near  abroad. But the KIKs are, first and foremost, a collective of  highly skilled specialists about whom the general public knows  virtually nothing at all. They remain outside the view of  reporting from Baykonur, Plesetsk and the Flight Control Station  for the Mir orbital station.    The journal is beginning the publication of a series of  materials on the service of the workers at the command, control  and telemetry complexes and their role in supporting the space  programs and raising the combat readiness of the armed forces of  the Russian Federation with this article by KIK Main Center  Chief Colonel Anatoliy Borisovich Zapadinskiy.    The Main Center for the Testing and Control of Spacecraft is  located near Moscow in the city of Krasnoznamensk (Golitsino-2).  The city was closed to journalists until quite recently, and not  just to them. Military specialists of the highest qualifications  are on duty here around the clock--electronics experts,  programmers, ballistics specialists, communications workers and  many more, for whom space is the cause of their life. These  people are responsible for the state of almost all of the  country's orbital stations, manned or unmanned, for military,  national-economic or scientific-research purposes. Information  flows from twelve command, control and telemetry complexes  located across the entire territory of the country to the Main  Center, which is a very important part of the Military Space  Forces of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, as well as from  scientific-research vessels (separate ocean-going floating  complexes) through relay satellites. The Flight Control Centers  for the separate types of spacecraft are structurally part of  it. They plan about 1,000 communications sessions with more than  180 craft in orbit each day.    The command and control of spacecraft that are in service is  just a part of their tasks. A second, and perhaps no lesser,  part is to conduct flight testing of new spacecraft. The  specialists of the Main Center perform these functions in  collaboration with representatives of more than 150  organizations--NIIs [scientific-research institutes], KBs  [design bureaus], NPOs [scientific-production associations] and  civilian agencies.    A satellite flies over the territory of Russia for about 20  minutes, and the control and telemetry complexes are "receiving  them" and "handing them over" to each other successively along  the entire track, each of them having its own zone of radio  visibility with a certain overlap; the control of the craft thus  continuously passes "by relay." And so it goes around the clock.    The collectives, supervised by Colonels V. Kovalev, A.  Kotenko, V. Artemenko, N. Kolesnikov, I. Lopatin and V. Pestov,  are successfully accomplishing the tasks assigned to them under  difficult conditions. There are 67 officers with academic  degrees of doctor or candidate of sciences currently serving at  the Main Center. They are making a large contribution to the  scientific-research work of the command and control centers. I  would like to note among them S. Ryapolov, O. Pudovkin, O.  Yefremov, M. Grekhov and Ya. Abdulov first and foremost.    The uninitiated reader could ask, "What do I in particular,  and the country in general, need with space science, since it  costs enormous amounts of money?" I will try to answer that.    When you open up a recent newspaper, turn on the television  or reserve a telephone conversation with a different city, you  scarcely give any thought to the fact that space telerelay  currently supports the transmission of Channel 1 from Ostankino  for 97.2 percent of the population and the Russia Channel for 90  percent, 29 cities receive images of newspaper column layouts  through satellites, and telephone, telegraph, facsimile and  other forms of communications are accomplished by satellite. The  economic impact from the use of those means alone is about 1.5  billion rubles a year.[.sup]1[/]    Orbital weather stations provide timely warning of dangerous  natural phenomena, and markedly improve the accuracy of  forecasts. The annual economic impact from their use totals more  than 500 million rubles, and the research data on natural  resources about 700 million. More figures from the realm of  space meteorology: one satellite receives more information in 90  minutes (the average duration of one orbit around the Earth)  than 1,500 weather stations around the world. The possibility of  forecasting the weather two weeks in advance, according to the  estimates of UN experts (and they can scarcely be suspected of  bias), could provide an annual economy of about nine billion  dollars on a worldwide scale. That figure is 600--700 million  rubles a year apropos of our country.    Take, by way of example, an area of space science such as  researching the natural resources of the Earth from space. This  is a gold mine! The high-precision cataloguing of pasturelands  and tracts of timber, predictions of spring water runoff and  harvest levels of grains, after all, also exist aside from the  aforementioned "line items" of income.    They have long since learned to count "space" money abroad.  They know very well there that the cost of one photograph that  encompasses 185 km[.sup]2[/] of the Earth's surface in  stereoscopic form costs more than 4,000 dollars. The  productivity of one spacecraft is more than 30,000 pictures a  year.    Less than four billion rubles a year were being allocated  for  space programs by the former USSR in 1990-91. This is roughly  half the spending of the state for tobacco products, and one  seventh of that for alcoholic beverages.    The sensible voices of specialists from many of the agencies  in whose interests the dozens of spacecraft and thousands of KIK  specialists are working are most unfortunately not always heard  against the background of the shrill declarations of some  "people's patrons" who are calling for reductions and cuts in  the space programs. They have been cut back as a whole. And what  of it? Was there a spurt in some other sector of the national  economy? No. Would it not thus be easier at least to preserve  what we have, and find a worthy and economically advantageous  application for it? We cannot in fact return to the plow and  torch, leaving the country without communications, television,  navigation, meteorological observations and many others services  that often go unnoticed that are offered by space science.    Many forget, when talking about the commercialization of  space science and its cost recovery, that there is also another  aspect that for us, servicemen, is the main one, whatever else  may be said on this score.    The positive changes in the world have naturally lessened  international tensions appreciably. But the dissolution of the  NATO alliance did not follow the collapse of the Warsaw Pact,  and no substantial changes are taking place in the military  doctrines and strategic concepts of the United States and the  NATO countries.    Each looks after his own, as they say. It is the business of  policy makers and diplomats to provide for the security of the  state using peaceful means. It is the business of the military  to support those efforts. How can space science help? The  responsibility of military space science is global  high-precision navigation, communications, the command and  control of troops, operational all-weather reconnaissance and  warnings of nuclear-missile attack, the monitoring of "hot  spots" and the course of fulfillment of treaty obligations. We  will be candid- -the space assets, in performing the total  monitoring of the situation around the world, play a dual role.  The national space assets of the great powers, on the one hand,  foster a strengthening of strategic stability and  confidence-building measures among peoples and, on the other,  increase the combat capabilities of the troops by one-and-a-half  to two times. The on-board apparatus of the reconnaissance  satellites, in orbits of 300 km or more, in fact have resolution  that allows them to see objects of just several dozen  centimeters. Measurement data from special spacecraft are used  to create the digital terrain maps that constitute the  foundation of the flight assignments of the newest strategic  arms systems. For cruise missiles this signifies the guaranteed  hitting of the target with a deviation of no more than ten  meters.    The operations of the United States in the war with Iraq is  an example of this. They have in operational use 17 supporting  space systems for military purposes today. These are satellites  for imaging, infrared, radio and radar reconnaissance on global  and regional scales, the monitoring of outer space and the  warning of nuclear-missile attack, communications, combat  command and control and navigational, topogeodesic and  meteorological support. The U.S. Department of Defense could  bring in civilian space assets as well when needed.    I would like to emphasize here the substantial difference of  our "space system" from the American one. We have no separate  military and civilian space science. The spacecraft, regardless  of their purpose, are thus prepared and launched from one and  the same cosmodromes by one and the same launch vehicles. Ground  stations and information-computer complexes belonging to the  Ministry of Defense of Russia control them. Why not now split up  the zones of responsibility and turn over national- economic and  scientific space science to civilian agencies, leaving the  military with purely their own tasks? With time, when private  companies begin to invest funds in space science, this could  become a reality, but now--we will be realistic--there is not  one civilian specialist who would go to work and live at a  cosmodrome or ground telemetry station for the same money, and  under the same conditions, as our officers. Colossal funds will  be required in order to create a separate civilian space  science. I think that this question will not be considered in  the near future. Thanks to the fact that domestic space science  is being kept on the backs of servicemen--whose monetary  sustenace is less than the wages of a trolley driver--living in  God-forsaken places and who do not have normal housing, but do  not go on strike nonetheless, it remains with those few that are  still working uninterruptedly here.    We are constantly called upon to perform tasks associated  with maintaining the combat readiness of the armed forces of the  Russian Federation. And that is not easy work. Dozens of  spacecraft for various purposes are prepared and launched at our  cosmodromes every year, and the KIK Main Center is constantly  controlling the spacecraft in orbit. The military people work  with such far from military spacecraft as the Molniya and  Gorizont (communications), Tsikada (navigation), Meteor and  Resurs (meteorology and remote sounding of the Earth) and  scientific satellites. They support the launch and control of  all manned flights. And meanwhile no one removes their main  task-- ensuring the security of the Fatherland.    The cutbacks in the personnel of space units that were  carried out in directive fashion a few years ago have created a  situation close to critical. Many officers at the command,  control and telemetry complexes put in day-long duty a day  later, are brought in for additional work at night and take part  in controlling communications sessions for two or three days  without a break. The psychophysical burdens are enormous.  Operations where each mistake could caused millions in losses to  the state are performed during these sessions.    It would be convenient here to mention the prospects for the  development of the KIK Main Center and questions of the social  protections for the people who are serving the Fatherland--to  its "greater glory," as they said in the old days. The  prospects, strange as it may be, are defined by our problems.  The facilities of the space infrastructure are located on the  territory of five states of the CIS (Russia, Kazakhstan,  Ukraine, Belarus and Uzbekistan). Only one of those--Russia--is  able to carry out space activity independently. Kazakhstan,  where Baykonur is located, does not have any space industry and  cannot operate the cosmodrome independently of the other states.  There are missile- building plants on the territory of Ukraine,  but no cosmodrome. So what is the way out? Operations in the  realm of space science must be organized in a new fashion, and  coordinated with the space programs of sovereign states and the  international space program. Such programs are expediently  developed from the perspective of a decade, since the cycle for  the creation and series production of space assets is 7--10  years. The necessity of a state program is conditioned by two  factors. Some space systems, first of all (meteorological,  navigational etc.), could serve a virtually unlimited number of  consumers in all parts of the Commonwealth. It would not be  expedient to create them for each state separately. Second, the  centralized financing of military and international space  programs should be preserved, from the economic and technical  points of view.    An International Aerospace Committee (MAKK) must be formed.  It could be entrusted with the functions of general customer of  international space projects, as well as being the body that  determines the degree of participation of states in shared  financing for the creation and operation of space assets for  dual purposes.    Responsibility for the fulfillment of the international  space  program should be charged to the Military Space Forces of the  Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, entrusting it  with ordering and operating space assets for military and dual  purposes. The involvement of space units in realizing the plans  of space agencies of the sovereign states and the MAKK could be  accomplished on a contract basis, with compensation for the  expenditures of military organizations for the creation and  operation of the hardware, as well as the maintenance of the  service personnel.

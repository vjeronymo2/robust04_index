			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday's agreement between the Polish Peasant  Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] could have  been reached earlier, we were told by Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy  today.    [Begin Oleksy recording] I am greatly relieved by the  successful and final conclusion of the talks. When it comes to  the matters that aroused speculations and various rumors outside  the coalition, the talks have put an end to the state of an  alleged crisis, or perhaps not even an alleged crisis. They  have put an end to the real and existing conflict, which was  interpreted by the mass media almost as a breakdown of the  coalition, or as the partners parting their ways because of  internal difficulties impossible to overcome.    My feeling of relief comes from the fact that the will to  continue the strategic cooperation was firmly reiterated  yesterday not because of the lack of an alternative but because  all of the elements that constitute the program credo and take  into account Poland's needs, underlining the foundations of the  coalition, were reconfirmed.

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Travel: Few seek out Qatar's riches Doha, capital of the oil state of Qatar, does not receive many visitors these days. In the oil-boom years, which faded in the early 1980s, foreign businessmen streamed in to sell their wares and services. Now that the capital has been rebuilt to the highest standards and the services are generally second to none, most businessmen go elsewhere. On a map, Qatar appears like a swollen thumb jutting northwards into the waters of the Gulf - 100 miles long and 44 miles wide, a small appendage to the vast Saudi Arabian hinterland. Its oil and natural gas have taken it from rags to riches. After Kuwait's experience at the hands of Saddam Hussein, there is safety in reminding the world that Qatar, too, is an independent state. Tourism is one way of doing this. In the last year or so, international sports tournaments  -tennis, squash and sailing - have helped establish the idea of Qatar as a safe and relaxing place. For me, there are two good reasons for going there apart from the warm winter climate. One is the award-winning National Museum (conceived by the British firm, Michael Rice and Company); the other is the Doha Sheraton, my favourite hotel in the Middle East. Nowhere else have I seen a museum that captures a sense of national identity so brilliantly. In a couple of hours, visitors can grasp not only what makes this little country tick but also what life is - or was - about, up and down the Gulf coast, from pre-history to the oil age. You can learn about cooking methods and pearl diving, bedouin life and boat-building, oil and Islam. The museum is based on the modest palace, built in days of still-remembered poverty, where the present Emir was born. Connecting walls have given way to gravel paths, desert flowers, shady trees and a carefully-integrated new block. Beyond the new block is a colourful aquarium and a yacht basin for traditional wooden vessels that swarm with children at weekends. At the other end of the social scale is a little old house probably built for a pearl diver. Now the ethnographical museum, it offers a more vivid idea of domestic life as it was until recently. Doha is built around a crescent-shaped bay, its skyline dominated by the Sheraton, which soars majestically. The Dollars 150m hotel was built by the government for an Opec conference and for hosting Arab summits. Making a profit and attracting visitors are secondary considerations, however, since the hotel is a national status symbol. What never fails to excite me is its extraordinary architecture and setting. This three-cornered pyramid is based on the idea of a tent, with coloured-glass lifts soaring up a marble-clad 'tent pole'. 'You want to go to goo?' my ever-helpful Bangladeshi driver asked, knowing I had a couple of hours to spare. 'What's there?' I asked weakly. 'Lion, tiger, monkey - very nice.' We went to the goo. But it was family day and the policeman was not convinced that the driver and I constituted a family. Instead, we drove west from Doha to see the Emir's herd of rare Arabian oryx. Rearing these graceful antelopes is his personal contribution to wildlife conservation. You would hardly choose Qatar for the scenery. One stretch of flat desert is the same as another - except, that is, for the mountainous dunes near the Inland Sea in the far south. Best of all, make friends with an expat family and join a weekend camping party that will give you the chance to see the dunes at their most dramatic, at sunrise or sunset.</p>

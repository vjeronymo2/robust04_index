			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> SET MORE PLACES AT SUMMIT TABLE;  </P> <P> IF WE ARE TO HAVE A TRUE PEACE, THE REST OF THE WORLD MUST BE GIVEN A SAY.  </P> <P> When I first met Mikhail Gorbachev in December, 1985, in Geneva, I came away  impressed by his vision of the world. After having had the privilege recently  to meet with him again, at a luncheon he hosted for American political leaders,  entertainers and scholars during the summit in Washington, I am even more  convinced of his commitment to world peace.  </P> <P> When we first met, he had the courage and boldness to step outside of the  assumptions of the old Cold War bureaucracy. I was in Geneva leading a  delegation of United States peace activists who were supporting the first  summit between President Reagan and Gorbachev. We had 1 million signatures on  petitions urging a reduction in the arms race to present to the two leaders.  Our President refused to see us. But the man labeled by President Reagan as the  leader of "an evil empire" did see us.  </P> <P> Standing in a crowded rotunda inside the Soviet Embassy, I saw Gorbachev at the  other end of the hall. Before his stunned aides, our excited delegation and  more than 100 press people, we greeted each other and held our talk there in  the open, rather than in a private room. He accepted the petitions and we  exchanged views.  </P> <P> Throughout the years since then, Gorbachev has played a major role in planting  new seeds of hope. It is as if he is adhering to the words of Dr. Martin Luther  King Jr. -- "We must learn to live together as brothers and sisters or we will  die apart as fools."  </P> <P> At the luncheon in Washington, which was attended by former Secretary of State  Henry Kissinger, economist John Kenneth Galbraith and others, Gorbachev caught  many of his guests off guard. Many of these advocates of the Cold War military  buildup were stunned by his pronouncements that a new world order was before  us. He talked about joint ventures, in oil explorations, for our environment  and in space development initiatives.  </P> <P> Without the threat of dropping any bombs, Gorbachev has helped shift the world  from standing on the brink of war to discussing long-term peace. The world has  indeed moved from fear to hope. We are moving away from nightmarish thoughts of  the aftermath of a nuclear war. Instead we are moving toward finding avenues to  increase tourism and expanded student exchange programs between the two  countries.  </P> <P> For this optimism to spread across the world, it is important that all of the  world leaders convene and talk. Unfortunately, when Bush and Gorbachev hold  summits, only a minority of the world is represented. Together, America and the  Soviet Union make up only one-tenth of the human race. The point is that 60% of  all human beings are Asian; one-third of that 60% are Chinese. One-eighth of  the human race is African; more than one-fifth of Africans are Nigerian. There  are more than a dozen nations in the Middle East. There are 833 million people  in India, 300 million more than the United States and Soviet Union combined.  Two-thirds of our neighbors in the Americas speak Spanish and Portuguese. Most  people in the world are yellow, brown, black, non-Christian, poor, young and  don't speak English.  </P> <P> Our global village is not so big. Four years ago, when we first got word that  there was an accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, it was dismissed as a  Soviet problem. But it was actually a problem for all the Soviet Union's  neighbors. Later, cows as far away as Oregon had health problems related to  that accident.  </P> <P> If Bush and Gorbachev can meet to discuss matters that affect all of us on  Earth, then why can't the leaders of the Middle Eastern countries also be  there? Why not a delegation of African presidents at that table, as well as  leaders from the Far East and Central and South America?  </P> <P> This process for changing the world is coming from a few. The ultimate peace  agreement will be the one when the rest of the world is represented at the  table.  </P> <P> This hope explosion is taking place at the right time in our history. It will  inevitably have a providential impact on our national debate regarding the  peace dividend, as we insist that the military budget be drastically cut and  the benefits be directed to meet urgent human needs at home.  </P> <P> The ultimate benefactors in this peace process will be the children of the  world. They will no longer have to grow up burdened and fearful of nuclear war.  That's why the decision to save the world should be a shared vision by all of  the leaders of the world.  </P></p>

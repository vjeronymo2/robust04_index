			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, May 23 (XINHUA) --China's Premier Li Peng  made a six-day tour of east China's Jiangsu Province from May 17  to 22.    Accompanied by Chen Huanyou, secretary of Jiangsu Provincial  Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and governor of  Jiangsu, Premier Li inspected some grain production centers and  large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in the cities of  Lianyungang, Huaiyin, Yangzhou and Zhenjiang.    He also visited the homes of farmers and held discussions  with local cadres and residents.    He said that he had personally seen the development and  changes during the reform and opening-up drive in Jiangsu, and  he praised the province for having conscientiously carried out  the principles and policies of the central government, having  achieved a rapid economic development, having remarkably  improved the urban and rural people's living standards, and  having made important contributions to the state.    During the process of economic development, he stressed, the  localities should keep in mind the local interests on one hand,  and serve the needs of the whole country on the other.    He said that many of the country's large and medium-sized  enterprises were getting along well, for they have high-level  technology and management and their products sell well in  domestic and overseas markets. But, he added, there were also  some enterprises with low economic efficiency and other problems  caused by various factors.    "We should have full confidence that the large and  medium-sized enterprises can be well-operated and also pay close  attention to the existing problems in the large and medium-sized  enterprises," Premier Li said.    He pointed out that agriculture was a big issue in the  overall situation of the national economy and for social  stability.    "It is necessary to pay more attention to the development of  agriculture, and the position of agriculture as a foundation can  not be shaken, particularly at present when agricultural  efficiency is still low," he stressed.    He expressed the hope that while stabilizing grain  production, Jiangsu would further develop a diversified economy  and promote the development of rural collective economy and  rural industrial enterprises.    When listening to the reports of Jiangsu party and  government  leaders, Premier Li said that in the past two months, the rate  of price increases had tended to drop. However, he added, to  stabilize prices was still an important task of governments at  all levels.    Accompanying Premier Li during the inspection tour were  leading members of departments of the State Council.</p>

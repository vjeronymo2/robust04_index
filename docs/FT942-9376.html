			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Inflation alarm bell likely to stop ringing  -New York In recent weeks, long-term US interest rates have been climbing rapidly amid growing concerns about resurgent inflation - concerns which have spread to the stock market, where prices have struggled to make any headway in spite of mostly bullish news on the economy. This week, the stock market will be able to judge for itself whether inflation is on the rise again, and some good news should allow stocks to shake off their inflation fears. Tomorrow, the February producer prices index is released and a day later, the consumer prices index is published. Although analysts expect the two indices to show slightly stronger growth than in January (the brokerage house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette forecasts that both the PPI and CPI rose by 0.4 per cent last month), the inflation alarm bell is likely to stop ringing. If analysts' forecasts prove correct, the annual consumer inflation rate - the most closely-watched of the two indicators - will measure close to 2.4 per cent. That is a full point below the comparable rate recorded at the same stage of the year in 1993, a remarkable reduction considering the economy has been growing at a significantly faster pace over the past two months than in the same eight weeks a year ago. A hint of how markets are likely to respond to favourable inflation reports came last Friday, when after a poor start, shares rose steadily on the back of declining bond yields. Stocks firmed partly because investors turned more optimistic about this week's inflation data. But even if the inflation picture brightens, political problems that have unsettled investors in recent days are unlikely to fade especially quickly. While most of Wall Street was in agreement by the end of last week that the fuss the bond market, and later the stock market, made over the rumours swirling around the Whitewater affair was overdone, the White House is unlikely to emerge from under the clouds of the 'scandal' particularly soon. As long as the perception holds that President Clinton is politically hampered by the growing inquiry into Whitewater, and by press reports of a possible cover-up, then it is of concern to investors. Why is not easy to answer, but it is often said that if the President gets into deeper trouble, so does his political agenda, which includes such market-sensitive programmes as healthcare and welfare reform. If Mr Clinton's position weakens because of the Whitewater affair, then the dollar will probably also weaken. And a weaker dollar means imports are more expensive, which puts up the rate of inflation. Politics aside, the stock market's immediate future depends greatly on what happens to long-term interest rates. While the 30-year yield may edge a bit higher, bond investors may soon realise that the correction in the Treasury market has gone far enough. This would give the stock market some much-needed breathing room, and allow investors to digest the events of the past few weeks in a more considered fashion.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Collecting: Art to warm a winter evening - Autumn in Manhattan brings the chill and the International fair By mid-October, Manhattan has settled in for the long winter. The air usually has a bracing snap and Manhattan society is looking forward to welcoming the winter season in the way it knows best - by buying something. The stage is set for the sixth annual International Fine Art and Antiques Fair, which holds its gala opening in the Park Avenue Armory, in Manhattan, on Thursday, October 13. The show runs until Thursday, October 20. The International is organised by Brian and Anna Haughton, London ceramic-specialists turned entrepreneurs. It made its debut at a time when its biggest rival, the long-established Winter Antiques Show, was going through an acrimonious time, involving accusations of mismanagement by its former chairman Mario Buatta, widespread defections of established dealers and, most important, revelations that several items featured by its leading exhibitors had been, in the words of one discreet colleague, 'creatively refinished and embellished'. The Winter Antiques Show was shaken by the International's strict vetting policies. These determined authenticity and the amount of restoration of every item proposed. The International became a venue where the prospective buyer could relax and buy with confidence. 'We won't have imitations in,' said Anna Haughton. 'For instance, there are perfectly good 19th century ceramics that are exact copies of popular 18th century models. Even though many of these were legitimately produced, and the dealer may represent them as 19th century, they would not be permitted at the International show because they are straight copies. There is no problem with 'revivalist' pieces of a later century: they are clearly of their time.' Still, the vetting procedure is not without its problems. At the Haughton's first Fine Art Fair in New York last spring, several exhibitors complained that the vetting committee (made up mostly of other exhibitors) occasionally placed personal rivalry above aesthetic considerations, expelling items that should have been included, and vice-versa. It can be difficult to get objective vettors, as several curators and restorers from the Metropolitan Museum were forbidden to participate. Nevertheless, Anna Haughton said: 'Each year, we have more and more outside vettors. This year we have 90, and 30 of them are museum curators.' When asked who they were, she demurred, saying: 'there are always some people who don't want to be listed.' Although a list was promised, Haughton backtracked a few hours later, telling me: 'We have decided not to publish a list of vettors this year.' The most important painting ever featured at the International Show was Bernardo Bellotto's 'Fortress of Konigstein,' featured in Bruno Meissner's booth in 1992. Its exhibition there was instrumental in its subsequent sale (for approximately Pounds 6m) to the National Gallery of Art. While there are still a good number of picture and drawing dealers exhibiting (Richard Green returns with his Impressionists and Old Masters, featuring works by Canaletto and Camille Pissarro, and first-timer Jill Newhouse with Old Master and nineteenth century drawings including an early Turner Watercolour of Florence and Degas' study of Julia Belelli), the International has developed into more of an 'object' fair. Unlike European collectors, Americans have not yet warmed to the idea of buying Old Masters at fairs, and it remains to be seen whether the Haughton's spring Fine Art fair can convince them otherwise. While the International has no stated yearly theme, this year a several exhibitors feature Oriental sculpture and Orientalist-inspired European and American works of art. In the former category, veteran Newn York dealer Bob Ellsworth has a rare Chinese bronze chariot group consisting of two horses, a chariot driver from the Han dynasty. Michael Goedhuis, of London, will show a similarly large number of monumental Chinese works in bronze and iron, including a large 13th-century Iron Head of Lohan and a 17th-century bronze Buddhist Lion, originally a guard for a private shrine, one of a handful of pieces signed by the caster Shunsei. In addition to many works of modern and ancient European art, the Belgian dealer Axel Vervoordt also features Oriental sculpture, including a large Chinese Song dynasty Seated Lohan of lacquered wood. Doris Wiener offers Indian and Cambodian sculpture; she is showing a life-size 11th century Khmer sandstone figure of Shiva, a notable 10th century Ganesha and Elephant-headed Deity known as a 'Remover of Obstacles and Bestower of Worldly Success' from Java. The Chinese Porcelain Company has a 19in high Khmer bust of a 10-armed Goddess Durga from c. 960-965. Earle D. Vandekar of Knightsbridge will show a decorative pair of 18th-century Chinese bronze Lion-dogs. Partridge Fine arts offers orientalist furniture including a red-lacquered Chinoiserie bureau-cabinet (c 1720) attributed to Master Martin Schnell who worked in the service of Emperor Augustus the Strong at Dresden. Frederick P Victoria features two elaborate Chinoiserie painted over-doors, probably made for the Villa La Favorita, and a Chinoiserie folly created by the King of Naples after he took up residence in Sicily at the end of the 18th century. Orientalism of a different sort is featured by Margot Johnson, who specialises in the American Aesthetic-movement specialist. She has a delicate Japonesque inlaid table by LeJambre of Philadelphia c 1880, (in addition to several fine pieces of furniture by Herter Brothers). David Pickup (one of the most popular exhibitors), offers a British Aesth-etic-movement brass canopy bed from around 1872 complete with its original pink-and-oatmeal embroidered cover and drapes. Most of the dealers are enthusiastic about their prospects. Says Michael Goedhuis: 'People are looking forward to it - it is the first item on the social agenda this autumn. They have not been spending very freely in the past three or four years, but there is a lot of anticipation this year. 'It is hard to get a handle on what's going on in the art market today, though. You cannot pan out the same old boring rubbish about people being 'only interested in the top line.' But this show is very good. Only Biennale in Paris makes more money for its dealers, although the rest of Europe is fairly dead. The big market remains in America.'</p>

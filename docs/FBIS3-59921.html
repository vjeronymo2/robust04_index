			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- As UNIAN reported, on 16-17 December there  were trilateral talks between the delegations of Ukraine,  Russia, and the United States on issues connected with the  ratification of START I by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The  leader of the Ukrainian delegation at the talks, Deputy Prime  Minister Valeriy Shmarov granted an exclusive interview to a  UNIAN correspondent.    As Shmarov emphasized, the date of the trilateral talks was  not agreed in advance. A decision on the meeting of the  delegations of the United States, Russia, and Ukraine was taken  promptly. The visit to Moscow by U.S. Vice President Albert  Gore probably gave an impetus to holding the meeting. During  Albert Gore's meeting with the Russian leadership, the issue of  nuclear armaments was touched upon.    However, as Valeriy Shmarov pointed out, Ukraine was  precisely insisting on holding trilateral talks, being convinced  that this would be the most effective form of achieving  agreement on START I ratification and implementation.  Therefore, the fact that such consultations did take place and  that they will be continued in the future can be regarded as the  first success. The resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine  on the ratification of START I, with the reservations formulated  by the Ukrainian parliament, was the first and foremost issue  discussed at the consultations.    Ukraine's representatives had an opportunity to clearly  comment on these reservations. These, as a matter of fact,  represent that working plan according to which the parliament  and the government of Ukraine have to work so as to achieve  "pure" ratification of the treaty. The members of the Ukrainian  delegation emphasized three main issues concerning which Ukraine  hopes to find understanding with the partners: Obtaining  political guarantees from nuclear states; gaining compensation  for nuclear weapons transferred from Ukraine, tactical weapons  in particular; and receiving technical and financial assistance  in the implementation of the disarmament project.    Most understanding was reached on the issue of compensation  for tactical nuclear weapons. For the first time ever a  proposal was formulated: To solve the issue through Russia  writing off Ukraine's debts for energy. However, this decision  was not approved because, in the opinion of the participants in  the talks, it is necessary to discuss these issues in greater  detail with experts.    As far as strategic weapons are concerned, the energy  uranium  required by Ukraine's nuclear power stations was offered as  compensation. In case this issue is solved in a positive manner  Ukraine's needs for this raw material would be satisfied for 5  years. Such a mechanism is acceptable in principle and  technical coordination has been planned. The issues of  compensations for the tactical and strategic nuclear weapons  were discussed as one package.    Today it is still early to mention any specific sum because  no final calculations have been made and they have not been  coordinated with experts. Ukraine's representatives believe  that these could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars  because, according to average world prices, for example, the  price of one kilogram of highly enriched uranium is $15,000.    According to Valeriy Shmarov, the U.S. and Russian sides are  concerned most of all about the issue of Ukraine's pace in  fulfilling the provisions of START I, in particular,  deactivation of the latest SS-24 missiles. Ukraine takes a  clear stand: One can immediately talk about the types [as  received] after the reservations formulated by the Supreme  Council are fulfilled.    Already today Ukraine is making specific steps toward  nuclear  arms reduction: The deactivation of SS-24 missiles is under way  -- 17 such missiles have been withdrawn from combat duty and put  under control, and by the end of the year their number will  reach 20. As a matter of fact, two regiments will be disarmed.  This is evidence of Ukraine's course toward a non-nuclear  status. It is ready to further continue this work but it hopes  for adequate moves on the part of the partners, the United  States and Russia. In particular, Valeriy Shmarov remarked that  the pace of elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine depends  very much on financial assistance. At present it is  insufficient. The aid is mainly rendered in the form of  consultations, and delivery of computer or space communications  systems. The following problems, however, remain unsolved:  What is to be used to transport the dismantled warheads, where  is the fuel to be taken, and where is the money to come from?    The Ukrainian side does not shrink from the opinion that  $2.5  billion should be spent on complete nuclear disarmament,  including the social protection of servicemen, restoration of  order on the territories, etc. Today, due to the economic  crisis, it is difficult for Ukraine to shoulder such a burden  and at the same time to abide by the fixed terms. However, the  members of the Ukrainian delegation emphasized that despite the  economic difficulties the START I treaty will be unconditionally  fulfilled. If Ukraine raises the issue of financial aid, then  it only has in mind speeding up the pace of nuclear weapons  elimination. Ukraine will further carry out voluntary  disarmament under conditions of universal support.    According to the deputy prime minister, the current  consultations failed to formulate the issue on political  guarantees in a clear-cut manner. However, he expressed  satisfaction with the relatively high level of representation of  the delegations which took part in the negotiations and also the  high level of competence of the experts who arrived with the  U.S. and Russian delegations. As Valeriy Shmarov indicated, he  hopes that by such a composition it will be possible to draft a  document that can be submitted to the top leaders of the states  for signing.    The participants in the meeting agreed to continue their  work  in one month's time. However, the Ukrainian representatives are  today already preparing information based on the materials of  the consultations for Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk, because  at the meeting of the CIS heads of state in Ashgabat the  Ukrainian side intends to raise materials from the trilateral  talks for a dialogue between the Russian and Ukrainian  presidents, although the discussion of this issue was not  planned in advance.</p>

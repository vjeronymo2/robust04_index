			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: US economy The slide in US equities following President Bill Clinton's outline proposals for reducing the budget deficit looks like the response of an over-valued market. Income tax increases now proposed go far beyond the millionaires tax promised in campaign rhetoric. Yet that should hardly come as a surprise. An energy tax and higher corporation tax were also bound to be unpopular. Still, a package which reduced the deficit by Dollars 145bn over 4 years might be expected to shave only a fraction of a percentage point from growth. Wall Street fears that by raising taxes on the middle class now the President risks pushing the economy back into recession. The big car makers were among the hardest hit yesterday on just such sentiment. If higher corporate taxes also lead companies to rein back investment plans, the strong earnings recovery now factored into share prices could be cast into doubt. With so much already in the price, the equity market can not be blamed for worrying. The greater danger, though, is that the long process of horse-trading between the White House and Congress leaves the deficit to grow unchecked. The Federal Reserve has indicated a deal on the deficit might leave room for lower interest rates - especially if employment growth remains sluggish. Without a deal the Fed may be more inclined to send rates higher. On a prospective yield of less than 3 per cent, US equities would then look vulnerable indeed.</p>

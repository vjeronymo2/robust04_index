			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / The Markets: Japan and US seek the right balance - Global Investor Even as the US puts the finishing touches to its latest Caribbean adventure this week, it will take another step nearer the brink with a rather more powerful adversary. No lives are at risk in the trade conflict between the US and Japan, but the implications for world currency markets are far-reaching. The two countries have until September 30 before the US has to decide whether to impose sanctions against Japan. This week Mr Yohei Kono, the Japanese Foreign Minister, will meet President Clinton and Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, to give new urgency to the framework talks. The markets will watch the meetings with keen interest. Past trade showdowns between the economic superpowers were fairly predictable affairs. The US would fulminate about Japan's enormous bilateral trade surplus and threaten retribution if serious action was not taken to redress it. At the last minute, Japan would usually cave in to one or two fairly meaningless demands and the crisis would be over. Meanwhile Japan's trade surplus would go on rising. But that changed in February this year. In an uncharacteristically unsporting manner, Japan refused to play the game by the usual rules and would not agree to the US demands for quantitative criteria by which to judge progress in increasing market access in key areas - hence the renewed brinkmanship this week. Another stalemate this week would have obvious consequences for currencies. The yen would stay punishingly high, or might even rise further as investors sensed a real trade war. But what would happen if the talks achieved some sort of compromise? Presumably the dollar would initially recover. But then what? That still depends on what happens to the trade imbalance between the two countries. At first sight, that looks like a controversial remark. For the last year, so-called economic fundamentals such as trade flows, seem to have had little to do with currency movements. Japan's trade surplus has fallen in yen terms in six of the eight months of 1994, bringing the total decline for the year to more than 6 per cent. But in that same period, the yen has appreciated by more than 10 per cent against the dollar and more than 5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. Though this seems to confirm one's worst suspicions concerning the capricious behaviour of financial markets, there is a rational explanation. Most past experience suggests that currencies do follow trade, but after a time lag. The last time the trade surplus peaked, in the middle of 1987, the yen continued to rise until early 1989. Sentiment eventually moved against the Japanese currency as the trade surplus declined by more than 30 per cent over four years. The reason for the delay is the very understandable one that investors decide to wait before changing direction to see whether trade flows really have shifted for the foreseeable future. Currently investors are far from sure that the Japanese trade surplus is on a firmly downward trend, and with good reason. A popular argument, that has the same specious attraction for some economists that historical materialism once had for others, is that there is something inevitable about a falling Japanese trade surplus. The restructuring of Japanese industry, deregulation and the 'hollowing out' caused by the high yen are changing the underlying nature of the Japanese economy and will eventually cut internal and external financial surpluses. In such circumstances the yen should head back down towards the Y110-Y120 to the dollar range, or even lower. This sanguine outlook may be justified by a very long-term view, but in the more immediate future (the next year or two being more meaningful for most investors) the outcome is far from assured. The strong recovery in the US and the continuing rapid growth in demand in Asia are outweighing the effects of the stronger yen. Thanks to rapid demand growth and higher inflation in those regions, Japanese companies are able to offset the higher prices caused by the stronger currency by pushing up sales. The country's trade surplus with the US has risen for six straight months, and with Asia for three consecutive months. Exports to the US were 13 per cent higher in the first eight months of the year than in the same period of last year. The one principal market that has been weak is Europe - exports have fallen for 22 consecutive months. But, as the European economies recover, that decline is bottoming out. Some of the extra demand abroad will, of course, be met by more overseas production. But Japanese companies at home still have enormous overcapacity and it is inconceivable that they will not continue to expand exports as world demand strengthens further. That leaves imports. If they rise at a much faster rate than exports then the surplus will of course fall. In the first eight months of the year they did indeed outstrip export growth. But that increase was the result, not so much of the opening up of the Japanese markets to greater import penetration as to the yen's sharp rise, which cut the cost of imports. In other words, a Y100 to the dollar exchange rate only just began to cut the surplus. As exporters continue to benefit from faster growth, the yen will need to rise further, or at least stay at its current level to make serious inroads into the trade surplus. Put another way, if the slight decline in the trade surplus this year were to lead investors to drop yen for dollars, pushing the yen towards the Y120 to the dollar level, the increase in imports would be halted abruptly, the surplus would rise again and the yen would climb back up. Until there is much clearer evidence of a decisive shift in trade imbalances  -and that will not come about until there is a real change in the way Japan's economy works - the dollar looks only marginally more attractive than the Haitian goude.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total return in local currency to 15/9/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          % change over period            US   Japan   Germany   France    Italy      UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week     0.09    0.04      0.09     0.10     0.16    0.09 Month    0.39    0.18      0.41     0.47     0.80    0.43 Year     2.59    2.59      5.81     6.19     8.25    5.78  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week    -0.08    0.28     -0.32    -0.23     0.64    -0.67 Month    0.26    0.59     -0.45    -0.30     1.01     0.23 Year    -1.42    2.25      2.40     0.57     1.28     0.99  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week    -0.25    0.29     -0.21    -0.32     1.08    -1.25 Month   -0.45    1.21     -1.20    -1.68     0.74    -0.32 Year    -5.34    1.90     -1.98    -4.94    -4.46    -2.38  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week      0.4     0.3      -2.5     -0.3      0.3     -2.2 Month     3.0    -3.9      -0.8     -1.0      4.3     -0.9 Year      5.6    -4.3      12.7      0.8      9.5      8.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

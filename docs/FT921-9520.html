			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Bonn rejects pleas from Moscow for more compensation GERMANY appears set for a nasty spat with the new Russian regime over compensation costs for its departing troops. Hard on the heels of a hefty bid for increased German contributions for ex-Soviet soldiers' housing, the once-Soviet commander in former East Germany yesterday put a figure on his demand for a massive pay-off for the decaying barracks, crumbling camps, and polluted exercise grounds his troops will leave behind. Col-Gen Matvei Burlakov told Stern magazine he was looking for no less than DM10.5bn (Dollars 6.6bn) for military buildings and housing. He was prepared to accept a cut of DM2.5bn for 'ecological damage' which had not been repaired by his final departure at the end of 1994. That demand comes on top of the call by Gen Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, for Germany's DM14bn for soldiers' housing back in the former Soviet republics to be increased by another DM7bn for Russia alone  - because that is where most of the troops are heading. Gen Grachev's request was flatly dismissed yesterday by his German counterpart, Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg. Gen Burlakov's demand was also dismissed yesterday by the German Finance Ministry as pure fantasy. Officials quoted a variety of prices which showed how far from reality the claims are. For four barracks in Schlotheim, near Gotha, the general was demanding no less than DM70m. The highest commercial bid for the property was DM180,000. As for a housing complex at Beeskow, outside Frankfurt on the Oder, the Russians were asking for DM5.7bn, whereas the local council was only offering DM60,000. The Soviet military installations are in a decrepit physical state, and vast scrap metal dumps, waste oil lakes, and devastation of military exercise grounds appears to far outweigh any notional value they may have. A joint working group has been attempting to reach an agreement, which German officials suggest might simply amount to both claims cancelling each other out.</p>

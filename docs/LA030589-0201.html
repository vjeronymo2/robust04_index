			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET ANTI-DRINK DRIVE DESTROYED THE WRONG GRAPES  </P> <P> "Human folly" in pursuing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's anti-drinking drive  caused the destruction of 16% of Soviet vineyards, many of which were not  intended to produce wine, the media said Saturday.  </P> <P> The labor daily Trud said table grapes rather than wine grapes suffered the  most during the systematic uprooting of vines spurred by the interest in  promoting Soviet sobriety.  </P> <P> In 1985-87, 533,000 acres of Soviet vineyards, or 16% of the total, were  destroyed, Trud said. The official Tass news agency called it a "human folly."  </P> <P> Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol campaign in May, 1985, raising the price of  vodka and other alcoholic beverages and cutting production within two months of  being named Communist Party chief.  </P> <P> Since then, the Soviets have admitted they erred in treating all alcoholic  beverages alike, and have liberalized the sales of wine, cognac and some other  beverages.  </P></p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / A message from the markets: Yield curve and stock price movements suggest the economy is returning to its pre-ERM pattern Financial markets aren't just a collection of podgy young men in red braces shouting down the telephone. They are also a giant, decentralised information processing system, which reflects and amplifies events in the real world - government decisions, technical innovations, social trends - and enforces a ruthless sort of logical consistency between them. So what are the markets saying now about the events of the past few weeks? How has the information-processing mechanism reacted, now that some, at least, of the data on which it operates have utterly changed? One way of looking at the markets is the yield curve, which shows what happens to interest rates as you lend money for longer and longer periods. Intuitively, you would think that a longer-term loan would command a higher interest rate than a short-term one. That sort of upwards-sloping yield curve is what we've got now. But it wasn't what we had before Britain left the ERM. Short-term rates, which are set by the government, were very high to keep footloose funds in sterling; long-term rates, which are set by investors, were lower - though still high in real terms. Now, the shape of the curve has completely changed. Short-term rates have fallen; longer-term rates have risen slightly to reflect the higher risk of inflation now that Britain is no longer anchored to the D-Mark. The main chart shows the periods in the recent past when the UK had an upward-sloping yield curve. There are two: the early 1980s, and 18 months in 1987-88. In principle, a downward-sloping yield curve chokes off longer-term investment (both in factories and in longer-term securities) because it makes it more attractive to keep your money in cash in a building society than in anything else. An upward-sloping yield curve may - if the slope is steep enough - produce a stampede out of cash and into shares, long-term bonds and anything else which promises a significant return. That factor has underpinned the US stock market for most of the past year, at levels that look pricey by historical standards. It may start to have a similar effect in the UK, too - though Mr Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs says that the impact of an upward-sloping yield curve is less pronounced in Britain, because it has different investment communities. Nonetheless, since the devaluation and the interest rate cuts, the stock market has risen sharply, with a particularly big jump this week as it digested John Major's commitment to growth. The analysts have a tool for exploring what the level of share prices is saying about expectations for growth. It is an equation which attempts to establish the way dividends on shares relate to the interest payment the government makes on the gilt-edged securities that make up the national debt. Gilts pay a fixed rate of interest; equities pay dividends which are expected to grow over time. If you divide the dividend you get on each share by the price you have to pay to buy it, you get a figure known as the dividend yield. Similarly, if you divide the annual interest payments on a gilt-edged security by the current price of that security, you get the yield on gilts. Dividends, unlike interest on gilts, go up and down; and companies can go bankrupt. So a rational investor, in choosing between gilts and equities would take into account not merely the yields on the two sorts of paper, but also how dividends would be likely to rise in future and what the risk is of dividends shrinking or disappearing altogether. That is spelt out in the analysts' formula: the yield on gilts is equal to the dividend yield on equities plus the expected growth rate in those dividends minus the risk premium required to hold equities rather than gilts. We know what some of those elements are immediately, just by looking at the statistics pages of the FT. The yield on medium-term gilts is just under 9 per cent. The dividend yield on the FT-Actuaries All-Share index is just over 4 1/2 per cent. That leaves two gaps: the expected growth rate of dividends and the equity risk premium. The second of these is something that analysts spend hours trying to establish, by looking back over long periods of history. The consensus is that it varies between about 1 per cent and about six per cent. In the short term, it goes up and down like a yo-yo, depending on the collective mood of investors. Let's assume, though, that it's currently close to its 3 per cent average. Plug these numbers into our formula, and we get something like this: 9 = 4 1/2 plus the expected growth rate of dividends minus 3. That enables us to calculate the trend growth in dividends the market is expecting: 7 1/2 per cent per year. So what? Well, the growth in dividends is itself composed of two different things: real growth and inflation. The existence of index-linked gilts allows us to calculate the level of inflation the market is expecting. If you regard the yield on index-linked gilts as the real rate of interest, then you can subtract that from the yield on conventional gilts to get the expected inflation rate. As the chart shows, this has picked up a bit since devaluation, and is now just over 5 per cent. Subtract that from the 7 1/2 per cent figure, and you get an implicit expectation of a real growth in dividends of 2 1/2 per cent a year. That may sound a figure of interest only to coupon-clippers, but in fact it's the best indicator of what the market thinks about the long-term economic outlook. Dividend growth is closely linked, over the long-term, with the real growth of the economy. So that's what the markets are expecting: an economy that grows at a long-term rate of around 2 1/2 per cent, with inflation of 5 per cent a year. That sounds plausible enough, and reasonably familiar: it's how the UK has looked for most of the post-war period. But looking more closely at the way those numbers work is not quite so cosy. Take, for example, a possible set of assumptions suggested by Mr Robin Aspinall, of the stockbrokers Panmure Gordon. Suppose that the UK is entering a slow-growth world, in which we cannot expect real dividend growth to be as high as 2 1/2 per cent. In any case, British companies have been arguably paying out too much in dividends, by historical and international standards, and need a period of holding them down to get their balance sheets back to normal. And in a slow-growth world, the 5 per cent inflation expectation may also prove too high. Suppose that demand is so depressed worldwide that even an inflationary economy like the UK is unable to generate more than 3 per cent inflation over the medium term. Putting those assumptions into the equation leads you - if gilts are still yielding 9 per cent - to a dividend yield of 7 per cent. Arithmetically, that implies a stock market 40 per cent lower than it is today. But of course, in that sort of environment, gilt yields would not stay at 9 per cent; assume they drop to perhaps 7 per cent. That would give you a 5 per cent dividend yield again, but it would make stocks much less attractive than gilts as a place to put your money. That's the pessimistic case. You can use the same sort of numbers to draw much more optimistic conclusions, however. Suppose that gilt yields come down anyway, as the markets adjust to the reduced risk of inflation, and borrowers at the long end switch to cheaper, short-term money, reducing demand and pushing long-term yields lower. If gilt yields drop to, say, 8 per cent, and all the other elements in the equation stay the same, then dividend yields will drop to 4 per cent - which implies a 20 per cent rise in the stock market. Much hangs on gilt yields, in other words. What will happen to them? One influence will be the behaviour of short-term rates. The current state of the interest-rate futures market suggests that investors are expecting shorter-term interest rates to be around 6 1/2 per cent within three to six months. US experience, as Mr Wadhwani says, suggests that a drop in short-term rates eventually tugs the whole yield curve down; if that happens here, gilt yields will eventually move down in sympathy with the short end of the market. On the other hand, says Mr Paul Walton of James Capel, there are two worrying upward pressures on gilt yields. One is the government's need to borrow; the second is the historic relationship with German bond yields. The last time the pound was floating and there was a public-sector deficit, in the early to mid-1980s, the spread between the two rates was close to 4 percentage points. Today, it is just over 1 percentage point, the sort of level that prevailed when Britain was firmly locked into the ERM. If the spread rises back towards past levels, with German bond yields unlikely to drop below 6 per cent, then it is hard to see gilt yields falling much. Which makes it more important that companies deliver the 2 1/2 per cent real dividend growth implied by today's numbers. Will they be able to? Perhaps the most striking conclusion to draw from this exercise is that the market seems to be expecting the world to go back to the way it was before Britain joined the ERM and Germany was reunified. That's a perfectly plausible future, of course: it's just that it may not be the right one.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review  of all items in the 21 June issue of the Arabic-language  newspaper Cairo 'AQIDATI that pertain to political Islamic  issues.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. A Muslim Must Not Accuse Others of Apostasy    2. Ulema Committee Meets To Respond to Extremist Thoughts    3. Awqaf Minister Berates Officials for Ignoring  Instructions    4. Ulema To Go To Russian Republic To Teach Islam    5. International Islamic Conference in Alexandria in  August    6. Islamic Writer Urges Muslims To Seek West's Knowledge    7. International Islamic Conference in Cairo in July    8. Columnist Criticizes West's Stance on Bosnia  <H5>  A MUSLIM MUST NOT ACCUSE OTHERS OF APOSTASY </H5> An approximately 2,000 word unattributed report on pages 1, 8,  and 9 of 'AQIDATI notes that the al-Azhar Fatwa Committee ulema  have declared that Islam prohibits a Muslim from accusing  another Muslim of apostasy without genuine and concrete  knowledge. Even if an individual Muslim finds out that another  Muslim is a renegade, he "must not mete out punishment," because  this is a task that must be verified and carried out by  officials in charge of society. Only competent officials have  the means to ascertain that a certain individual is a renegade  and mete out a sanction, the article states. A Muslim who  violates this rule is culpable and is working against true  Islamic teaching.  <H5>  ULEMA COMMITTEE MEETS TO RESPOND TO EXTREMIST THOUGHTS </H5>   A 120-word unattributed report on page 2 says that the ulema  committee that has been formed to respond to the thoughts and  claims of extremists held its first meeting on 15 June, where it  reviewed the books from which the extremists derive their  thoughts. Several named professors and ulema attended the  meeting, which was chaired by Awqaf Ministry Under Secretary Dr.  'Abd-al-Rashid Salim. Salim said that at the end of the  meetings the ministry will compile the ideas crystallized by the  ulema and publish them in booklets for distribution to the  public, the report concludes.  <H5>  AWQAF MINISTER BERATES OFFICIALS FOR IGNORING INSTRUCTIONS </H5>   A 100-unattributed report on page 2 notes that Aqaf Minister  Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub has addressed severe criticism to the  Awqaf departmental chiefs throughout Egypt. He stressed that  they do not follow up the progress of the work in their  departments, particularly regarding preaching, nor do they  comply with the themes of the Friday sermons approved by the  ministry. According to the report, Mahjub described his  instructions to the chiefs as mere ink on paper. The report  says that these chiefs are expected to be replaced.  <H5>  UELMA TO GO TO RUSSIAN REPUBLIC TO TEACH ISLAM </H5>   A 70-word report on page 2 states that the Awqaf Ministry  has  decided to send a number of ulema to the Checheno-Ingush  Republic to promote Islam. Awqaf Ministry Diector General  'Ulaywa said that the goal is to increase the amount of  religious information for Muslims, teach them Arabic, and  project the genuine picture of Islam.  <H5>  INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC CONFERENCE IN ALEXANDRIA IN AUGUST </H5>   A 100-word report by Majdi Za'tar on page 3 of 'AQIDATI says  that the largest international Islamic gathering organized by  the Egyptian Awqaf Ministry will meet in Alexandria in  mid-August under al-Azhar Mosque Rector Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq.  Awqaf Minister Dr. Mahjub said that more than 50 Islamic  affairs ministers and representatives of 100 Arab and European  countries will attend the conference. Za'tar concludes that the  conference will discuss the Islamic call and cooperation with  other religions.  <H5>  ISLAMIC WRITER URGES MUSLIMS TO SEEK WEST'S KNOWLEDGE </H5>   In an 800-word article on page 7, Islamic writer Dr.  Muhammad  'Amarah exhorts Muslims to seek knowledge and learning so that  our nation can rise and revive the Islamic civilization. He  argues that it is wrong to blindly imitate and be subservient to  the West, but we should seek the West's useful and positive  knowledge while not forgetting our roots and spiritual values.  Thus we will not be blind "imitators or subservient to the  West" and, at the same time, we will not "isolate or close  ourselves" to the scientific progress of the West, 'Amarah  concludes.  <H5>  INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC CONFERENCE IN CAIRO IN JULY </H5>   A 2,000 word report by Muhammad al-Abnudi and Musa Hal on  page 10 of 'AQIDATI's 21 June issue notes that an international  conference for the Islamic call will be held in Cairo in  mid-July. The report says that this is the first conference to  be devoted to the Islamic call and ways of promoting it. Awqaf  Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub said that the conference will  discuss ten issues. The reporters then interview several ulema  from the al-Azhar and the Awqaf Ministry, who spell out their  views on the issues that the conference should debate.  <H5>  COLUMNIST CRITICIZES WEST'S STANCE ON BOSNIA </H5>   In a 200-word article entitled "Peace in Bosnia" on page 20,  columnist 'Adil Dayf maintains that the way the European  countries and the United States continue to deal with the  Bosnian crisis shows that they are trying "to impose a de facto  solution" on the Bosnian people. This is "a gross injustice" to  the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he says, particularly after  they have lost so many of their sons along with large tracts of  their territory as a result of aggression by the Serbs and  Croats. Peace in Bosnia, Dayf concludes, requires the  deterrence of the aggressors, return of the territory they  usurped, and the lifting the ban on arms for the Muslims.</p>

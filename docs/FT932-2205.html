			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Loan-back boost INVESTORS in loan-back business expansion schemes, who feared retrospective legislation to ban the schemes, will be pleased that proposed amendments to the Finance Bill were ruled out of order this week. Loan-back schemes allowed investors to exit from investments after six months instead of five years. The most radical proposal was put forward by Michael Stern, Conservative MP for Bristol North West, who said he was concerned about tax avoidance measures. Stern said this week he had feared Labour could win a vote on retrospective legislation to ban the schemes at committee stage, as some Tory MPs would be ineligible to vote because of their own investment in loan-back BES schemes. He tabled a proposal which he expected to be acceptable to Labour, with the intention of withdrawing it to pre-empt a similar proposal from them. Labour said Stern's comments were 'complete rubbish' and that it knew that retrospective legislation of this type would not be acceptable. Its own more modest proposals to backdate it by up to a fortnight before the Budget were also ruled out of order. However, the 3,000 or so investors in two schemes issued by National Westminster bank and BZW, will be disappointed that John Watts, conservative MP and chairman of the Treasury select committee, withdrew a proposal which would have made the schemes eligible for tax relief. Although shares in the two schemes had been allotted by the Budget deadline, the Inland Revenue says they were not issued because the shareholdings were not listed in the companies' register of members by the Budget deadline. Watts' proposal was that the word 'issued' should be changed to 'allotted.' He withdrew the proposal because he did not think the committee atmosphere conducive to a favourable outcome. NatWest and BZW said this week that they were continuing their legal action against the Inland Revenue to try to reverse its decision that the schemes are ineligible for tax relief. New BES offers this week include a contracted exit and a trading scheme. Lady Margaret Tenancies sponsored by Capital Ventures aims to raise Pounds 15m to buy houses in Cambridge from St John's college. Investors are given a contracted exit of Pounds 1.17 for every Pounds 1 invested after five years. Smiles Traditional Inns, sponsored by Rowan Dartington, will buy six to eight pubs in the Bristol/Avon area under an agreement with Smiles Brewing. The latter has been given an option to buy the pubs so that investors will receive a cash distribution of 175p per 100p invested. If Smiles does not exercise the option, it is proposed the company be liquidated.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Permanent Interest Bearing Shares  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Stock                       Coupon           Minimum        Issue date                            (gross %)         (pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bradford &amp; Bingley           13.00            10,000          30/9/91 Bradford &amp; Bingley           11.63            10,000          29/6/92 Bristol &amp; West               13.38             1,000         11/12/91 Bristol &amp; West               13.38             1,000         31/10/91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Britannia (1st)              13.00             1,000          13/1/92 Britannia (2nd)              13.00             1,000          8/10/92 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs          11.75            50,000         21/10/92 Coventry**                   12.13             1,000          28/5/92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First National               11.75            10,000           4/5/93 Halifax                      12.00            50,000          23/1/92 Leeds Permanent              13.63            50,000           3/6/91 Leeds &amp; Holbeck              13.38             1,000          31/3/92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Newcastle                    12.63             1,000           8/9/92 Newcastle                    10.75             1,000          15/6/93 North of England             12.63             1,000          23/6/92 Skipton                      12.88             1,000          27/2/92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Stock                      Issue price        Price*         Yield*                              (pence)          (pence)      (gross, %)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bradford &amp; Bingley           100.20           128.25          10.14 Bradford &amp; Bingley           100.13           115.25          10.09 Bristol &amp; West               101.79           125.50          10.66 Bristol &amp; West               100.34           125.50          10.66  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Britannia (1st)              100.42           123.50          10.53 Britannia (2nd)              107.13           123.50          10.53 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs          100.96           114.00          10.31 Coventry**                   100.75           114.25          10.61  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First National               100.25           103.25          11.38 Halifax                      100.28           121.00           9.92 Leeds Permanent              100.00           133.50          10.21 Leeds &amp; Holbeck              100.23           125.00          10.70  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Newcastle                    100.45           123.25          10.24 Newcastle                    100.32           102.25          10.51 North of England             100.14           121.25          10.41 Skipton                      100.48           117.00          11.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett. *Purchase price as at morning of June 17; excludes accrued interest **includes stamp duty payable on Coventry pibs only  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVE APPLE ITS DUE  </P> <P> Regarding the Feb. 19 story, "Apple: Has It Lost Its Bite?":  </P> <P> I don't know how many articles I've read about Apple that cite the company's  visionary film clip of the futuristic, notebook-sized, talking computer called  Knowledge Navigator, then disparage Apple President John Sculley for his lack  of vision and, finally, conclude that Macintosh technology is fine for  yesterday but not tomorrow.  </P> <P> The ridiculousness of these contradictory points has never been made so clear  to me than by The Times' accompanying article about Apple's new Hyper TV. This  software and hardware technique makes real-time video images appear on the  screen of a Macintosh. This dramatic technological feat is one of the parts  required to make the Knowledge Navigator work.  </P> <P> I submit that: Apple's vision is to make the Knowledge Navigator; that Sculley  will be celebrated for fostering this vision, and that the Macintosh technology  is evolving more rapidly toward this end than most people suspect.  </P> <P> ROBERT W. BURKE  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 6 (AA) -- The Foreign Ministry on  Monday [6 June] said that a final solution in Cyprus can only be  reached with the free will of the Turkish Cypriot community.    A Foreign Ministry statement said that some declarations  claimed to have been made by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin are  untrue.    The press on Monday had said that President Rauf Denktas of  the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] said "if southern  Cyprus joins European Union [EU], we will join Turkey" and that  Cetin answered by saying "let's see if the TRNC people will then  support Denktas."    The statement said these allegations were untrue.    "Turkey believes that any decision on the membership of the  Greek Cypriot to the EU without the knowledge or agreement of  the Turkish Cypriots will hurt the talks process to solve the  issue," the statement also added.</p>

Commenting today on NATO's decision to give the Serbs 10  days  to withdraw or face an air strike and on Russia's request for an  urgent Security Council meeting to discuss the demilitarization  of Sarajevo, Musa said Egypt and the Islamic countries will  oppose any attempt to hinder the end of the Serbian aggression.  He explained that if the attempts to delay things continue,  then the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims must be lifted.    He stressed that UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus  Butrus-Ghali  has a Security Council mandate to use force to protect UN forces  and populated areas and that this mandate is sufficient,  especially so in light of NATO's offer to use its resources in  this regard.    Foreign Ministry sources said 'Amr Musa has asked Dr. Nabil  al- 'Arabi, Egypt's permanent delegate at the United Nations, to  convey to the UN secretary general and Security Council  president Egypt's viewpoint on attempts to delay the NATO  decision.    The sources added that Musa asked Egypt's permanent delegate  at the United Nations to hold consultations with the Islamic  countries' Liaison Group to adopt a clear stance on the issue.</p>

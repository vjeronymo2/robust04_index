			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel says 'fatigue' is new danger THE Uruguay Round faces the danger of unravelling because of 'fatigue, frustration, disenchantment and missed deadlines', Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), said in Lausanne yesterday. Addressing the Business Council for Sustainable Development, Mr Dunkel called for trade negotiators to 'display political courage' by recognising that nothing can be achieved by further delay in completion of the long-blocked round. He pointed to a recent assessment by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that the draft Uruguay Round agreement, tabled at the end of last year, would increase trade flows by Dollars 195bn (Pounds 110bn) a year - with Dollars 90bn of that benefiting developing countries, and the hard-pressed countries of central and eastern Europe.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: DFS to be floated with market value of Pounds 200m - Family own all the shares and will sell about half MR GRAHAM Kirkham, an already seriously rich 48-year-old miner's son from Yorkshire, is about to join the ranks of the super-rich. He is executive chairman of DFS Furniture, which makes and sells upholstered furniture. DFS is planning a stock market flotation before Christmas expected to value it at more than Pounds 200m. Mr Kirkham and his family own all the shares and will sell about half. The group has no borrowings and has expanded entirely from cashflow since it was founded in 1969. It is now the largest upholstered furniture retailer in the UK, with more than 5 per cent of a highly fragmented market. No new money is being raised by the company at the flotation. Mr Jon Massey, chief operating officer, says it does not need any. Mr Kirkham, who says he has never borrowed a penny either corporately or personally, took a salary in the latest reported financial year of Pounds 5.72m. He is somewhat embarrassed to be caught wearing a Rolex watch, and by a newspaper article that described a plutocratic lifestyle he says was pure fiction. But he laughs off the inaccuracies - he never tipped a Monte Carlo waiter Pounds 1,000, he says, it was Pounds 2,500. Once DFS is public, Mr Kirkham will be on a more suitable salary of Pounds 200,000, initially with a three-year contract. He will also receive dividends on his remaining shareholding. His high salary in the past was in part instead of dividends. Mr Kirkham attributes his success to a good idea and a lot of hard work. He says his increased wealth will not affect his commitment to the business. He left school at 16 with no O levels and went to work in a furniture shop that eventually became part of the Harris Queensway group. Frustrated at a lack of career prospects, he set up his own business under the name of Northern Upholstery in an old billiard hall near Doncaster, making the furniture upstairs and selling it downstairs. Important to its success is the wide range of styles on offer, with a price range for a three-piece suite of Pounds 900 to Pounds 3,500. DFS has close links with its suppliers, fostered by paying them speedily, giving it exclusive styles and fabrics, and manufactures up to 20 per cent of its stock itself. Another factor is customer service. Staff training is a priority and, unusually, the group does not employ part-time sales people. The group spends heavily on advertising to attract customers, but is careful not to open stores too close together. Mr Kirkham says going public is a natural step in DFS's progression, allowing employees to own shares and giving the group 'a wider shareholder base which is more appropriate to a business of its size'. He admits to having discussed the step with his merchant bank, J. Henry Schroder Wagg, for the past six years. He believes it is essential to go public to maximise the chain's potential. DFS wants to expand the 24-store chain, which is concentrated in the north of England, the Midlands and East Anglia, to cover the whole country. This could take the group to about 80 stores. However, Mr Massey says it will continue to finance its expansion internally. Acquisitions are possible, but not the main focus of the company. While other furniture retailers have suffered in the recession - some of them failing spectacularly - DFS has increased operating profits from Pounds 7.7m in the year to end-July 1990 to Pounds 13.6m in 1992. Mr John Richards, retail analyst at NatWest Securities, which is broker to the issue, is forecasting an operating profit for 1993 of Pounds 18m. He says: 'DFS should be capable of sustaining a self-financed 15 per cent per annum average growth rate through to the late 1990s.' DFS has appointed Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman of the Iceland Frozen Foods chain, as a non-executive director. Another two will be appointed, one before the flotation. A finance director will also be signed up, taking on the role Mr Massey had occupied.</p>

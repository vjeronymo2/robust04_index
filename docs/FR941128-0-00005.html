			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Severity Levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing examples of harassment and intimidation in Supplement VII of the NRC Enforcement Policy focus on the level of management involved in the discrimination. Additional examples are warranted to address other considerations associated with discrimination. Example B(9) will be added as a Severity Level II example to address violations involving a hostile work environment. Such a violation may be very significant because the failure by licensee's management to correct a hostile work environment can have a potentially significant adverse impact on employees raising issues. In such cases employees may not believe that they are free to raise concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplement VII does not currently address threats of discrimination or restrictive agreements, both of which are violations under NRC regulations such as 10 CFR 50.7(f). Example C(10) is being added as a Severity Level III example to address such violations. This type of violation is being categorized at a Severity Level III because the potential impact on future protected activity may be of significant regulatory concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some discrimination cases may occur which, in themselves, do not warrant a Severity Level III categorization. Example D(6) is being added as a Severity Level IV example to address these situations. An example of such a case might be a single act of discrimination involving a first-line supervisor, in which the licensee promptly investigates the matter on its own initiative, takes prompt, decisive corrective action to limit the potential chilling effect, and thereby provides a clear message to other supervisors and employees that such conduct will not be tolerated. Another example might involve a threat of adverse action against an employee for going around the supervisor to raise a concern; if the licensee took prompt, aggressive corrective action before any adverse action was taken toward the employee, such a case might be considered as having minimal potential for a widespread chilling effect. These cases would be categorized at a Severity Level IV because they are of more than minor concern and, if left uncorrected, could lead to a significant regulatory concern. Therefore, the Enforcement Policy is being changed to provide the flexibility to classify less significant discrimination violations as Severity Level IV. Such cases would normally be considered for exercising enforcement discretion if warranted under section VII B(7). However, citations would normally be made if one of the four exceptions in that section were applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Miscellaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Enforcement Policy is also being changed to reflect current Commission practice on consultation concerning proposed enforcement actions involving or relating to Office of Investigation (OI) reports. This change is being made to Section III.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final policy statement does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).

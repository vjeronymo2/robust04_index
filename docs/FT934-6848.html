			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A fragrant, but complex, monopoly Sir, Both your leader writer ('Perfume cartel', November 12) and, indeed, your legal correspondent ('Whiff of controversy hangs in the air', November 16) appear to be under the impression that a 'complex monopoly' and a cartel are the same thing. In fact, under the admittedly rather convoluted provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973, unless the Monopolies and Mergers Commission finds that there is a 'monopoly situation' (a technical term defined in ss. 6 to 8 of the Act), it has no jurisdiction at all to pursue an investigation under the monopoly provisions of the Act. In a simple case, there will be a 'monopoly situation' if one person has 25 per cent or more of the market; however, there will also be a 'monopoly situation' if two or more companies together have 25 per cent or more of the market and they all 'conduct their respective affairs' in a similar fashion. In the latter situation, there is a so-called 'complex monopoly'. In the recent inquiry into fine fragrances, it was clear from the outset that the MMC would almost certainly conclude that there was a 'complex monopoly' as all the suppliers of fine fragrances operated some form of selective distribution. Indeed, many of the perfume houses, including Parfums Givenchy which I represented, made no serious attempt to argue the contrary view before the MMC. On the other hand, we argued very vigorously indeed that the 'complex monopoly' did not operate in any way against the public interest. After an extremely thorough investigation which extended over a period of nine months and which involved consideration of evidence from many different sources, not just the perfume houses, the MMC concluded that it was indeed the case that nothing which it had found was against the public interest. Superdrug and others had, of course, mounted a very effective campaign in the press and elsewhere in support of the contrary view. It is perhaps only to be expected, therefore, that when the MMC's findings failed to match the expectations fuelled by that campaign, it came as a surprise to many people.

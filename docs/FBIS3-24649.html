			<p>The  English-language newspaper THE JERUSALEM POST, which has a  strong right-wing orientation and as Israel's only English-  language newspaper is regarded as influential among foreign  readers, has rebuked the Israeli Foreign Ministry for its recent  decision to cancel more than 1,000 of the ministry's 1,200  subscriptions to the paper's weekly international edition and to  reduce subscriptions to its weekly French edition from 125 to 14  (both papers are routinely distributed among Israeli legations  abroad).  In an article on 21 January, POST editor David Bar-Ilan  reported that Foreign Ministry spokesman Yosi Gal had attributed  the cancellations to budgetary considerations, but rejected this  explanation as "bald lying in public by a government official."  Bar-Ilan called the ministry's action retaliation against an  "unfriendly paper."  Casting further doubt on Gal's statement,  Bar-Ilan said that the ministry had "flatly rejected" POST  publisher Yehuda Levi's offer to send the paper free of charge to  all ministry subscribers.  Moreover, Bar-Ilan noted that the  ministry had almost simultaneously doubled its subscriptions to  Israel's weekly Spanish-language newspaper AURORA, which he  depicted as "super-dovish" and "enthusiastically supportive of  government policies."     To reinforce his claim that the Foreign Minstry's curtailment of  subscriptions was a political act--rather than a cost-cutting  exercise--Bar-Ilan said that an undated article by Sarah Helm in  the British daily THE INDEPENDENT had reported that Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres is concerned about the POST's effect on  international opinion, since, "as the only English-language  daily, it is an international opinion-former" and has "declared  war" on the POST because the paper "is undermining the  government's peace efforts."  According to Bar-Ilan, Helm  reported that the Foreign Ministry believes that a 10 December  POST article about an alleged Israeli Government plan to return  to the Palestinians all the territories seized in 1967 had been  "planted" to "stir up" opposition to the Israel-PLO Declaration  of Principles among Jews abroad.

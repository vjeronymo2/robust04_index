			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Sweden reports rise in its export orders THE Swedish economy has started to see the first signs of a recovery in export orders, according to a report by the National Institute of Economic Research yesterday. For the first time since autumn 1989, more Swedish companies saw an increase in export orders than reported a decrease, according to the Institute's Business Tendency Survey for the first quarter of 1992. The pick-up in export orders came mainly from the US and newly industrialised countries, the Institute said. While domestic demand remains weak, companies expect export orders to increase in the second quarter of 1992, particularly for forestry products and engineering goods. The survey reports a further fall in industrial production, with 30 per cent of companies reporting cuts in volumes, particularly in the construction materials, engineering, and metal industry sectors. 'The production plans for the current quarter and for the second half of 1992 do point to an increase but any expansion this year may be markedly restricted by excessively large stocks of finished goods,' the report says. Nearly half the 1,862 companies questioned have cut jobs. Unemployment in Sweden rose to 4.2 per cent in March, the highest since records began in the 1970s, according to the Central Statistics Bureau.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Lockheed confident of winning Hercules battle Lockheed, the US aerospace manufacturer, said yesterday it was optimistic that the UK government would buy its latest generation Hercules C-130J transport aircraft to replace half its ageing Hercules fleet. The order for up to 30 aircraft has been bitterly fought between Lockheed and British Aerospace, which wanted the government to buy the European Future Large Aircraft. Lockheed said: 'Because the FLA is not available in time the decision is between refurbishing the existing Hercules or buying new C-130Js. Refurbishment does not stack up and no other country has backed it.' The Ministry of Defence refused to comment beyond saying a final decision had not been made. It is understood that an MoD evaluation committee has recommended purchase of the C-130J. That recommendation will go to ministers and an inter-departmental committee, with a final decision expected before Christmas. The committee is likely to recommend that if the MoD does choose the C-130J, Britain should rejoin the FLA project which it left in 1989. It is understood that at the Franco-British summit at Chartres last Friday Mr John Major came under pressure from President Francois Mitterrand for Britain to rejoin the project. If Britain rejoins development funds might be made available from the Department of Trade budget as launch aid, which would not be in breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules covering government funding of aircraft projects. British Aerospace, the company that would build the wings for the FLA if Britain joined the project, has argued strongly that its lead in wing design would be lost to French and German companies if the RAF bought the US aircraft. It has also argued that all 66 Hercules aircraft would need to be replaced with the FLA if the company was to gain sufficient work to build the wings. That objection might be overcome if Britain agrees to replace its tanker and maritime patrol aircraft with the FLA. BAe has said the FLA would be bigger and faster than the C-130J, and, if the UK became a full member of the programme, it would be worth Pounds 5.5bn and secure 7,500 jobs. BAe said it was continuing to lobby for refurbishment of the existing Hercules fleet until the FLA became available in 2002. BAe has submitted a proposal to the MoD under which it would maintain the Hercules fleet, including a basic refurbishment, at about 20 per cent of the costs estimated by the MoD. BAe has also asked that any decisions be deferred until March, when the full results of a year-long FLA study will become available. The MoD is thought to be sticking to its 1994 deadline, effectively ruling out the FLA for the current competition. BAe apprentices and engineers will be lobbying parliament tomorrow to argue for the FLA.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Ford halts graduate recruitment scheme FORD UK, the leader in the market for new cars, is to withdraw from the 1993 'milk round' system of interviewing university students for future jobs for the first time for 18 years. The company usually takes about 130 graduates a year, and is the largest graduate recruiter known to have withdrawn from the 1993 round, according to the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services. Ford said yesterday it had halted all salaried recruitment 'in view of the continuing weakness in the UK car market, which looks set to continue into next year'. The company will continue to support its sponsorship programme for undergraduates in which about 200 young people participate each year. A leaked internal memorandum says that in 1975, when the company last withdrew from the milk round, it suffered 'considerable loss of goodwill and great difficulty in regaining our reputation as a progressive employer on the university campuses'. Ford is expected to announce today that it is cutting about 3,500 jobs at its UK car plants as part of job reductions across its European operations, union sources said last night. Union leaders are to meet Ford management today.</p>

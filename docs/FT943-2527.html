			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Multimedia moves into OJ's courtroom When the double murder trial of OJ Simpson, the former American football star, gets under way in Los Angeles an elaborate multimedia system will be used to present evidence to the judge, jury and millions of armchair jurists watching the courtroom drama on television. Simpson's lawyers say that they plan to use the system, provided by Trial Presentation Technologies, to display evidence on a large projection screen in the Los Angeles courtroom. The same images will also be displayed on smaller monitors for the judge and lawyers, and be available to TV networks. Instead of propping up a chart, holding up a photograph or simply referring to documents, in the conventional manner, Simpson's lawyers will be able to select computer graphics, text, video or animations previously stored on computer discs. Diagrams of the murder scene, or of the now-infamous OJ Simpson estate, will be displayed on a 67in video screen. Text of the proceedings will be translated automatically from the phonetic system used by the official court reporter, and will be available to the judge and lawyers should they wish to refer back to previous testimony without delay. This is likely to be the second time that the multimedia system has been used in a US criminal trial. The first occasion is expected to be the trial of two off-duty policemen accused of shooting a highway patrol officer, scheduled to start in Los Angeles today. But the system has been used widely in civil cases, where it has proved valuable in presenting complex issues to juries, says Pamela Huenke, chief executive of Trial Presentation Technologies, a Los Angeles company that is pioneering the use of multimedia technology in the courtroom. The technology has important advantages, she says. 'Typically, jurors do not see exhibits until the end of the trial when they go into the deliberation room.' The computer system enables them to view the evidence as it is being discussed. In addition, visual displays typically help people to retain more information during lengthy court proceedings. The equipment which is to be installed in Judge Lance Ito's court for the Simpson trial will be worth about Dollars 120,000 to Dollars 185,000, but will be loaned to the court by TPT. The opportunity to demonstrate the system in what is expected to be America's most avidly-viewed trial is regarded as sufficient reward. Lawyers are conservative creatures, says Huenke, and have been slow to adopt technologies that are already established in business. She is confident, however, that the Simpson trial will demonstrate the advantages of multimedia and put to rest concerns that it detracts from the serious nature of the proceedings.</p>

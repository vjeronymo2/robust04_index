She expresseed satisfaction at the declaration of the Polish  foreign minister that Poland will actively participate in the  work of the Council of Europe and will continue economic, legal  and democratic reforms in the country. She stated that according  to the Council of Europe the line of the Polish foreign policy  that had been initiated in 1990 is good.    Earlier on Tuesday, the second and final day of her official  visit to Poland, Ms Lalumiere was received by President Lech  Walesa. She told newsmen after the meeting that the president  pointed to the unstable situation in central and eastern Europe,  especially in Russia and Ukraine. According to her, Walesa  stressed that the West did not make enough efforts to help these  countries in overcoming their internal problems.    Lalumiere's talks with President Walesa, Foreign Minister  Andrzej Olechowski, the speakers of the Sejm and Senate and the  Sejm Committee of Foreign Affairs were dominated by the issue of  admitting the states that had emerged after the collapse of the  Soviet Union to the Council of Europe.    The sides agreed that these countries should become members  of the Council of Europe if they pledge to respect the  democratic principles, pluralism, human rights and fundamental  rights of citizens.    The Polish interlocutors of Ms. Lalumiere, above all the  president, pointed out that the situation in postcommunist  central and eastern Europe is serious and causes concern. They  stressed the necessity of a strong support by the West for  reforms carried out in the postcommunist states, above all in  Russia and Ukraine.    Ms. Lalumiere's talks with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy covered  social charter of the Council of Europe. Both agreed that this  was a boosting tool that contained some European standards,  useful particularly to countries in the period of transition.    During the meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander  Luczak the two focused on joint initiatives to support training  of staff for European institutions. Luczak said a centre of  civic education could be established in Warsaw to promote  tolerance, knowledge of human rights and European integration.    Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Wlodzimierz  Cimoszewicz and Lalumiere discussed the question of Poland's  access to further conventions of European Council.

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> YOUTH PLEADS GUILTY TO AVOID 2ND TRIAL  </P> <P> A 17-year-old Mexican immigrant pleaded guilty Monday in Ventura County  Superior Court to charges that he stabbed a Thousand Oaks nurseryman to death  last spring "in the heat of passion," according to the charge.  </P> <P> A jury found Jose Luis Navarro not guilty last week of first-degree murder in  the slaying of Jose Narvaez, 49.  </P> <P> But Judge Charles R. McGrath declared a mistrial when jurors announced that  they were deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of acquitting Navarro of second-degree  murder.  </P> <P> Navarro decided to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter and use of a deadly  weapon because he wanted to avoid another trial, said his lawyer, Deputy Public  Defender Steve P. Lipson.  </P> <P> "I saw him Friday and he said he thought about it from . . . when the partial  verdict came in and he said he didn't want to go through another trial," Lipson  said.  </P> <P> Navarro testified at his trial that he had sodomized Narvaez on the night of  April 19. But he told jurors that he stabbed Narvaez in self-defense when  Narvaez tried forcibly to sodomize him.  </P> <P> Narvaez was stabbed once in the stomach and three times in the back with a 9  1/2-inch butcher knife.  </P> <P> Several of the jurors believed that "there was an element of self-defense" in  the slaying, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes said Monday. "The vote of the  jury was five for second-degree murder and when you don't have a majority on  the first go-round there's going to be obvious difficulties to get all 12 on  the second" trial, Holmes said.  </P> <P> Holmes said Navarro faces four to 12 years in state prison. Sentencing is  scheduled for Jan. 7.  </P> <P> Navarro was in this country illegally and faces certain deportation upon his  release from prison, Holmes said. MACK REED  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- Koreans' organisations  and Koreans in Americas and Europe are briskly conducting  activities to make this year a year of the great unity of the  nation.    The American Committee on the Korean Question repeatedly  published informations supporting the 10-point programme of the  great unity of the whole nation in December last year and early  this year.    The informations said the 10-point programme is the most  fair  and aboveboard proposal of reunification acceptable to anyone  irrespective of differences in ideology and idea, party  affiliation and religious belief.    The One Korea Movement in a statement said the 10-point  programme indicates the way of ending the national division,  promoting the national interests and achieving security and  prosperity of the Korean nation.    Son Hak-won, chairman of the Society for the Study of the  Chuche Idea of Koreans in the United States, in his address to a  meeting held in Los Angeles in April to celebrate the birthday  of the great leader President Kim Il-song, called on overseas  compatriots to build an independent, democratic, neutral and  denuclearized country by following the spirit of the great  national unity of President Kim Il-song.    A meeting for achieving Korea's reunification under the  banner of the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole  nation also was held in Washington in April, and the 3rd meeting  of the Society for Peaceful Reunification of Korea took place in  Berkeley, the United States.    Organisations of Koreans overseas are briskly conducting  activities to explain and disseminate the 10-point programme of  the great unity of the whole nation.    Organizations of Koreans in Germany published and  distributed  to compatriots the "10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the  Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country" and books  explaining the programme, including "Great Charter of National  Unity" and "New Evolution of Principles of National  Reunification."</p>

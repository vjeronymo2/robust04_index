			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Mar. 9 (YONHAP) -- The third-round U.S.-North  Korea high-level talks, scheduled for March 21, may be put off  until a later date as chances are now slim for the exchange of  special envoys between South and North Korea before the talks.    A Seoul government official said on Wednesday that even if  there is a dramatic inter-Korean accord on the exchange soon, it  would be hard to materialize it before the March 21 talks in  view of a period of time needed in preparing for the exchange.  He noted that it was earlier decided that special envoys would  be exchanged prior to the third-round U.S.-North Korea talks.  "There is no change in this decision on the part of South Korea  and the United States," he said.    At least 15 days' preparatory period is necessary for the  exchange, said the official, adding that this means that even if  the two sides agree on the exchange at the next contact slated  for coming Saturday, March 12, it would be physically impossible  to exchange envoys before March 21. He said it appears North  Korea is trying to drive a wedge into the South Korea-U.S.  cooperative system by deliberately postponing the exchange of  envoys until after March 21.    The official said that if North Korea suggests at Saturday's  contact for the exchange of envoys after March 21, South Korea  and the United States would not turn it down as a breach of  agreement. In such an event, he said, the third-stage  Washington-Pyongyang talks would be put off until after the  materialization of the exchange of envoys. The official added,  however, that if North Korea keeps shunning the exchange even at  the upcoming contact, the recent U.S.-North Korea agreement on  the North Korean nuclear issue would automatically be nullified.    "In this case, there exists the strong possibility that the  conditional suspension of the '94 Team Spirit exercise and the  planned third-round U.S.-North Korea talks would be withdrawn,"  he said.</p>

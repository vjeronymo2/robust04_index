			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAN THOMPSON: OLD TIMES AT HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL  </P> <P> I spent a day and a night at Huntington Memorial Hospital last week for some  tests and I saw a lot of friends on the professional staff.  </P> <P> Coming back to Huntington Memorial is like a class reunion. I have spent a good  deal of time with these people in the last two years what with my various  malfunctions. Maureen in the admitting office is a friend and managed to get me  in my old room, a large one at the end of the corridor with two upholstered  chairs centered by a lamp table and a bathroom with a large bathtub.  </P> <P> Hospital lore has it that it's the room where Bing Crosby once stayed.  </P> <P> People become attached to the areas where they have had a pleasant time under  sometimes difficult circumstances.  </P> <P> When I sailed down the corridor to No. 3500 in my wheelchair, I whooped with  delight at each nurse I recognized. It's a comforting feeling to know that the  same nurses who have taken care of me before are still there -- careful,  professional, knowledgeable, pleasant, funny.  </P> <P> Most people, except the very brave or the very unknowing, are afraid in  hospitals and the staff people who greet the patient with a smile and a  pleasant word are magic workers. Good nurses are surely given a course in  making the patient feel like an instant friend instead of one more added  annoyance in the doctor's day.  </P> <P> A hospital is like a self-contained city. News or tasty gossip makes the tour  of the hospital corridors like a well-aimed laser beam. Within three minutes,  according to carefully monitored tests, a bit of news can start at the front  door and hit the back, not missing an alcove nor a storage closet.  </P> <P> My friends' lives have been making rewarding advances in the two years since I  have been there.  </P> <P> Mary Knight, one of the marvelous nurses on 35, went this year to see her  parents in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.  </P> <P> A nurse named Vicki Young has a 2-year-old named Deanna who is old enough to  have doll tea parties and offer cookies to the doll guests. Last time I saw  Vicki, she was working on her museum-quality collection of miniature furnished  rooms. "I don't have time for them now, with Deanna. I'm too busy going to doll  tea parties," she said.  </P> <P> Sandy Leon, one of my special friends, has a husband who is a pharmacist and a  new baby named Michelle.  </P> <P> Marsia McAtee and her husband have a son named Ryan and a new one name Cinjon.  Marsia coined the name because she liked its sound and now she has been told by  an American Indian friend that it is a well-respected name among his tribe.  Marsia has an Aztec heritage and the second son has red hair. She learned that  Cinjon means rising sun -- a fortuitous name.  </P> <P> Diane Newton and Ruth Wong were on 35 and delights to see. Diane is a Mount St.  Mary's nursing school graduate. My friend Joan Morelli who is normally in  charge on 35 is a marvelous friend and great executive. One time she put a note  on my door after a surgery that said, "No visitors. Zan can't say no, but I  can."  </P> <P> One night a few years ago, when a wild, wind-whipped rain was lashing the  window of my room, a large, burly man came in and brought me apple juice and  graham crackers. He told me that he was descended from Irish brigands. He is a  wonderful nurse named Keith Mooney.  </P> <P> On this last brief visit, I was prowling the halls before the 7 a.m. shift  change and Keith said, "Do you want some coffee?"  </P> <P> Of course I did. Keith knew why I was wandering the halls, a waif looking for  an eye-opening cup.  </P> <P> I'm sure that the other floors in the hospital are filled with friendly,  professional people but these are my own. And I'll bet that nowhere else is  there a young woman from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and an Irish brigand who will  slip you a cup of coffee before the official start of a new day.  </P></p>

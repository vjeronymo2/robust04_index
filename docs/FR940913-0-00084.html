Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to HUD for further HUD utilization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If HUD has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration, unless HUD has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.'')

Such property is ``exempt property.'' Should HUD not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Equipment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the equipment without approval of HUD. When the equipment is no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Activities sponsored by HUD which funded the original project; then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by HUD that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include all of the following.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) A description of the equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Source of the equipment, including the award number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.

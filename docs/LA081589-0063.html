			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> K MART PROFIT FALLS 10.9% IN QUARTER; LOWER SALES CITED  </P> <P> K mart Corp., faced with increased competition from such sources as Wal-Mart  Stores Inc., on Monday reported a 10.9% decline in its second-quarter profit.  </P> <P> The company said lower-than-expected sales in May and higher interest payments  led to the drop.  </P> <P> The nation's second-largest retailer behind Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said its  second-quarter profit came to $145 million on revenue of $7.01 billion during  the period ended July 26. That compared to earnings of $162.8 million on  revenue of $6.68 billion during the same time last year.  </P> <P> For the six months ended July 26, the company's profits were down 15.7%,  falling to $239.1 million from $283.6 million during the same time last year.  </P> <P> Revenue for the period this year totaled $13.07 billion, up 4.4% from last  year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tough Market'  </P> <P> "In the first quarter, we were disappointed by K mart's earnings and we  attributed it to Sears Roebuck and the heavy promotion they had for their new  everyday pricing," said analyst Sally Schaadt of Fourteen Research in New York  City.  </P> <P> "This whole area (of discount retailing) has become extremely competitive," she  said. "It's a tough market."  </P> <P> K mart Chairman Joseph E. Antonini said his company's sales in May fell below  expectations and the cost of borrowing money was higher in the period.  </P> <P> He said things should pick up in the second half of the fiscal year, as the  company develops stronger merchandising programs and increases the use of a  companywide computer link to monitor sales.  </P> <P> K mart operated 4,135 outlets at the end of the period, including K mart  discount stores, Waldenbooks, Builders Square and Pay Less Drug stores.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pressclub" program] </F>   [Excerpts] [Announcer] Good evening, esteemed television  viewers. This week's live relay of our Pressclub roundtable is  taking place on a different day because the Cabinet, headed by  Jozef Moravcik, held its fourth session one day later than  usual. The main point on their agenda was an extraordinarily  important document--a draft government program statement. After  discussing it in detail, the Cabinet approved it at today's  session.    I welcome our guests, who are in the studio to brief us  about  today's session: Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik and Deputy Prime  Ministers Brigita Schmoegnerova and Roman Kovac. I also welcome  our colleagues, the journalists who accepted our invitation.  [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Mr. Prime Minister, could you please assess  realistically the situation and risks you took into account when  drafting the starting analysis of the program document? [passage  omitted]    [Moravcik] From the economic viewpoint, the macroeconomic  viewpoint, the most serious problem is probably maintaining the  budget--that is, the budget's deficit--on a certain acceptable  level. [passage omitted]    What is the situation in this sphere? One considerable  negative element is last year's high deficit of the state  budget. It amounts to roughly 6.8 percent, if I remember the  figure correctly. This means 23 billion korunas [Sk]. If we  add other state budget debts, the overall state debt amounts to  Sk60 billion. This is a big figure, which indeed represents a  certain risk for the future development of our economy.  [passage omitted]    The decline of last year's GDP was roughly 4.1 percent. This  is also a negative factor in developing our economic policy.    A big discrepancy, a big difference between our export and  import, is something very negative, and the Cabinet has to  tackle it, to face this problem. Last year our export fell and  our import increased. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Deputy Prime Minister, what are the main  macroeconomic objectives of the government's policy statement?  [passage omitted]    In the present economic situation, where are the possible  sources for the development of the economy?    [Schmoegnerova] As to the first part of your question, we  have agreed that in our policy statement we would define the  basic macroeconoic objectives in a relatively explicit way. We  pledged that we will try to achieve zero growth of the GDP, keep  the deficit at the level envisaged for this year, and try to  keep inflation within 10 to 13 percent, at most. Also,  unemployment must not exceed the limit envisaged in the budget  for this year.    Further, we have pledged that, in cooperation with the  National Bank of Slovakia, we will try to create conditions to  keep foreign currency reserves at a level that will allow normal  internal convertibility without any additional measures. Our  experience with such measures taken at the beginning of the last  year was rather unfavorable.    We have also pledged to retain a positive balance of  payments.    [Announcer] Deputy Prime Minister, I would like to ask you  what the problems linked to our stand-by loan are. [passage  omitted]    Do you think we will succeed and reach an agreement [with  the  IMF]?    [Schmoegnerova] I think we have never in our history enjoyed  such a favorable situation as the current situation we succeeded  in bringing about. [passage omitted]    Our current attitude toward the IMF is built on a totally  different basis than was the case in the past. This is the  first time in our history that we have put forward our own  economic policy outline. We have analyzed the risks linked to  this economic policy, and we have also presented measures  intended to eliminate those risks. This is a different approach  from that in the past.    Up to now, it was always the other side that presented us  with proposals, and the government accepted them in a passive  way. I am not saying that it was a totally passive acceptance,  but, in substance, it was passive. This, unfortunately, has  applied also to our past dealings with the World Bank, not just  with the IMF.

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Management (Training on Trial): Low marks for slow learners  -Anne Weinstock says trainees with special needs deserve more help Few topics have exercised the minds of Training and Enterprise Councils quite so much as the training of people with 'special' needs. The Tec Operating Manual states that there should be no discrimination against people who cannot learn at the same rate as others. Michael Howard, the employment secretary, insisted that Tecs define in their business plan the specific ways in which they would train disadvantaged groups. However, with little financial incentive, monitoring or evaluation systems, some question his real commitment. The last two years have seen big reductions in Tec budgets, the notional idea being that employers invest more in training. However, the recession has decreased employer contributions for work experience placements. The financing of Tecs is such that the higher the level of qualification attained, the greater the financial reward to the Tec. If Tecs do not meet their targets in terms of qualifications, they can lose 25 per cent of their budgets. Not surprisingly, they concentrate on those who can reach the desired level in the shortest possible time and for the lowest possible price. So what needs to change? We are constantly told that an adaptable and flexible workforce is the key to our future. It follows that our national training system must reflect these characteristics. We need to review the contradictions between the National Vocational Qualifications framework (which allows for recognition of individual achievement) and the funding structure of Tecs (which determines that achievement below a certain level of competence is failure). There is a number of forward-looking Tecs which have introduced flexible training for people with special needs, despite having no financial incentive to do so. But we should not have to depend on their generosity. We should be building on what young people are capable of achieving from their own starting point, rewarding individual progress. Many employers on Tec boards still believe that young people leaving school without even the basic skills of literacy and numeracy are not their 'problem'. It can and often does cost more to train people with 'special' needs. But with the advent of a single Europe and a fall in the number of school leavers, a training framework to maximise the skills of all young people will become an economic imperative. How long it will take those responsible for studying Tecs to realise this, remains to be seen. The early evidence for the 1992-93 contracting round suggests that inequality of opportunity will continue to be the order of the day.

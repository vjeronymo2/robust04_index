Investigators have focused their attention on the Muslim fanatic  group which calls itself "Jihad" or militant Muslim groups which  have been long-standing enemies of Israel.    According to a report, in 1992 members of these groups  detonated a bomb laden truck which they parked in front of the  Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 20 instantly and  wounding 240 others. This method is similar to the one planned  for Thailand. The C-4 explosives used in that explosion are the  same type that were found in the tank on the six-wheel truck in  Bangkok on 17 March.    The method and type of explosive, in addition to support  from  terrorist groups seeking the separation of southern Thailand,  led police to focus on the above mentioned groups. This theory  matches the investigation result which shows that part of the  financial support came from Sungai Kolok District, Narathiwat  Province. Also, there must be support from residents in  Thailand to facilitate travel by the suspects in the country.    The Metropolitan Police investigation team's questioning of  witnesses reportedly resulted in naming four suspects: Mr.  Wudera Wankuwa, Mr. Konsak Ayat Manusuk, Mr. Mohamad Talao, and  Mr. Asmal Dansis Hakare. The Immigration Office has been asked  to check the arrival and departure records of these people.</p>

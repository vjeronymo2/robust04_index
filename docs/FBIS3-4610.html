Speaking before the National Defense Committee of  the National Assembly, Kim said the NSP will also carry out a  five-year intelligence-gathering plan to cope with "the era of  information."    "We will consistently try to improve our ability to collect  and analyze intelligence information while diversifying channels  for exchanges of information as soon as possible," Kim told  lawmakers.    With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, Kim said,  "there is a long way to go before transparency of their nuclear  program is objectively guaranteed."    "The agency will strengthen a 24-hour early warning system  against North Korean provocation in view of the adventurous and  provocative character inherent in the North Korean regime," Kim  said.    At the same time, the agency will boost cooperation in  exchanging information with international organizations and  friendly nations, Kim said.</p>

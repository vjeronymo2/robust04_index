			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Gu Yuezhong (7357 2588 1813)] </F>   [Text] Zhengzhou, 18 May (XINHUA) -- During a fact-finding  tour of rural Henan, Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee  of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and member of the  CPC Central Committee Secretariat, said emphatically: We should  carry out the overall task of the entire party in close  conjunction with the central task of economic construction, and  strengthen party building while, in practice, deepening reform,  promoting development, and maintaining stability so as to ensure  the completion of various reform and construction tasks.    After attending commemorative activities in Zhengzhou and  Lankao on the 30th anniversary of Comrade Jiao Yulu's death, Hu  Jintao, accompanied by Li Changchun, secretary of the Henan  Provincial CPC Committee, inspected some villages in eastern and  northern Henan from 14-18 May. He visited some village and town  enterprises, as well as some peasant households, and was very  pleased to witness rapid economic development, remarkable  improvements in peasants' lives, and strong motivation among  cadres and people there. In Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Jiaozuo, and  Zhengzhou, Hu Jintao held informal discussions with responsible  persons from city, county, township (town), and village party  organizations, during which they studied ways to strengthen and  improve party building, especially the construction of primary  party organizations in rural areas. During his cordial  conversations with grass-roots cadres and people, some peasants  remarked that "we are quite satisfied with our lives now," upon  which he said admonishingly: "While it is good to be satisfied,  you should not be complacent. Do not neglect hard work, thrift,  and arduous struggle after you have become better off. Although  the economy has developed, you should keep breaking new ground  and aim for an even higher level of development." Upon hearing  peasants' complimentary remarks that "the party's policies and  leadership are good," he said: "Given the party Central  Committee's good policies and sound grass-roots bodies, coupled  with concerted efforts by all to achieve a fairly comfortable  standard of living, there is great hope for building a new  socialist countryside."    During his informal discussions with local and grass-roots  leading comrades, Hu Jintao pointed out: The situation across  the country is now favorable as both the leadership and the rank  and file of the entire party are accelerating the pace of  building a socialist market economic structure in accordance  with the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. The  situation in Henan is also favorable. A decade of practice, as  well as some advanced typical experiences which we have come  across over the past few days, fully attest to the fact that  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics -- including his thinking that it is  imperative to uphold and improve the party's leadership, as well  as to strengthen and improve party building, in carrying out  socialist modernization -- is entirely correct. During our  current efforts to further consolidate and improve on the  favorable situation, deepen reform, promote development, and  maintain stability, we should also rely on the party's correct  leadership, as well as on the efforts by party organizations at  all levels and the broad ranks of CPC members to unify and rally  people so that the party's correct policy decisions will be  translated into conscientious popular actions. The party holds  the key to maintaining its basic line for 100 years without  wavering; it also holds the key to deepening reform, promoting  development, and maintaining stability in accordance with the  demands of the basic line. Success in party building will  provide a fundamental guarantee for success in the cause of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Hu Jintao noted: Building up the party in strict  accordance with its basic line is a fundamental experience in  this respect during the new period. To apply this experience,  we should now strengthen all facets of party building, improve  the standards of governance and leadership, and heighten the  rallying power, appeal, and fighting skills of party  organizations at all levels, while closely linking these efforts  with the way we deepen reform, promote development, and maintain  stability in practice. In building up the party, we should take  overall interests into account, submit to and serve overall  interests, improve party building by maintaining and promoting  overall interests, and consolidate and expand overall interests  by strengthening party building.    On strengthening and improving primary party organizations  in  rural areas, Hu Jintao said: Primary party organizations in  rural areas should rally and lead peasants and people toward a  fairly comfortable standard of living, vigorously develop the  rural economy, enrich the collective sector of the economy,  encourage hard work as a way to prosper, follow the path of  common prosperity, develop the "two civilizations," and build a  new socialist countryside, taking these efforts as their own  fundamental tasks. The key to accomplishing these tasks lies in  building up the leadership bodies and in selecting qualified  leaders. With good leaders, we can unify a group of people who,  in turn, can spur on all villagers; we can also constantly open  up new avenues, and bring rapid changes to the less developed  villages. We should show concern for and cherish village  cadres, inspire their initiative, and support and protect  hard-working comrades. Particular efforts should be made to  step up the training of township and village cadres in  accordance with local conditions, so as to improve their quality  in an all-around manner. In light of the realities in rural  areas, we should institute an incentive-based mechanism by which  qualified personnel of remarkable caliber at the grass-roots  level will show their talent and perform meritorious services.  We should take effective measures to ensure a steady source of  village cadres to replenish the existing pool. We should devote  major efforts to cultivating active elements and recruiting  party members from among outstanding youths at the forefront of  production in rural areas, so as to expand the unduly small  ranks of young party members in the countryside. In keeping  with the new situation brought on by changes in rural  development, we should make timely and reasonable adjustments to  the way we establish primary party organizations, actively  explore an effective means to establish various village-level  organizations as part of a complete network with party branches  as the core, and promote the experience of "setting up  organizations in accordance with the law, administering villages  on the basis of established organizations, and exercising  democratic management," so as to gradually institutionalize and  standardize the work of various village-level organizations.    In closing, Hu Jintao said emphatically: We should earnestly  strengthen and improve our leadership over primary organizations  in rural areas. Both the party Central Committee and party  committees at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels  should devote themselves to building up primary organizations in  rural areas. County (city) party committees should all the more  carry out this task unremittingly and effectively.    Accompanying Hu Jintao during his inspection tour were Zeng  Qinghong, director of the CPC Central Committee's General  Office, and Zheng Keyang, deputy director of the CPC Central  Committee's Central Policy Research Office.</p>

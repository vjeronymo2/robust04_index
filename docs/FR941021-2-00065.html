In general, issues that affect policies on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national level are addressed by the central office, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues dealing with regional and local policies, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those of an operational nature, are addressed by the ROs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuous communication between HCFA and the fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediaries and carriers is established through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation workgroups that meet on a regular basis and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprised of representatives from the central office, ROs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Medicare contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II. Fiscal Intermediary and Carrier Budget Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> HCFA's central office is responsible for developing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national contractor budget for Parts A and B of the Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. The budget is formulated over an 18-month period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning in March of the calendar year preceding the fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year (FY) to which it applies. Input from the contractor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community, HCFA, the Department of Health and Human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Services, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received and included before submission to the President for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval and forwarding to the Congress. Once the national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractor budget has been approved, HCFA issues Budget and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Performance Requirements (BPRs). BPRs specify the level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort required for contractor functions and serve as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement of work for contractor use in preparing their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual budgets for submission to HCFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The budgets submitted by contractors are reviewed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ROs during a budget level determination process that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on current claims processing trends, legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandates, administrative initiatives, current year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance standards and criteria, and the availability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds appropriated by the Congress. We subsequently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocate funding within these constraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice contains the proposed data, standards, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology that we intend to use to establish a national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractor budget for fiscal intermediaries and carriers for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1995. As in prior years, we have had, and will continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to seek, extensive input from the involved parties,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly contractors, when establishing the national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractor budget. The national contractor budget (the FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995 President's budget) has already been presented to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress. Nevertheless, to the extent that we receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments during this comment period, which warrant revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the data, standards, and methodology we used, we will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make the necessary changes before publishing the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

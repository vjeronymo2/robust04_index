			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Broadcasters mix old and new in electronic results race BROADCASTERS are applying wise old heads and new technology to the most comprehensive coverage of the results of a general election. ITN's coverage through the night will feature Sir Robin Day. Back with the ITN election team for the first time in more than 30 years, he will interview senior politicians and pundits in the studio. ITN has also found a use for the vast atrium in its new London headquarters. It will be transformed into a life-size electronically generated House of Commons. John Suchet will walk among political mirages. As the results come in, ghostly figures in red, blue or yellow will change sides. At the BBC Peter Snow, handling his eighth election, supported by political editor John Cole who covered his first election in 1945, will preside over the return of the Swingometer. This 16 ft neon-lit pendulum is a long way from the 5 ft wooden version last seen during the 1979 campaign. As Peter Snow moves the pendulum across the scale, percentage point by percentage point, computers will change target seats from blue to red or vice versa to give what the BBC describes as 'an instant and clearer-than-ever understanding of the election night battle for power'. A separate battleground graphic will tell the Liberal Democrat story. Peter Sissons, who succeeded Sir Robin as presenter of Question Time, will take over Sir Robin's election night mantle, interviewing politicians and guests in the studio. Behind main BBC presenter David Dimbleby, in a refurbished 10,800 sq ft studio, will be a 20 ft by 16 ft projector screen able to carry simultaneous pictures from four outside broadcasts - BBC cameras will be at 85 locations. After a three-and-a-half-hour break for Breakfast News, David Dimbleby will be back on air until 5.30pm. As befits devolutionary times, Scottish viewers will be able to choose the full UK story on BBC1 or their own programme on BBC2. The BBC's main Election 92 programme is being transmitted live throughout the night on BBC World Service Television's Asian and European satellite services and will be available to millions of viewers from China to Czechoslovakia. BBC World Service radio will run an election special for five hours beginning at 2200 GMT. ITN, which is spending Pounds 2m on its programme, will use 1,000 staff and freelance journalists to try to be first with the results. It claims it was first in 450 of the 651 seats in 1987, and is trying to do better this time. Election 92, which will have Jon Snow in the anchor chair following the retirement of Sir Alastair Burnet, is believed to be the longest programme ever broadcast on ITV without commercial breaks - it will run for more than eight hours until TV-am begins at 6am. ITN's coverage will also be beamed to the US. Both ITN and the BBC will aim to reduce both the uncertainty and the excitement by broadcasting results of exit polls, which tend to give a good forecast of the likely outcome, early in the evening. Sky News, for its first general election, will offer a 24-hour results programme spearheaded by David Frost and Selina Scott. A 1,000 sq ft screen in the studio will show the interior of the House of Commons and an eight-screen video wall will display graphic interpretations of how the voting has gone. Channel 4 will live up to its reputation for providing a real alternative. At 10pm it will show Scandal, the feature film about the Profumo affair. Later it will move on to the real Marxists - the Marx brothers and Duck Soup.</p>

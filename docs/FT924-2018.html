			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Third prong goes for the balance sheet - Andrew Jack considers the expected impact of Fred 3 on capital instruments GURUS IN some of the City's better-known financial institutions have been heard to answer the telephone in recent years with three revealing and unsettling words: 'Financial engineering department.' Their raison d'etre is to produce haemaphroditic capital instruments, the chameleon-like hybrids which often exhibit all the characteristics of debt. By taking advantage of loopholes in existing accounting rules and company legislation, they are able to make these instruments appear on the balance sheet as equity. This keeps gearing low and can diminish any risk of breaching loan covenants. It is precisely these financiers and their evolving devices that the Accounting Standards Board hopes to put out of business with Fred 3, its financial reporting exposure draft on capital instruments, issued last week. Mr David Tweedie, the ASB chairman, says Fred 3 represents the start of the ASB's attack on the third prong of accounting. FRS 2, the financial reporting standard on cash flow, replaced the old source and application of funds statement. FRS 3 dealt with the profit and loss account. Now Fred 3 begins the assault on the balance sheet. 'We had to act,' he says. 'One of the biggest problems for auditors was the shifts between debt and equity of these instruments. It was getting to ridiculous proportions.' At the heart of Fred 3 is a simple boxed statement drawn from the ASB's statement of principles, which defines liabilities as 'an entity's obligations to transfer economic benefits as a result of past transactions or events'. That turns most instruments into debt. The standards-setters hands were partly tied when it came to shares and their derivatives, which cannot be defined under the present law as liabilities. The result is six categories into which capital instruments will be classified: shareholders' funds: equity and non-equity interests minority interests in subsidiaries: equity and non-equity interests in subsidiaries liabilities: convertible and non-convertible liabilities. Fred 3 also incorporates into a standard the first ruling from the ASB's urgent issues task force issued in July last year, which deals with the treatment of supplemental interest or premium on convertible bonds. It says that these elements should be charged annually to the profit and loss account from inception. An illustration of the impact of the new standard is shown by BET, the business services company. Its 1991 annual report simply shows Pounds 189m in share capital and Pounds 437.4m in the share premium account. The 1992 accounts have been re-cast along the lines suggested by Fred 3. The 1991 accounts now show equity shareholders' funds of Pounds 186.1m, and Pounds 152.9m in the share premium account. Non-equity funds, in the form of preference shares, total Pounds 287.4m, including just Pounds 2.9m for the nominal value of the shares. Theoretically, readers of accounts could always have calculated the contribution from preference shares for themselves. The awkward reality is illustrated by the 1991 Ratners accounts. The balance sheet shows called up share capital of Pounds 66.2m and a share premium account of Pounds 356.9m. These figures are linked to three tightly-worded pages in the notes which list the six different authorised types of complex equity instruments, such as 36m 6.75p convertible cumulative non-voting redeemable preference shares. Those allotted are shown simply at their par value, making the market value of each extremely difficult to calculate. More fundamental than the switch from equity to non-equity shareholders' funds for many companies will be the switch from equity back to debt. Among those affected when Fred 3 becomes a mandatory standard next year is British Airways. Its 1992 accounts show Pounds 320m in convertible capital bonds maturing in 2005. These will have to be reclassified as debt. The 1992 accounts for BICC show Pounds 177m in convertible capital bonds which will have to be re-cast as borrowings. The notes also show that Pounds 33m of its Pounds 134m in minority interests now under capital and reserves will also become debt. That will increase BICC's gearing from 43.4 per cent to 106.7 per cent The same fate faces Pounds 109.9m in redeemable convertible preference shares in Coats Viyella Finance, guaranteed shares issued by a subsidiary of Coats Viyella. Thorn EMI will have to reclassify as debt from the 1992 accounts Pounds 211.5m in convertible unsecured loan stock and Pounds 103m in guaranteed redeemable convertible preference shares in minority interests. It will also have to account under non-equity shareholders' funds Pounds 114m in auction preferred stock shown as a minority interest in capital and reserves. Some of the other obscure instruments mentioned are debt issued with warrants; deep discount, income and stepped interest bonds; index-linked loans; and subordinated, limited recourse and repackaged perpetual debt. But the point of Fred 3 is to lay down principles, not simply classify existing instruments, which could rapidly become out-dated as new devices are invented. Instead it attempts to provide a comprehensive set of categories. The ASB says most submissions it has received since issuing a discussion document last December have been positive. Its only principal modification in Fred 3 has been to allow short-term borrowings under a long-term financing facility to be reported as long-term. The lack of complaint suggests the financial engineers have so far kept quiet. The chance to have their say may come once Fred 3 has become a standard towards the end of next year and put out to test.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            BET CAPITAL AND RESERVES IN YEAR TO MARCH 30 1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In annual report 1991                                         Pounds m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Share capital                                                    189.0 Share premium account                                            437.4 Revaluation reserve                                               56.0 Other reserves                                                  (785.3) Profit and loss account                                          572.8 Associated undertakings' reserves                                  2.9                                                                  472.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Minority shareholders' interests                                  23.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  496.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In annual report 1992 - restated in accordance with Fred 3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equity shareholders' funds: Ordinary share capital               186.1 Ordinary share premium                                           152.9 Revaluation reserve                                               56.0 Other reserves                                                  (785.3) Profit and loss account                                          572.8 Associated undertakings' reserves                                  2.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  185.4 Non-equity shareholders' funds: Preference share capital           2.9 Preference share premium                                         284.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  287.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BET shareholders' capital and reserves                           472.8 Minority shareholders' interests                                  23.3 Total capital and reserves                                       496.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

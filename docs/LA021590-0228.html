			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IRATE BUSH VOWS TO LIMIT CONTACTS WITH PRESS  </P> <P> Stung by news reports that he is secretive and deceptive, a fuming President  Bush told the news media today as he flew to Colombia for a four-nation drug  conference, "From now on, it's going to be a little different."  </P> <P> Bush vowed to hold fewer news conferences and to limit his sessions with  reporters in the future.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to be burned for holding out or doing something deceptive," Bush  said.  </P> <P> Bush aired his grievances with the news media in a chat with reporters aboard  Air Force One, shortly before he landed here to transfer to a helicopter that  would take him to Cartagena for a drug summit with the presidents of Colombia,  Bolivia and Peru.  </P> <P> What apparently riled the President were news stories suggesting he had  sometimes said one thing, then done something else.  </P> <P> For instance, his comments at a news conference Monday that he did not think it  was time for a four-power conference on the future of Germany came a day before  a major agreement on German reunification was reached in Ottawa.  </P> <P> "When I told you . . . that I didn't think there'd be a deal and there shortly  was a deal, then I'm hit for deceiving you," Bush said.  </P> <P> He said that at his news conference he did not know that an agreement that  would involve oversight by the four post-World War II European powers -- the  United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France -- was at hand.  </P> <P> The President expressed his testiness from the start of today's exchange with  reporters accompanying him here on Air Force One.  </P> <P> Bush had slept aboard the plane in a hangar at Andrews Air Force Base in the  Maryland suburbs so that he would not arrive in Colombia sleepy after today's  pre-dawn flight, and he was asked if he had enjoyed a good night's sleep.  </P> <P> "I had a very good night's sleep. I can't get into the details of that because  some will say it's too much sleep, some will say it's too little."  </P> <P> Then the President added: "I think we've had too many press conferences. It's  not good. It overdoes it. It's overexposure."  </P> <P> Bush has had about one news conference a week on the average, since he took  office on Jan. 20, 1989.  </P> <P> "I'm taking no answers to questions. I'm not going to discuss what I'm going to  bring up," Bush said when asked about his agenda for the day's drug  conference."  </P> <P> Asked about an NBC-TV report that Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas has  made a deal with some drug lords in his country not to extradite them to the  United States if they turn over drug labs, Bush snapped: "I have no comment  whatsoever on that. I have no comment on whether I know about it or not. I  can't comment on whether it's true or not."  </P> <P> "So from now on, it's going to be a little different," he added. "We're going  to have a new relationship. It will be pleasant. It will be fun. But it's  different.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to be burned for holding out or doing something deceptive."  </P> <P> Bush did not mention which news reports he was referring to. However, today's  editions of the Washington Post, copies of which were on Bush's plane, had a  story on what it called "the debate between President Bush and the press over  secrecy and deception."  </P></p>

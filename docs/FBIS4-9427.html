			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, April 25 (AFP) -- NATO strategists are  bracing for a Serb offensive on the Brcko corridor, a finger of  land in northern Bosnia which joins Serbia to its conquests in  western Bosnia-Herzegovina, officials said here Monday. The  area is not covered by a NATO ultimatum on Friday which  threatened massive air bombing of the Bosnian Serbs if they  continued attacking Gorazde in eastern Bosnia or threatened  another four mainly-Moslem towns.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forced the Bosnian  Serbs to begin pulling back from the battered town of Gorazde at  the weekend, after they had mauled it.    This means, warned one NATO source, that three brigades --  10,000 men or more -- could be looking for a new target, along  with about 60 tanks and big guns.    With Gorazde close to the Serb border, they could easily  cross into Serbia and travel quickly and safely northwards  towards Brcko in order to widen and strengthen the corridor, he  said. The source added that such an attack could provoke NATO  air strikes if UN personnel were stationed in the area and their  lives were in danger, even though the area was not included in  last Friday's ultimatum.    Last week the Bosnian Serb chief of staff, General Manjlo  Milovanovic, said candidly that Serbian territory between Brcko  and Doboj, the eastern and western ends of the narrow corridor,  was the next target. The statement was followed by a barrage of  reports in the Serb press that Bosnian Moslems were attacking  Serb positions around Brcko. Similar allegations preceded the  Serb assault on Gorazde which started three weeks ago.    But one NATO official said the Bosnian Serbs could not be  relied on to follow a consistent strategy. "Who knows what goes  on in their minds?" he said when asked if Brcko was the next  likely target. The official, who spoke on condition that he not  be identified, said it was not clear to NATO strategists whether  the Bosnian Serbs were following a master plan, or even whether  their generals would follow one if it existed.    "There are renegade warlords who owe their power to  continued  fighting," he said, adding that the Serbs had a pattern of  unpredictably hitting wherever their enemies showed signs of  weakness.    But diplomats here are also hoping that the Bosnian Serbs,  having already conquered large parts of Bosnia, might decide  that they have won enough to start real negotiations to end the  two-year war from a position of strength.    "There is a lot of war-weariness on all sides," the official  said. Fueling this thesis is a new concertation by the United  States, Russia and the European Union to push the warring  parties towards a settlement.    However, Nedzad Hadzimusic, the head of the Bosnian  Government's mission to Brussels, said the Bosnian Serbs would  continue to use their military muscle at least until the  year-end as long as it was not knocked out by NATO. "There is  going to be another Gorazde somewhere else, perhaps even in  another safe area like Tuzla," he said. Tuzla, along with  Gorazde and the other Moslem-held towns of Bihac, Srebrenica and  Zepa, are protected by NATO's air strike ultimatum issued last  Friday.    But Hadzimusic predicted that the Bosnian Serbs might attack  Tuzla, which has a strategically-important airport, to test  whether NATO really does have the nerve to launch massive air  strikes against them.</p>

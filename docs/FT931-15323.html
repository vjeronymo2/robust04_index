			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Delhi crash exposes hazards of pilots' strike: Indian Airlines has been forced to open negotiations SATURDAY'S crash in Delhi of an Uzbek aircraft leased to Indian Airlines has forced the domestic carrier into negotiations with its 475 striking pilots. It has also highlighted the effects on the inefficient, state-owned airline of the Indian government's open skies policy, under which new private carriers have been allowed. The Russian-made Tupolev TU-154, leased from Uzbekistan Airlines because of the month-long pilots' strike, crashed in fog on Saturday after the Uzbek pilot apparently failed to understand instructions in English. The aircraft flipped over, split in pieces and caught fire. In spite of the late arrival of the emergency services at the scene, all 163 people on board survived without serious injury. Mr Madhavrao Scindia, minister for civil aviation and tourism, resigned hours after the crash. Management and pilots spent yesterday trying to break their impasse. The pilots want their salaries almost doubled to match those paid by private carriers, as well as a 200 per cent increase in meal allowances. Officials say the pilots are already well paid and could soon fly extra hours under a proposed 'fly more, earn more' scheme. The strike has benefited the private carriers which have sprung up since the government's decision 2 1/2 years ago to deregulate national civil aviation, allowing private operators to choose routes, timings and fares. India's domestic passengers, accustomed for 40 years to Indian Airlines' legendary delays, inefficiency and indifferent service, now have the choice of six other domestic airlines. The biggest of these, East-West Airlines, has wooed passengers easily by adhering to schedules and offering good food and courteous service. Extras such as a free drink - Indian Airlines is not permitted to serve alcohol on domestic flights - have made it a big hit on Indian Airlines' traditional high-profit trunk routes such as Bombay-Madras and Delhi-Bombay. Although it has only three aircraft compared with Indian Airlines' 50, the Bombay-based airline's success has encouraged at least three more operators to apply for licences. With load factors of between 85 and 100 per cent, the fledgling carriers are already making money, and the strike has only made them more popular. Continental Airlines, which started operations in October 1991, says its profits exceeded Rs20m (Pounds 450,000) up to June, and East-West, which commenced in March, says it hopes to reach Rs20m profits this year. Indian Airlines, by contrast, has suffered losses for the three years and says that it is operating at a considerable disadvantage. 'We suddenly find ourselves operating in a competitive market with our hands tied behind our backs,' complains a senior airline official. According to one official, Indian Airlines has operated 'more like a haphazard patchwork of government departments rather than a commercial organisation'. It has had social obligations to fly to remote parts of the vast country, and had rested comfortably on a non-profit making image. The airline is weighed down by governmental norms. 'We cannot discontinue services on loss-making sectors any more than we can choose the best candidate for air-hostesses' jobs, like the private airlines,' says an Indian Airlines official. 'Nearly 15 per cent of all our routes are unprofitable.' Calculations have shown that, on some sectors, flying Indian Airlines is cheaper than taking a taxi. To keep the airline profitable, Indian Airlines is forced to increase its capacity utilisation or seat factor as high as 90 per cent on its profitable trunk routes, much higher than the global average of 68 per cent. This results in a 'high distress' factor on infrastructure, causing frequent breakdowns, delays and strained employee relations. Mr Scindia, while still a minister, admitted that Indian Airlines was at a disadvantage compared to private airlines. The smaller companies have lower overheads, hire crew on contract and are not obliged to operate on unremunerative routes. Indian Airlines, which employs more than 22,000 people, has lost about 50 of its pilots to private operators. The Indian Commercial Pilot's Association (ICPA), the pilots' union, has regularly held the Indian Airlines' management to ransom during the peak tourist season and has disrupted the airline's operations 34 times in the last three years. Management has usually given in to pressure from the pilots in order to keep the airline going. However, this time a hard-headed chairman, Mr Lakshminarayan Vasudev, backed by Mr Scindia's ministry, decided to hold out and to operate a skeleton service using foreign pilots and non-union members. He negotiated the lease of three TU-154s before the strike began and leased an additional three aircraft before Saturday's crash. All the TU-154s are now grounded. The union said the Russian aircraft used twice as much fuel as the Airbus A-320s they were replacing, and carried fewer passengers. Mr RN Jalan, ICPA general-secretary, said the pilots' stand had been vindicated by the crash. The pilots realise that they have little option but to work for India's largest domestic carrier. For the moment, as stranded passengers crowd airports and are forced to cancel thousands of trips daily because of a lack of seats, the pilots seem to have the upper hand.</p>

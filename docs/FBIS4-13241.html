			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tzvi Bar'el] </F>   [Text] The Hamas office in Jordan continues functioning  regularly, despite reports and announcements that it had been  closed. Office workers come to work, answer phones, and operate  the office as before. In a telephone conversation with the  Hamas office, Muhammad Nazzal, head of the movement, said that  the office exists and is operational, "but unfortunately, I  cannot make comments to your newspaper because it is our policy  not to speak with Israeli elements."    Jordanian sources in Amman have reported that the king's  decision regarding Hamas has remained unchanged but, as far as  they know, no practical steps to restrict the movement's  activity have been taken so far. According to them, the heads  of the movement were summoned for a discussion with the heads of  the Jordanian intelligence who asked that Hamas media activity  be reduced.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU border restrictions on agriculture should end Sir, I am sure that David Richardson is right (Farmer's Viewpoint, November 8) to point out the many problems facing agriculture in central and eastern Europe (CEE). To pick up just one of the factors at the root of the production problem: unfinished land reform is indeed creating a more fragmented ownership structure in many countries. This does not necessarily result in a fragmented operational structure - that depends on the flexibility of the rental market for land. While informal rental arrangements are becoming increasingly common, it will take many more years to sort out these institutional matters. Thus, the much-feared threat to agriculture in the European Union from eastern Europe is certainly many years down the road. But this is not just a matter of supply conditions in CEE, it is also dependent on the trading relationship we offer them. The earliest we could expect accession of the new applicant countries (and thus their opportunity to benefit from the Common Agricultural Policy in the single market) is at beginning of the next century. They pose little threat to EU agriculture in the interim because of our impervious borders secured by the agricultural provisions of the association agreements. Since 1990, the EU agricultural trade balance with the six associated countries has reversed in our favour. So put the Richardson hypothesis to the test. If we have nothing to fear from eastern Europe, let's dismantle EU border restrictions on agriculture with these countries. Can we expect Richardson, his German friend, Mr Graf Grote, and the National Farmers' Union, who apparently share his view, to add their weight to those voices who advocate a more open trade stance on agriculture with eastern Europe?

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Capital Cities/ABC hit by recession and war costs THE IMPACT of recession on advertising and the cost of covering the Gulf war has cut the profitability of Capital Cities/ABC, one of the three big US television networks. It yesterday unveiled a 38 per cent slump in first-quarter operating income to Dollars 130.3m and warned of a further decline in the second quarter. The company owns the ABC radio and television national networks, local television and radio stations and weekly newspapers, including the Fairchild fashion trade publications. First-quarter net income fell 45 per cent to Dollars 58.6m or Dollars 3.50 a share from Dollars 106.3m or Dollars 6.08 a year earlier on revenues essentially unchanged at Dollars 1.26bn. Operating income was Dollars 130.3m, against Dollars 211.5m a year ago, while income before taxes dropped 44 per cent to Dollars 103.4m from Dollars 186.2m. Capital Cities/ABC's weak first-quarter performance comes on the heels of poor results from CBS and General Electric's NBC broadcasting, which were also hurt by higher news costs and the very weak advertising market. Revenues from the company's broadcasting operating advanced to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 992.5m, due to the telecast of the Super Bowl and two National Football League Wild Card play-off games.</p>

City  Duma Will be Elected at the Same Time To Save Funds"]    [Text] Aleksey Strakhov, new head of the Sverdlovsk Oblast  administration, has issued a decree regarding elections for the  oblast Duma. It sets 10 April as the precise date of the event.  Oblast residents are to elect 28 deputies. As little as  two-fifths of this number of people's choices are going to draw  up normative acts on a permanent basis, with the rest working in  the Duma while continuing in their normal jobs.    The elections will be held in seven districts already  familiar to the population from the recent electoral campaign.  They will be held on the basis of the majority system, i.e.  four deputies in each district shall be elected by a majority of  votes.    The oblast and party organizations have actively joined in  preparing for the elections. Vyacheslav Senko, coordinator of  the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia in the Urals and western  Siberia, has stated that 16 deputies out of the 28 would without  fail be elected on the Zhirinovskiy party ticket.    Yekaterinburg Mayor Arkadiy Chernetskiy has drawn attention  to the fact that in order to save funds, the elections for the  city Duma will be held simultaneously with the elections for the  Sverdlovsk Oblast Duma. It should be pointed out that no  regulations on the elections for the city Duma have been signed  or published yet.</p>

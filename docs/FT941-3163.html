			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Observer: Big blue new view IBM boss Lou Gerstner shook a few trees last July by saying 'the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision'. Now he is moaning in IBM's annual report that many extracts from his statement omitted the words 'right now'. Can he be suggesting that while IBM didn't need a vision then, it does now? 'The fact is, no company is going to succeed without a clear set of tough-minded strategies,' says Gerstner. 'Some call it mission. Some call it vision. I call it strategy.' In his new 'IBM Principles', contained in the annual report, Gerstner says IBM will 'never lose sight of our strategic vision'. Some call it inspiration. We call it an about-face, Lou.</p>

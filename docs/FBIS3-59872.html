			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Iraqi Journalists Condemn Mad </F> Attacks on Iraq"]    [Text] Iraqi journalists have condemned the mad Western and  Zionist campaign against Iraq.    The Syndicate of Iraqi Journalists confirmed, in a  statement,  that this notorious attack was aimed at prolonging the hostile  and criminal sanctions against the people of Iraq.    It explained that human rights in Iraq were protected and  safeguarded by the Iraqi constitution, at a time when human  rights were willfully and bloodily violated with the knowledge  of the big powers in many countries of the world. It pointed out  that Britain, France, and America ignored these excesses and  ongoing violations of human rights because the rulers in  question were serving their interests and goals.    The Syndicate of Iraqi Journalists accused the big powers  and  the Security Council of violating Iraqi human rights by  persisting in continuing the sanctions. Was not forbidding the  Iraqi people food, medicine, and common necessities, they asked,  an intentional violation of the rights accorded them by  international conventions and laws?    The Syndicate of Iraqi Journalists called on Arab and  foreign  press organizations and federations to take a stand for justice  and right, and to expose the hidden goals of this oppressive  campaign.</p>

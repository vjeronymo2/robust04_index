			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Project Hawk takes flight - The British Coal deal is in the bag for RJB Project Hawk was the codename given by Barclays de Zoete Wedd to its work on the RJB Mining bid for British Coal. But outside the company there were many who doubted that the bird would fly. Yesterday they had their answer when RJB signed a deal to pay Pounds 815m for the English mining assets of British Coal. In extremely difficult circumstances, it had raised the Pounds 894m needed to finance the bid. That means its acquisition of the 17 deep mines, including two which are mothballed, and 16 opencast sites is in the bag. Even the company's critics acknowledged yesterday that RJB and BZW have done well. 'We doubted it when they said they could raise the money,' said one. 'They should be congratulated for doing a deal against the odds.' One difficulty for RJB was the recent weakness of the stock market. Several companies have had to pull out of, or scale back, fund-raising exercises. But RJB's biggest potential problem was persuading the institutions to accept its view of the potential in English coal rather than those of its rivals. It has predicted profits of Pounds 220m in 1999 on sales of 1.2bn. The resulting margin of 17 per cent would be one of the highest of any international coal company. But rivals say RJB's projections are based on an over-optimistic view of markets. Whereas RJB assumes it can sell 34m tonnes of coal at an average price of Pounds 32 a tonne, Mr Malcolm Edwards, chairman of Coal Investments, whose bid failed, reckons that 24m tonnes at Pounds 26 would be more appropriate. In an extraordinarily bitter series of exchanges between the two companies RJB has dismissed Mr Edwards' comments as an attempt to destabilise its bid so that he could press forward with his. But Mr Edwards is not alone. Most executives within both the coal and electricity industries are closer to the gloomier, Edwards view. The institutions think otherwise, or are at least prepared to give RJB and Mr Richard Budge, its chief executive, the benefit of the doubt. 'There are an awful lot of numbers knocking around and, because coal has been in the public sector for so long, the City's knowledge is not good.' said Mr Neil Richardson of Threadneedle, one of the institutions which is buying shares. 'However, we know the supply of coal is much closer to demand than for a long time and that world coal prices are rising.' Mr Richardson also believes there is more scope for cost-cutting than RJB has allowed for in its forecasts. RJB assumes it will cut costs by just 3 per cent a year. Most of the institutions backing RJB say they invested when the company was floated last year because they were impressed by its track record and nothing has arisen since then to change their minds. A wide airing of events surrounding the collapse two years ago of AF Budge, of which Mr Budge was a director for 20 years, has seemingly failed to deter many investors. 'None of the deals struck then was illegal,' says one shareholder. 'Most of them were typical of what happens when private companies collapse.' Fund managers concentrated instead on the finances. Assuming the company meets its after-tax profit projection of of Pounds 75m next year, the shares are being sold at 320p on a 1995 prospective price earnings ratio of 6.4, compared with a stock market average of 12. But what really made Project Hawk fly was the projections of profits and dividends after 1998, when the debt is scheduled to be paid off. There remain many doubters about RJB's assumptions, but the company's investors prefer Mr Budge's version of the future.</p>

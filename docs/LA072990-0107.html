			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MARTINEZ;  </P> <P> YOUTH SENTENCED IN KILLING FOR PAGER  </P> <P> A 15-year-old youth, who police say killed a friend so he could take the  victim's telephone pager, has been sentenced to spend a decade in the  California Youth Authority.  </P> <P> Juvenile Court Judge John Minney, in handing down the sentence Friday, said the  authority is the only appropriate place for Manuel Walker, who the judge said  has a history of violence. "The minor engaged in a brutal, cowardly killing  involving an apparently defenseless victim," Minney said. "It appears he has no  sense of accountability or responsibility for what he's done." Walker, who  turns 16 next month, was convicted of first-degree murder for the fatal  stabbing of 15-year-old Ricky Martinelli last March. Authorities said Walker  can be held until age 25.  </P></p>

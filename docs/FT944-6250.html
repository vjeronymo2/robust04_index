			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Spending stays level in real terms at Pounds 1.28bn - Science Science spending will remain exactly level in real terms at Pounds 1.282bn next year. 'This is a good settlement,' said Mr David Hunt, the minister responsible for science. 'After looking very carefully at all its expenditure programmes, the government has again made science one of its priorities.' Mr Robert Hughes, the junior science minister, added that the level outcome was better than it looked at first sight, as the current year's science budget was worth about 2 per cent more than in 1993-94 because of lower than expected inflation - and Mr Hunt, unlike many of his colleagues had hung on to the increase. But Save British Science, a research lobby group, was disappointed. Mr John Mulvey, SBS secretary, had expected a further rise of at least 2.5 per cent, after a speech this year in which the prime minister said he expected 'spending on the science base to rise in real terms next year'. 'At a time when our economy is growing at 3.5 per cent a year, we can afford to invest in the long-term future by spending more on research,' Mr Mulvey said last night. 'This is a government with shorter term concerns.' The government's science budget covers money spent directly by the Office of Science and Technology through its five research councils - mainly on university research. OST officials expected overall public spending on research and development to decline again next year, because of cuts in support for science and technology by the Ministry of Defence and Department of Trade and Industry. But figures for all R&amp;D expenditure in 1995-96 will not be available until next year.</p>

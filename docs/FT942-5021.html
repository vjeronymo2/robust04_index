			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Technology: Battle for house and home - The competition for fun and games is heating up as PC makers take on the video giants Personal computer manufacturers have always eyed the home market as an El Dorado, a largely untapped gold mine that promises great wealth to those who can find the right combination of technology and price. Yet the PC industry is littered with sad tales of companies that failed to make it into the home market, or lost huge fortunes in the attempt, such as Coleco with its Adam home computer, the Sinclair ZX80, Commodore and IBM with its IBM PCjr. But despite the failures, PCs have made remarkable inroads in the US home market. According to the Software Publishers Association, 27 per cent of US households have PCs. Market research company Link Resources predicts that by 1998, almost 50 per cent of US households will own a PC. 'When you look at medium to large business sectors, the markets are already very saturated,' explains Abhijeet Rane, senior industry analyst at Link Resources. 'The home market offers much greater potential for growth than the business market.' While many PC companies have offered low-end models as a way into the home market, Intel, the leading microprocessor manufacturer, has discovered that US consumers are buying large numbers of sophisticated systems. 'Conventional wisdom says that the home PC market is served by a low-end machine,' said Paul Otellini, senior vice-president and co-general manager of Intel's Microprocessor Products Group. 'The facts are different, however. Multimedia education and entertainment applications are key pieces of the home PC marketplace and they require CPU (central processing unit) performance as well as a robust system design.' Intel recently launched a Dollars 150m (Pounds 100m) marketing campaign to promote its most powerful microprocessor, the Pentium, in systems aimed at the home market. Intel also plans to cut the price of Pentium microprocessors at a faster rate, making Pentium-based PCs more affordable, especially for the Christmas selling period. By the fourth quarter of this year, Intel expects Pentium-based PCs to account for 25 per cent of all PCs sold, with at least half being sold to the home market. The strength of the home PC market is making its mark on the design of future PC systems, an area that used to be driven by the demands of the business market. For example, CD-Rom drives and sound cards are becoming standard equipment on PCs, yet there are few business applications that require them. Windows 4.0, the next big upgrade to Microsoft's popular Windows user interface, will be able to run games and educational software applications. Software applications have always been the key to hardware sales. In the same way that financial spreadsheet software helped boost sales of business PC systems, games promise to help PC companies in their efforts to enter more homes. Market research shows that children are a key factor in determining PC purchases. This means that the PC has to adopt some features that will appeal to children who are already familiar with video game player machines. But the competition is formidable. While PCs have managed to enter markets once dominated by workstations, minicomputers and mainframes on the basis of high performance and low price, video games players are already very cheap. The next generation of video game players, due in 1995 from Nintendo and Sega, will feature fast graphics and powerful microprocessors that will rival high-end workstations at a fraction of the price. Jeff Camp, multimedia systems product manager at Microsoft, said: 'The home PC market is growing quickly but we have had an earful from customers complaining about the lack of fast games for Windows systems. We are now able to provide games that have the fast graphics that customers want.' Developing games for PC systems has many attractions for video-game companies. There is an installed base of about 40m Windows-based PC systems and the distribution of games for PCs is cheaper. Nintendo and Sega charge video game developers about Dollars 20 for each video game cartridge and they maintain strict control over the type of games that can be played on their systems. In contrast, there is no royalty to pay for distributing PC-based games and there are no restrictions on the development of games. PC owners are typically more affluent and can afford to buy more games. The Software Publishers Association found that half of all US households with PCs have an annual income of at least Dollars 50,000. 'PC versions of major arcade game and film hits are the fastest growing segment of our business and of the game industry overall,' says Henry Kaplan, chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based game developer Hi Tech Expressions. 'Industry-wide, this segment of the market accounted for about Dollars 800m in sales in 1993 and we expect it to grow to Dollars 1.5bn by the end of this year.' While Microsoft is happy to encourage third-party game developers, it is not ignoring this fast growing market itself. The company has expanded its consumer products division and launched its Home brand which includes low-end versions of its business software such as word processing and spreadsheet software plus new entertainment software. Although Microsoft offers fast, graphics-based games such as those found in its Arcade package, Tony Garcia, manager of the entertainment division at Microsoft, explains that most of the games are more adult oriented. 'Games such as Flight Simulator and our forthcoming Space Simulator offer more depth which appeals more to adults.' Software companies such as Utah-based WordPerfect have also targeted the home market. Earlier this year, WordPerfect introduced its Main Street software line, a collection of word processor, spreadsheet, games and educational software. The company also agreed a deal with Walt Disney that will allow it to use Disney characters to market its software in Europe. Among PC manufacturers, Compaq Computer has been successful in reaching the home market with its Presario models. Its success recently pushed the company to the top in US sales for the first quarter of 1994, ahead of 1993 market leaders IBM and Apple Computer. For now, PCs and video game-playing machines can co-exist, with most households that have PCs also owning game machines. The battle for the home market will be waged with the coming integration of computers and TVs in the form of set-top TV boxes. These will be powerful computing devices, capable of running business as well as entertainment software, and acting as gateways to the much heralded 'information superhighways'. PC firms such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Apple Computer are developing their own set-top TV systems. These companies have an advantage in that there is a huge base of software applications, not just games, that will run on their platforms. However, video game machine makers will not give up their huge installed base without a fight. Nintendo, Sega and Sony are developing powerful set-top TV systems. Nintendo has teamed with workstation manufacturer Silicon Graphics to develop a set-top TV system that will incorporate many of the features of a high-end 3-D graphics workstation yet retail for less than Dollars 300. Nintendo, Sega and Sony have an advantage in that they understand the consumer electronics market better than their PC rivals. They also have more widely recognised brand names and well-established distribution channels. Whichever technology wins, it is clear that the competition for the home market will result in larger numbers of computers in the home; allowing parents to work from home, children to run educational and entertainment programs and, eventually, to provide a means of managing huge data flows from future 'information superhighways'.</p>

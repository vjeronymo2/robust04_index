Since 1989 the total amount of the funds poured into  agriculture in the province has been the highest in the country.    In 1992 the amount allocated to agriculture by the province  was 2.64 billion yuan, accounting for 21.7 percent of the annual  total expenditure of the province. The figure was 13 percentage  points higher than average level of the funds allocated for  industry.    Over the past five years Yunnan has invested 2.18 billion  yuan in water conservancy projects, and 44 large- and  medium-sized projects were carried out smoothly.    Now the irrigable area of the farmland in Yunnan has  increased to 1.1 million ha [hectares], and high-yielding  farmland occupies about 690,000 ha.    In 1993 Yunnan's grain output hit a record 10.85 billion kg,  an increase of 148 million kg over the previous year.</p>

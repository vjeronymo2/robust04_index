			<p>BFN     [Text] The African foreign ministers finished their work in  Tunis this evening. They finalized 22 draft resolutions which  will be submitted to the heads of state by Monday. One of these  texts, probably the most striking, calls for a return to peace  in Rwanda. We shall come back to this later. [passage omitted]    Rwanda is the subject of a draft resolution. Dominique de  Courcelles has read it:    [Begin Courcelles recording] The Council of Ministers  strongly condemned the massacres and killings that are still  being carried out in Rwanda and called for an immediate end to  them. It added that this was a crime against humanity and  called for the trial of those behind them in accordance with  international law. It called for an immediate end to  hostilities and the institution of a cease-fire. It called on  the belligerents to put an end to any hatred propaganda through  their media.    Finally, it asserted yet again that the Arusha peace accord  was the basis for a lasting solution to the conflict. It was  pleased to note that several African countries had promised to  contribute troops to UNAMIR II [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda]  and had launched an appeal to the international community for  financial and logistic help. It also called for urgent help for  the refugees and displaced people.    As we can see, the tone of the declaration is firm. However,  neither of the two sides and none of the neighboring countries  has been singled out for being responsible for the crimes, the  war or any involvement in the Rwandan tragedy.

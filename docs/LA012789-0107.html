			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: DOWNTOWN  </P> <P> Every retrospective of a major artist spawns small, satellite shows hoping (at  best) to beef up our information or (at worst) to benefit from the media  fallout. A small, visual footnote to the County Museum of Art's Billy Al  Bengston retrospective does a little of both. You could argue that after 20  years of living with the glitzy, never news-shy Bengston, L.A. viewers don't  need updates. On the other hand, this show treats us to quintessential late  '60s Billy at his bad-boy-pretty-surface best.  </P> <P> Mostly prints, the show demonstrates that whatever your feelings about  Bengston's ability to handle paint, he's a deft printmaker. From the late '60s,  there are violet and lime green chevrons printed on dented aluminum. There are  also scores of lithographed irises -- coiled in pretty patterns, blanched to  minimal white on white, reduced to dots and dashes. The real fun comes from  large, handsome lacquer and resin on aluminum pieces that give Bengston's  car-culture slickness a touch of the emblematic. (Cirrus, 542 S. Alameda St.,  to Feb. 14.)

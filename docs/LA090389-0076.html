			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> VAST MAJORITY THINK BERNSON SWAYED BY DEVELOPER DONATIONS  </P> <P> By a 7-to-1 margin, San Fernando Valley residents expressing an opinion believe  that Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson is influenced by the developers of  the massive Porter Ranch residential and commercial plan in his 12th District,  last weekend's Times Poll found.  </P> <P> Since 1982, Bernson has received about $50,000 in campaign contributions from  Porter Ranch developers and their hired consultants. He also chairs the City  Council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee, which will decide this  month whether the plan to build 3,000 residences and nearly 6 million square  feet of commercial and office space should go forward.  </P> <P> Poll respondents were told that critics, including opponents of the Porter  Ranch project and California Common Cause, believe that Bernson has a conflict  of interest on the issue. They were also told that council President John  Ferraro has determined that Bernson does not have a conflict and that he has  conducted himself objectively at public hearings.  </P> <P> When asked whether they thought that Bernson was influenced by the developers,  57% of those polled said they thought that he was. Only 8% said he was not, and  35% said they did not know. In Bernson's district, 61% of the respondents said  he was influenced by Porter Ranch developers, and only 7% said he was not.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Legal Bribes'  </P> <P> In addition, 56% of those polled said they agreed that campaign contributions  are little more than "legal bribes."  </P> <P> "These figures indicate that Bernson has a conflict of interest in the opinion  of many people in the Valley," said I. A. (Bud) Lewis, director of The Times  Poll.  </P> <P> Bernson said it was "grossly unfair" to imply that he had "received $50,000  from people in connection with the Porter Ranch plan."  </P> <P> He said the contributions came from a variety of consultants and other  companies that do business with Shapell Industries, the key Porter Ranch  developer. But he said the contributions were spread over the past seven years,  beginning even before a Bernson-appointed Citizens Advisory Committee began  reviewing the Porter Ranch plan. He also said his campaign committee, to avoid  the appearance of impropriety, had returned a $500 donation that Shapell made  earlier this year.  </P> <P> "You can make polls sound like anything you want," Bernson said. "It is no  wonder that people think that politicians are dishonest."  </P> <P> Bernson said he had never made a decision based on whether a developer was a  contributor or a supporter.  </P> <P> "I think I've been a very responsible elected official," he said. "I've  listened to people and I always try to do what's best for the community."  </P> <P> A conservative Republican first elected to the council in 1979, Bernson is  nonetheless generally viewed as a moderate who has twice won reelection by  substantial margins. He has supported some developments but has opposed others,  such as the office complex that a developer wanted to build earlier this year  on the site of Northridge Little League's baseball fields. In February, he  proposed that developers seeking to build in a large section of Northridge be  subjected to City Council requirements to provide parking and street  improvements to reduce traffic congestion.  </P> <P> Poll respondents gave Bernson's performance a mixed mark, with most saying they  did not know enough to judge him. Bernson was viewed favorably by 22% of those  polled in his district and was viewed unfavorably by 21%. Those numbers are  subject to a higher margin of error -- plus or minus 9 percentage points --  than other poll results because only 210 of those polled were in Bernson's  district.  </P> <P> Bernson is also the target of a fledgling recall effort, backed by Northridge  businessman Walter N. Prince. Prince is opposed to a Bernson plan to designate  about 80 acres on Parthenia Street as a redevelopment area.  </P> <P> "I definitely think he's biased in favor of developers," Prince said. "He  continues to ignore whatever the voters want. He was elected to represent the  people and he doesn't even attempt to represent them."  </P> <P> Prince said the Porter Ranch project is a key example. The Times Poll found  that 63% of those in Bernson's district oppose the plan, while only 27% favor  it. Bernson supports the plan on the grounds that its large size will allow the  city to require the developer to spend between $80 million and $100 million to  build a fire station, library and parks and to make significant improvements to  streets and to the Simi Valley Freeway.  </P></p>

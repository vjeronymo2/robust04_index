			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Now, after one year has passed since it emerged  under the veil of a civilian administration, the current South  Korean regime has fully revealed its face as a group of civilian  fascists after completely taking off their masks.    The paper of pannational workers in South Korea questioned  if  the Kim Yong-sam government is truly a civilian government, and  wrote that if the Kim Yong-sam government is truly a civilian  government, it should prove that it differs from the Chon  Tu-hwan and No Tae-u military governments. However, it is not  different from a military regime. The traitorous nature of the  civilian regime has been intensively exposed.    It is not an accident that the South Korean people brand and  condemn the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime as a fascist regime far  surpassing the Fifth and Sixth Republics. If the South Korean  ruling bunch wants to carry out genuine civilian politics, it  should first abolish the National Security Law, which infringes  upon and obliterates the people's political rights and poses an  obstacle to national reunification.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, is maintaining  intact the National Security Law -- a remnant of a  confrontational era and military dictatorship that instigated  anticommunism and confrontation -- and committed  antireunification and antinational acts. By wielding this law,  it is cruelly oppressing the people's struggle for independence,  democracy, and reunification.    One example is that in May 1993 the fascist ring, by  mobilizing more than 100,000 police forces, atrociously  suppressed the struggle of youth, students, and citizens  demanding revelation of the truth of the Kwangju incident and  punishment of those responsible for the incident, and injured  people three times more than that of the Sixth Republic.    At the end of May 1993, the civilian government viewed it as  a crime that South Korean youth and students wanted to  participate through an international telephone line in the first  cochairmen delegation's meeting of the National Alliance of  Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification  [Pomchonghangnyon] and suppressed them by exercising the  National Security Law. On 12 June, it mobilized more than  12,000 combat police to block the northward road of South Korean  youth and students advancing to Panmunjom in order to attend  North-South student talks, and arrested more than 370 of them on  the spot.    The civilian fascist regime claimed that the holding of the  Fourth Pannational Rally in Seoul hosted by the South Korean  reunification and patriotic forces is also a violation of the  National Security Law and committed the criminal act of blocking  the rally.    With the National Security Law still in force, numerous  reunification and patriotic figures have been imprisoned and are  moaning in 222 police stations, over 3,400 police branches, and  hundreds of prisons across South Korea. According to the data,  which was even reduced by the authorities, the South Korean  prisons are overflowing with prisoners numbering 60,000 to  70,000.    That the civilian regime is only in name is also proven by  the fact that the Kim Yong-sam ring, like previous military  fascist dictators, has not disbanded the Agency for National  Security Planning [NSP] -- the general headquarters of fascist  suppression -- despite the people's stern denunciation, but  assumes it as a shield for its survival.    Although the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, forced by the  people's resistance, publicized the reduction of the NSP, in  actuality, it transferred some of the NSP's functions to various  offices and agencies of the administration, and posted others in  research institutes it newly organized. Moreover, it newly  established the Anti-North Strategic Planning Bureau and  reorganized and expanded the NSP's structure, thus committing a  crime.    Presently in South Korea, the NSP exists as an oppressive  organization supporting the civilian regime, which is in a  crisis. The civilian regime is instigating confrontation between  fellow countrymen, and works out smear incidents one after  another. Thus, it is running amok to suppress the patriotic  reunification forces.    The South Korean people will never tolerate the civilian  regime, which follows the tracks of the Fifth and Sixth  Republics, and will sternly punish it without fail.</p>

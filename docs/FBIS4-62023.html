			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents] </F>   [Text] Bonn May 12 TASS -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin  wants Germany which is to chair the European Union from July to  promote its integration into international financial  institutions.    "Russia should be pulled closer in Naples", Yeltsin told  German Finance Minister Theo Waigel at the end of their Thursday  meeting referring to the G-7 summit scheduled for July.    "We shall try as much as it is possible", Waigel promised in  return.    According to Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin,  Yeltsin wants the G-7 to analyse the forms of insuring  investments in Russia from noncommercial risks. He told TASS  that the Russian leader had raised the issue at the G-7 summit  in Tokyo, but "unfortunately the European Union is only now  getting down to the work".    Shokhin added that the problems of Russian foreign debt in  the framework of the London and Paris Clubs of creditors were  discussed during Yeltsin's meeting with Waigel.    Waigel, in his turn, told TASS that the debt problem will be  discussed in detail at his talks with Shokhin. According to  him, Yeltsin expressed his gratitude for efficient work in  attracting international financial institutions to reforming  Russian economy.    He also said that the Russian pullout from Germany will not  "alienate the peoples" of the two countries. "On the contrary,  this step already now causes sympathy to Russia among citizens  and political parties of our country", the finance minister  stressed.    After the meeting with Waigel Yeltsin left for Helmut Kohl's  home region of Rhineland-Palatinate where he is to hold several  private meetings with the chancellor.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: GBL lifts first-half profits 6% Belgium's second largest holding company, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, announced a 6 per cent increase in consolidated profits from BFr4.2bn (USDollars 132m) in the six months to June compared with BFr3.9bn in the same period a year earlier. Net earnings per share rose to BFr180 against BFr175 for the diversified holding, which has interests in oil, the media, utilities, insurance and banking. Barring unforeseen events, the group should report an increased profit for the whole year, which would allow it to pay an unchanged dividend. The group has 21.8 per cent in Petrofina, the petrochemicals company, 20.3 per cent in Tractebel, the energy group, 13.1 per cent of Royal Belge, the insurance company, 59.2 per cent of CLT, and 12.4 per cent of BBL, the retail bank. In June GBL announced an increase in its holding of Audiofina from 52.5 per cent to 55.3 per cent as part of a restructuring of its majority shareholding together with French media group Havas. GBL's investments have reached BFr12bn since the beginning of the year. Royale Belge announced that consolidated turnover amounted to BFr55.5bn, a 3.4 per cent increase on the same period a year ago.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Labour vows to combat City 'short-termism' A Labour government would seek to reform companies law to counter the culture of City 'short-termism' which the party believes is harming industry. A 17,000-word paper on competitiveness, to be published next week, will set out a six-point plan for reviving industry, including tougher controls on takeovers and a network of development agencies to promote economic activity in the regions. The timing of the launch is designed to steal some of the thunder from the government's much-trumpeted competitiveness white paper, due for publication on May 16. It follows last week's report by the Tory-controlled Commons trade and industry committee, which urged institutional investors to adopt a more flexible approach to corporate dividend payments and singled out City short-termism as a structural weakness damaging Britain's prospects. The white paper - set to appear in the critical period between the approaching local and European elections - is expected to act as a mid-term manifesto, pulling together a range of policies on education, training and manufacturing. News of the Labour document emerged as Mr John Smith, party leader, promised an audience of trade unionists a 'new deal for working people', enshrining 'proper' rights in the workplace and a statutory national minimum wage. Mr Smith, addressing the annual conference in Blackpool of the shopworkers' union Usdaw, did not give a precise figure at which the minimum would be pitched. He said only that rates of less than Pounds 3 an hour were judged to be too generous by the government. Underlining Labour's commitment to the goal of full employment, Mr Smith promised action to ensure that employers could not deny union representation to workers who voted in favour of it in a secret ballot. He also pledged that signing the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty would be among the first acts of the next Labour government. Next week's paper will back the imposition of statutory interest payments on companies which settle their debts late - a move under consideration by ministers - and urge that companies which attempt hostile takeovers should have to prove the deal would be in the public interest. Focusing on the need to encourage more long-term investment in manufacturing, it will argue that the fear of a takeover is the single largest reason why the dividends paid by UK companies are comparatively high.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Climbing the slippery slope - Victor Mallet looks at how Castrol made a name for itself in Vietnam Castrol is hoping that its name will soon mean 'lubricant' in the Vietnamese language, just as 'Honda' is the popular Vietnamese word for motorcycle. The UK-based lubricants multinational has already gone a long way towards that target in the past three years, and Castrol is a byword for successful brand name promotion among foreign investors in Vietnam's undeveloped but fast-growing market. The green and red Castrol logo is prominently displayed not only in the streets of Ho Chi Minh City - the southern commercial centre that includes Saigon - but throughout the provinces of Vietnam, on advertisement hoardings, car stickers and, above all, on some 4,000 signboards at Vietnam's ubiquitous roadside garages and motorcycle cleaning shops. Castrol says its own researchers have found that the company's rhythmic local slogan 'Dau nhot tot nhat' ('Best quality lubricants') is recognised by a remarkable 99 per cent of people in Ho Chi Minh City. Airport check-in attendants even recite the slogan when they see a customer in a Castrol shirt, according to George Webster, the South African-born general director of Castrol Vietnam. He says Castrol owes its marketing success in Vietnam to its early entry into the market, its choice of a good local partner and a bit of old-fashioned determination. Castrol had been selling marine lubricants to Vietnam since 1981, and was one of the first wave of foreign companies to invest in production facilities when the communist government launched the policy of 'doi moi' ('renovation', the Vietnamese version of perestroika) in the late 1980s. The Dollars 3.9m (Pounds 2.5m) joint venture company licensed in 1991 is owned 60 per cent by Castrol and 40 per cent by Saigon Petro, a fuel import and distribution company control-led by the Ho Chi Minh City people's committee, the communist local government. The joint venture opened its 25,000-tonnes-a-year blending plant near Ho Chi Minh City two years ago and employs 125 people. At first Castrol Vietnam intended to concentrate on the market in and around Saigon, but it soon found its products travelling north and south through informal networks. So the company established its own network of distribution agents in all but five of the country's 52 provinces, and operated its own delivery fleet. The peculiarities of the Vietnamese market mean that most provincial agents are state companies, while most urban ones are private; and in some provinces Castrol has two distributors, one for state and one for private customers. The distribution drive was backed by television advertising and by the painted signboards. Each of Castrol's three sales teams is supported by a marketing services group. Working with the distributors, the salesmen identify a suitable shop; the marketing team finds a contractor to paint a sign for the owner and ensures the quality of the logo. The first foreign investors in Vietnam were pioneers. Activities normally farmed out to specialised service companies, such as buying television airtime for advertisements, were handled by Castrol itself because such companies did not exist. 'There's not a lot of external infrastructure,' says Webster. Despite its success in becoming Vietnam's brand leader in lubricants and in setting up a national distribution network, Castrol has found it hard to persuade the Vietnamese to switch from cheap, low-quality lubricants in drums to its more expensive packaged products. The packaged product, at 15,000 to 17,000 dong (about Dollars 1.50) a litre, is three times the price of the cheaper oil in drums, which used to come from the Soviet Union but is now imported from such countries as Taiwan and Thailand. 'We are appealing to people who want to take care of their new motorcycles,' says Webster. 'It's a slow process. Our main thrust is to establish the Castrol brand in the consumer market and, with the high awareness, we get quite a good run-off in the industrial market.' The rival British company BP - in partnership with Petrolimex, the state fuel importer and distributor - is investing in a blending plant with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes a year and is marketing packaged and bulk products to consumers. The two companies see eye to eye, however, when they need to protect their Vietnamese investments from cheap imports. One of the biggest headaches for the two - which between them have invested in enough capacity to serve the entire Vietnamese annual lubricant market of an estimated 75,000 tonnes - has been to ensure that government taxes and customs tariffs favour local producers over importers. While Castrol was building its plant, tariffs on lubricants were unexpectedly lowered from 10 per cent to 1 per cent - which meant that Castrol would have been better off importing packaged lubricants from Singapore - although they have now been raised again to between 18 and 20 per cent. But cheating remains common. No sooner had the watchful Castrol executives and their allies stemmed the flow of imported motor oil masquerading as 'hydraulic brake fluid' (which enjoys a 1 per cent tariff) than they noticed a surge in imports of 'rubber process oil'. Other foreign investors envy Castrol's marketing prowess in Vietnam, but they question whether it is possible to make profits in such difficult conditions. Webster says the profits may be small for the time being, but he insists Castrol Vietnam has made money from its first month and was quicker to get off the ground than Castrol subsidiaries started elsewhere in Asia in the last five years. An early investment and effective marketing of products to Vietnam's 70m consumers were vital to Castrol's success, as Ian Pringle, Castrol International's director for Asia, made clear during a recent visit to the region. 'We were fortunate enough to be faster than our competitors,' he said. 'We actually introduced consumer advertising to Vietnam.'</p>

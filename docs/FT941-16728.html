			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Scott blames Whitehall for inquiry delays Lord Justice Scott has told the government that continuing delays in obtaining Whitehall documents have disrupted the progress of his arms-for-Iraq inquiry. In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, the judge confirms the inquiry has been delayed and sets a provisional date of July for the completion of a first draft of his report. While thanking the minister for the co-operation generally shown by Whitehall, Lord Justice Scott states: 'I regret to say . . . that there have been a number of occasions when documents have been submitted long after they should have been.' The letter continues: 'This inevitably disrupts the orderly conduct of business.' Lord Justice Scott says in the letter that his inquiry has 'raised important questions about the relationship between ministers and parliament and between civil servants and their ministers'. An inquiry official said last night that there was no suggestion that the government was deliberately trying to withhold information. 'We have found that some of the documents we have asked for have been misfiled, or come to light after further inquiries,' he said. The delay means that the contents of the Scott report will not be known until after elections for councils and the European parliament. The letter, sent on December 21, was released yesterday by the judge with a reply dated January 5 from Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, in the absence of Mr Heseltine, who has been on holiday. In his reply, Mr Needham reiterates earlier assurances made by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that the government will 'continue to do all that we can to assist' the judge in his inquiry. The inquiry will resume public hearings next week with the appearance as witnesses of Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, and Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary. Critics of the inquiry in recent months have suggested that the exercise was proving an unnecessary waste of government money. But the inquiry's sponsoring department, the Department of Trade and Industry, last night released figures which officials described as confirming 'reasonable expenditure'. The inquiry costs to the DTI since November 1992 are officially put at Pounds 610,000. It is being covered by the DTI's overall budget for miscellaneous running costs in the year 1993-94 of Pounds 329m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After 5 years of experience with the 1989 procedures, and after consultation with the Bar Committee representing the International Law Section of the District of Columbia Bar, the Section of International Law and Practice of the American Bar Association, the International Trade Commission Trial Lawyers Association, and the Customs and International Trade Bar Association (the Committee), we believe it is time to reevaluate and revise our procedures. The Committee polled its members on various issues. Through this cooperative effort, the ITA is proposing changes that reduce the micromanagement of a representative's handling of business proprietary information, allow for two independent representatives to have APOs in a proceeding, and provide for the issuance of a single APO on the record in each proceeding, rather than the issuance of multiple APOs to each representative. We believe that the proposed changes will provide for effective and practicable protection of business proprietary information, expedite issuance of APOs and APO amendments, and reduce the number of APO violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed changes to the APO application and the procedures are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Revised Application for APO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the recommendation of the Committee, we propose removing overly restrictive conditions in the application for APO and the APO itself, while retaining the critical restrictions necessary to protect the APO information. The proposed changes will streamline the process for both the parties and the ITA. Under current procedures, ITA issues one APO for proprietary information submitted on hard copy, and a different APO for proprietary information submitted on electronic medium, the so-called ``computer tape'' APO. The tape APO contains numerous additional restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed APO application incorporates three restrictions concerning electronic data and eliminates additional conditions that the ITA has traditionally placed in its computer tape APOs. The significant changes to the APO application are set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Representation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed APO application (Items 1 and 7) allows a party to the proceeding to have two independent representatives. Item 7 of the application defines a ``representative'' as an attorney or non-legal specialist associated with a single firm, who is acting on behalf of the party to the proceeding. Separate applications can be filed by applicants from more than one law firm or non-legal specialist firm acting on behalf of the party or parties to the proceeding. When an interested party has representatives from two different firms, the lead representative that will be the primary contact for the Department must be identified. A ``lead'' representative must be designated either in the transmittal letter to the ITA, or in the APO application, if more than one representative is retained. A non-legal specialist may function as the ``lead'' representative. The ITA does not wish to consider authorizing more than two representatives (i.e., firms) on behalf of a party as it may cause confusion and create difficulties in administering the proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

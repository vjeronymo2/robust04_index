			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Gwent (3): Second leap forward - Severn airport and second bridge planned GWENT'S transport communications look poised to undergo as dramatic a leap forward over the next decade as they experienced a quarter of a century ago when the Severn bridge opened. Before 1966, drivers of cars and lorries wishing to travel between Newport and Bristol had either to queue up to catch the Aust ferry which plied the river near the existing crossing, or travel northwards to cross the Severn at Gloucester. It was a different era. Now plans are afoot for an equally dramatic addition to Gwent's transport infrastructure - construction of a Severnside International Airport, offering an alternative to Heathrow and Gatwick for long-haul scheduled services. Should the project go ahead, it will give Gwent's already excellent communications a substantial extra dimension. It has to be said immediately that the project is the object of considerable scepticism locally, not least because the proposal was first put forward more than a decade ago. Gwent County Council sought then to promote the virtues of Severnside as the site for London's third airport in preference to Stansted. Though the council lobbied hard, the proposal failed to win Whitehall's support and had to be shelved. Then, in March last year, it was announced that a privately-led consortium had decided to take the county council's proposal off the shelf and carry forward the scheme, whose centrepiece is the construction of a 4,000 metre runway on land reclaimed from the Severn estuary. Little has been heard of the project since last year's announcement, but according to Mr Paul Boyce-Mears, managing director of the new consortium company, Severnside International Airport, this does not denote inactivity. 'A great deal of preparatory work has been going on behind the scenes on the design, engineering and environmental requirements of the project.' Rather than build another Gatwick or Heathrow, the consortium's model is Manchester airport which has gradually but steadily expanded its range of scheduled services to the point where it now handles 11m passengers a year. The Severnside consortium sees its project as the third leg of a triangle of long-haul airports serving England and Wales  - the other two being Manchester and Heathrow. Mr Boyce-Mears admits the main obstacle still to be overcome is finance. 'During the past year the climate has not been good for winning backing for major capital projects. However, I think we are now on the way to getting the required finance.' He is reasonably optimistic that the consortium will be in a position to apply for planning permission before the summer is over and place the necessary bill before parliament later this year. Assuming there are no unexpected hiccups, the new airport could be open for business in five or six years. Mr Boyce-Mears stresses that while the project is big, it is straightforward. It involves investment of Pounds 200m in land reclamation to create a 4,000-metre runway capable of handling, fully-laden, the new generation of 600-passenger Jumbos and Airbuses, and investment of a further Pounds 500m to build a modern terminal capable of handling large quantities of freight traffic, as well as passengers. Airfreight traffic is currently growing at a faster rate than passenger traffic. One of the key advantages of building the airport on reclaimed estuarial land is that it eliminates problems of noise pollution. Mr Boyce-Mears says the investigations they have undertaken show that the number of people affected by the noise 'cone' created by aircraft using Severnside would be zero - because the aircraft approaches and take-offs would be over water. By comparison, some 500,000 people are adversely affected by aircraft noise at Heathrow and 50,000 people at Gatwick. Gwent's other major communications development - the go-ahead of the second Severn bridge - has also enhanced the viability of the Severnside airport project. It has eliminated concern that the current bridge, which carries 19m vehicles a year, compared with 6m when it first opened, could become a serious bottleneck for traffic travelling to and from the airport. (That said, regular traffic jams on the Chiswick flyover do not seem to have dented Heathrow's attractions.) The second Severn bridge is now definitely going ahead. The start of work was signalled in April when responsibility for the existing bridge passed from the Department of Transport to Severn River Crossing, the consortium which will build, finance and operate the new crossing, with the help of revenues raised from the existing crossing. The four major shareholders in the consortium are John Laing, GTM-Entrepose, Bank of America and Barclays de Zoete Wedd. This change of ownership from the public to the private sector proved to be an inauspicious occasion. Large traffic jams built up as a result of the new consortium's decision to raise charges sharply and to begin reconstruction immediately of the tolls plaza at Aust. Instead of vehicles having to pay a toll travelling in either direction, they are now charged only if travelling in a westbound direction into Wales. Lord Hooson, chairman of the consortium, says that once the new systems are in place, 'they will offer a much speedier passage for the 19m vehicles a year now using the bridge.' The new bridge will be three miles long, and three miles downstream of the existing bridge. It will have three traffic lanes and hard-shoulders each way and wind-shielding to allow vehicles to cross even in high winds. Fears have been expressed in the past that a second Severn bridge could weaken, rather than strengthen, Gwent's economy by encouraging businesses and skills to migrate from the county to the Bristol area. The signs are that, on the contrary, it is opening up new opportunities to strengthen the local economy. This, too, is evidently the conclusion of a new Pieda study on the impact of the second Severn bridge. Due to be published shortly, it forecasts that the benefits will far outweigh any deleterious effects.</p>

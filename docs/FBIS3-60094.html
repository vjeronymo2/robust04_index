In 1993, police mobilized  all their personnel resources to fight drug trafficking. The  1993 internal report by the police drug section is devastating.  This is an exclusive report by DIE PRESSE:    "We are losing track of the overall picture," the report  says. The number of police arrests rose from 849 in 1992 to  1,370 in 1993; there was a record number of official  investigations [Amtshandlungen] leading to over 100 arrests; and  a spate of suspected offenses was reported to the police.    "The former Eastern Bloc countries are now being used as  caches by the producer countries. Large amounts of drugs are  smuggled into Austria by all means imaginable and sold here," a  police official said. The dealers have organized themselves  into groups and are working in a very professional way. "We  have begun to sense this in 1993 for the first time."    The dealers work in complete isolation. Third countries  build up huge caches in Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech  Republic. The local drug scenes in these countries have gotten  completely out of hand. Then smugglers are hired.    "Eighty percent of drug dealing is controlled by Turks and  Yugoslavs," the investigating authorities say. The "stuff" is  brought into Austria in cars, buses, or aboard ships; yet the  quantities are always less than 1 kg. [passage omitted].

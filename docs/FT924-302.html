			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 60m science laboratory RMJM has produced a 'trend-setting' design for a building for the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Foods's Pounds 60m central science laboratory at Ryedale, near York. The construction contract for the 40,000 sq metre campus has been awarded to LAING CONSTRUCTION and HADEN YOUNG. Work will commence in the New Year and completion is scheduled early in 1996. The RMJM team of architects, engineers and planners has come up with a novel approach to providing flexible laboratory buildings by placing mechanical, electrical and drainage services on the perimeters of the buildings. 'The idea has been tried in one or two places, but this is the first time it has been applied wholesale on a group of laboratory buildings in the UK', said RMJM's project director Mr Alan Crawshaw. The design locates major plant, such as bulky air handling units, at roof level in link blocks which run at right angles to the laboratory blocks. The roof spaces over the laboratories contain the ducts for air handling, which are then fed down the exterior of the two-storey buildings to first and ground floor laboratories. The result is standardised structures with an 80 sq metre grid which can be used for anything from office space to a chemistry laboratory. The design has the additional advantage that it eliminates conventional ground ducts and space consuming risers, which are inflexible and expensive to replace.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Taiwan may invest in McDonnell Douglas TAIWAN'S government is inclined to support a proposed deal for a Taiwanese company to buy a stake in the commercial aircraft business of McDonnell Douglas, according to a report by Economics Minister Mr Vincent Siew, Reuter reports. The government would be willing to consider providing low-interest loans and tax breaks to the Dollars 2bn project if Taiwan Aerospace decides to go ahead with the investment, the report says. It stops short of explicitly recommending the company proceed with the deal with the US group, but says the project provides great opportunities for Taiwan. 'It is a high-risk venture but it will help upgrade our industrial level . . . We need the full support of parliament, the government and the private sector.' The report is due to be delivered to parliament on Wednesday, but was leaked to the local press. Taiwan Aerospace, set up last year and 29 per cent owned by the government, signed a memorandum of understanding with McDonnell Douglas last November to buy up to 40 per cent of the US company's commercial aircraft operations for Dollars 2bn. Taiwan Aerospace has since indicated that the stake acquired could be as low as 25 per cent. McDonnell Douglas will retain a 51 per cent stake, but the US company is already discussing, with other investors from south-east Asia or South Korea, making up any shortfall in Taiwan's investment. The deal, which needs approval by both governments, would boost Taiwan's fledgling aerospace industry and give McDonnell Douglas the funds to develop its next-generation MD-12 jetliner. But the deal has run into opposition from some legislators in Taiwan, who have criticised it as a bad investment and threatened to try to prevent the government from using state funds to support the project. Mr Siew's report to parliament says Taiwan's government and private companies holding stakes in Taiwan Aerospace should reopen negotiations with McDonnell Douglas to reach agreement on details and conditions of the proposed investment. The report, which quotes a three-month feasibility study into the project completed recently by state-run China Steel Corp, says producing fuselages, wings and other components for the MD-12 in Taiwan would create 90,000 jobs.</p>

Perhaps the Tall al-Za'tar massacre was, but what  happened was a combination of all these massacres at once. It  was the bloody Friday massacre that extended from Hebron to  Gaza, Nabulus to Ramallah, and from the ocean to the gulf,  enveloping the entire Arab homeland; a massacre that was the  natural twin -- since it came from the same womb -- of the Hamah  massacre in Syria in 1982 and the al-'Amiriyah shelter massacre  in Baghdad in 1991. It was the massacre that drowned the faces,  souls, bodies, policies, and the persons of the gathering of  servility, humiliation, abandonment, concession, and  normalization with the Zionist Jews -- the Hafr al-Batin  gathering.    The Palestinian blood that filled the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque  in  Hebron was a bath from which none of those Zionist Arabs who  shook hands with Zionist Jews will emerge.    It was a bloody massacre, drowning in eternal shame Hafiz  al-Asad, Husni Mubaak, Fahd, Jabir, and all the others. They  are responsible for the death of Iraqi children in their  sickbeds in hospitals due to shortages of medicine and food.  This is thanks to the blockade imposed by the savage  civilization that has allowed the death of Muslims in Sarajevo  and danced to the tune of Arab deaths from Somalia to Baghdad,  via the West Bank and Gaza, to the remotest areas of the Earth,  wherever people speak Arabic or recite the holy book in Arabic,  because the Koran is Arab and Prophet Muhammad, may the peace  and blessings of God be upon him, was an Arab.    This Palestinian blood is the curse of the righteous martyrs  who fell in defense of the Allahu Akbar flag [Iraqi flag] and  for the sake of justice, freedom, and human dignity. It is the  curse of the martyrs on everyone who has betrayed their blood  and generous sacrifices and disavowed the sacred slogans for  which they died peacefully, knowing their blood will not be  wasted.    This Palestinian blood is the responsibility of those who  rushed to Madrid.    It is the responsiblity of those for whom Washington has  become Mecca.    It is the responsibility of those who sold Arab national  honor in the slave market between the walls of the Security  Council and the Knesset.    Tell me, O nation of Muhammad; tell me, O free Arabs, what  would have happened if Palestinians had attacked a Jewish  synagogue and slain seventy and wounded 500 others in cold blood?    Nay, what would have happened had a faithful Arab government  slain 10 debased traitors in broad daylight? Would it not have  aroused the [Security] Council, human rights, and the new world  order? In fact, armies would have moved, missiles would have  been launched, and aircraft would have taken off to burn and  destroy!    What peace, what normalization, and what agreements can  there  be with criminal racist murderers? Let God be our witness,  whoever calls for or strives toward that will be directly  responsible for every drop of Palestinian blood that has been,  or is being, shed on the soil of the entire Arab homeland from  the ocean to the gulf.    O pure blood, you are boiling in the veins. You are the  moment of truth that burns the spiders web. O Palestinian  blood, can we forget you? If we did, we would not be Arabs.  Woe to us from our grandsons and conscience. Woe to us from  our Arab blood which is calling us day and night: Revenge,  revenge. Where is the Arab who forgets blood revenge?</p>

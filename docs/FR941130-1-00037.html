			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Also, under proposed &sect;6.10(f), NRTLs must make available for MSHA review the results of their field audit (follow-up) programs. This includes reports of factory inspections of manufacturers whose products the NRTL is testing and evaluating and any field audits of products to monitor and ensure the proper use of the NRTL's mark. In addition, the NRTL must notify MSHA expeditiously, for example by telephone or by fax, and send the Agency any necessary documentation when audits reveal nonconformities in products issued an MSHA approval. Because NRTLs currently maintain records of audits performed on products as a normal business practice, there are no paperwork burden hours related to maintaining such records. However, as a result of the proposed rule, the NRTLs would have to notify and send necessary documentation to MSHA when audits reveal nonconformities in approved products. MSHA estimated that NRTLs would find product nonconformities in about 12 percent of audits, and it would take an NRTL about 30 minutes to notify and send MSHA the necessary documentation. In FY 1993, MSHA audited 709 units of approved products. Thus, the associated burden hours are estimated to be about 43 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments regarding the proposed paperwork provisions, estimates, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing these burdens, should be sent to Patricia W. Silvey, Director, Office of Standards, Regulations, and Variances, MSHA, Room 631, 4015 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22203, and directly to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Steve Semenuk, Desk Officer for the Mine Safety and Health Administration, Room 3001, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> From its creation by Congress in 1910, MSHA's predecessor, the Bureau of Mines, Department of the Interior (Bureau), was responsible for the testing and evaluation of mining products. Under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act), MSHA is responsible for prescribing the technical design, construction, and test requirements for certain products used in underground mines, and for testing and evaluating them for approval based on those requirements. These technical requirements are set forth in the Agency's approval regulations in 30 CFR parts 7 through 36.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA's approval regulations govern the process through which manufacturers may obtain MSHA approval, certification, acceptance or evaluation of certain products for use in underground mines. Each of these separate approval actions has specific application procedures and technical requirements for testing and evaluation. MSHA currently conducts the testing and evaluation of products for a fee paid by the applicant. Following MSHA approval, manufacturers must ensure that the product continues to conform to the technical requirements tested, evaluated, and approved by MSHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When MSHA receives an application for approval of a product for use in underground mines, every aspect of the documentation package is scrutinized to determine whether the technical requirements of the applicable provisions of 30 CFR parts 15 through 36 have been met. Each drawing and specification in the package is cross-checked against these requirements and, for some products, samples of the product or parts of the product are disassembled and examined by MSHA for conformity with the drawings and specifications. After MSHA verifies that an applicant's product complies with the design and construction requirements, MSHA then tests the product to determine whether it performs according to the approval requirements, unless the design obviates the need for testing. If the product passes the tests and meets all MSHA requirements, MSHA issues an approval for the product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once MSHA has approved a product, the manufacturer is authorized to place an MSHA approval marking on the product that identifies it as approved for use in underground mines. Use of the MSHA marking obligates the manufacturer to maintain the quality of the product as approved. The MSHA marking indicates to the mining community that the product has been manufactured according to the drawings and specifications upon which the approval was based. Any proposed change to an approved product that causes it to differ from the design or construction described in the original documentation approved by MSHA must be submitted to the Agency for approval prior to implementation of the change. If MSHA approves the change, the Agency issues an extension of approval or a notice of acceptance of the modified product to the manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

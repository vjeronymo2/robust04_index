The prime minister has instructed  concerned officials in government and the ruling coalition  parties of his intention to study ways to promote the reform.  The prime minister is aiming to win the people's understanding  of his intention to push for the administrative and fiscal  reform by announcing his plans to "make the government lean"  after judging that debates on tax increases are inevitable in  the course of sweeping reform of the current tax system for  Japan to prepare itself for a society of senior citizens. While  the idea is surfacing within the ruling coalition parties of  merging three agencies -- the National Land Agency, the Hokkaido  Development Agency, and the Okinawa Development Agency -- the  prime minister plans to review the need to maintain various  corporations and business corporations. The prime minister's  plans, however, will encounter twists and turns because the  government ministries and agencies are expected to react against  them.    The prime minister believes that his failure to mention how  he will work to reform and streamline the administration was one  of the reasons for the national welfare tax coming under attack.  The prime minister thinks it is indispensable for the government  to show a posture to make itself lean and not to meet all fiscal  requirements through tax increases. Among the ruling coalition  parties, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which  wants to avoid raising the consumption tax, is responding  positively to the prime minister's plans.    Along with the prime minister's intention, the  Administrative  and Fiscal Subcommittee in the "Tax System Reform Consultative  Council on Social Welfare" (headed by Koken Nosaka, chairman of  the SDPJ Diet Administration Committee), is now working on a  full-fledged review, and a plan is surfacing for merging the  Hokkaido Development Agency and the Okinawa Development Agency  into bureaus in the National Land Agency.    The plan has been incorporated three times in all in reports  compiled by the Second Provisional Administrative Survey Council  in 1981 and the Second Provisional Administrative Reform  Promotion Deliberation Council in 1987 on the need to promote  the comprehensive and integrated development of national land,  but it has never been put into effect.    In this connection, moves are afoot to reexamine the way the  Hokkaido-Tohoku Development Finance Corporation, the Okinawa  Development Finance Corporation, and the Amami Gunto Promotion  Development Credit Fund are managed. The Third Administrative  Reform Council, which tried to promote reform of special  corporations in the closing days of the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP], scrapped plans to compile a final report in the face of  backlash from government ministries and agencies shortly after  the Hosokawa government was inaugurated. Taking this background  into account, the prime minister is showing his eagerness to  grapple with the policy task that was left unaccomplished during  the LDP era. The prime minister is poised to study broad ways to  merge, abolish, or privatize corporations, business  corporations, and financial corporations, and funds whose  management is intransparent, whose work is duplicated, and whose  significance of existence is lost in view of the objective of  their establishment.    Government ministries and agencies in Kasumigaseki [name of  Tokyo town where government ministries and agencies are located]  very strongly resist any reform that affects directly the fate  of their organizations and a loss of their vested interests. In  response to the plan for the merger of the three agencies, the  Hokkaido Development Agency and the Okinawa Development Agency  are voicing their strong opposition to concerned officials in  the ruling coalition parties. Some point out that "it is  doubtful how much in financial resources the government will be  able to save by reorganizing government ministries and agencies,  and reforming special corporations."    The prime minister, Kasumigaseki, and the ruling coalition  parties are expected to engage in a fierce tug of war in the  future.</p>

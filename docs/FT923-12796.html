			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Bosnian Serbs' leader orders end to shelling: Diplomatic moves in London MR Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serbs, yesterday ordered his forces to stop bombarding the eastern Bosnian city of Gorazde as European Community-sponsored peace talks appeared powerless to bring about a ceasefire in the republic. EC diplomats in London said Serb irregulars had been besieging Gorazde, a town of 37,000 inhabitants, of which 70 per cent are Moslem, as part of a plan to 'ethnically cleanse' the region and eventually annex eastern Bosnia to Serbia. Despite the differences and the fact that all three sides did not meet one another, Mr Jose Cutileiro, the EC mediator, said: 'I am not that pessimistic.' Mr Karadzic denied Serb forces were involved in deportations, expulsions, and killings, despite numerous eye-witness accounts. 'What we want is a Bosnia-Hercegovina which is based on three constituent states. With this in mind, we support the current EC negotiations,' he said in an interview. He said these three ethnic states would consist of Moslem, Serb and Croat regions. The Serbs account for a third of Bosnians, but with the support of the former Yugoslav army, they have seized two thirds of Bosnia-Herce-govina. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, said he wanted a unitary state, adding that the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina along ethnic lines would fail to take into account mixed marriages, as well as those who perceived themselves to be Bosnian. 'What Serb extremists are doing in Bosnia today is what the Nazis did in world war two. Identity and ethnicity are being imposed on innocent civilians,' he said. Bosnia's Moslems, who make up 44 per cent of the 4.3m-strong population, had earlier in the week put forward a peace plan offering equal shares of cabinet posts to the other two ethnic communities. It was rejected by Mr Karadzic and Mr Boban. In an open letter to Lord Carrington, and Mr Cutileiro, Mr Silajdzic asked the EC to stop the flow of weapons into Bosnia from neighbouring Serbia and Montenegro. 'It is the Serb extremists who hold the weapons and continue the war. It is the Serb extremists who are in a position to stop the killing. All heavy weaponry and artillery should be placed under international control as a precondition for constitutional negotiations,' he said. Mr Karadzic said he had no preconditions for peace talks, but agreed with the plan to place weapons under international supervision. Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats and a close ally of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, said he would support the EC Lisbon plan of March 9 which stipulated that Bosnia would be composed of several national units, but that the current borders of the republic would remain intact. However, EC diplomats in London said Croatia and Serbia were working on dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina between them, as witness the recent declaration of a Croatian-run state within a state in western Hercegovina. Mr Silajdzic yesterday said Mr Boban and Mr Karadzic had met in early July in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, where the Serbs agreed to recognise the Croatian region of Herceg-Bosnia, with a possible link to Zagreb. In return Mr Boban had promised not to interfere in northern Bosnia, and called for large population shifts aimed at creating ethnically clean areas. Both Mr Karadzic and Mr Boban denied meeting each other.</p>

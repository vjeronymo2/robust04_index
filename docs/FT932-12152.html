			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Noranda pushed into the red NORANDA, the resources group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, was pushed into a first-quarter loss by lower metal prices and a CDollars 30m (USDollars 23.8m) loss from the recent sale of its stake in MacMillan Bloedel, the west coast forestry company. The net loss was CDollars 31m, or 25 cents a share, compared with earnings of CDollars 17m, or 1 cent a share, a year earlier. Sales dipped to CDollars 1.29bn from CDollars 1.33bn. Mr David Kerr, chief executive, painted a cautiously optimistic picture for the rest of the year. Noranda will benefit from a recent surge in timber and natural gas prices, and expects improved prices for paper. Mr Kerr said he was also encouraged by the growing strength of the US recovery. The mining and metals division turned from a CDollars 31m profit to a CDollars 3m loss as a result of low zinc and nickel prices, and production cutbacks to meet over-supplied markets. Forest products recovered to a CDollars 16m profit from a loss of CDollars 7m, due to record lumber prices and improving newsprint markets. Pulp prices remain in the doldrums, however, and are not expected to improve until 1994. Noranda has disposed of several businesses in recent months to improve its balance sheet and protect itself from the troubles in the rest of the Bronfman group. The sale of the MacMillan Bloedel stake last February has sliced long-term debt to CDollars 3bn from CDollars 4.9bn. The sale of a Canadian oil and gas exploration company and a Texas vinyl products plant raised another CDollars 119m in the first quarter.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirement for 24 consecutive hours of rest in any 7 consecutive days is designed to supplement daily rest requirements and to ensure that flight attendants receive the opportunity for adequate rest. The FAA did not verify lost flight attendant income, because the annual loss of extra income to some flight attendants represents a gain to flight attendants who would be hired. This income transfer is not considered a cost of this rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Single Set of Duty Time Rules for Cabin and Flight Crew Members <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Great American Airways stated that the total cost savings derived from implementing a single set of duty time rules for its cabin and flight crewmembers, as opposed to adopting the rules proposed in the NPRM, would exceed $100,000 per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA recognizes that giving operators the option to apply flight crewmember flights, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants may provide a cost savings to certain operators, particularly supplemental operators. The FAA expects that the operators that choose the option will incur costs that are lower than those estimated in the final regulatory evaluation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the FAA recognizes that operators who choose to apply the flight crewmember regulations for duty limitations and rest requirements must submit an application to the appropriate Flight Standards District Office for approval. This is a minor, one-time cost, and the FAA assumes that operators who choose to incur this cost would do so because it would obviate those operators from designing and establishing a tracking system for flight attendants. Instead, this option would allow them to use whatever system is in place for flight crewmembers. The application process chosen was selected deliberately out of concern that recordkeeping costs be kept to a minimum. That is, the FAA chose an application process that is very familiar to carriers, the commonly-used procedure for changes to operations specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Limiting Scheduled Duty Period to Fourteen Hours <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Great American Airways stated that limiting scheduled flight attendant duty periods to 14 hours would force the air carrier and other supplemental air carriers to add flight attendants at intermediate stops. The commenter stated that, because company-required deadhead transportation would be considered part of a duty period under the FAA's proposal, it would be necessary to schedule flight attendants for required rest after they completed a deadhead flight segment and before they began the next duty period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter also stated that the proposed rules would impose substantially greater costs on supplemental air carriers than other air carriers because supplemental air carriers rarely have travel privileges with scheduled carriers, and, when they do, they are often very restrictive. Finally, this commenter stated that unanticipated schedule and routing changes occur more frequently among charter operators than scheduled carriers and could severely curtail the flexibility of supplemental air carriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

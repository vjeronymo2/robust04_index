			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Yeltsin plunges Russia into crisis RUSSIA was plunged into an acute political crisis last night as its president and vice-president both claimed supreme state authority and the allegiance of the people and the armed forces. President Boris Yeltsin precipitated the long-awaited confrontation with parliament and General Alexander Rutskoi, his vice-president and main opponent, when he dissolved parliament, called elections for December and took emergency executive powers. But his unilateral action was immediately challenged by parliament, the constitutional court and Gen Rutskoi, who proclaimed Mr Yeltsin's act unconstitutional and declared himself president. Early this morning the army appeared to be staying neutral and there was no evidence of imminent armed conflict. But it was unclear who was in control and the scene seemed set for a prolonged power struggle. In a nationwide television address Mr Yeltsin told the Russian people he had dissolved the existing legislature - the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People's Deputies - and had called for elections to a new bicameral parliament, or Federal Assembly, for December 11 and 12, to be followed by early presidential elections. The country's constitutional court ruled that Mr Yeltsin had violated the constitution and could be impeached. Its chairman, Mr Valery Zorkin, told parliament after an emergency session the court had concluded that Mr Yeltsin's decree and statement did not correspond with the constitution and were a 'basis for impeaching the president'. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, appealed to all military, interior and security troops and militia to disobey the 'criminal orders' of the president and parliament voted to order the central bank to stop financing government and presidential structures. Shortly afterwards parliament reported that Mr Sergei Glazyev, the country's trade minister had resigned in protest at Mr Yeltsin's action. Mr Khasbulatov called on all regional and republican parliaments throughout Russia to hold immediate sessions to denounce the president's decree and told workers to mount strikes in defence of the constitution'. However, the prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, in an effort to calm an inflamed situation, indicated he remained loyal to Mr Yeltsin. 'I will carry out what is necessary for the government and the orders of the president,' he said after a government meeting. When asked if he meant Mr Yeltsin, Mr Chernomyrdin replied 'yes'. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister - who returned to his duties yesterday after being cleared of corruption charges - said that the heads of the 'power' ministries of Defence, Security and the Interior, who command all of the country's armed forces, had expressed support for Mr Yeltsin. There were signs, however, that Mr Yeltsin had not gained the full consent of all of his supporters before last night's dramatic announcement. A senior parliamentarian, speaking on condition of anonymity, said many members of the presidential team had advised against the move. He said senior members of the collegium of the Ministry of Defence had come to parliament after a meeting yesterday - and had retailed an account of a conversation between Mr Yeltsin and General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, in which, in response to obvious pressure from the president for his support, Gen Grachev had asked: 'What do you want me to do - bring in the army, or what?' Last night a statement from Russia's armed forces said they would obey the constitution and 'as in the past maintain strict neutrality'. Communists manned the barricades outside parliament in protest at Mr Yeltsin's decree, but there was little sign of stepped-up military activity. The parliament responded swiftly to Mr Yeltsin's announcement by voting late last night to strip him of his powers. A hastily-convened emergency session swore in Gen Rutskoi, still suspended by Mr Yeltsin from his vice-presidential duties on corruption allegations, as president. Gen Rutskoi quickly announced his first decree: 'To declare null and void all decrees issued by President Boris Yeltsin on September 21. Leaders of regions and (semi-autonomous) republics within the Russian federation are obliged to act within the constitution.' Earlier Gen Rutskoi said Mr Yeltsin had dismissed himself from power by breaching the constitution, and that he, Gen Rutskoi, was now president. 'This is a direct violation of the constitution,' he said from within the White House, or Russian parliament. 'It is an open state coup.' Mr Yeltsin said in his address he had taken all necessary measures to ensure security - and lorryloads of troops were deployed outside buildings such as the Interior Ministry. Anarchy, Mr Yeltsin said, could not be allowed in a country possessing nuclear weapons. His action was necessary to preserve both democracy and the still weak Russian market.

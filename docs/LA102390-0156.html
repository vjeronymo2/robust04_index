			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> GRANADA HILLS PILOT MISSING  </P> <P> Authorities are searching for a 68-year-old Granada Hills man who has been  missing since Monday morning when he took off in his single-engine plane from  Whiteman Airport.  </P> <P> Robert Bell, a retired carpenter, told his family Monday that he was going to  Whiteman in Pacoima to look at a plane, said Detective Jim Lewis of the Los  Angeles Police Department's Missing Persons unit.  </P> <P> When Bell failed to return home, his wife called police, who discovered Bell's  plane was missing from its hangar and his car parked nearby, Lewis said. Police  believe that Bell took off in his plane on an impromptu pleasure ride over the  Mojave Desert, as is often his custom, Lewis said.  </P> <P> Tuesday morning, eight planes combed the desert in search of Bell, said Lt.  Kate Kelley, a spokeswoman for the Civil Air Patrol.  </P></p>

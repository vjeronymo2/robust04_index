			<p>BFN     [Text] Uzbekistan's Foreign Minister Saydmukhtar  Saydkasymov said that the Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev's proposal of a Eurasian Union is an attempt to  restore the former USSR. He was speaking in Tashkent on Friday  [17 June] at a meeting with the heads of the diplomatic corps  accredited in the Republic.    Saydkasymov said the CIS has not exhausted its opportunities  yet and a Eurasian Union would mean a return to the past.  "Uzbekistan links its future with the sovereignty obtained by  the Republic," he said.    Kazakhstan's Ambassador to Uzbekistan Nazhameden Iskaliyev  told INTERFAX that "every state has the right to express its  opinion on issues in which it has an interest." Iskaliyev  believes that the idea of an Eurasian Union would be discussed  at the September summit of the heads of CIS states.    "Of course, certain corrections will be introduced into the  document, nevertheless it should be treated with great  attention," Iskalilyev said.</p>

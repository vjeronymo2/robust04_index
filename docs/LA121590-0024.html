			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKING SIDES OVER ABORTION AND TBS  </P> <P> Bravo! I salute Howard Rosenberg's column in speaking up for equal time for the  other side of a controversy that is dividing the nation. I am myself pro-choice  on the abortion issue, but as someone concerned with media and with the future  of civilized dialogue in this country I feel the defense of balance and of  respect for difference is vital for our democratic future.  </P> <P> In the past, I have felt that he has only spoken up for balance when he felt  that points of view on the liberal-left side of the divide did not get an  airing. This column would seem to indicate that I did him an injustice. Please  take this as my apology.  </P> <P> DAVID HOROWITZ, Chairman, Committee on Media Integrity, Los Angeles  </P></p>

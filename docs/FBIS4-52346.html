			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata commented on future  Diet steering on 8 May, saying: "When I think of the situation  Japan is in, I feel that we have to approve the budget as soon  as possible. We need not only reforms, but also cooperation with  other parties." It seems that his remark indicates that Hata  decided he has no choice but to seek cooperation with the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ] over the issue of the draft for redrawing  single-seat electoral districts for the House of Representatives  and other issues to approve the fiscal 1994 budget, which is the  most urgent task.    On his responsibility as a person who appointed former  justice minister, the prime minister stated: "By doing some  soul-searching regarding the past history, Japan will candidly  apologize for what it did and teach next generations. We will  show our resolve by exerting efforts to prevent tragedies like  war."</p>

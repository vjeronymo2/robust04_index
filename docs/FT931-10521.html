			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (16): More smiles than scowls - Business guide MANY first-time visitors to Iran are surprised. They arrive conditioned by the particular type of publicity Iran has received over the past 15 years and instead discover rather more smiles than scowls. It has not always been like that and first impressions have been much improved by the streamlined procedures at Tehran's Mehrabad airport. Instead of the long waits, aggressive baggage searches and minute examination of currency declarations, it should now be possible to get through the airport at an internationally acceptable pace. There are now no currency restrictions, arriving or leaving, and quite often no baggage check. On no account attempt to take alcohol into the country or publications with immodest photographs of women. Video tapes may be confiscated. HOTELS The two most popular in Tehran are the Laleh (formerly the Intercontinental) and the Esteghlal (formerly the Hilton). Both have seen better days, but the Esteghlal has benefitted from restoration work. The Laleh is downtown and can be more convenient for government ministries and embassies. The Esteghlal enjoys the cleaner, cooler air of north Tehran and has superb views over the mountains. But the drive into town can test the nerves of the most hardened taxi passenger. At night it is not uncommon to find cars without lights driving at more than 70 mph on the expressway. Tehran hotels tend, fairly, not to boast about their cuisine, but it is modestly priced. Caviar, when available, is particularly good value. International phone calls suffer only slight delays and fax facilities are available. Hotels usually ask for the room rate to be paid in dollars but accept rials for all other spending. Other hotels: Azadi Grand (formerly the Hyatt) and the Homa (formerly Sheraton) CURRENCY Credit and charge cards are not accepted in Iran. Take cash. The dollar, sterling and the D-Mark are the most easily traded. It is faster - and often slightly more profitable - to go to a money changer rather than a bank. Be prepared to be given large quantities of low-denomination notes. TRANSPORT Local representatives often provide a car and driver for visitors. Otherwise, the car services operating from the main hotels have English-speaking drivers, reasonably modern vehicles and charge by the hour or by the day. There is a good private hire company directly opposite the Laleh. In view of the traffic problems of Tehran, it is vital to employ experienced drivers who have a good knowledge of the city. A willingness to reverse at speed the wrong way down one-way streets is a time-saving asset. Iran Air runs frequent services between the biggest cities. Seats can be difficult to acquire without booking well in advance. VISAS For a first-time visitor, the simplest method is to join a trade mission or attend the annual international trade fair. Once contacts have been made with local companies, it is then possible to be invited, the normal procedure for getting a visa. It has be approved by the Foreign Ministry in Tehran. Allow several weeks and be sure to find out the approval number in order to assist the local consulate which will actually be issuing the visa. It is often possible to get visa extensions once in Iran. EMBASSIES Most western countries have embassies in Tehran. British representation has been strengthened but there is still no ambassador because of the Salman Rushdie affair. Commercial sections can offer guidance on changes in local regulations and on key personnel in government departments. LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES Finding the right local representative can be the key to success in Iran. Accurate, up-to-date information and guidance through the local bureaucracy is at a premium. Embassies can help in providing contacts, as can the local chamber of commerce and in London, the Department of Trade and Industry. DRESS Many visiting businessmen choose to wear suits and ties, although it is not necessary, especially when dealing with the government. Arms should be covered in public. Women must be fully covered, with a scarf over the hair. Cosmetics can be used discreetly. Iranian women constantly seek to push back the frontiers of the dress code. Limits of official toleration are subject to sudden change. SOCIAL ATTITUDES Men must never offer to shake hands with a woman in public. In people's homes, especially in affluent north Tehran, pre-revolutionary attitudes prevail. Alcohol is more prevalent than might be expected, but it is unwise for the visitor to appear to be under its influence. Criticism of the regime is often heard but best not repeated. Iranians remain strongly nationalistic. Help with visas is often sought. SHOPPING The ban on carpet exports has been lifted and individuals can now take out of the country one carpet and one kilim. Best to seek local advice and bargain hard. Caviar is best bought at the airport on departure. Beluga and sevruga are usually available at about one-seventh of the London retail price. Payment has to be made in rials but there is a bank near the caviar shop. Saffron is also an excellent buy. GUIDES TO IRAN One of the best, quick guides is Doing Business with Iran written by Pauline Jackson and published by the Committee for Middle East Trade, 33, Bury Street, London SW1Y 6AX. This also contains sections on contracts, tendering, bidding, contract negotiations, taxes and social security. Business International has also published three other manuals on Iran by Pauline Jackson: Iran: a Practical Handbook, Iran after Khomeini and in 1991 Iran - A Manual for Foreign Business.</p>

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace There could scarcely be a better measure of the extreme suspicion with which the market views British Aerospace than yesterday's further 5 per cent fall in its shares. The immediate reason was suggestions that the European Commission would again try to force the company to repay the Pounds 44m of sweeteners attached to its purchase of Rover from the UK government in 1988. Having failed once, it is by no means certain that the Commission would succeed this time. Even if it did, the impact on BAe's gearing would be trivial, given shareholders' funds of Pounds 2.7bn. Doubtless the fall in the shares to a level less than half last year's rights issue price owes much to deep uncertainty about what action BAe will take to stem the losses in its regional aircraft division. The company, of course, can say nothing ahead of its interim statement in September. But here, too, the market may be erring on the side of pessimism, with regard both to the size of the provision resulting from the worst case of outright closure and to the impact on cash flow. At its current level, the price is discounting a savage cut in the dividend at the very least. Since the market is so determined to look on the bad side, there is no telling how it may react if new car sales in August turn out even more awful than expected. BAe has developed an unnerving tendency to lurch from one problem to another. That is why it is now so difficult for any remaining faithful to believe that rationalisation of the regional aircraft business could herald a robust earnings recovery next year. Just the same, it is worth pausing amid the gloom to recall that a dividend halved this year might with luck be covered four times next.</p>

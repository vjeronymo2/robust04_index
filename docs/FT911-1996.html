			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Amex group to focus on derivatives THE American Stock Exchange has formed a new capital markets group which will focus on introducing new equity derivative products to institutional investors, writes Our Financial Staff. The new group will be headed by Mr Benjamin Krause, who was formerly head of the exchange's new listings rules and policies. The group will work with issuers and underwriters to bring new investment vehicles to the market. In the past, Amex has launched derivatives including warrants based on the Nikkei Stock Average, CAC-40 index, and FT-SE 100 index. The exchange has also pioneered the development of contingent value rights, a variety of put option which guarantees holders a one-off cash payment if the issuing company's share price does not reach a specified level by a specified date.</p>

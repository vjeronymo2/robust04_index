Even if decisionmaking  is backed by evaluations, studies, and forecasts, unexpected  events are almost always detrimental to long-range decisions. In  the military area in particular, there are many examples showing  the difference between actual capability and the desirable  level. But despite that, forecasts, studies, and evaluations are  still of basic importance in reaching decisions affecting the  future.    In the Armed Forces, those functions are performed by  high-ranking officers with outstanding ability, and their  purpose is to point decisions by the higher commands in the  right direction. Known as general staff activities, they are an  efficient tool that commanders rely on in order to exercise  their command, even at the risk of being faced with unforeseen  and pressing events.    In the Brazilian Army more specifically, the general  advisory organization responsible to the minister for preparing  and guiding that institution in its use of the ground force is  the Army General Staff. Established on 24 October 1896 and  located at Army Headquarters in Brasilia, the Army General Staff  consists of a chief of staff, a deputy chief of staff, and six  assistant chiefs of staff who specialize in various military  matters. Its vast range of duties also includes responsibility  for cooperating with the Armed Forces General Staff (EMFA) in  studies aimed at establishing military doctrine, policy, and  strategies.    The current Army chief of staff is a four-star general:  Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel. A native of Piraju, Sao Paulo,  General Leonel has an extensive record of service to the  Army--his military career spans nearly 50 years--and he was  promoted to full general in July of last year. In the line of  hierarchical succession, the Army chief of staff takes charge of  the Ministry of Army if the actual minister is absent.    On the morning of last 17 August, Gen. Leonel received  the editors of TECNOLOGIA &amp; DEFESA, Francisco Ferro and Cosme  Degenar Drumond, in his office. On that occasion, he commented  to our magazine exclusively regarding important matters related  to current military affairs and enumerated the Brazilian Army's  priorities in terms of the country's financial capabilities.  Here are the principal excerpts from his remarks during that  interview.  <H5>  Simulation System </H5>   "With a view to increasing the efficiency of training while  also achieving cost-benefit gains, the Army has acquired a Small  Caliber Arms Effect Simulation System. That modern equipment,  which has been adopted by the armed forces of several countries,  will enable us to improve training standards in small units  (companies and platoons) by making the execution of dual-purpose  maneuvers possible. The equipment will be assigned to a  motorized infantry brigade. The company supplying the system  will provide a 12-day training period for officers from various  units."  <H5>  Electronic Warfare </H5>   "This is a priority for the Army because it is a factor for  modernization and increased operational effectiveness in the  service. The phases of this project include personnel training  and the introduction of high-performance tactical and strategic  systems in the field of communications and noncommunications,  the objective being to monitor the electromagnetic spectrum.  Personnel will be trained at the Electronic Warfare Training  Center, a unit that provides officers and NCO's--and, through a  cooperative effort, the Navy and Air Force--with specialized  training in that activity."  <H5>  Modernization of Equipment </H5>   "The modernization of equipment will be aimed not only at  meeting the demands of modern warfare, which require that we  have materiel more suited to existing operational environments,  but also and chiefly at saving money. With that in mind, the  limitations imposed by the current economic situation are being  taken into account. The current priorities in the modernization  effort are armored vehicles and field artillery equipment, but  we are not losing sight of the needs in other  areas--communications equipment, for example."  <H5>  Antitank Missile </H5>   "The MSS-1.2 antitank missile has been developed and is now  going through the final phases preceding industrial production.  This weapon is the result of cooperation between the Army and a  European firm. It is a missile of the latest generation with an  effective range of about 3.5 km and the ability to destroy the  most modern armor currently in existence. Production is expected  to begin in 1994, and at that point distribution to the infantry  battalions will begin."  <H5>  Osorio Main Battle Tank </H5>   "Several tests conducted in international competitions show  that the Osorio, manufactured by Engesa [Specialized Engineers,  Inc.], is a tank in the same class as the M1 Abrams (American),  the Challenger (British), and the Leopard II (German) and that  it is superior to the first-line tanks of other countries. The  Army worked with Engesa to develop this tank."  <H5>  Ballistic Protection Helmets </H5>   "Individual protection is essential for the soldier on the  battlefield, who is exposed to four kinds of threats: shrapnel,  projectiles, blast effects, and incendiary effects. As far as  helmets are concerned, it is necessary to obtain a more suitable  model that is more comfortable and affords increased ballistic  protection. Some countries have used a composite material made  of aramid and polymer resins. The Brazilian Army intends to  gradually replace the old steel-fiber helmets with a highly  functional light combat helmet providing ballistic protection.  It has an effective shape and can be used on various missions."  <H5>  New Suppliers </H5>   "The configuration of the world today is quite different  from  what it was five years ago. Until just recently, the Brazilian  Army looked for equipment in West Europe and the United States.  But today there are other potential suppliers: Russia, China,  Korea, and Taiwan, for example. Those countries have interesting  things to offer, and we are engaged in a process of developing  closer relations with them by observing and making certain  analyses. It is essential to pay attention to three principles:  the materiel itself, logistics, and technology transfer when  required."  <H5>  Foreign Materiel </H5>   "Before buying any materiel abroad, the Army needs to know  whether the supplying firm is 100-percent privately owned or a  state-owned firm and the kind of economic-financial policy its  country has. For example, when the Army deals with a foreign  firm, it needs to be certain that the government of that country  will support and guarantee the transaction, because we must seek  the best for Brazil."  <H5>  Antiaircraft Artillery </H5>   "The Secretariat of Science and Technology is continuing its  studies and projects aimed at the development of a Brazilian  surface-to-air missile. Portable infrared-guided missiles will  be acquired to expand our current defense capability. Plans also  call for acquiring a battery of laser-guided missiles  (optronic)."  <H5>  Field Artillery </H5>   "This involves several current programs: a) modernization of  the M-108's, including the replacement of engines and changes to  the vehicle transmission systems, to be completed in 1996; b)  modernization of the self-propelled 155mm howitzers and the  self-propelled 105mm's to increase their ranges by 32 km and 17  km respectively. This program is being carried out by a British  firm that will transfer the technology; c) the acquisition by  1996 of a large number of 105mm howitzers; d) studies and tests  on the use of 105mm ordnance in the Amazon Region; e) the  acquisition by 1996 of area saturation rocket systems; f) a  start on the incorporation of modern radar target seeking  equipment and sound ranging equipment as well as sight, laser,  and infrared ranging equipment; and g) the acquisition, now  under way, of photographing equipment and electronic fire  computing equipment."  <H5>  Coast Artillery </H5>   "Defending the coast and navigable inland waterways is an  Army concern. The General Staff is conducting studies for  ensuring suitable defense of the tactically important points  controlling access to the Amazon Region."  <H5>  Domestic Expertise </H5>   "This is fundamental for the Army. We are collecting  know-how  outside the country in the initial phase and then encouraging  our own firms to participate in technological development. I  believe that the same thing is also going to happen in  connection with Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System]. As  the program continues, the Army will enlist domestic industry.  When you talk about materiel for military use, domestic  industry, and the Armed Forces, that combination is a great  platform for giving development a boost, with applications in  many other areas. Technical know-how radiates out into the  civilian area. There is no doubt that the Armed Forces play an  important part in the country's development."  <H5>  Support for Industry </H5>   "A country's security does not depend solely on its Armed  Forces. It also involves the economic, psychosocial, and  political areas in addition to scientific and technological  development. The ability to design and manufacture materiel for  military use is very important for strengthening our defense  capability. The peace and progress that we all want for Brazil  depend upon the integration of Armed Forces and industry. One of  the efforts that the Army has been making in the area of  industrial integration is Sicatex (Army Cataloguing System). The  Army has a special affection for domestic firms which, besides  working with production, also engage in research and carry out  technological projects. Those firms deserve closer attention. In  all projects of interest to the Army, the participation of our  firms has been preserved. We cannot promise anything at the  moment because of budget difficulties, but as soon as things  improve, we will continue to support projects being carried out  by our firms."  <H5>  Military Service </H5>   "The Military Service System administers the Army's most  important resource: people. It should be pointed out that even  the Royal Charter dated 22 March 1776 ordered that everyone,  with no distinction as to class, should participate in the  defense of the territory. The current recruitment process has  served very well throughout this entire period and lived up to  Olavo Bilac's expectations regarding its role in promoting  patriotism. The essential thing is to decide what is best for  the country. We must decide that question ourselves without  importing any models, especially since 83 of the 143 countries  with organized armed forces have universal conscription, and our  solution must be the result of an analysis taking into account  geopolitical factors--size of the territory and  population--among other things. The Military Service Law and its  implementing regulations, based on Brazilian tradition and prior  legislation, are the consolidation of long-time practice in  dealing with the activities of military service."  <H5>  Army Aviation </H5>   "Our Army Air Force comprises two types of helicopters:  reconnaissance/attack helicopters and utility helicopters. There  are a total of 54 aircraft, and they are going to be joined by  another 18 reconnaissance/attack helicopters that we are in the  process of receiving. To meet its requirements for logistic  support and pilot training, the Army is looking into the  acquisition of freight helicopters and training helicopters."  <H5>  Adoption of GPS </H5>   "The adoption of portable equipment for determining one's  position by the use of satellites leads to greater speed and  accuracy in all combat missions. In order to conduct military  operations in the field, it is essential for the fighter to know  the exact location of his forces and of the enemy. The use of  GPS [Global Positioning System] and other similar equipment  greatly facilitates missions for all combat echelons and makes  greater operational performance possible. The importance of that  kind of equipment is very great in areas with difficult terrain,  where there is dense plant cover and few reference points, the  Amazon Region being one example."  <H5>  New Caliber </H5>   "Several foreign armies have been adopting 5.56mm caliber  personal weapons to replace the traditional 7.6.2mm. Besides  helping to reduce weight and volume, the new caliber enables a  fighter to carry more ammunition for the same weapon. Ballistic  studies show that the 5.56mm weapon meets the requirements for  range, penetration, and shock power. Some units of the Brazilian  Army are already testing the FAL 5.56mm, produced by Imbel [War  Materiel Industry], and preparing to use it."  <H5>  Computerization </H5>   "The current state of computerization in the Army is  characterized by a growing concern with the training and  technical expertise of personnel and efforts to assimilate the  culture of information processing; the search for a level of  standardization that can improve productivity, quality, and the  interaction between systems; awareness of the need to turn the  user of information processing into the subject of the process  by encouraging his active participation in the same; and the  planning and implementation--now under way--of integrated  systems for dealing with personnel and equipment and, later,  economy and finance. Those systems will make it possible to  develop other systems which are no less important than the  former but which are dependent upon them."  <H5>  Brazilian Amazon Region </H5>   "It is unquestionably an area of great strategic importance.  The chief element in the vivification and development of that  vast area--a slow process until recently--has been the  pioneering work of the Armed Forces. The Federal Government laid  the groundwork for the Calha Norte Project in 1985, and the  actual work, which started in 1986, was to be carried out  jointly by several government agencies. The project covers the  region located north of the Solimoes and Amazon Rivers. Because  it was already organized in the area, the Army quickly began  working on the project."  <H5>  Reserve Training Centers </H5>   "The Ministry of Army establishes reserve training centers  at  the request of the municipal governments, which address those  requests to the commanders of the military regions. The centers  are primarily the result of a municipal community effort. The  Ministries of Army and Social Welfare have set up an  interministerial coordinating committee for actions resulting  from a protocol of intention covering the establishment of TG  [reserve training center] programs in areas that lack them. Work  to establish a pilot project (six TG's) is scheduled to begin in  1994. Those installations will also be used for activities of a  social nature under the coordination of community centers."  <H5>  Finances </H5>   "As far as the Army is concerned, the current fiscal year  has  meant an unprecedented exercise in adaptations and adjustments.  Since the 1993 budget could not be approved until the end of  April and actually implemented until June 1993, the ground force  got through the first five months of the year with equivalent  funds and only 12 percent of the amount it expected to have for  operations and investment. The Army has an interest in getting  its budget ceilings increased in 1994, because otherwise its  operational capability will suffer."</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Sport: When the irons are in the fire - Golf SAM Torrance, the roguish Scot, was trying to explain to David Feherty, the irreverent Irishman, the special tensions attached to playing in a Ryder Cup match. 'It's like having a baby,' said Torrance finally. 'Until you've become a father, you don't know what it's like. You can read all the books, take all the advice anyone wants to give you but you have to experience it for yourself to know what it's really like.' Later this month, at the Belfry, Torrance will be experiencing the thrill - and the fear - for the seventh consecutive time while Feherty will be biting his nails on the sidelines. He coped well on his debut at Kiawah Island two years ago (beating Payne Stewart, the US Open champion, in the singles) but failed to make the team this year. Torrance has won numerous individual titles, including three this season, but he said nothing matched striding up the 18th fairway at the Belfry in 1985 knowing it was in his hands to win the Ryder Cup. 'In a tournament, you're only letting yourself down if you blow it. That's the big difference, having other people relying on you. It's very special.' That was demonstrated for the whole world at Kiawah last time, when Bernhard Langer had a putt of a few feet to beat Hale Irwin and retain the Cup. Langer missed and the agony or the ecstasy was written on every face. The emotions might have been similar if Langer had had that putt to win the Masters or the Open Championship but they would not have been felt so universally or so intensely. Feherty called it the 'high temple of stress' and Irwin, three times US Open champion and a man who thought he was used to tense situations, admitted he could barely breathe as he played the last hole, so crushing was the pressure. Tom Watson, captain of the US side this year, was not at Kiawah but said, 'Just watching it on television was worse than the pressure of winning an Open.' And Watson won the Open five times and the US Open once. Everyone sympathised with Langer, specially Irwin, who had suffered with him in the cauldron, and admitted, 'There is no way that I would ever wish what happened on the last hole to happen to anyone.' It was the sort of thing that might have ruined a career but Langer proved that he is blessed with an iron will and an admirable sense of perspective when he won the German Masters the following week. Bernard Gallacher, Europe's captain then and now, was full of admiration. 'Extraordinary,' he said. 'Such maturity. Such resilience. I might ask Bernhard to play last again,' he added, 'and I think he'd accept the position.' There is no doubt that Langer would. Earlier this year, he was asked if he would be happy to face a similar putt, in a similar situation, at the Belfry. 'Yes,' was his answer, given without an instant's hesitation. Fred Couples, the former US Masters champion, asked the same question, also said, 'Yes,' but only after a long pause and without anything like Langer's conviction. Yet he could only imagine how hard it would be. Langer knew. Watson, who has played on four Ryder Cup teams, has no doubts that the competition is 'a top ticket event, a major if you like.' He reiterated his view that it is, in some respects, more major than the majors. 'There is no question that the pressure of playing in the Ryder Cup is greater than that you experience in a major championship. You are testing the human bottle, the human spirit, the human capability to its utmost.' Winning the Cup is relatively straightforward: you just collect more points than the other lot (although in the Americans' case, a tie would allow them to retain the trophy). All the passion, all the effort, all the blood, sweat and tears boil down to a simple set of figures, figures that will be there for ever, indicating no more than who won and who lost, taking no account of how close things were or how the luck ran. That is another thing that makes the Ryder Cup so tough and so special. It is all or nothing. There is no place to hide. Harry Vardon, who won the Open Championship six times, once said: 'For this game you need, above all things, to be in a tranquil frame of mind.' Vardon, however, never played in a Ryder Cup.</p>

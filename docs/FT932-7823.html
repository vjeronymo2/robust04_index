			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Observer: Testing time If you are interested in how honest business types can slip off the rails, don't forget to watch It's a Steal on BBC2 tomorrow night. In the last of the current Hypotheticals series, Professor Arthur Miller of Harvard Law School does a first rate job cross-examining a group of leading British businessmen employed by an imaginary company. Out of a cast list which includes Sir John Quinton, Lord Spens and Sir Nicholas Goodison, it is less well-known types such as Kingfisher's Nigel Whittaker, Michael East of Eastcastle Management, personal assistant Fiona Alfred, and Roger Pincham of Gerrard Vivian Gray, who turn in the best performances. However, the real star of the show is G Ware Travelstead, the US property developer. Watch him and it's easy to see why he is about the only person to have made money out of Canary Wharf.</p>

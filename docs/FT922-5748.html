			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Pepsico in Belarus bottle joint venture PRODUCTION OF Pepsi bottles will start later this year in the republic of Belarus under a joint venture officially announced in Moscow yesterday. The venture, named Belpak, is between Pepsico International and Eastman Chemical Company, both of the US, and Khimvolokno chemical company and MPOST synthetic textile enterprise, both of Mogilev, Belarus. The venture will make plastic bottles for soft drinks and is expected to produce Dollars 100m (Pounds 56.4m) of investment over the next five years from hard-currency earnings. The initial investment, which was said to be 'modest', was not disclosed. From the autumn, Belpak will produce polyethylene terphthalate resin (PET), a clear recyclable plastic used in making drinks bottles. Half the production will be used for Pepsi bottles in the former Soviet Union, while the rest will be exported to west and east Europe for hard currency. The hard currency profits will be split equally between the two US partners and the two Belarus enterprises. Production of the PET resin is expected to grow to 25,000 metric tonnes annually, equivalent to 500m 2-litre bottles a year. Pepsico, the leading soft drinks maker in the former Soviet Union, has a history of innovative agreements since opening its first facility there in 1974. It trades its soft drink for exports of Stolichnaya vodka and, in the past two years, commercial ships built in the Ukraine. Mr Donald Kendall, Pepsico's former chairman, said: 'There is no question that US and other western companies should come into this market now. People who wait for political stability or better convertibility of the rouble will lose out to others.'</p>

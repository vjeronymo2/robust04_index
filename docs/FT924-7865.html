			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (3): A painful period - Banking and financial markets THE Japanese banker looked at me sheepishly. 'You know,' he said hesitantly, 'this is not a very good time to be writing about us.' Indeed, this is a painful period for Japanese bankers and securities companies in Europe. The high-flying 1980s, when easy money enabled them to grab big shares in the Euromarkets and launch bold forays into some European domestic financial markets, are over. The collapse of the Japanese stock market has stripped the brokers of their most important profit stream and undermined the capital bases of most large banks. The slump in the Japanese economy has forced most industrial companies to slash their capital spending budgets and, consequently, to cancel the Eurobond issues that many used to finance them. As a result of all these factors, both banks and securities companies have been forced to tone down their activity in Europe. This can be seen in the slide of the Japanese banks and brokers from the Euromarket league tables and the retreat of the Japanese banks from the interbank market. In London, for example, they account for only 30 per cent of the interbank market now, compared with 38 per cent at the peak three years ago. 'We all have to be more conservative in building assets,' says Mr Tomonori Naruse, senior managing director for Europe of Bank of Tokyo in London. There is, of course, nothing that Japanese organisations hate more than slowing down or admitting defeat. Until recently, they clung to the status quo, insisting that they had made long term commitments and hoping desperately that market conditions would improve. But by the middle of this year, it became clear that, with continuing weak conditions at home, there was no alternative but to cut back abroad - 'it is still not as drastic a retreat as that of some US companies,' Mr Seiichi Takeda, senior vice-president of Nomura Europe in London, says. Last month, Nomura in London announced that it would retreat from market making in London of all European equities and several UK ones, causing some 50 redundancies from its 600 staff. That was the first big cutback in London but others had already taken place in Zurich where Japanese banks and brokers have had an extraordinarily high profile. Until recently, there were no fewer than 42 Japanese financial institutions registered in Switzerland, reflecting the high volume of Eurobond issues that used to be done for Japanese companies on the Swiss franc market. Last month, Chuo Trust and Banking, the trust bank, announced that it had closed its Zurich subsidiary in response to poor trading conditions, and would concentrate its European activities in London and Brussels. Chuo was the third Japanese financial company to shut its Zurich office this year, the others being Ryoko Securities and Yamatane Securities. Japanese bankers in the city say none of their number are making profits at the moment, so a few more could follow in the next few months. Nomura's Swiss subsidiary announced two weeks ago that it was closing its Basle branch. All of this is happening when there is, at least in theory, a rationale for financial institutions rationalising their operations in Europe. Next year, with the creation of the single market in the 12 EC countries and its extension to the seven countries in the European Free Trade Association, any financial institution that has a licence in one of the 19 should be allowed to operate in all the others. Chuo Trust, for example, expects to be able to continue to operate in the Swiss capital markets from its Brussels office. In fact, however, complete harmonisation is probably still a long way away. France and Germany, for example, still do not allow financial institutions domiciled in other countries to be in the primary dealer group for securities issues, and they are showing no signs of being willing to change that stance. And while there is at least an EC banking directive that provides the framework for pan-European banking, the investment services directive that would do the same for securities and fund management is not expected to surface until the end of next year. As a result, Switzerland last month said that it too would continue to insist after January 1 that lead managers of Swiss franc issues have a domicile in Switzerland. Thus, it looks as if there could be a rather brutal shakeout in the next few months, with the weaker Japanese institutions realising they have no future in Europe, while the strongest doggedly maintain their offices throughout Europe and, in a few cases, may even expand. Nomura's Mr Takeda, for example, makes clear that the group's policy remains to have an independent presence in each of the leading European countries - 'there are still a lot of peculiarities in individual country markets, so penetration of the European market really means penetration into each country,' he says. Another problem is that as long as taxation systems are not harmonised, it will continue to be difficult to transfer capital and profits easily among European units. Among leading Japanese banks, the accent is on rationalisation and on developing off balance sheet business after being wounded by bad loans to some of the spectacular bankruptcies in Europe. Japanese bankers say that branches in some less important cities could be reduced to representative offices. One ray of light is that the Japanese ministry of finance is likely from next year to allow them to lead manage Eurobond issues for Japanese companies. But it is a thin ray because it merely means that there will be more competition for the reduced amount of business around. Bank of Tokyo is, ironically, an exception in still thinking of expansion, this year having upgraded its representative office in Vienna to a branch and opened an office in Moscow.</p>

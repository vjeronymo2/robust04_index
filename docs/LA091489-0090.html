			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MY DAD' NOT UP TO PAST 'SPECIALS'  </P> <P> ABC's "Afterschool Specials" tackle some heavy issues. Past episodes of the  Emmy-winning dramatic series for children haven't flinched from date rape,  racism, alcoholism, drug abuse and adult illiteracy.  </P> <P> Often, the series respects viewers' intelligence enough to pose hard questions  and avoid easy answers.  </P> <P> So what happened to today's by-the-numbers, under-wrought season opener?  </P> <P> In "My Dad Can't Be Crazy . . . Can He?," at 3 p.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and  42, the issue is schizophrenia and its effect on a family when the illness is  denied and untreated.  </P> <P> Written and directed by Joanna Lee, and based on the works of children's  novelist Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, the film centers around high school sophomore  Nick (Wil Wheaton of "Star Trek: The Next Generation"). Nick quickly makes good  friends in the town to which his family has just relocated. He's  super-wholesome and well-adjusted.  </P> <P> This is surprising because at home Nick's unemployed father (Don Murray) has  paranoid fantasies that Mom (Loretta Swit) ignores; the move to a new apartment  is just one of many the family has been forced to make because of Dad. It's not  clear how they manage financially; Mom just gives piano lessons.  </P> <P> Problems with believability extend to the cast. Swit isn't convincing as she  pretends familial normality while Dad accuses his son of being a spy for  "them"; she's too strong a presence. Murray is allowed no subtlety and thus  elicits no sympathy. Through it all, Wheaton displays a remarkably unfurrowed  brow.  </P> <P> Schizophrenia is a common but misunderstood mental illness that affects an  estimated one in 100 Americans. It often goes untreated, and financial and  support resources are limited. That's the message here, but there's not enough  depth to give it real impact.  </P></p>

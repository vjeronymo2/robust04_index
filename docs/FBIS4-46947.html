			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Chernakov under the rubric "Timber": </F> "Need and Insects Compelled Americans To Turn to Russia"]    [Text] "And I whacked him for all I was worth so that my  arm went limp--here is one for you for Vietnam, for Hiroshima,  and for that beetle of theirs!..." (From a Russian song)    For the first time Russian loggers will be able to break  into  the American market, which has so far been geared toward its own  resources and deliveries from neighboring Canada. For the first  time Russian timber-processing enterprises and pulp-and-paper  combines will be able to obtain up-to-date technologies and  equipment from a credit line guaranteed by the U.S. Government.  Finally, for the first time in Russian-American relations it has  become possible to seriously discuss a project of such  significance at the highest level. The document whose signing  means the implementation of all these "first times" in practice  is called the Agreement on Cooperation in the Area of  Modernizing the Timber Industry Complex of Russia. It is planned  to review the draft agreement in June among other documents at a  regular meeting of the intergovernmental commission for issues  of Russian-American scientific-technical and economic  cooperation (the "Chernomyrdin-Gore Commission").    The Russian logging company Roslesprom is currently awaiting  the remarks and comments of the U.S. Department of Commerce  concerning the draft agreement on the reconstruction and  upgrading of the pulp-and-paper and timber-processing industry  of Russia and the delivery of Russian products to the American  market. Upon coordination, it is planned that the draft  agreement will be reviewed within a general package of documents  submitted for the June meeting of the "Chernomyrdin-Gore  Commission."    As a KOMMERSANT correspondent has managed to learn, a credit  line guaranteed by the U.S. Government and the participation of  American companies producing equipment for the pulp-and-paper  and timber-processing industry in modernizing a number of key  Russian enterprises in the industry will be the main aspects of  the agreement for the Russian side. (As chief specialist of  Roslesprom Aleksandr Lagutenkov told a KOMMERSANT correspondent,  the depreciation of fixed assets at a number of combines and  associations has now reached 60-70 percent.)    The Russians will pay back the credit with finished  products.  Domestic loggers will thus be given an opportunity for the first  time to enter the U.S. market, which has so far been geared  mainly toward its own resources and deliveries from Canada.    Judging by unofficial information from Roslesprom, the  Americans are mainly interested in pulp-and-paper production  facilities. At present Roslesprom is working on a list of  enterprises which, in the opinion of the Russian side, may  attract American partners. These are primarily combines  outfitted with new equipment which are capable of substantially  increasing the output of exportable products. According to  information which KOMMERSANT has succeeded in obtaining at  Roslesprom, this list will certainly include the joint-stock  company Arkhangelsk Pulp-and-Paper Combine, Svyatogorsk  (Leningrad Oblast), Solikamskbumprom (Perm Oblast), and the  Tsepruss Joint Venture (the former Kaliningrad Pulp-and-Paper  Plant).    Strange as it may be, the project was initiated by the  Americans themselves rather than the Russian loggers, who are  smothered by domestic problems and depressed by a slump in the  world market. As a KOMMERSANT correspondent was told at  Roslesprom, two main reasons compelled American consumers to  establish contacts with Russia. The appearance in 1993 of a  certain beetle in the Canadian forests which turns quality  timber into dust was the first reason. American consumers have  tightened the quality requirements for products delivered from  the north, and Canadians had to treat the forest intensively in  order to destroy the beetle. So far, the insecticidal campaign  has not been particularly successful. Meanwhile, the scope of  activities of the malevolent insect has become so extensive that  the United States, where about 300 kilograms of paper products  per capita are produced annually, had to turn its sights toward  Russia, where as little as 28 kilograms of such products are  produced.    The "Greens" movement, under pressure from which draft laws  sharply restricting the cutting of forests have been recently  passed in both North American states, is the second cause which  prompted the Americans to offer cooperation to Russia. It is  notable that Vice President Albert Gore is one of the champions  of this strategic policy in the United States; in June he will  meet with Prime Minister of Russia Viktor Chernomyrdin in order  to discuss, among others, issues of delivering the products of  Russian loggers to the United States.</p>

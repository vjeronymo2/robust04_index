According to this official, property rights of state-owned  enterprises being transferred to overseas financial groups must  first go through strict examination; the liabilities of the  former state-owned enterprise would be taken up by the  enterprise that becomes a joint-venture. On this point, the  state was planning to adopt a series of preferential polices  including preferential treatment in the charge for transfer of  land use right.    The sources of the "state-owned enterprises reinvigorating  fund" would be mainly the original bank subsidy loans,  proceedings from disposal of property, and international aid;  this fund would be used in purchases between enterprises from  now on.    Besides this, the state would establish and promote a  "bankruptcy warning system," which would be used to standardize  a bank mortgage insurance system; it was stipulated that from  now on administrative organizations were not allowed to be  guarantors of enterprise loans, and the guarantee between  enterprises must be based on the principle of voluntariness,  joint products, and multiple association in responsibility; this  system should stipulate a certain index for the liability rate  of an enterprise for it to go bankrupt.    This State Economic and Trade Commission official disclosed  that the state was considering revising the "Law on Bankruptcy"  and formulating a series of new decrees that comply with the  modern enterprise system.</p>

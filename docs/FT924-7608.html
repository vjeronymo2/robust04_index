			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Yeltsin and industry leaders cement alliance RUSSIA'S industrialists cemented a new alliance with President Boris Yeltsin at the weekend when they promised to support his market reform strategy in return for an agreement by the government to compromise on its policies. After attending a congress of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs on Saturday, the president said he had previously underestimated directors of state-owned plants as a source of support. The industrialists' main lobby group in turn issued a statement supporting 'the president's reform course' but demanding changes to avert 'deindustrialisation', to provide decent living conditions for all, and to avoid mass unemployment. However, Mr Yeltsin, who two years ago likened a fatal compromise on the radical 500-Day Programme to 'mating a hedgehog with a snake', insisted there were certain compromises he would not make. He told the industrialists that Rbs1 trillion in fresh credits promised last week by Mr Viktor Geraschenko, central bank chairman, would not be forthcoming because they would trigger hyperinflation. He also ruled out any attempt to restore price controls or the old system of state orders under which the government supplies enterprises with the inputs they need to carry out state procurement. Both the latter are included in a programme presented by Civic Union, the opposition umbrella group of which the industrialist lobby is a key component. A compromise between the two sides is already being negotiated behind the scenes, and to a certain extent, achieved in everyday life with constant concessions by the government, which has all but given up its commitment to Polish-style shock therapy. Before the industrialists even met, Mr Yegor Gaidar, acting prime minister, asked Mr Anatoly Chubais, his deputy responsible for privatisation, to set up a task force with Mr Arkady Volsky, leader of the industrialists and a key Civic Union figure. Its job will be to merge an alternative Civic Union programme with the government's latest anti-crisis plan. The gathering, in a Moscow bearings factory, simply rubber-stamped the compromising ahead of a critical session of the Russian super-parliament which will try to strip Mr Yeltsin of his emergency powers and his right to appoint the government when it meets on December 1. 'This congress was only a small part in a great political game,' said one of Mr Volsky's colleagues. Meanwhile, General Pavel Grachev, defence minister, denied the government had been contemplating imposing emergency rule. He said that emergency powers were needed to impose order in crisis spots such as North Ossetia and the former Chechen-Ingushetia, where up to 300 people have been killed in fighting over land between local ethnic groups. Russia and the breakaway southern region of Chechnya have agreed to pull their troops back from a disputed frontier today, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>

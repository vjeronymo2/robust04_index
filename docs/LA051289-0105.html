			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Buzz Spector spent most of his childhood holed up in libraries and developed an  intense love affair with books. He loves their feel, their smell and the great  flood of ideas they contain. Not surprisingly his highly intelligent art pivots  on this devotion. This exhibit takes his usual operation of ripping, stacking  and altering books one step further to delve more deeply into the mental and  physical enchantment of his medium. One of the show's most poignant images is  the encaustic-covered, blank-page grid "Mensem" with its single splash of red  paint down the center that makes the white pages reel with the feminine  principle of life.  </P> <P> But Spector has stepped out of his bookish metaphors for two of the strongest  pieces in the show. Although the reference is still to bound volumes and the  power of written ideas the materials are pure symbol. "Butter-Rose" is a long  grocery freezer stocked with a bed of long-stemmed roses that have been dotted  with great scoops of butter. Like any book, the cryonic coffin tries to  preserve beauty, delicate flavors and aromas that become frozen, abstracted  principles in the process. "Hospitality" is a strange wall piece made of 11  white enamel bread pans that have been used to bake loaves of bulbous bread.  Disturbingly, the swollen bread resembles aborted fetuses, making an analogy  between waste and life. In the context of this show this raises associations  between human life and vital ideas that are trashed before they have the  opportunity to provide nourishment. Tough and uncompromising as these messages  are, Spector can still seem non-threatening, thanks to the visual poetry of his  materials and metaphors. (Roy Boyd, 1547 10th St., to June 1).

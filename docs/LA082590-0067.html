			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BROWN AGAIN PUSHES EARLY PRIMARY BILL  </P> <P> Democratic state Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr. said Friday the importance of a  bill making California one of the earliest presidential primary states  outweighs "speculative" fears of some fellow Democrats in the Legislature.  </P> <P> The former governor, who twice ran unsuccessfully for the White House, said the  early primary bill would give Californians "a voice that they haven't had for  50 years in presidential politics."  </P> <P> In an interview, Brown repeated his strong support for advancing the  presidential primary from June to early March even as restive fellow Democrats  in the Senate and Assembly were voicing fears about disturbing the status quo.  </P> <P> Many Democrats and Republicans alike worry that a third election -- in addition  to the regular primary and the general election -- in presidential primary  years would invite more citizen-initiated ballot propositions. Legislators  caution that this could tilt political balances in favor of one party or  another depending on the popular drawing power of a particular initiative.  </P> <P> But Brown told The Times: "The value of putting California back in the  presidential nominating process outweighs any speculative consequences about  how certain initiative campaigns are conducted.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen any evidence that shows either liberals or conservatives are  advantaged by having an initiative voted on in March, June or November.  "Initiatives take on a life of their own whenever they are placed before the  voters."  </P> <P> But Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), a begrudging  proponent of the early primary and seldom a Brown cheerleader, later dismissed  the Democratic chairman's enthusiasm for the bill as self-serving.  </P> <P> "He wants to be a player in the national elections," Roberti said.  "Consequently, his interest in its impact on government and politics is  secondary."  </P> <P> Supporters of the long-stalled but newly revived early primary plan by  Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) insist that it would give California renewed  political clout befitting the nation's most populous state in the selection of  party presidential nominees.  </P> <P> As one of the last major states to hold a late presidential primary, California  has been virtually left out of deciding who the nominees will be in recent  elections.  </P> <P> Legislation that would move the California presidential primary in 1992 to  early March -- right behind the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary --  is expected to be voted on by the Legislature next week. Primaries for  statewide, legislative and congressional elections still would be held in June.  </P> <P> Fueling Senate Democratic anxiety over advancing the primary is Sen. Bill  Lockyer (D-San Leandro), a foe of the early primary.  </P> <P> He has warned colleagues that Republicans may try a March, 1992, referendum to  undo any congressional and legislative reapportionment plans written by  Democrats in 1991. In drawing new political boundaries, the party in power  historically tries to perpetuate its dominance into the next decade.  </P></p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Interim reduced by Garton Engineering In view of reduced half-time profits, the length of the recession and lack of positive signs of improvement, Garton Engineering is cutting its interim dividend from 1.75p to 1p. In the period to June 30 turnover was Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 10.3m). But pre-tax profit fell from Pounds 161,000 to Pounds 37,000 after interest charges reduced from Pounds 110,000 to Pounds 16,000. Earnings per share came to 0.63p (2.78p). The result continued to recognise the consequential loss claim following the fire in December 1990.</p>

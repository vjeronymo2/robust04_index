			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (1): Pragmatism still prevails - The tasks facing the Slovenes are awesome. But there is little doubt that the benefits of their freedom and independence far outweigh the endless, and costly, compromises made under the previous federal communist system. Judy Dempsey reports on some of the difficulties AFTER centuries of living under the Hapsburgs, and decades under communist rule, Slovenia regained its independence on January 15 this year when it finally won recognition by the international community. Slovenia's struggle for independence, whether - at an earlier period of history - from Vienna, or from the Yugoslav federation, was not based on the politics of recalcitrance or rebelliousness - or driven by a fiery devotion to a nationalist cause. Before declaring independence last June following a republic-wide referendum, Slovenes, in their pragmatic way, had attempted to find a modus vivendi with the status quo in Belgrade, federal capital of the former Yugoslavia and the capital of Serbia. Pragmatism, flexibility and more than a tinge of stubbornness have long characterised this industrious and hard-working community, and have shaped the nation's relations with the more powerful neighbours it was obliged to live with in the Yugoslav federation. Even over the past two years, when efforts to save the federation from disintegration - it was by then already slipping deeper into political and economic crisis - had all but failed, the Slovenes attempted to salvage what remained of Yugoslavia by proposing a confederation of sovereign states. When these attempts were blocked by the republic of Serbia and the federal army, the Slovene government, elected in April 1990 in the republic's first free parliamentary elections for many decades, chose the road to independence. For the Slovenes, a small nation of 2m people, it was a matter of survival. Its trade with the other republics of Yugoslavia was being blocked by Serbia; its contributions to the federal budget were being squandered; its citizens' foreign exchange deposits were financing the federal defence establishment. The first days following the declaration of independence on June 25 will be indelibly marked on the consciousness of the republic. During that night, in the course of which young and old Slovenes celebrated their independence in the streets of the Slovene capital of Ljubljana, the Yugoslav federal army, or People's Army, crossed into Slovenia in an attempt to gain control over the republic's external borders. After several days fighting against a well-prepared Slovene defence force, a demoralised federal army retreated but turned its attention - and much greater fire power - on neighbouring Croatia, which had also just declared its independence. Slovenia has had a mere 10 weeks in which to feel secure in its independence, since recognition of its sovereignty was granted - by most countries but with the notable exception of the US - on January 15. Making a reality of that independence is an historic task. While Slovenia and the countries of eastern Europe share the same difficulties in making the transition to the market economy and political pluralism, it also has to establish its own institutions of independence from the Yugoslav federation. These include consolidating a new monetary system, stabilising control over its borders, establishing its own postal service, setting up its own banking system and communications network, and funding and training a diplomatic service. Independence also involves negotiating membership of international organisations such as the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, the European Community and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, as well as a host of other institutions through which independence can be strengthened. But while the tasks facing the Slovenes are awesome, there is little doubt that the benefits of freedom and independence far outweigh the endless, and costly, compromises made under the previous, communist federal system. Economically, Slovenia, has for the moment lost its market share in the former republics of Yugoslavia, which previously accounted for more than 30 per cent of exports and imports. Slovene economists believe, however, that economic relations with these republics will eventually be normalised. Foreign investors are already seeking access to markets in the former republics of Yugoslavia by setting up joint ventures in Slovenia. They see that the republic's small market can be compensated by using Slovenia as a stepping stone into the other republics, into eastern Europe, and into the Commonwealth of Independent States. But in order to attract foreign investment, the fragile six-party coalition government, which consists of Christian Democratic, Liberal, and Social Democratic parties, will have to prove it is competent and capable of drawing up legislation on privatisation, and foreign investment, and of restructuring the banking system. The government has been slow in drawing up legislation. One of the reasons is that the Slovene authorities agreed last July to suspend implementation of its independence declaration. This decision was part of the European-Community brokered Brioni peace accord which aimed at finding a solution to the federal army's attack on Slovenia. In return for a three-month moratorium on the implementation of Slovenia's independence, the federal army, within that three months, agreed to withdraw completely from the republic. The other reason for the slow pace of change is that the coalition government has inherited the former communist system of large cabinets. The present one, consisting of 27 ministries, is repeatedly criticised by economists and bankers for lacking co-ordination and a strategy for the economy. The former communist system has also slowed up decision-making. Legislation is often blocked, or watered down, as it passes through the three-chamber parliamentary system. This cumbersome system has almost paralysed the work of the government. Finally, the coalition government has little expertise and experience. It is led by Mr Lozje Peterle, the prime minister who is also leader of the Christian Democrats. His critics say he is more preoccupied with restoring what he terms the 'dignity' to politics, and restoring the power of traditional conservative forces in Slovene society, than opening up new enterprises and attracting foreign investors. The business community, foreign partners and the Slovene electorate are becoming impatient for change. The Bank of Slovenia, or central bank, which is implementing a tight monetary policy, wants the government to stem the growing impatience and disillusionment by breaking down monopolies, encouraging private enterprise and maintaining a freeze on wage increases. The central bank believes that the successful implementation of these policies would curb inflation, now running at more than 10 per cent a month, and stimulate growth. Industrial production, compared with last year, is this year expected to fall by 4 per cent to 15 per cent because of the war in neighbouring Croatia and the loss of markets in the former Yugoslavia. Unemployment is expected to rise by 2 per cent to 10 per cent. Few economists doubt the need for a speeding up of the economic reforms. At the same time, they - and ministers from across the political spectrum - argue that the process of transforming post-communist societies must take into account Slovenia's political culture and traditions. With the support of the agrarian community, the Christian Democrat movement is anxious to invoke and promote traditional values of the family and women, giving the Roman Catholic church more prominence in social and public life and encouraging women to have more children, rather than joining the labour force. These traditions are tempered by liberal and social democratic values which find wide support among the younger, urbanised population. But unlike many of its east European counterparts and neighbours of the former Yugoslavia, the Slovene government has not allowed the paraphernalia and symbols of nationalism to prevail over pragmatism. Instead, the work carried out by the central bank, the agency for privatisation and the enterprises, serves to reassure the international community and foreign investors that Slovenia is stable. But if that confidence and stability is to remain a permanent feature in this part of Europe, Slovenia will need access to experts, credit facilities and markets. They will secure Slovenia's place in the new Europe.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 31 (ATA) -- The president's press and  information office reports that, commenting on the latest  developments in the relations with Greece, President Berisha  stated that:    There has been no reason to suspend the meeting of the two  foreign ministers. Albania holds that not interruption but  continuation of the dialogue helps overcome the difficulties in  the Greek-Albanian relations and the lowering of tension. I  would like to stress that the detention of six Greek minority  people under charges which are already known took place several  weeks before we agreed on the meeting. No other arrests have  been made regarding the above process, but Albanian citizens of  Greek origin and Albanians have been interrogated as witnesses  according to penal procedure. This is a right of the Albanian  independent justice for which it has to ask permission from  nobody. The judicial process will be normal, open and  independent.    During this period Greece has blocked the EU assistance for  the balance of payments of Albania. With this act they aim not  only at discouraging the reforms but also to change the radical  European direction and orientation of Albania. On this  occasion, I would like to declare and confirm that neither this  blockade of the assistance for the balance of payments nor other  measures or decisions of Greece towards Albania will succeed to  divert Albania's European direction and its integration into  Europe. I am confident in the EU Commission and the European  Union member countries and governments that they have their own  positive independent opinion for the Albanian policy as a factor  for the stability in the region and for the efforts of Albania  to expand cooperation in the region according to the interests  of the EU. I also am aware that they will not accept to prevent  reforms in Albania, because this union, its member countries and  international institutions have been those that have encouraged  and supported Albania mostly. I agree with the call of Greece  to the EU member countries to deal with the problems created in  the Albanian-Greek relations. Albania is ready and open to  cooperate with them and also welcomes their contribution to the  re-establishment of the Albanian-Greek dialogue, unilaterally  interrupted by the Greek party.    Lastly, regarding the fuss of the Greek propaganda on the  lack of the rights of the Greek minority in Albania, I would  like to say once more that Albania is fully determined to create  a pattern of the treatment of minorities in the region and that  the Greek minority enjoys all the rights and freedoms envisaged  by the charter of Copenhagen. International institutions, the  CSCE, European parliament, the US congress know and have  reconfirmed several times these uncontested facts. On this  occasion I would like to tell Mr. Papandreuo that despite his  abusive statements, which is not the first time, and which have  been inspired by electoral interests or long-term goals,  Albania's policy towards the Greek minority will not change. It  is dictated by our determination to establish the rule of law  and the market economy in Albania. It cannot be dictated by  other tendencies to manipulate the minority. By offering  dialogue and insisting in it, Albania will never accept that the  questions of the minority be manipulated and put at the disposal  of nationalistic or electoral fevers.</p>

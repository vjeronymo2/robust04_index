Students, schools, and lenders are the parties most affected by the financial condition of guaranty agencies, and they should not be denied an opportunity to provide information in these proceedings. The Secretary does not believe that it is appropriate to limit the information that third parties may provide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.417(f)&blank;Adverse Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters requested that all third-party information be provided to the guaranty agency without a formal request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), not just adverse information considered by the deciding official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This matter was also discussed at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding, and the guaranty agency negotiators agreed that the agencies would usually already be aware of any favorable information that was submitted by third parties.

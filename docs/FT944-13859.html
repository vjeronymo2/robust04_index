			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / EU fails to limit animal journeys European agriculture ministers in Luxembourg were again locked in stalemate last night on the plan to limit journey times for animals being transported for slaughter. A compromise proposal from Germany, current EU president, to leave maximum journey times at the discretion of member states met widespread disagreement. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said the deadlock meant that 'millions of animals will continue to suffer long, unnecessary, stressful journeys'. The issue is extremely emotive with the British public, 56,000 of whom rang the RSPCA supporting its recent full-page newspaper advertisements calling for an eight-hour journey limit. Ferry companies have introduced bans or restrictions on transporting live animals to the Continent in response to a campaign by animal welfare groups. They will maintain their bans unless European-wide agreement is reached. Northern member states, which favour journey limits of between eight and 15 hours before animals are rested, remain at loggerheads with southern states, which prefer a 22-hour limit.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / US Health Reform: Political imperative to end costly hodge-podge - President Clinton formally launches his health crusade this week. A look at why change is so vital ON Wednesday President Bill Clinton will formally launch his healthcare reform proposal in an address to Congress. The best way for non-Americans to understand why reform has become a political imperative is to imagine what the health system in the UK, say, might look like if the National Health Service had not been created in the late 1940s. In the absence of an all-embracing public system, most large companies would have offered health insurance as a fringe benefit, along with corporate pension schemes. At some stage pressure of public opinion would have forced government to set up public schemes to cover particularly vulnerable groups  -such as the elderly and the poor - that companies could not be expected to cater for. The result would have been a hodge-podge. Some people would be in lavish private schemes financed entirely by employers. Some would qualify for public healthcare. Some - for example, employees of small companies that could not afford to set up corporate health schemes - would not have any insurance. Nearly everybody would face a great deal of insecurity: a job change, for example, might involve acceptance of a less generous insurance scheme; a bad illness might leave an employee uninsurable. In such a system it would be hard to control costs. If government attempted to reduce spending on public schemes, doctors and hospitals would probably respond by charging private patients more. In emergencies, uninsured patients would have to be treated and the bills would again be passed on in higher fees for privately insured patients. With employers paying for most people's insurance, patients and physicians would have little incentive to economise on treatments or new technology. This scenario describes what has occurred in recent decades in the US. The government set up two public schemes in the 1960s - Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor. But most people of working age still rely on voluntary employer-provided health insurance. Some 37m people (15 per cent of the population) are without insurance cover; most are employees of small companies (or their dependants), and some are poor people who do not qualify for Medicaid. The absence of an overall budget, such as that which the Treasury imposes on the NHS and the lack of incentives for individuals to ration demand for care, has permitted explosive growth of medical spending. Since 1960 per capita healthcare expenditure has grown at an average annual rate of 4.6 per cent in real terms. Spending has grown from 5 per cent of gross domestic product to 14 per cent, nearly double that in most European countries. Much of this has fallen directly on US employers who complain bitterly that their foreign competitors are not expected to shoulder comparable burdens. Business spending on healthcare rose from 3.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent of salaries between 1970 and 1990. Yet although the US spends far more than any other country on healthcare, the results are not particularly impressive. The US has pioneered many advanced treatments yet has one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the developed world. Life expectancy is lower than in many poorer countries. There is evidence that much unnecessary surgery occurs; for example, an abnormally high proportion of births are by caesarian section. The low apparent return on heavy investment in healthcare has many causes. The reliance on hundreds of private insurance companies, with different rules and procedures, has led to high administrative costs. Physicians have gravitated toward the most lucrative high-tech specialties, leaving primary and preventive care understaffed and starved of resources. The geographic distribution of care is very unequal, reflecting the low profitability of medical practice in inner cities and poor rural areas. In the 1980s Republican administrations failed to address the emerging crisis in US healthcare. But the soaring financial burden on employers prompted a revolution of sorts in the private sector. To control costs, large companies have increasingly insisted that employees join health maintenance organisations (HMOs) or other forms of 'managed care'. An HMO charges a flat annual fee and then guarantees to provide whatever care members need. Physicians in HMOs have a much stronger incentive to control costs than those who charge a separate fee for each item of service  -the usual practice in the US. The corporate drive to control costs has resulted in soaring membership of HMOs (and similar arrangements) - from 9.1m in 1980 to 41.4m last year, 16 per cent of the population. President Bill Clinton's reform will seek to build on the strengths of the US system while importing European-style budgetary controls. He will provide financial incentives to try to push a larger fraction of the population into HMOs or other forms of tightly managed care. He will seek to replace the current voluntary system of corporate-financed care with a legal requirement that employers pay at least 80 per cent of employees' healthcare costs. And he will try to impose caps on the growth of healthcare spending in the private as well as the public sector.</p>

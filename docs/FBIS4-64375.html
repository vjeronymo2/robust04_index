			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MA/BL/NB: "Greek-Albanian meeting in Zurich </F> -- Development and Content of Talks Still Uncertain"]    [Text] The meeting between the Greek and Albanian foreign  ministers is expected to take place. Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias arrived at Zurich-Kloten Airport from Athens  on Tuesday [3 May] morning. His Albanian counterpart Alfred  Serreqi had arrived in Zurich on Monday evening.    The holding of the talks and the issues to be discussed were  still uncertain on Tuesday morning. The Greek Embassy is  referring all requests for information to the Foreign Ministry  in Athens. The meeting was proposed two weeks ago in Greece  after a border incident triggered a political crisis.    On 13 April, three days after the fatal attack against a  border Albanian military camp by Greek nationalists, Albania  expelled four Greek diplomats from Tirana. Greece reacted by  evicting an Albanian diplomat. New skirmishes broke out over  the weekend between Greece and Albania on the occasion of the  Orthodox Easter celebrations.    Greece threatened to cancel the Zurich meeting. On Sunday,  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou hinted that the talks  might take place anyway. On Monday evening, around 1,000  Albanians demonstrated in front of the Greek Consulate. They  denounced the "aggressions against Albanians" and pleaded for a  return to peace in the Balkans.</p>

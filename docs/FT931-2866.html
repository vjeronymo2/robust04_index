			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Market Report London's May robusta COFFEE contract fell through support at Dollars 900 a tonne to close at Dollars 882, down Dollars 27. Traders said the market was now out of its trading range, and had a very bearish overtone. 'There are no good signs in the market except for some fresh longs in New York,' said one. Chicago WHEAT prices were sharply higher at midday on short covering by the funds. The USDA targeted several African and Baltic countries for the sale of 1.5m tonnes of EEP wheat, which must be registered before June 30. SOYABEANS jumped higher on stop-loss buying as the market shed some discontent regarding Russia's financial and political situation. New York raw SUGAR futures were modestly higher at midday after choppy morning trading that saw players unsure which side of the market they should be on. Analysts said that after this week's volatile trading, a further corrective fall to Friday's high of 10.67 cents a lb might be needed before the recent upswing could resume. Compiled from Reuters</p>

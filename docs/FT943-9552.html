			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Bonds: EIB raises CDollars 200m with 10-year issue The eurobond sector was revived yesterday by a flurry of new issues in a variety of currencies, but traders said activity was likely to remain subdued for the rest of the week amid the US Treasury's quarterly refinancing. The European Investment Bank took advantage of the recent buoyancy in the Canadian dollar sector to issue CDollars 200m of 10-year bonds. The bonds were targeted mainly at institutional investors keen on liquid, long-dated paper, said a syndicate official at lead manager Barclays de Zoete Wedd. He said that investor interest in the longer maturities had picked up in the last week as the 10-year yield spread over US Treasuries had contracted dramatically. The pricing, at five basis points over the 10-year Canadian government benchmark, was deemed to be competitive. Meanwhile, Ford Credit Australia issued ADollars 75m of five-year bonds via Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank which converted its London office into UK branch status on Monday. Also in the Australian dollar sector, Queensland Treasury Corp issued ADollars 100m of three-year bonds via Nomura, which were seen to be aimed mainly at Japanese investors. The Republic of Finland tapped the Luxembourg franc sector, issuing LFr5bn of 10-year bonds. This deal was largely targeted at Benelux retail investors, and met with good demand, said lead manager Banque Internationale a Luxembourg. Finland plans to borrow at least Dollars 2bn more in the international capital markets this year, a finance ministry official told Reuter in an interview. Standard &amp; Poor's has affirmed its triple-A senior and double-A subordinated debt rating for the African Development Bank. Some months ago, revelations of mounting arrears from AfDB debtors put a question mark over the bank's triple-A rating.</p>

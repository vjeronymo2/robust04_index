In addition, it  is an undeniable fact that human rights have been ensured and  improved. For the Vietnamese people, the rights to live in  independence and freedom are the biggest, a lesson drawn from  the country's reality over the past half century. However, all  the Vietnamese people are fully aware that independence and  freedom will have no significance if they live in poverty,  ignorance, and a minimally developed society.    An independent and free country should closely links with  ideas of prosperous people and a mighty nation [sentence as  heard]. That is why the renovation process has been fully  responded by the people. The people's rights to live, first of  all, is the right to do business. It is safe to say that never  before the Vietnamese people are doing business as dynamically  as today. They have engaged in diversified jobs in different  branches. Life of the people in different quarters is better.  However, a part of the people still lead a difficult life for  they cannot adapt to the mechanism of market economy. To be  fair, the people's rights to do business have been strongly  assisted by a number of state encouraged policies. Democracy  has worked in many fields and it showed that human rights have  been respected.    National Assembly deputies and relevant government officials  have been directly and frankly questioned about the standstill  and negative practices in their branches or ministries. The  Minister of Education and Training openly talked with students  about issues of their concern. Mass media has disclosed cases  of corruption and smuggling in different ministries and  branches, including senior officials and so forth. Perhaps  never before the Vietnamese people have followed closely the  mass media as today, because they not only need information but  also want to know the implementation of human rights and the  national renovation process.    Last year, the Vietnamese state continued to issue policies  and guidelines in order to substantially ensuring the citizen's  rights. Now, the number of Vietnamese people going to foreign  countries as tourists is on the increase. They not only go to  regional countries but also to far away countries such as Hong  Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, U.S.A., Canada, and Australia where  in the part were considered forbidden land.    An ordinance on the marriage of Vietnamese citizens with  foreigners has been issued. Freedom of belief has been written  in the Constitution. It is complemented by mamy concrete  resolutions. Worthy of note was the movement on eradicating  hunger and eliminating poverty which has been largely deployed  in the whole country. Many efforts have been made to help poor  farmers develop production and to assist supportless aged  people, war invalids, disable people, and orphans.    However, the Vietnamese state acknowledged that it does not  complete the task in fully implementing its policies for the  people. There remain many social evils, even serious ones. But  it can be affirmed that the Vietnamese state has strived to  remove difficulties for every people, every family, and increase  their joy and confidence. That is why the people share the same  view to build and establish a democratic society because it  ensures human rights.</p>

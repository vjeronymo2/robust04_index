			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paulo Francis] </F>   [Text] PT [Workers Party] candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da  Silva has said that, if elected, he will negotiate the foreign  debt with U.S. President Bill Clinton because he might be more  understanding than bankers. Only inexperienced people, unaware  of how the world and U.S. society operate, would propose such a  shortcut. By the way, this is a typical feature of PT programs  like the one that will distribute land to landless people  without even realizing that farming calls for capital,  expertise, machinery, and a market -- modern features that  educated people have known since the time of Adam Smith  (1723-1790), the father of economists.    The Brazilian foreign debt is not owed to the U.S. President  but to private banks, most of which are European or Asian. U.S.  banks coordinate creditors, but they cannot impose anything on  them. To summarize, the Brazilian foreign debt is a private  matter. Since the time of Joao Figueiredo's government, no  Brazilian Administration has understood how to manage the debt,  and Washington has already tried to facilitate agreements. The  most noticeable effort, which the Brazilian Government accepted  after repeatedly promising that it would never do so, is the  Brady plan, designed by George Bush's Treasury Secretary  Nicholas Brady. Under this plan, indebted countries can buy  their own debt certificates with discounts of up to 35 percent,  substantially reducing the principal and postponing capital  repayment through payment of interest. After faltering under  the economic leadership of several amateurs, Brazil became a  Brady plan client. If the teams of [former Presidents] Sarney  and Collor were unfit -- just as Franco's team is -- one does  not have to be clairvoyant to imagine the type of person Lula  would select to contact bankers, considering the PT's exotic  ideas on the subject. Brazil's largest creditor is the Bank of  Brazil branch in New York, which can take the burden and remain  silent.    Lula seems not to have even the slightest idea of our real  debt situation. Negotiations call for endorsement by the IMF.  Without that any arrangements are merely provisional and  "initial accords" that are advertised as solutions but which --  months later -- appear to fail like everything that has been  negotiated since the political opening in 1985. The IMF will  back Brazil but only through a drastic reduction in our public  deficit and with an accelerated policy of privatization that may  reduce inflation to a single-digit figure (less than 10 percent  monthly). Candidate Lula is against everything the IMF wants.  If Lula is elected, the impasse will continue and -- what is  even more serious -- Brazil will remain outside the  international capital market, which is flourishing from Mexico  to China.</p>

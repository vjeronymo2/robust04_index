			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Asprey to gain full listing as Sears sells its stake SEARS, the UK retailer has sold its stake in Asprey, the jewellery group, for Pounds 92m in a deal that will also allow the USM-quoted jeweller to graduate to the main market. Separately, Sears said it would close its Dutch mail order business, Ter Muelen Post, having decided it could not be turned around. The two deals conclude a process of focusing on mass market retailing which began in the mid-1980s when Sears had interests ranging from the William Hill betting shop chain to engineering and house building companies. Sears said Asprey was not central to its strategy, nor was it able to exercise control over its investment. The sale of the Asprey stake will produce a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7m. The Pounds 5.5m cost of closing Ter Muelen, includes Pounds 1.8m in operating losses to June this year, redundancy costs and asset write-offs. Smith New Court is understood to have placed the 20.3m ordinary Asprey shares, representing a 25.38 per cent stake, with about 40 institutions at 267p after taking the stock on to its books in a bought deal. Collins Stewart converted Sears' preference shares to net 8.25 per cent preference shares which were also placed with institutions. The wider share distribution will allow Asprey, capitalised at Pounds 230m, to achieve a full listing. Mr John Asprey and family trusts increased their stake to nearly 52 per cent through the purchase of 1.1m additional shares yesterday, securing the group from takeover. Mr Naim Attallah, Asprey chief executive, said the group would now concentrate on growing organically. Since taking control in 1988, Mr Attallah has led a rapid expansion that included the 1990 purchase of the Mappin &amp; Webb and Garrard shops from Sears for preference shares, and Watches of Switzerland from Ratners. 'It is a time for consolidation, although we are planning to open Mappin &amp; Webb in Prague and probably in Shanghai,' he said. Asprey reported a pre-tax profit in the year to end-March of Pounds 21.63m (from Pounds 19.36m) on sales up 35 per cent at Pounds 144.72m. Some Pounds 23m of this arose from sales in acquired companies. Earnings per share fell from 15.14p to 14.44p and the group is to pay a final dividend of 4p (from 3.75p) giving a total for the year of 5.1p (from 4.85p). Asprey said earnings had suffered from the return to a normal tax charge and margin erosion as the group took some of its acquired companies back up-market. Mr Ken Taylor, Smith New Court sales director, said that before yesterday's share placing Asprey had not had a serious institutional following. The Sears' sale had increased the free float in the shares by 200 per cent. Market, Page 36</p>

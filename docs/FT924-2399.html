			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further profit-taking as account ends LONDON equities remained a prey to sterling and stock index futures yesterday, falling sharply in early trading before rallying later in the session. Investment sentiment remained depressed by the discouragement to interest rate hopes from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. The close of the day's trading saw a fall of 10.3 for a FT-SE reading of 2,716.2 with traders continuing to take the view that the stock market was undergoing an expected bout of year-end profit-taking. A slow start to the new Wall Street session, which added an initial 9 Dow points to its overnight fall gave no encouragement to London at the end of the day. Trading volume slipped to 692.1m shares from the 711.8m of the previous session, but there was a reduction in the tax-related business which featured trading on the previous day. Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.45bn on Thursday, indicating that year-end profit-taking was at significant levels. Traders drew comfort from the Footsie's success in rallying from the day's low of 2,704.2, which came very early in the day and reflected initial weakness in the stock index futures sector. At last night's close, the Footsie was 43.2 points down on a week which has seen repeated bouts of profit-taking on doubts over prospects for a further one point cut in UK base rates. Last night also brought the close of the two-week trading account in the UK stock market which has seen the Footsie fall by 1.6 per cent. Weakeness in sterling, together with general uncertainty surrounding the EC ministers' meeting in Edinburgh has encouraged institutional investors to take profits in UK equities without waiting for the end of the year. A trading programme from a leading UK investment bank helped the rally in the stock market during the second half of the session. But the City of London had largely discounted the UK Retail price index for November, showing an annualised rise of only 3 per cent. Government bonds, responding favourably to the UK chancellor's indication that base rates were likely to remain stable for the rest of this year, put on about half a point at the longer end. Equity strategists continued to suggest that, while the medium-term outlook for equities remains firm, there may be rotation early in the new year from 1992 outperformers into stocks which have underperformed. Trading volume has risen sharply as share profits have been taken in the wake of the sharp gains recorded since mid-September.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Working LIfe: 'Pyramid' sales companies face aggressive clampdown - Caveat Investor Thousands of members of schemes supposedly designed to generate money for nothing have seen their hopes turn to sand in their hands during the last few days. The Department of Trade and Industry has begun an aggressive clampdown on so-called 'pyramid' companies and has promised a review of the existing law that allows them to operate. In a series of High Court petitions over the last few weeks, it has applied to appoint provisional liquidators on public interest grounds to 3T Publications, Alchemy (UK), Alchemy Marketing and Quillpunch. It is scrutinising at least one other company, called Powertag. 3T Publications operates as FPW - known at different times as Frequency Programming World and Futures Product World. FPW in turn operates schemes, including the Silver Matrix and Midas. Alchemy operated a scheme named after itself, then renamed the Alchemy Foundation. The companies managed several schemes which promised members the chance to multiply many times the money they have put in. For example, Midas members were promised that Pounds 140 paid out would result in their receiving back Pounds 600. Alchemy offered Pounds 31,775 to members in exchange for 24 monthly payments of Pounds 75. They also constantly require new recruits, apparently attracted by a combination of money and semi-mystical self-improvement. A three-page letter distributed earlier this year explains that FPW 'is about teaching success technologies to members' through 'mind exploration meditation' and 'self-help'. It talks about bringing money to places 'in which opportunity is almost non-existent' such as old mining, shipbuilding and steel-making towns, using 'breakthroughs in modern technology . . . and facts taught by eminent doctors.' As distinct from other more conventional pyramid selling organisations, which use personal networks to market goods or services, these schemes simply ask members to send in money - and to recruit additional members. Their flaw is that they work like a Ponzi scheme: money is not invested in any way to add to the value of the income, but simply redistributed to those higher up in the pyramid. So for each new level of members to receive income, there must be a continual growth in members beneath them - or additional contributions from existing members. When these flows dry up, members stop receiving any money. In words approvingly cited by the DTI, Mr Justice Chadwick granted provisional liquidation against Alchemy last month stating that the schemes were 'bound to fail' because 'the pool of those willing to join is not inexhaustible.' However, the DTI's recent court petitions - and the associated publicity - means that money from new members is likely to quickly dry up, depriving existing members of any new income. In spite of the logical flaws of the schemes, the regulators have apparently left many members not only angry and out of pocket but still ardently committed with an almost religious belief in the systems and their founders. The views are summed up by one businessman based in the south-west of England who wishes to remain anonymous and has been a member of FPW's Silver Matrix and Midas, and was considering joining Alchemy. He says he joined FPW after his 12-year-old business collapsed, and he had unsuccessfully played the options markets and responded to chain letters which asked him to send in money. 'I feel there is a general view - the orthodox view - of accountants, bank managers, judges and so on about these schemes,' he says. 'I would have argued that view before, but I have now accepted it can work. I would hope to show that logical view has a chink. I've put a lot of thought into this. It is a very stable way to operate. If left alone I believe they would not only continue, I would be able to look back and say was this one of the best things since sliced bread.' During a discussion lasting 105 minutes he was unable to explain how the schemes could be self-sustaining, but stressed that they worked. 'My return is so much higher than any alternative. I have survived for 12 months on them. I am confident I can get the money I have lost back on them.' 'I regard these as long-term savings - not as safe as a bank, but safer than unit trusts. Unlike most investment and saving schemes this company asks only for really very modest amounts. There are inherent dangers in building societies, which are only saved because others step in when they get into financial difficulty. I would hope in the future we would have a self-protective mechanism - like Abta for travel agents.'</p>

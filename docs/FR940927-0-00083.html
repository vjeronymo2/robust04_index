Updating the standards and procedures to keep pace with current economic conditions will increase the likelihood that a veteran obtaining a VA guaranteed loan will be able to repay the loan. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> effective date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> These regulatory amendments are effective October 27, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> for further information contact:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Ms. Judith Caden, Assistant Director for Loan Policy (264), Loan Guaranty Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 273&hyph;7366. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> supplementary information:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On September 29, 1993, VA published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 50875) proposed regulatory amendments to 38 CFR 36.4337. VA proposed to amend the credit underwriting standards and procedures for processing VA guaranteed home loans (1) by updating the figures in the residual income guidelines; (2) by requiring that income tax returns be submitted with applications for borrowers who are self-employed, paid on a commission basis, employed in the building trades, or have seasonal jobs; (3) by providing more specific time frames for considering whether income from part-time employment, second jobs overtime, self-employment, and commissions may be considered stable and reliable; (4) by adding guidelines for underwriting cases involving foreclosures and Federally-related debts; and (5) by deleting the requirement that lenders check with VA regional offices on prior VA loans. VA also proposed to delete union dues from items considered job-related expenses because these dues are part of the residual income figure. Please refer to the September 29, 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  for a complete discussion of the proposed amendments. VA is adopting the regulatory amendments as originally proposed except for the minor editorial and terminology changes discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> VA received three comments on the proposed amendments. One commenter favored all the amendments. The second, a national association representing certified public accountants, suggested that more accurate accounting terms be used to describe VA's financial requirements for self-employed borrowers. Specifically, the commenter noted that ``compile'' is the correct term to use to describe the case where an external accountant will ``prepare'' the financial statements, as required by section 36.4337(f)(7)(i). The commenter also pointed out that independent accountants do not ``certify the accuracy'' of financial statements, rather, the technically correct usage is to say that the accountant conducts an ``audit''. VA agrees that the commenter's suggested terminology is more precise. Accordingly, we are revising paragraph (f)(7)(i) of &sect;36.4337 of the regulations to read that the profit and loss statement and balance sheet required for self employed applicants be ``compiled'', rather than ``prepared'', by an accountant. The words ``certified as accurate'' are also being deleted from the sentence which was proposed to read, ``In some cases the nature of the business or the content of the financial statement may necessitate an independent audit certified as accurate by the accountant.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third commenter requested clarification of how a loan underwriter determines the stability and reliability of a self-employed applicant's income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed new paragraph (f)(7) of &sect;36.4337 states that ``income from self-employment is generally considered stable when the applicant has been in business for at least 2 years and that income from less than 2 years of self-employment usually cannot be considered stable unless the applicant has had previous related employment and/or extensive specialized training.'' It also states that ``When an applicant has been self-employed less than 1 year, it will rarely be possible to demonstrate that the income is stable for qualifying purposes *&blank;*&blank;* .'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the regulations provide, VA does not require that in every case the self-employed applicant have a two-year period of continuous employment with no gaps. If the applicant has been self-employed for less than two years, it is appropriate in underwriting the loan to also consider the applicant's related employment or specialized training. For example, sufficient weight might be given to the fact that the applicant has had specialized training in his or her field of endeavor, and that therefore, the income from self-employment should be viewed as stable, even though it has been for less than 2 years. However, when the self-employment has been for less than one year, it would be very difficult to consider the income stable and reliable. In other words, in cases where the loan applicant has been self-employed for less than one year, it would not be possible to view his or her income as stable unless the applicant's training and/or related experience is such as to clearly show a very strong likelihood of success. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter also asked ``If the two-year history of employment applies, must it be continuous or should factors such as schooling or training be considered during that time even if no income resulted?'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the proposed regulations provide for the consideration of training and schooling when determining the adequacy of income from self-employment. Thus it is possible to consider income as stable and reliable with less than 2 years of continuous employment, provided gaps in employment are sufficiently explained by adequate documentation of schooling or training. It is clear that the language in paragraph (f)(7)(i) is adequate to prescribe the intended standard and, therefore, the paragraph will be published as originally proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VA is making an editorial change to paragraph (g) of the regulations. Language now contained in paragraph (f)(1) of the regulations explaining the requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, is being repeated in paragraph (g) for the purposes of clarity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, except for the terminology and editorial changes already discussed, VA is publishing these regulations as originally proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collection requirement contained in paragraphs (f)(6), (f)(7) and (f)(9) of &sect;36.4337 of these regulations has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB control number 2900&hyph;0521. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

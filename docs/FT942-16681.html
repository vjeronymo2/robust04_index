			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries show late improvement in quiet trading US Treasury bonds staged a late technical upturn yesterday in light trading after holding steady early in the session amid conflicting signals on the economy. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 better at 88 7/16 , with the yield slipping to 7.198 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  3/32 better at 99 19/32 to yield 5.326 per cent. In general, the market enjoyed a peaceful session. Comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, just before the afternoon session began, triggered a brief flurry of selling which quickly evaporated. Mr Alan Greenspan, addressing bankers in San Francisco, said he thought the country's sense of economic pessimism was misguided. He stressed that the long-term outlook was highly favourable. Early on, the weekly reading on the state of labour market - which showed a rise of 6,000 in initial claims for state unemployment benefit  - provided a slight lift, as it suggested that the economy was not growing at an excessive rate. But the favourable news was soon balanced out by March sales data from the leading US retailers. The figures showed shoppers returned as soon as February's deep freeze ended, a worrying development for bond investors, who fear the increased demand will lead to higher prices. The middle segment of the yield curve benefited the most from a firming trend in the mortgage-backed and municipal bonds. French government bonds ended the day lower, weighed down by the lacklustre response to the Bank of France's FFr19.8bn auction of OATs and the weaker franc. 'Auctions are not desperately easy at the moment so the Bank of France did as well as one could have expected in these difficult times,' said Mr Kit Juckes, economist at SG Warburg Securities. He added that the uncertain political situation in France could force a widening of the yield differential between 10-year French and German government bonds. The differential now stands at about 20 basis points, he said. A further widening would lessen the appeal of French bonds to international investors. Dealers said the muted demand at yesterday's auction was reflected in the higher yields, noting that the average accepted yield on the 5.5 per cent OATs due 2004 rose by six basis points to 6.47 per cent. The yield on the 6 per cent OAT due 2025 rose to 7.05 per cent from 6.91 per cent. They added that the bid-to-cover ratios were much lower than at the previous auction. One dealer noted that the June contract of the notional 10-year French government bond future on the Matif had held up relatively well during the auction but had weakened on the back of lower US treasuries. The contract traded between a high of 123.62 and a low of 123.40 during the day. In the late afternoon, it traded around 123.54, marginally higher on the day. Italian government bonds rose more than one point yesterday afternoon on news that Italy's federalist Northern League had resumed contact with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who had broken off talks with his electoral allies on Tuesday. The June contract of the Italian government bond future on Liffe went as high as 113.48 on the news, well up on the day's low of 112.43. In the late afternoon, the contract traded around 113.40, up 1.11 point on the day. UK gilts recovered from an intraday low which followed the release of stronger-than-expected UK industrial output data for February. Some dealers said the data appeared to lower the chances of an early rate cut. Apart from the data, there were no other fresh influences on the market and gilts traded in a narrow one-point range. The June contract of the long gilt future on Liffe traded between 108 21/32 and 107 5/8 during the day. In the late afternoon the contract was quoted at 108 3/32 , down  3/32 on the day. German bunds were trapped in a narrow range yesterday as the market waited for Mr Greenspan to make his speech. There had been worries that he would raise the discount rate in order to underpin the recent rise in the Fed funds rate. The June contract of the bund future on Liffe was sandwiched between 97.30 and 97.00 during the day and traded at 97.15 in the late afternoon, up 0.10 point from Wednesday's close.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / MRes to act as PhD filter Plans for a 'research masters' degree to be taken by all students aiming for science doctorates were announced yesterday Mr William Waldegrave, the science minister. The qualification, which the government hopes will be offered from September 1995, is intended to cut the amount of research council funding for students who fail to complete their doctorates. Of those who started science doctorates using government research council grants in 1988, 40 per cent had not completed their doctorates four years later. Employers had also expressed concern that their recruits who had taken doctorates had inadequate communication skills and were too 'narrowly focused', with a poor grasp of management, according to officials. Mr Waldegrave suggested that the new qualification, provisionally known as the MRes, should take one year to achieve and include a significant research component, accounting for 60 per cent of students' time. It would include a grounding in research techniques and modules designed to provide 'transferable skills' - including management, team working, and communication - to enable scientists to explain their work to lay audiences.

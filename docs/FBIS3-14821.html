			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Scherban] </F>   [Text] Moscow, February 28 (TASS) -- "I have acted in full  compliance with law and my conscience is clear. Let those who  do not rely on law blush for their conduct," said Alexey  Kazannik, former Russian prosecutor general, as he parted with  his colleagues on Monday. Kazannik's resignation was accepted  by Russian president on February 26.    Addressing his colleagues, Kazannik explained his  resignation, saying that he had been put under pressure from  high-ranking officials from the president's administration who  demanded that the resolution on amnesty adopted by the State  Duma be suspended. "As a supporter and authorised official of  President Yeltsin, I had to carry out any presidential orders,  even of they were illegal," Kazannik said.    On the other hand, Kazannik referred to officials of the  prosecutor's office who believe that "there are no legal grounds  to do anything against this amnesty." Facing a complex dilemma,  Kazannik tried to "personally get in touch with the Russian  president and explain the situation to him." However, he failed  to do this and decided to resign from his post.    Kazannik declared that Aleksey Ilushenko, temporarily  appointed to the post of the prosecutor general by the Russian  president, as a chairman of the control department of the  president's administration, had called on him to prevent putting  the resolution an amnesty into effect. This "illegal" demand,  as Kazannik put it, was made by participants in an emergency  meeting held to discuss the only one problem -- how to prevent  the amnesty and who adopted a decision not to let prisoners out  of Lefortovo whatever the cost might be.</p>

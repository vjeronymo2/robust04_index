			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / London urged to reverse policy on HK Sir Percy Cradock, Britain's former chief negotiator on Hong Kong, yesterday bitterly attacked the decision of Mr Chris Patten, the territory's governor, to proceed with electoral reform legislation without agreement from Beijing. He told the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee in London that the breakdown of talks with Beijing would create a lasting confrontation. The situation was 'a tragedy for Hong Kong,' for which the policy of the British and Hong Kong governments since last year was largely responsible. Sir Percy, former ambassador to Beijing and foreign affairs adviser to Mrs Margaret Thatcher as prime minister, urged London to reverse its 'dangerous and reckless' policy. Mr Patten's approach 'will do much more harm to Hong Kong than the alternative policy of co-operation with China on the best terms we can get.' Sir Percy said Britain had refused China's request for discussion of the proposals before Mr Patten unveiled them in October 1992. The Foreign Office said in response Britain had made clear the proposals were intended for discussion with China. Parliamentarians on the committee questioned Sir Percy's views. One suggested that acceptance of China's position would mean the 'emasculation of real democracy,' and would enable the Chinese government to say that this had been done with Britain's agreement. Sir Percy, however, said present policy was putting at risk the increase in democracy in Hong Kong to which China had agreed. Reforms introduced in 1995 would be dismantled by China in 1997 and replaced in a 'vicious backlash' with a government subservient to China. He rejected as an 'extraordinary and ignorant distortion' the suggestion that British policy on Hong Kong had been directed by Sino-centric officials at the Foreign Office such as himself. Chinese and British officials yesterday held the second day of talks in the Joint Liaison Group charged with details of the 1997 handover to China. The meeting ends today.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur who has arrived in  Moscow to participate in the CIS summit, hoped that the  documents which were to be signed would give a new impulse to  the development of economic relations between the CIS states.    Snegur spoke in favor of an agreement on mutual settlement  in  an interview with Interfax. "It is not normal when a country  cannot settle its accounts with another country," Snegur  stressed.    He also pointed out that Moldova was interested in signing  another document concerning the human rights of ethnic  minorities within the CIS. Snegur considered it a mutual  commitment towards ethnic minorities in the CIS republics.  Snegur said he had no worry about this issue in Moldova. He  stated that all linguistic problems had been resolved and that  Moldova had the most democratic law on citizenship (which  automatically grants Moldovan citizenship to everyone living on  its territory).    Commenting on Kazakhstan's initiative on the establishment  of  a Eurasian union, Snegur said he had not had enough time to  examine it in detail. "If this means the establishment of a new  structure similar to the CIS, it will be better to make the CIS  work. The idea of the CIS itself is good, at least we need a  single economic space. If Nazarbayev's proposal is a hidden  attempt to reestablish the former Soviet Union, Moldova would  not be in favor," Snegur stressed.</p>

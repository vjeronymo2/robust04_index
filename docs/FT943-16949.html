			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: NatWest pays Pounds 195m for US retail bank National Westminster Bank yesterday announced that it would expand its US retail banking subsidiary further by spending Dollars 300m (Pounds 195m) in shares and cash to buy Central Jersey Bancorp, a retail bank with assets of Dollars 1.8bn. NatWest Bancorp, its US retail subsidiary, will pay Dollars 33.50 per share, or 2.4 times book value. The deal follows the acquisition by NatWest in March of Citizens First Bancorp, another New Jersey bank. Some 55 per cent of the Dollars 300m will come from the issue of up to 25m ordinary shares - 1.5 per cent of share capital - in the form of American Depository Receipts. The acquisition will increase NatWest Bancorp's assets to Dollars 30bn. Mr John Tugwell, NatWest Bancorp's chairman and chief executive, said that Central Jersey was attractive because its franchise covered 'horse-farming country, some sea-shore, and a lot of small businesses and prosperous consumers'. He said that NatWest could cut Central Jersey's cost base by 35 to 40 per cent, mainly by cutting duplication in central functions. Earnings per share were unlikely to rise in the first year because of initial integration spending. NatWest was 'comfortable that we will earn an appropriate return' by raising income from the sale of financial products. Some 11 per cent of Central Jersey's income comes from such items, compared with 34 per cent for NatWest Bancorp. It would also be able to cut its funding cost by gaining access to Central Jersey's retail deposit base, which wholly funds its lending. Central Jersey was 'a very clean bank' in which only 1 per cent of the loan book was non-performing, and reserves stood at 116 per cent of bad loans. It has a very strong 12.3 per cent ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets.</p>

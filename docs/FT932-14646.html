			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / International Company News: Rescue plan for Uni may emerge next week A PLAN to restructure financially Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurance group which collapsed last August, is expected soon following a breakthrough in negotiations between creditors and potential investors. A choice is expected to be made next week between two proposals. The collapse followed Uni's NKr4.7bn (Dollars 692m) acquisition of a 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia Forsakring, Sweden's biggest insurer, financed through short-term loans. A joint bid for the Swedish group with fellow insurer Hafnia failed, and the value of Uni's stake more than halved when Skandia's share price plunged. Uni's creditors called in their loans and the insurer was unable to pay. One proposal calls for a foreign investor to take a significant stake in Uni. Last month Norwegian authorities cleared the way for such a solution by expanding the allowance for foreign ownership in domestic financial institutions to 33 1/3 per cent from 10 per cent. Sources close to Uni said yesterday that a large French insurer has been undertaking a due diligence process over the past few months with a view to taking a stake in Uni. The other solution, due to be presented soon to Uni's administration board by two domestic brokerage firms, calls for a share issue to raise up to NKr2.8bn.</p>

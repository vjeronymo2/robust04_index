			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Bosnian aid to go by rail THE United Nations refugee agency said yesterday it was going to try to take aid into war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina by train, an idea rejected until now as too dangerous, Reuter reports from Geneva. The decision came as Ms Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, warned that her agency had been stretched to its limits in former Yugoslavia, where 3.1m people have been displaced by fighting. The first UNHCR 'train convoy' into Bosnia, carrying 250 tonnes of supplies, will leave the Croatian port of Ploce on Monday, said UNHCR spokeswoman Ms Sylvana Foa. The UNHCR reckons Bosnia needs a minimum of 9,100 tonnes of food aid every week. With relief operations interrupted repeatedly by attacks , it has never managed to achieve more than two-thirds of that figure.</p>

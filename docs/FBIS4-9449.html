			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 25 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav  Havel writes in the European Union (EU) magazine EVROPA that  Europe cannot be built up according to beforehand known and  tested prescriptions. The first issue of the magazine, a  bi-monthly which already appears in EU member states and is a  forum for debate about EU issues in all spheres, comes out in  the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary in their  national languages for the first time today.    Reflecting upon the reasons which have prevented Europe from  becoming a continent of peace, cooperation and equal chances for  all and from establishing the feelings of certainty, trust and  peace after the fall of communism, Havel says that the dramatic  changes of the past years and the resurfacing of spectres of the  past challenge some not much direct and sometimes cheap  optimistic concepts.    But Havel says he still believes there is a chance for  Europe  to gradually become a large community based on the principle of  "unity in diversity." It is natural that there are also  skeptical moods and disappointment over the pace of changes and  that the new democracies even feel "abandoned" by the others, he  says.    In conclusion, Havel stresses that he personally supports  European integration which he sees as the only road not only for  Europe, but for the whole of the world.    Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec says in an interview  for the magazine that Europe would not be complete without the  Czech Republic. He points out that Europe has been living  together with the other nations (now EU members) for centuries.  "I do not think that Germany should be Europe's border," he says.    Zieleniec says that European integration is sometimes viewed  as a historical opportunity to build Czech-German relations,  which have always been close, but from time to time tragical, on  new bases as was the case of other small nations such as the  Netherlands and Belgium.    The Czech Republic's integration into the EU together with  free movement of people and capital could make a full stop after  some problems at last. "Both countries have re-evaluated their  own history and searched for a new future," Zieleniec stresses.    He says that the Partnership for Peace plan is much more  interesting from the political than military point of view.  Zieleniec says that it would not matter if the Czech Republic  was the first Central European country admitted into NATO, but  it does not want to be left alone. "It is in our best interests  that our neighbours be in the same military bloc as we. It  would be unfortunate if Slovakia, Austria or any-one else became  part of another security grouping than we," Zieleniec stresses.</p>

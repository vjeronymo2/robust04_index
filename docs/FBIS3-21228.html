(Matsushita Electric), jointly with  Professor Koichi Niihara at the Industrial Science Research  Institute of Osaka University, has developed new nano-composites  in which nm-size, microfine molybdenum particles are uniformly  dispersed in a matrix of yttria/partially stabilized zirconia  (Y-PSZ or Y-TZP). With the addition of nano-microparticles of  molybdenum to comparatively strong and tough PSZ to form the  composite, ``the material manifested strength and toughness  equivalent to those of super-hard alloys and corrosion  resistance nearly equal to that of ceramics,'' according to the  Functional Material Laboratory of the Central Research  Institute. Within the next two to three years, Matsushita  Electric plans to use the composite for electric tools' cutting  edges and barber's equipment, including electric razors.    Nano-composites are reinforced ceramics created by forming  residual stress fields with nm-size microparticles either in the  ceramic crystalline grains themselves or in their boundaries.  Nano-composite research activities have flourished because  drastic improvement of bending strength and toughness is  possible by the formation of the composite. Previously, the  research concentrated on composite materials that combined  dissimilar ceramics, e.g., alumina and silicon carbide.    With the aim of ``developing materials that are  simultaneously strong, tough and corrosion-resistant,''  Matsushita Electric focused its attention on nano-composites  containing ceramics and metal because previous nano-composites  consisting of two ceramics had been poor in toughness. PSZ  containing 3 mol-percent yttria (Y[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/])  was chosen as the ceramic matrix material. PSZ has excellent  toughness and strength, since it undergoes the  structure-reinforcing phase transition of its crystalline grains  from cubic to monoclinic, when external stress is applied. The  actual PSZ material used was Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd.'s  ``TZ-3Y,'' with an average particle diameter of 300 nm.    The research group selected molybdenum for the metal  component because of its high melting point, approximately  2,600C. In super-hard alloys, metallic properties, as  opposed to ceramic, are dominant, because their metal component,  cobalt, with a low melting point of 1,500C, tends to cover  the ceramic grain boundaries. Therefore, super-hard alloys have  excellent toughness, but poor corrosion resistance. By using a  high-melting metal, the group hoped to be able to overcome the  poor corrosion resistance, the weakness of super-hard alloys.  Thus, molybdenum was chosen because its readily wettable,  micro-fine powder was commercially available.    The molybdenum powder, ``Mo-H-D,'' made by Nippon  Shinkinzoku  K.K., was obtained. The powder's average particle diameter was  650 nm, and the particle size distribution curve showed two  peaks, at 200 nm and 1,000 nm.    For the production of the new composite, the two raw  material  powders were mixed and then ball-milled together for 24 hours in  acetone; the blend was sintered by the hot press method for one  hour at 1,400-1,600C, under 30 MPa pressure. The resulting  sinter density was higher than 99.5 percent.    In the micro-structure of the sinter, molybdenum particles  approximately 800 nm in diameter were seen precipitated in the  grain boundaries of PSZ poly-crystals, also approximately 800 nm  in diameter. Furthermore, 20- to 30-nm-diameter molybdenum  nano-particles were also seen precipitated within PSZ particles.  It is conjectured that PSZ crystal grains ``form nano-particles  by incorporating molybdenum micro-particles inside.''    The mechanical properties of the newly developed composite  are strongly influenced by the amount of added molybdenum. The  composite's bending strength increases as the molybdenum  addition increases from zero through 30 volume-percent, above  which the strength does not change significantly (Figure 2). The  composite's toughness, on the other hand, hardly increases until  the molybdenum amount reaches 30 volume-percent, and rapidly  increases as soon as the molybdenum amount exceeds 30  volume-percent. The explanation: ``As long as the molybdenum  amount is 30 volume-percent or less, the composite's strength  improvement is governed by the nano-particles.    When the nano-particles precipitate inside zirconia  particles, the structure of zirconia becomes finer, and the  composite's strength increases. On the other hand, as more  molybdenum is added, molybdenum in the grain boundaries begins  to grow to become sub-m-sized particles; hence, greater  toughness. The composite's toughness becomes high because  molybdenum in the boundaries can prevent the progress of any  cracks that have been generated in the sinter, in addition to  the PSZ's phase-transition reinforcing mechanism.''   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-17A>           Figure 2. Bending Strength, Fracture Toughness Values of </FIG>       The composite's mechanical properties, when 50  volume-percent  molybdenum was added, were determined as follows: bending  strength was 1,800 MPa, and toughness was 17.5  MPa/m[.sup]1/2[/]. These values were 1.8 and 4.2 times,  respectively, the values with no molybdenum added. According to  the group: ``We have never seen a nano-composite that has  simultaneously manifested bending strength of 1,000 MPa and  toughness of 10 MPa/m[.sup]1/2[/].'' The group confirmed the  excellent corrosion resistance of the composite with a salt  water spray test; thus, the group concluded that the material  should have no problem in an ordinary environment.    The group feels that it needs to improve the composite's  hardness, which decreases with the increase in the molybdenum  quantity. When 40 volume-percent molybdenum is added, the  composite's Vickers hardness HV is only 7-8 GPa, compared with  19 GPa for alumina and 12 GPa for Y-PSZ. The reason was the  hardness of molybdenum itself, which is only 2 GPa. The group  plans to overcome this weakness of the composite by improving  the control of the composite's micro-structure, i.e., the  precipitation sites and numbers for nano-particles.</p>

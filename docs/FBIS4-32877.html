			<p>BFN     [Text] Asked if the executive branch has issued  instructions to military commanders on the issue of the  temporary suspension of their membership in political parties,  Colonel Carlos Medina Monjagata, director of the Military  Forces' Social Communications Center, said that the military are  expecting a decision by Commander in Chief Juan Carlos Wasmosy  on the matter.    Medina said there will be no institutional reaction on the  issue until the executive branch promulgates the bill and the  commander in chief decides what to do about it.    Medina reiterated, however, that the Armed Forces will obey  this and all other legal dispositions on the matter.    The colonel said that the Constitution forbids the military  from participating in partisan politics, and therefore  absolutely nothing will occur if the law is approved.  <H5>  Troop Mobilization </H5>   Col. Medina announced that the 1st Infantry Division will  mobilize to travel to Potrero del Carmen, Itacurubi de la  Cordillera, at 0700 on 30 May. Medina said the unit will conduct  a tactical demonstration for Army Officers Advanced Training  School (EPOE) students.    The exercise is in cooperation with Army officers' training.    Brigade General Carlos Alberto Ayala is the current  commander  of the 1st Infantry Division.  <H5>  Changes in Air Force </H5>   On 26 May PAM [Air Force Pilot] Colonel Alejandro Roman was  appointed commander of the Air Force Logistics Brigade. Roman is  an experienced pilot. Last year he took advanced training  courses in Taiwan at the invitation of that country's Armed  Forces.

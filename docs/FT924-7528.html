			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Broker in mass recruitment LAWRENCE KEEN, the private client stockbroker, has recruited 11 new staff members - including three who will become directors - from rival Granville Davies. The move is one of the most significant mass recruitments in recent years in the private client stockbroking business which has been shedding jobs rather than gaining them. Lawrence Keen was created via a management buy-out from its parent, Lawrence Prust, in 1986 following the spin-off of its former unit trust division, Framlington. Mr Mark Powell, chief executive of Lawrence Keen, said the 11 include seven fund managers and four support staff who between them had managed roughly Pounds 200m for their former employer. The move could increase Lawrence Keen's client base by as much as 15 per cent, he said. The broker has roughly Pounds 1.25bn under management for 8,000 clients, mostly individuals, small pension funds and charities. While there is no guarantee that the recruitment will result in a shift of clients, Mr Powell noted that key personnel in such moves have traditionally brought their customers with them. 'This is a very personal business and continuity of care is a very important part of the business'. Mr Powell said he does not expect there to be any legal obstacles to such a mass recruitment. The matter has already been discussed with executives of Granville Davies, a firm formed following a management buy-out by staff from Vickers da Costa.</p>

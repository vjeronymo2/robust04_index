			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Ambassador 'Abdallah al-Ashtal, our  country's permanent representative to the United Nations, has  presented a message to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus  Butrus-Ghali including a new initiative by brother Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential  Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. The message  states the following:    The Republic of Yemen emphasizes its concern to observe a  cease- fire in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution  No. 924. This is despite the secessionist rebels' repeated  flagrant cease- fire violations since 1800 on 9 June--the date  set by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, after his meeting with Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary  general's envoy. These violations were still continuing up to  the time this message was drafted. Although the forces of  legitimacy and unity complied with the the Armed Forces supreme  commander's order not to respond to those violations, the  apostate and secessionist elements persisted in their cease-fire  violations, intensifying their air and naval bombardment of our  forces in Aden and Abyan governorates, resulting in material and  human losses among their ranks. Despite all that, the  Government of the Republic of Yemen has instructed the permanent  representative to inform the UN secretary general of all those  violations and to submit a new initiative, on condition that the  rebels abide by the cease-fire as of midnight last night,  Friday, 10 June. Out of the Government of the Republic of  Yemen's concern not to allow the apostate and secessionist  elements to continue the letting of Yemeni blood within their  criminal scheme, the brother chairman of the Presidential  Council has instructed members of the Yemeni military committee,  which had been set up by a decision by the chairman of the  Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces,  to supervise the cease-fire by holding its first meeting in a  specific place named (Ja'ulah), located between Sabir and Dar  Sa'd villages, at 1100 today, Saturday, 11 June.</p>

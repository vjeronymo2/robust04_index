			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In the next few minutes, you  are going to hear interviews that correspondents Anna Samelova  and Ivan Samel have conducted with the newly appointed ministers  of key ministries. First of all, however, here is President  Michal Kovac's answer to the question of what he expects from  the new government.    [Begin Kovac recording] The fact that this government was  formed five days after a vote of no-confidence in the previous  government was passed shows that Slovakia has capable  politicians who have the will to cooperate in the interest of  the state and in the national interests of the Slovak Republic.  I expect that, during its term of office, this government will  confirm and consolidate this and will also give citizens  confidence that we are not such a wrangling nation as it might  have seemed recently.    Second, it is necessary that this government prepare the  ground to ensure a calm course for the new elections that will  most probably take place this fall. The government has very  important tasks in the areas of the economy and social and  foreign policy. In the economic and social areas, especially, it  has to take measures to stop a further decline in the economy  and the rise in unemployment. Measures need to be taken as well  to increase the feeling of security among citizens who worry  about their health and property, and about their social  prospects. There are other tasks, as well, but the most  important ones are those I have just mentioned here. [end  recording]</p>

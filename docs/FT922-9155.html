			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: RAS rises sharply after special item RIUNIONE Adriatica di Sicurta (RAS), the Italian insurance company controlled by Germany's Allianz, raised net 1991 profits by almost a half to L201.5bn (Dollars 163m) from L137.9bn in 1990. Much of the gain was fuelled by extraordinary items linked to the sale of equity stakes in Austria and Germany and property transactions in Italy. As a result, the dividend will remain unchanged at L300 for ordinary shares and L360 for savings stock. The company announced a complex rights issue to raise more than L800bn for future investment. RAS will increase its nominal capital by L54bn to L271bn via a one-for-four issue of new ordinary and savings shares, priced at L11,000 and L7,300 respectively. Shareholders will be offered one warrant, convertible exclusively into savings shares, for every four shares of either category held. The warrants will be exercisable into new savings shares, priced at L11,000, on the basis of one new share for every two warrants. The warrants will be valid from the beginning of next year until the end of 1995. The issue was initially poorly received on the Milan stock market, where RAS shares were suspended yesterday. The bourse has been hit by a string of cash calls at a time of particularly poor sentiment towards Italian equities. Reactions improved after Allianz confirmed that it would take up its full quota, which would effectively halve the size of the call on the market. Premium income at RAS went up by 14.2 per cent to L3,247bn for the parent company and by 10 per cent to L6,439bn at group level. The company said non-life business continued to suffer in Italy, with an underwriting loss of L101bn on motor insurance last year. Domestically, RAS registered strong gains in premiums, with non-life income rising by 13 per cent to L2,045bn while life insurance rose by 20 per cent to L715bn.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Ukraine puts brakes on Start: Kiev might obstruct nuclear cuts George Bush put the finishing touches to his foreign policy legacy in Moscow last weekend when he signed the Start 2 agreement with Boris Yeltsin. But President-elect Bill Clinton may well wish his predecessor had taken the time to visit Kiev. For the unprecedented cuts in the world's nuclear arsenal agreed in Moscow hinge on the decisions of a country which was overlooked by the summit - Ukraine. In addition to Russia, three republics - Kazakhstan, Belarus and Ukraine - still have nuclear weapons stationed on their territories. Kazakhstan has already followed Russia's lead in ratifying the 1990 Start 1 treaty agreed between the Soviet Union and the US, which promised cuts in both countries' long-range nuclear missiles. Belarus can be expected to follow suit if Ukraine complies. But the Ukrainian parliament is resisting ratification of Start 1. And under the accord reached in Moscow, Start 2 cannot go into effect until the previous treaty is ratified. Moreover, in the view of western military specialists, Ukraine is the only non-Russian republic with the capacity to become a nuclear power. It is home to many of the factories used to develop the Soviet nuclear arms industry, and the government in Kiev has won over the loyalty of most of the former Soviet soldiers serving within Ukraine's borders. As a result, many of the personnel guarding the 176 inter-continental ballistic missiles stationed on its territory take orders from Kiev. Thanks to the combination of military potential and political resistance, Ukraine has suddenly emerged as the critical piece in the international disarmament puzzle. Resolving the issue of Ukraine's nuclear arms is complicated by the divisions among the country's leaders. A vocal minority comprising Ukrainian nationalists and ex-communist hardliners contends that nuclear weapons are Ukraine's only guarantee against aggression from Russia. It believes such safeguards are increasingly important, as relations between the two countries have deteriorated following disputes over the division of the Black Sea naval fleet and Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. The Ukrainian ministries of defence and foreign affairs, by contrast, continue to support removal of nuclear weapons. Marshal General Konstantin Morozov, the liberal minister of defence, has repeatedly warned the Ukrainian parliament that retaining the country's nuclear weapons would be prohibitively expensive and technically complicated, and that they should be removed in line with the Start 1 treaty. His views are supported by President Leonid Kravchuk and Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma. But removal of nuclear weapons requires the agreement of parliament, and that will not be easy to win. Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, the influential chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs, has said that the legislature will not consider Start 1 until the country's economic reform programme has been approved by parliament. Even then, ratification of the treaty will face a long and difficult passage. One reason is that Ukraine's fragmented legislature has begun to vote with increasing autonomy and is less amenable to control from President Kravchuk. But there is a second explanation. Having understood the strength of its bargaining position, Ukraine is determined to get something in exchange for surrendering its nuclear weapons. Its two principal desires are economic aid and security guarantees. The issue of economic aid is fairly straightforward. Ukraine is seeking Dollars 1.5bn in aid from the west to offset the cost of dismantling the missiles, and has hinted that a Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn fund to support the Ukrainian currency would speed ratification. After November's announcement of an economic reform programme by Mr Kuchma, western governments may be more willing to supply such finance. Security guarantees, however, are more contentious. Ideally, Ukraine would like public pledges of western assistance in the event of Russian aggression. Aware that they are unlikely to receive such pledges, Ukrainian diplomats are proposing a compromise: that all nuclear powers, or at least Russia and the US, guarantee that they will not attack Ukraine with nuclear or conventional weapons. To date, western governments have been dismissive of Ukraine's efforts to create a special security arrangement, and have instead exerted pressure on Kiev to ratify Start 1. Lawrence Eagleburger, US secretary of state, has warned of a serious deterioration in bilateral relations if the treaty is not ratified. A year ago, when Ukraine was a fledgling state on the brink of independence, a complete renunciation of nuclear weapons might have been won in exchange for an earlier and more enthusiastic acceptance of Ukraine into the international community. Now, after receiving only grudging international recognition and no substantial financial aid, Ukraine has adopted a tougher stance in diplomatic negotiations. Pressure from the US to eliminate its nuclear weapons has antagonised many Ukrainian politicians. As a result, Mr Clinton, who will be responsible for the next round of disarmament talks, may find the going much harder in Kiev than his predecessor did in Moscow.</p>

Sayamov, Rostov-on-Don Scientific Research Antiplague  Institute; UDC 57.086.13:576.828]    [Abstract] The urgency of HIV research and the need to  develop reliable yet accessible methods of storing infected  cells, even HIV-producing cells, necessitated the development of  improved freezing conditions for HIV-infected or HIV-producing  cells, a study of their viability and the viral antigen  expression on the cell surface and during storage in liquid  nitrogen, and preservation of the representative morphology of  the newly forming viruses. To this end, the H-9/III-B inoculated  cell line infected with HIV-I (VICh) from Bulgaria cultivated as  a suspension in the RPMI-1640 medium (by Flow, U.K.) with a  15%  embryonic calf serum is used. The experimental procedure is  outlined. Glycerin and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were used as  cryoprotectors. The cell viability and HIV antigen expression  with various cryoprotectors at different freezing rates and the  cell viability and HIV antigen expression at various points  during storage are summarized, and the recovery dynamics of  virus-producing cells after cryopreservation are plotted. The  findings show that the frozen cell concentration does not affect  subsequent cell viability; single multinuclear cells which  disappeared after freezing, probably due to destruction, were  detected on the eighths and ninth day. A comparison reveals that  dimethylsulfoxide is less suitable for this conservation  procedure. The highest survivability of the H-9/III line  infected with HIV-I was observed after freezing in a 10%  glycerin solution at a 1C/min rate to a -70C  temperature with subsequent specimen placement in liquid  nitrogen. The cells maintained their original viability and  ability to express HIV antigen after an extended (12 months)  storage of cryopreserved samples in liquid nitrogen. The above  method makes it possible to preserve HIV isolates and  HIV-producers for an extended period in labs with a minimum set  of cryogenic devices.

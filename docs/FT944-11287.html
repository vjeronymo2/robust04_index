			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / UK Company News: New Tadpole PC will tap greater market Tadpole Technology, market leader in high performance notebook workstations, will announce today that it has developed the world's most powerful portable personal computer. The new machine will be available from the beginning of next year. It will give the Cambridge-based manufacturer access to a vastly greater market than its existing workstations, which are intended chiefly for scientists and engineers. Workstations are more powerful than PCs and are correspondingly more expensive. According to Mr George Grey, Tadpole chief executive, the P 1000 is likely to find a ready market among personal computer users with a need for substantial computing power on the move. He gives as examples three-dimensional modelling, multimedia demonstrations, data collection and real-time analysis. Tadpole's reputation rests on its ability to shoehorn complex computing electronics into notebook sized packages.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed K.G.B.: "Intrigues as Politics. What the </F> Kremlin Is Whispering About"]    [Text] There are three laws that define the "dogfight"  under the Kremlin carpet. In the first place, it is constantly  going on and never ceases even for a single hour. In the second  place, this refined battle consists of a number of bilateral  duels in which analytical notes, telephone calls, proximity to  Banana's (the Kremlin nickname for Yeltsin) aides, etc. are  used. Third, periodically they all gang up against one who is  bothering many of them and at whom the finger of the "leader"  (another nickname for the president) is pointed.    Yuriy Baturin, the president's aide for national security is  persistently intriguing against Oleg Labov, the secretary of the  Security Council. So successfully that a couple of weeks ago he  forced him to hastily hide in the hospital. But Baturin (the  Kremlin's nickname--Sour Cabbage Soup) and S. Filatov, who  supports him, miscalculated and underestimated the traditions of  the "Sverdlovsk grouping": The president and Labov communicated  in a friendly way for a long time on the eve of the meeting of  the Security Council last week.    Incidentally, at that same meeting of the Security Council  the president blew up at A. Kozyrev. "There is no Russian policy  regarding the Caucasus." And what about the other regions or  problems--is there a policy for them? The foreign affairs  minister turned pale. He had prepared to answer on the Yugoslav  crisis and managed to warn his deputy, V. Churkin, that he would  be the scapegoat. One can assume that of those present at the  meeting of the Security Council, the newly appointed Deputy  Prime Minister S. Shakhray would gloat the most. Because the  conflict in the Northern Caucasus was largely on his conscience.    Incidentally, observers doing time and motion studies of the  Kremlin intrigues are more and more frequently asking one  another this question: When will Shakhray "deny" Prime Minister  V. Chernomyrdin?    Recently S. Shakhray persuaded the prime minister to abandon  the idea of creating his own party and proposed his own PRUA  [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] "to rule and guide." S.  Shakhray had turned the ministry entrusted to him into a PRUA  staff headquarters. You cannot deny him the ability to speak  intelligently and significantly in the provinces, supposedly on  behalf of Yeltsin or Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, and get his own  people elected as deputies in the localities. Recently he  received another "trump card" from the prime minister: Credits  for Northern deliveries will go through the PRUA.    But observers find that S. Shakhray is "too frisky." Does he  want to turn the PRUA into the CPSU? But there is still the law  on de-party-ization held in reserve. The necessary people also  recall the strong hostility the deputy prime minister felt for  Viktor Polyanichko, who was still alive at the time. And they  also note S. Shakhray's desire to play on the disagreements  between the president and the prime minister. Observers are  inclined to think that eventually he will have to choose between  the two gentlemen.    Ultimately, even Yu. Luzhkov--that successful member of the  nomenklatura, steeled by swimming in ice holes on the coldest of  days, recently read with terror in an official communication:  "...acting mayor of the city of Moscow Yu. M. Luzhkov."    In the darkness of the political blind alley everyone tries  to kick the "acting mayor" harder. "Why stick your neck out? Did  you want to become president? Do you think that just because you  have money you can be impudent! We will show you the presidency!"    Yu. Luzhkov was denied access to the president's physical  presence. V. Chernomyrdin is confidently attacking "the acting  mayor." First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets, who also  "placed his bets" both on the prime minister and on Yu. Luzhkov  has begun to cautiously distance himself from the lover of the  ice holes. And they continue to whisper to the president: Yu.  Luzhkov and V. Pankratov, the chief of the Main Administration  of Internal Affairs of Moscow, as before, are mourning the early  demise of their close friend Otari Kvantrishvili. The president,  they say, is downcast and taps his pencil on the desk. And in  the Kremlin offices they are whispering: "Why does Luzhkov want  to move several domestic troop divisions from Yerin's command to  Pankratov's? To fight crime? Do not make me laugh, Ivan  Ivanovich...indeed...", smiles are stretching from ear to ear,  and even the excellent microphones cannot catch it.    Spring had a favorable effect on the president of the  Strategy Fund, G. Burbulis. Under the influence of the rays of  the sun Gennadiy Eduardovich again felt like a strategist and a  fighter. According to rumors, he calls V. Chernomyrdin "Viktor  Boozevich" and Ye. Gaydar, in his own words, he has "crossed off  his list for good," and he wants somehow to make B. Fedorov, a  member of the State Duma and former finance minister of the  Russian Federation, the leader of the younger generation of  "democrats." Who needs G. Burbulis today, observers ask  themselves; and they answer--S. Filatov.    Under the influence of the warm spring weather ties between  the radical democrat S. Filatov and the social democrat I.  Rybkin have become closer. The speaker of the State Duma, for  example, phones the leader of the president's administration:  "OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachment] representatives are  coming to us here at the Duma from various parts of the country  and demanding that we adopt a law on the inadmissibility of  using the OMON against the people." "But you have more important  draft laws" comes the answer. "And that is right," answers the  speaker.    ...Sun, warmth, spring. Last year's leaves and illusions are  burning. Green grass and new intrigues are ripening.</p>

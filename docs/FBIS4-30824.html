			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman of </F> the Hungarian Socialist Party, by Henrik Hammang; place and date  not given: "There Is No Overwinning Involved Here"]    [Text] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] won the 1994  elections with a landslide victory and obtained more than half  of the parliamentary mandates. After the elections, MSZP Deputy  Executive Chairman Imre Szekeres gave us an interview about the  party's election successes and short-term concepts.    [Hammang] In view of the results, in your opinion, has the  MSZP overwon itself or it has simply carried its best form?    [Szekeres] It is very difficult to answer this question. We  repeatedly said that it is difficult to determine the concept of  overwinning [tulgyozes]. If the voters thought to vote for the  MSZP or its individual candidate, naturally this is a great  pleasure for us and, in my opinion, the 270,000 extra votes  compared to the first round of elections and the total of close  to 2 million votes show a serious confidence in the MSZP. This  support shows that everything that we thought about the country,  the tasks, and the people's needs in the past four years was  right.    [Hammang] After the first round, the public thought that  only the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] was capable of  forcing the MSZP back regarding the individual candidates and  thus creating a proper balance in the next parliament. As shown  by the results, the SZDSZ failed to achieve this. On the  contrary: The well-known SZDSZ candidates failed to obtain a  single mandate in Budapest, for example; only the MSZP and the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] were able to do that. In your  opinion, what is the reason behind this?    [Szekeres] I think that they put the question wrongly and  also answered it wrongly. The MSZP behaved very politely  between the two rounds and argued very calmly that the  opposition should represent the balance against a government  coalition, but this is not needed within a government. Given  the results, the citizens also thought so. The results of the  second round clearly proved that no negative campaign whatsoever  leads to results in Hungary. If the SZDSZ had formulated its  campaign differently -- saying that it knew the situation better  or that its candidates were better than the candidates of other  parties -- they would have achieved better results.    [Hammang] At its upcoming congress on 4 June, the MSZP will  determine the party's candidate for the position of prime  minister. Will the coalition talks start already this week, or  will you only be preparing them until the upcoming MSZP congress?    [Szekeres] Our plan is unchanged: The congress will decide  on the two major issues on 4 June. The two issues are: With  which parties we should start coalition talks, and who should be  the MSZP's candidate for the position of prime minister? This  agenda will not change and I think every party needs to evaluate  the election results and to consider the situation.    [Hammang] It has been said that, regarding the coalition  possibilities, you are open to every democratic party. However,  it has also been said that, along with the most probable  partner, the SZDSZ, the MSZP only considers parties that did not  compromise themselves with their participation in the losing  coalition. In addition, in view of the considerable differences  between the ideas of the MSZP and the Independent Smallholders  Party [FKGP], only the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]  remains as a possible coalition party among the six parties.    [Szekeres] We must consider several things in this respect.  One of them is the need to find out which party program can be  adjusted to the MSZP concepts. It is also an important factor  to find out who thought in terms of different government policy  than the one prevailing so far. In this respect, we can  consider the SZDSZ and the Fidesz. I would regard this as a  starting point. Theoretically, we cannot exclude the cooperation  of all the three political poles in a government either.  Cooperation with the Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP], the only force to be considered in this respect, is only  possible after the necessary political changes. Naturally, all  these are only theoretical possibilities.    In the course of coalition talks, it is essential that the  composition of Hungary's next government should not be  determined by party or individual interests. The people have  lost their patience and the current situation is quite  difficult, so it is very important to create a stable government  that is able to function.    [Hammang] We learned that several SZDSZ leaders think that,  given the 54-percent parliamentary majority of the MSZP, there  is no longer need for a coalition.    [Szekeres] The best thing for the SZDSZ is also to wait for  the coalition talks and then decide on possible cooperation.  All the more so because the SZDSZ is also obliged by the  elections in a certain respect, at least in the sense that the  SZDSZ was speaking about a different government in the past  years and, in their view, they have an adequate program for  this. All this could be implemented in a coalition government.  This 54-percent magic totally contradicts the elementary logic  of an attitude toward a consensus. I say that we should sit  down and talk, and then think about each other's percentage.    [Hammang] At his late-night news conference, MSZP Chairman  Gyula Horn said that the MSZP will be able to solve the problems  and will take short-term measures that will lead to improvement.  Are there really possibilities for this?    [Szekeres] It is very important that Gyula Horn made these  promises after the elections, rather than before the elections;  in other words, the citizens did not vote for the MSZP because  of these promises. Gyula Horn and those who are engaged in  politics in a responsible way in Hungary think that changes must  be made in the people's situation. There are things that do not  cost money and nevertheless can lead to considerable changes,  like the style or the government's attitude toward the people.  In addition, some ideas can also be implemented under the  current financial conditions. Naturally, issues that imply  considerable expenses can only be solved in the long term.</p>

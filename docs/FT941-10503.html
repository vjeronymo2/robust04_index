			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Observer: Crossing de Cuellar Even former United Nations secretaries-general are no longer treated with respect. Javier Perez de Cuellar - whose cv boasts more than 30 honorary degrees and 'the highest decorations of nearly 40 countries' - was to be found in London yesterday giving an impassioned talk about the importance of democracy to the Anglo-Peruvian society. 'I am 100 per cent a democrat and think that all problems can be solved by democracy,' opined de Cuellar. 'Oh yeah,' piped up a Colombian scribbler, somewhat peeved when the great man pooh-poohed the notion of solving the international drugs problem by legalising the trafficking of narcotics. 'We have a long-established democracy in Colombia and we haven't solved all these problems,' she averred.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Food: Shoppers go for a wholesome option / A look at US wholefood 'PLEASE, Mommy, can I have a rice cake?' The cry echoes down the wide, pristine aisles of the Bread and Circus Whole Foods supermarket in Hadley, Massachusetts. Other shoppers smile benignly - naturally, kids are welcome at Bread and Circus. The store even provides miniature shopping carts so that kiddies can pretend-shop while Mom and Dad do the real thing. The detail is typical of the family-oriented, wholesome philosophy behind Bread and Circus, and similar temples of healthy consumerism popping up in suburbs throughout the US - Mrs Gooch's in Los Angeles, Fresh Fields in Washington DC, Whole Foods in Texas and the San Francisco Area, and Alfalfa's in Denver. The wholefoods supermarket trend combines the current national obsessions with health and fitness, food safety, and ecological correctness, with the familiar, self-indulgent pleasure of that most American of entertainments - shopping. Bread and Circus operates six stores in Massachusetts and Rhode Island and is the undisputed industry leader, according to Chris Kilham, whose Massachusetts-based Cowboy Marketing provides consulting services to natural foods and natural products companies. 'Bread and Circus standards of product purity and customer satisfaction are the best in the business,' says Kilham. For anyone who's spent a Saturday afternoon fighting for the last packet of frozen peas in a narrow aisle at a UK supermarket, shopping at Bread and Circus is no less than a revelation. Passing time in the Hadley store is as soothing as new age music. The store is uncrowded, the shelves fully stocked, the produce-section bursting with bright, beautiful fruits and vegetables. Bread and Circus offers naturally-raised meats, a fresh fish counter, wholesome prepared, packaged, and frozen foods, as well as cruelty-free health care products, a florist, and nutrition department. Fresh-scrubbed young people working behind the bakery counter cheerfully interrupt their discussion about multicultural college curriculi to recite the ingredients of any of the baked goods on offer. The friendly woman with short grey hair in the dairy section offers samples of Bread and Circus' impressive array of cheeses, and in the cooking demonstration area, tutoring is available in the preparation of wholefoods breakfasts of kasha and yogurt. If all this leaves the shopper weak-kneed and hungry, there's the Bread and Circus in-store cafe, with an ambiance so pleasant that locals go there even when they're not shopping to sip cappucino and nibble on whole-grain muffins. Bread and Circus even provides reading material to browse through during breakincluding A Guide to the Benefits of Fiber and Every Day Ways to Greener Living are available from the nutritional and educational consumer information section, and the book department prominently displays The Bread and Circus Wholefood Bible. Shopping at Bread and Circus is an education for those who think wholefoods eating means a no-fun diet. The wholefoods movement sprung more from concern for safe food than healthful food: what you get at Bread and Circus will not poison you, but it will not necessarily make you thin, either. Its cheeses may be only the purest available, but triple cream brie is triple cream brie, and the gooey rolls and cakes in the bakery, even if they are baked with whole-wheat flour, add the same inches as their conventionally-prepared counterparts. Natural foods supermarkets thrive in affluent and educated suburbs; a whopping 80 per cent of Bread and Circus' customers have college degrees. Shopping at natural foods supermarkets costs, on average, 20 per cent more than at conventional supermarkets, but experts and shoppers agree that natural foods supermarketing requires a reconsideration of the notion of value. A whole-grain loaf may cost more than an equivalent amount of white' bread, but that money buys better-quality food that improves the consumer's health. As the Bread and Circus promotional literature puts it: 'Comparing the price of our wholefoods with the prices of conventional foods is like comparing apples with oranges.' The story behind Bread and Circus has been, until recently, archetypical of the trade: the store's founders, Anthony and Caroline Hartnett, are natural foods enthusiasts who still run the privately-owned company. Anthony Hartnett, born in County Clare, Ireland, became interested in natural foods by reading an article about macrobiotic cuisine in the London Evening Standard; his Louisianian wife is a macrobiotic chef. They opened Green Acres, the first natural foods store in Dublin, Ireland, in 1972, before they came back to the States to open the first Bread and Circus in 1975. Bread and Circus is now the largest wholefoods retailer on the East Coast, with annual sales exceeding Dollars 55m and over 650 employees. Similarly, Sandy Gooch founded Mrs Gooch's Natural Foods Markets in 1977 when she discovered that it was nearly impossible to find wholefoods in the Los Angeles area. Mrs Gooch's is now a seven-store chain that takes in over Dollars 85m a year and employs 800 staff. Mrs Gooch's wholefoods doctrine is even stricter than Bread and Circus's allowing no chocolate, caffeine, or alcohol. A concept this timely could not stay in the family for long. 1991 saw the opening of Fresh Fields, the first wholefoods supermarket chain founded not by natural foods zealots but by businessmen, including Leo Krahn, the 75-year-old founder of the Staples Dollars 340m cut-rate office products chain. Purists scoff at Fresh Fields' unideological stance and lax standards, but their stores are doing well, further encouraging natural foods marketing into the American mainstream.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- Some 2,000 villagers  in the northeastern district of Hong Kong's New Territories on  17 April staged a rally, strongly condemning the British Hong  Kong authorities' support for amending the draft of the "New  Territories Land (Exemption) Regulations" in an attempt to  divide up the people of Hong Kong and to induce social  instability in New Territories.    In a speech at the rally, Liu Huangfa, chairman of the New  Territories Township Council, said: With only three or more  years left before China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over  Hong Kong, the customs and habits and traditional rights and  interests of the original inhabitants of New Territories are  being brutally trampled upon. What is worse is that the British  Hong Kong authorities, intending to break the promise made when  they leased New Territories, have suddenly rendered support to  some council members' motion to amend the draft of the "New  Territories Land (Exemption) Regulations." He said: "We are  justified to believe that quarters concerned are carrying out a  major scheme aimed at destroying the traditions of the New  Territories, depriving the original inhabitants of their rights  and interests, and dividing up the people of Hong Kong."    Chairmen of the seven township councils in the northeastern  district, as well as many villagers, including women, and former  inhabitants of the New Territories who have taken up residence  abroad, spoke at the rally, supporting the New Territories  Township Council's action to protect the original inhabitants'  lawful rights and interests. A female college student denounced  some Legislative Council members for making statements that  smear the image of original female inhabitants of the New  Territories. According to her, the majority of the original  female inhabitants, who do not care much about the family assets  of their father's generation, hold a harmonious and ethical  society more important than material interests.    After the rally, villagers proceeded to Fengji Township to  pay tribute to martyrs who died while resisting British troops  96 years ago. In 1898 when British colonialists wanted to  forcibly lease New Territories after occupying Hong Kong, more  than 100,000 people of the 423 New Territories villages staged  valiant resistance and many died heroically. In April 1899 when  British troops took over the New Territories, the masses  bombarded British barracks and were brutally suppressed. Some  200 villagers sacrificed their lives.</p>

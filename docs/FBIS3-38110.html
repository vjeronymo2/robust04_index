			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene by Martine </F> Dubuisson, Thierry Evens, and Jean-Pierre Stroobants; place and  date not given: "Agusta, One More Reason To Last"--first  paragraph is LE SOIR introduction]    [Text] The Agusta scandal has occupied the front of the  political stage for several weeks. It has threatened directly  the government. The prime minister now clearly wants to revive  the mechanism of a reshuffled team, not by refusing to forget  the "scandal" but by trying to show that ministerial work must  continue.    [Dehaene] With regard to the Agusta scandal, it is a good  thing that matters have been clarified by drawing a distinction  between government policy and the handling of "scandals." And  that those whose names have been mentioned should be free to  defend themselves. I do not want to trivialize these events.  This issue must be cleared up, like the Andre Cools murder, and  any other scandal which breaks out in the future. I therefore  insist that the legal authorities be allowed to act, according  to their rules, on this issue and on any others that arise.    [LE SOIR] The Agusta scandal has shown the need for some  reforms. Will you propose them?    [Dehaene] Discussions were already under way on party  funding, the limitation of election spending, ensuring the  objectivity of nominations, or the establishment of an ombudsman  in public enterprises or Parliament. What has happened has  served as a catalyst.    The issues on which parliamentary groups and parties will  have to take the initiative -- namely immunity, the status of  deputies, and funding -- should be distinguished from those  which relate to the state apparatus and are the government's  responsibility: ministerial responsibility, the control of  public appropriations, recruitment and promotion in the  magistrature and civil service.    [LE SOIR] Are you not afraid that other scandals will  emerge,  as they have in Italy?    [Dehaene] First, let us not make too hasty a comparison with  Italy. Second, if other scandals emerge, they will have to be  clarified. Third, if they are the result of vengeance, that is  dangerous.    [LE SOIR] Do you share the view of those who talk of  different ethics in the north and the south? Those who think  that the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party] is a sicker party  than the others?    [Dehaene] Public opinions and voters are different. The  parties, politicians, and media often reflect that. That may  create different sensitivities. But I do not think there are  fundamentally opposite approaches. In other, previous cases,  questions were asked, in the north and the south, about the  resignation of certain people....    [LE SOIR] What do you think of the defense adopted by Guy  Coeme?    [Dehaene] I will not express an opinion or a judgment on the  aspect of this case under jurisdiction.    [LE SOIR] Guy Coeme has criticized the "excessive media  coverage" and "over-politicization" of the issue. Do you agree?    [Dehaene] The system of parliamentary immunity and Article  90  must be reviewed because, in view of the media coverage, what  was originally a protection has turned into a system under which  the politician is tried twice. It is up to Parliament to draw  the necessary conclusions.    [LE SOIR] Nonetheless you called for the creation of a  financial, social, and fiscal status for the deputy....    [Dehaene] It is one thing to say what is a desirable reform.  Giving a verdict on how to implement it is a different matter.  As a deputy, I will say what I think about it within my party.  But that is not the prime minister's role.    [LE SOIR] At one time, the PS said that you too had met  with Agusta envoys. Did that annoy you?    [Dehaene] I note that, susequently Mr. Spitaels issued a  communique explaining that he had not intended to implicate  other people. As for the decision on the Agusta issue, I  participated in it as a government member. I have shouldered my  responsibilities. At the time there were contacts between the  different candidates and my office. A distinction must be drawn  between the licit and illicit aspects of the issue.    I have been involved in other cases of public  appropriations:  At the time of the RTT [Telegraph and Telephone Administration]  contract, we were subjected to lobbying from all sides. The  RTT's interests seemed secondary to the effects on Flanders or  Wallonia. I therefore say that the issue of appropriations  should be dealt with according to the principle of the best  relationship between quality and price and not in accordance  with which enterprises need investments. Indirect compensation,  which is often dubious, must therefore be abandoned. On the  other hand, direct compensation can be useful if it does not  affect the price.    [LE SOIR] Last week, did you pass on the view of the CVP  [Christian People's Party] deputies who thought that Guy Coeme  should resign? Did you take that action?    [Dehaene] I am abiding strictly by the reply I gave in  Parliament, each word of which was carefully considered.    [LE SOIR] Coeme says that his resignation was a personal  decision. But it came several hours after a conversation which  you had with the PS president. Was that meeting not the  decisive factor?    [Dehaene] No.    [LE SOIR] Has the government now been weakened?    [Dehaene] It is a good thing for the government program that  the PS has appointed new ministers. But I certainly do not rule  out the fact that the process of the Agusta scandal or the  emergence of other issues could have an influence on the  government or the pursuit of its policy at a given time. At  present, the two spheres are clearly separate. During my  meeting with the presidents of the majority parties, all clearly  expressed their desire to see this issue resolved and their  desire to pursue government action until the end of the  parliamentary term.    [LE SOIR] Do you agree with Gerard Deprez? He does not rule  out the possibility of the government's unity being undermined?    [Dehaene] His remarks speak for themselves! It is one thing  to say: For the time being matters have been clarified and the  government is in a good position to pursue its policy; saying  that the development of the Agusta scandal or the emergence of  other scandals will have no influence on the coalition is a  different matter. You would have to be naive to think that!    [LE SOIR] Was it necessary to give guarantees to the PS for  it to remain in power?    [Dehaene] No. Not other than to express our determination to  carry on to the end of the parliamentary term, which is natural.  Philippe Busquin clearly took account of the other parties'  desire to complete the parliamentary term. Moreover, this is in  the interests of the PS and the other parties, because the  government had a threefold objective: The reform of the state  virtually has been completed, the overall plan has been drawn up  and must be implemented in all its dimensions, and, finally, the  contract with the citizen must be highlighted and given greater  prominence and this implies reforms which take longer. After  two years of preparatory work in several spheres, we can adopt  bills and start to implement them on the ground.    [LE SOIR] The Flemish liberals continue to level very harsh  criticisms at you. What is your answer to them?    [Dehaene] Those who think they will extricate themselves by  exploiting the antipolitical climate are merely strengthening  that phenomenon.</p>

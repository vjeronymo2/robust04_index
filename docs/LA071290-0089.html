			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING;  </P> <P> ANGLER HAS SUCCESSFUL NINE-DAY TRIP TO BAJA  </P> <P> A recent long-range fishing trip to Baja was a dream come true for Marc Larson  of San Pedro.  </P> <P> Larson, 22, started fishing with his father in the surf off Long Beach at 5 and  has been hooked ever since. He spends all his free time fishing from barges,  day boats and float tubes in the ocean.  </P> <P> Last month, Larson left for a nine-day trip aboard the 125-foot Royal Polairs.  After traveling for two days, the first stop was Thetis bank.  </P> <P> Larson said yellowtail blanketed the water.  </P> <P> When word came over the speaker to cast the lines, Larson tossed a jig at the  yellowtail and came up with a 50-pound fish on his first hook-up.  </P> <P> Each of the 33 anglers aboard the Royal Polairs caught a fish weighing more  than 35 pounds.  </P> <P> After two days at Thetis bank, the boat headed to Cedrus where Larson said he  caught some of the largest calico bass he had ever seen.  </P> <P> Although he failed to win any jackpots, he did manage to net his first dorado,  which he brought home to have stuffed.  </P> <P> Royal Polairs' total catch for the trip was 890 yellowtail, 300 calico bass and  a few dorado and amberjack.  </P> <P> Now that Larson has fulfilled one of his childhood dreams, he has set a new  goal -- tuna fishing on a 15-day trip.  </P> <P> On Sunday, 15 boats from the King Harbor Marlin Club participated in an annual  shark tournament.  </P> <P> Bob Stephens, fishing from his boat Exta Sea, took first-place honors with a  20-6 mako shark. Second place went to Don Haynes, who caught a 15-6 mako  fishing from his boat the Fisherett.  </P> <P> Sonny Bennette of Marina del Rey, fishing aboard his boat Sand Crab at Venice  reef, used pieces of crab and a halibut rig to catch four halibut weighing a  total of 67 pounds.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Russell Nakamoto of Gardena, fishing aboard the Reel Special  at rocky point, caught a 42 1/2-pound white sea bass, the whopper of the week.  </P> <P> Ken Helm of Lawndale, fishing aboard the Monte Carlo at horseshoe kelp, caught  a 32-pound halibut. Bob Sumiyoshi of Gardena, also fishing aboard the Monte  Carlo at horseshoe kelp, caught a 25-pound halibut.  </P> <P> John Kuljis of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Toronado off Catalina Island,  caught an 18 1/2-pound white sea bass.  </P> <P> Abe Gross of Wilmington, fishing aboard the Matt Walsh at the rock pile, caught  a 14-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Fish Reports: The sand bass continue to bite in all areas of sandy beaches.  Catalina barracuda fishing remains steady, but yellowtail bites are slowing.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the bay and returned with a  catch of 320 sand bass, four halibut and a bonito.  </P> <P> The Betty O rock cod trip resulted in a catch of 290 rock cod, two lingcod and  a cow cod.  </P> <P> The Sumo fished the Venice reef area and had a variety catch of 85 calico bass,  84 sand bass, 25 rockfish, six sculpin, six cabazon and a lingcod.  </P> <P> The Happyman, on a half-day trip, returned with 40 sand bass, 10 calico bass,  six barracuda and two bonito.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: The Seaspray worked the flats on a twilight trip and  returned with 511 sand bass, 18 bonito, four barracuda and four halibut.  </P> <P> The City of Redondo, on a half-day trip, returned with 180 sand bass and two  barracuda.  </P> <P> Anglers aboard the Barge Isle of Redondo caught 7,053 mackerel, 203 bonito, 66  rockfish, 59 barracuda and five sand bass.  </P> <P> At 22nd Street Landing: The Firststring, fishing off Catalina, caught 148  barracuda and 62 bonito.  </P> <P> The Monte Carlo half-day trip resulted in a catch of 132 sand bass and 62  bonito.  </P> <P> At L.A.

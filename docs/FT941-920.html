			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Business Travel: How five Bs drive a harder bargain - The way European companies use travel agents is changing Mr Richard Lovell, head of Wagonlit Travel in northern Europe, remembers the conversations he used to have with potential clients six years ago. 'They'd say: 'You're a pretty good agency, you've got a good reputation, another percentage point off your quote will get you the business,' ' he recalls. Today, Mr Lovell says, business travel agencies bidding for new contracts are routinely asked to submit proposals more than 100 pages long. Mr Bill Kirkwood, travel management sales and marketing director at Thomas Cook, says his company recently concluded a contract with the Swiss Bank Corporation. The negotiations lasted three months. Five years ago, he says, they would have taken 10 days. Travel agents say European companies are radically changing the way they manage business travel. Mr Lovell says the revolution began in the UK - for two reasons. The first was that the recession and the drive for cost-cutting struck Britain before it affected the rest of Europe. The second was that trends from the US, where hard-nosed travel purchasing is well-established, usually take root in the UK more quickly than elsewhere in Europe. The same trends are now appearing in other European countries too. The first thing travel agents noticed was that they were negotiating with different people. They used to deal with a company's travel manager. Increasingly, they found themselves being interviewed by the head of procurement: the person buying airline tickets and hotel rooms tended to be the same manager who purchased the company's electricity and cars, says Mr Lovell. Mr Kirkwood says that, in some companies, the finance director or the head of human resources began to negotiate travel contracts. Travel managers have not disappeared from all companies, he says. Where they survive, however, they usually work more closely with senior directors. Mr Lovell says a new feature of the UK market is the appearance of travel consultants, who help companies negotiate their contracts. Frequently, the consultants are travel managers who have been made redundant. Still a rare breed in the UK, travel consultants are common in the US, he says. The information companies require from travel agents has changed too. In their 100-page documents, travel agents are expected to describe the structure of their own company - who owns it and what its financial strengths are. Companies want to know where travel agents have their branches and whether these are conveniently located for the client's own offices and factories. Travel agents are asked to provide some sample quotes on airlines and hotels. They are asked to say who their other clients are. Mr Kirkwood says companies prefer travel agents to have clients of a similar size and status to themselves, so that they can establish performance and expenditure benchmarks. Travel agents are required to provide references from other clients. They are also asked to provide details about their own staff, often from the chief executive downwards. Mr Lovell says companies sometimes ask if travel agents can help staff with their leisure travel. How does this compare with a few years ago? 'A few years ago, you'd exchange a few letters,' Mr Lovell says. Mr Kirkwood says that while companies demand constant reductions in the cost of their business travel, they have begun to realise they cannot continually ask agents to pass on a growing part of their commissions to customers. Instead, increasingly they offer agents a proportion of the savings they make. He says: 'The typical commission on a Pounds 100 airline ticket is Pounds 9. Instead of asking for more of that commission, they're saying: 'Reduce the Pounds 91.' ' Mr Kirkwood says travel agents have to develop strategies to ensure they can communicate with all relevant staff on the client's premises and not just those at the top. Thomas Cook calls the most important employees 'the five Bs': the buyer of travel, who makes the principal decisions; the booker, who makes travel arrangements; the business traveller; the budget-holder, who controls the traveller's expenditure; and the back-office staff, who make the payments. He says he expects corporate travel policy to evolve further in the next few years. Airline deregulation means there are far too many special deals on offer for companies to keep track of them all. Hotels will go the same way, Mr Kirkwood believes: instead of having just an official rate and a corporate discount, hotels are increasingly quoting a range of prices aimed at ensuring they make the best use of their rooms. Instead of companies specifying which class staff must fly and which carrier and type of hotel they should use, he believes they will tell employees they can spend a certain sum on each trip. It will then be up to the staff to sort out the most convenient route and hotel with the company's travel agent.</p>

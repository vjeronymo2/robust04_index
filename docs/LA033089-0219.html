			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MITSUBISHI GETS FSX JET CONTRACT  </P> <P> The Japanese government today awarded an $81-million contract to Mitsubishi  Heavy Industries to design the FSX fighter plane, going ahead despite a lack of  agreement with Washington on the controversial plan.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Defense Agency said the signing took place just one day  before the end of Japan's budget year, which allows it to spend money allocated  for the project in this year's government budget.  </P> <P> Mitsubishi Heavy, prime contractor for the project, won a contract that  includes groundwork for a design based on the U.S.-built F-16 warplane, said  the spokesman for the agency, the equivalent of the Pentagon.  </P></p>

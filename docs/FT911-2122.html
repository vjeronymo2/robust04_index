			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Observer: Re-run Who was the bright spark at Samuel Montagu, financial adviser to the Pounds 245m Mirror Group Newspapers float, who decided at the last minute to reduce the size of the limited circulation pathfinder prospectus because it would make the mailing easier? Had it not been for Robert Maxwell's eagle eye for detail yesterday's final version might not have emerged in its full tabloid-sized splendour. Widespread expectations that the pathfinder version would be produced in similar Mirror newspaper-style were dashed earlier this month when the document returned from the printers in ordinary A4 dimensions. It is said that Cap'n Bob was infuriated when he saw the change, chiefly because it made the text, arranged in newspaper-like columns, extremely hard to read. The order went out to print off extra copies in full tabloid size. Yesterday's final version, with the MGN titles emblazoned across the cover, was exactly as he wanted to see it. So no one can accuse him of trying to conceal something nasty in the small print.</p>

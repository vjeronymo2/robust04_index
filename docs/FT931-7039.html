			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Arts: Royal Liverpool Philharmonic/Kempf - Concert The controversy over the return to favour of examinations in the government's education policy has been a reminder of how difficult it is to evaluate the performance of students in any subject area. Competitions, in particular, cause heated debate in musical circles, especially when they pit one instrument against another, as does the BBC's Young Musician of the Year. It has always seemed to me that the pianist there enjoys an unfair advantage. The concerto repertoire is so much wider; the virtuoso opportunities so eye-catching, if the competitor chooses a big, romantic piece. Frederick Kempf (born 1977) won last year playing Rakhmaninov, but in his case it would be difficult to argue against his first place. Kempf did not play like a child prodigy. He sounded a genuine musician, who just happens still to be young. For his Barbican concert on Monday, with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, he chose Rakhmaninov again: the Third Piano Concerto. It was an ambitious undertaking, for the concerto is hard work for young fingers. Much of the first movement seemed to be sensitively played, but it was underprojected, leaving the orchestra to lead the way. His energies, however, were being conserved. The cadenza brought determination into play; the lead out of it was magical, the scale of the playing suddenly better judged. All of the slow movement had a fine, impulsive lyricism and the finale scampered off towards a scintillating finish at a pace that the conductor, Libor Pesek, had no intention of allowing. For all that, Kempf showed that he has a real interpretation of this concerto in the making. If Pesek kept his young soloist rather sternly in check, he was correspondingly lax with the orchestra during the opening movements of Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique. Ensemble was not sharp, nor were the textures very clear. The best playing came in the final witches' sabbath, where the forward drive at last started to make the flesh tingle a bit: the bells, tolling noisily out from on high, really did sound like an invitation to hell.</p>

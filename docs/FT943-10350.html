			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Kleinwort Benson If the recent weakness of merchant bank shares was due solely to worries about the prospects for dealing profits Kleinwort Benson's figures provided little reassurance. Net dealing income was down by more than half in the first six months after a very sticky second quarter. While the fall was cushioned somewhat by lower bonuses to staff, it was asking a lot for the fee earning businesses to make up the difference. But they did so with room to spare. Fund management profits have suddenly shifted into a higher gear, thanks partly to a quick payback from its expansion in the US, and though they remain modest by the standards of SG Warburg or Schroders, they now account for more than 40 per cent of group profits. Kleinwort shows there is still good money to be made selling European stocks into the American market and its investment in international equities in general is being well rewarded. The mergers and acquisitions business is also having a good run and while the gravy train of international privatisations will not keep rolling for ever Kleinwort's experience in Argentina shows that they can be an excellent entree into that country's private sector. Perhaps most encouraging of all, the bank says the proportion of new mandates it is winning has never been higher. Given the improved quality of its earnings and abundance of capital Kleinwort could well decide to step up the pace of dividend growth. Yet the shares now yield over 4.8 per cent and the 30 per cent discount to Warburg looks increasingly difficult to justify.</p>

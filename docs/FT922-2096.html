			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mirror cracks as the Left regards its voters - A look at the fallout from a fourth election defeat THE tedious, acrimonious and wholly irrelevant row over who exactly was responsible for what during Labour's election campaign is acting like a lorry load of sand delivered to the party's Walworth Road headquarters. As the 32-member national executive committee gathers to conduct its election post mortem today, there is every danger that it will take the ostrich option and bury its head in it. At the centre of the row is the role played by Labour's Shadow Communications Agency - its polling, advertising and image-making arm - and other sundry political advisers drafted in for the campaign. As the game of pass the parcel has speeded up, a leaked report by Mr Jim Parish, a key organiser, has attributed many of the failures of the campaign to the 'wholesale takeover' of day-to-day strategy by this unelected inner-core group. That the SCA, headed by Mr Phillip Gould, and others such as Ms Patricia Hewitt, a former Kinnock aide, played a central role in the conduct of election is indisputable. It is arguable, too, that the more worldly experience of professional politicians might have been brought more heavily to bear. But all that does not mesh well with the conclusion of party workers on the morning of April 9 that Labour had surpassed even its 1987 effort and fought its best campaign ever. To his credit, Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, has been scrupulous in refusing to join the search for scapegoats. His official report eschews all buck-passing and tells a more convincing story. Far more significant than the role of the SCA, the Jennifer's Ear affair, the Sheffield rally or Mr John Smith's tax plans was the 'general distrust' felt by voters of the party and its leadership. The report goes on to show an extraordinary haemorraging of support for Labour in the last few days of the campaign. On the important 'economic competence' question, for example, Labour saw its position slip from about even with the Conservatives to an 18 percentage point deficit in the last three days alone. A post-election, qualitative survey of 'swing' voter groups appears to have borne that out. Its findings were that Labour was regarded as old-fashioned, tied to the past, and unduly linked to minority interests, not least the trade unions. But as this research was conducted by the widely disparaged SCA, some NEC members, such as Ms Clare Short MP, have cast doubt on its veracity. 'They would say that, wouldn't they,' she commented on Tuesday. Yet other senior party figures also broadly subscribe to Mr Whitty's alarming view that it is the product itself - not the promotional glitz - that remains Labour's core problem. Mr David Hill, the party's communications chief, in his own paper to the NEC agrees with Mr Neil Kinnock himself that it is the historical baggage left over from the 1970s and 1980s that continues to undermine Labour's election chances. Many new Labour MPs concur that it is indeed that public image - Labour's very identity - that is the central question. In a cogent newspaper article this month, Mr Tony Wright, MP for Cannock, has said that the party must now tackle the traditional no-go areas. It must dump its 'ancestral commitment to a publicly owned economy', acknowledge a new European social democratic identity and confront head-on a wholesale reform of its constitution. However, he appears dubious as to whether that is really achievable. 'In a remarkable transformation,' he wrote, 'as the Conservatives have acquired a radical identity, so Labour has become the conservative party.' Today's NEC's inquest coincides with the publication of the first comprehensive study of Labour's activists. To the surprise of some, this analysis of more than 5,000 party members has found some remarkable disparities between Labour members and voters. Of the former, for example, some 75 per cent are owner-occupiers and nearly half are designated of the 'salariat' - against 14 per cent of Labour voters  -with just 26 described as working class (57). Similarly, there is clear confirmation that the party's vanguard stands well to the left of Labour voters on a number of important issues. On public ownership, some 71 per cent of members believe in more nationalisation, against 38 per cent of Labour voters. If, as the authors Mr Patrick Seyd and Mr Paul Whiteley conclude, the membership is 'socially unrepresentative' of Labour voters in significant ways, how much more are its views politically unrepresentative of the country as a whole? Both Mr Whitty's and Mr Wright's analyses appear tacitly to acknowledge, if not publicly endorse, the voters' perception of the party as both outdated and out of touch. There are no guarantees the predominately salaried, middle-aged, home-owning and male arch-activists meeting today on the NEC will agree. With Labour's leadership election firmly focused on party members as opposed to the voters' at large, a radical debate has been shut down and old prejudices reinforced - at least until the contest's conclusion on July 18. As Mr Bryan Gould, candidate for both leader and deputy leader, put it in a bitter speech this week, Labour's election inquest is in danger of becoming 'hunt the scapegoat'. 'If winning inner party elections becomes more important than devising ways of winning general elections,' he said, 'Labour is in deep trouble.' The danger is that to win the former, candidates must make their pitch to an electorate whose views bear little relation to those of the voters' at large.

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the Agriculture Ministry, more than  138,100 hectares of dry-season rice, or over 86 percent of the  planned target, has been planted nationwide by 4 April.  Outstanding provinces and cities in the planting effort  included Takeo, Kandal, Prey Veng, and Kompong Cham Provinces.    The report also said that during this 1993-1994 dry season,  our peasants planted 7,900 hectares of rice fewer than in the  previous year. Many factors, such as [words indistinct] and  late and prolonged harvest of rainy-season rice, delayed this  year's dry-season rice planting.    During the same period, over 50,000 hectares of dry-season  rice were harvested nationwide and the average yield was about  two metric tons per hectare.</p>

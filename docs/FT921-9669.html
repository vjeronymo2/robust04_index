			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Chinese Estates investors vote for Evergo bid SHAREHOLDERS of Chinese Estates, the Hong Kong property concern, have approved a bid by Evergo International, the main corporate vehicle of the colony's controversial corporate raider, Mr Joseph Lau, to buy the 50.4 per cent it does not already hold, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Mr Lau told an extraordinary shareholders meeting that 1.37bn shares had been voted in favour of Evergo taking Chinese Estates private and 75m against. Trade in both companies was suspended. However, a group of minority shareholders was unhappy with the vote and marched to the colony's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to complain. The SFC would not give details, but said the complaints would be investigated. A shareholder source said the group had protested that proceedings at the general meeting had been unfair.</p>

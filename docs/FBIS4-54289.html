			<p>-- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY  <F P=103> OW2705031094 </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 27 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata commented on the issue  of Japan's acquiring reconnaissance satellites at the House of  Representatives Budget Committee on 26 May. He said, "It is  time to consider how far this can be done for information  gathering, and to think of what to do," in response to a  question from Wataru Hiraizumi (Liberal Democratic Party). This  remark of the prime minister, which indicated he does not  discount such a possibility, is bound to trigger a debate in  relation to an existing Diet resolution on the "peaceful use of  outer space."    Hiraizumi interpellated Hata on security issues in relation  with the situation on the Korean peninsula. He asked if Japan  should acquire reconnaissance satellites to strengthen its  capability to gather and analyze information. Hata responded,  "It is important to possess accurate information to ensure  security. However, satellites have to do with flying over other  countries' territories, which is a controversial question. That  is why there has been little progress." This indicated that the  issue is indeed being examined.    At present, for analytical purposes, Japan purchases from  the  United States photographs taken by meteorological satellites.  However, such photographs have much lower definition than  photographs from reconnaissance satellites. For this reason,  officials of the Defense Agency have been asking for Japan's own  reconnaissance satellites.    However, the Foreign Ministry is concerned about the impact  of this on neighboring countries. The United States is also  asking Japan to participate in the Theater Missile Defense (TMD)  program. Some ministry officials are of the opinion that owning  such satellites "is not good for Japan-U.S. economic relations."    In May 1969, the Diet adopted a resolution stipulating that  "objects launched into outer space, and rockets use for  launching should be used only for peaceful purposes."</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN DENIES OBLIGATION TO HIKE U.S. CHIP IMPORTS  </P> <P> Japan is not obliged to increase American semiconductor manufacturers' share of  this country's computer chip market, a Japanese trade ministry official said  Monday, disputing American officials.  </P> <P> "There is no legally binding agreement except the semiconductor agreement," an  official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.  </P> <P> U.S. government officials have said Japan has failed to live up to a commitment  to increase the percentage of the Japanese chip market held by American  companies, while Japanese officials say they made no such commitment. Former  Commerce Department official Clyde Prestowitz alleged last year in his book,  "Trading Places: How America Allowed Japan to Take the Lead," that the Japanese  government pledged in a secret document to raise the U.S. market share of  semiconductors in Japan to 20% by 1991.  </P> <P> In the third quarter of last year, the latest period for which there are  statistics, foreign manufacturers had 10.9% of Japan's chip market, the MITI  official said in an interview. The U.S. Commerce Department says the American  share rose from 9.2% in 1987 to 9.5% in 1988.  </P> <P> In a 1986 semiconductor agreement, Japan pledged not to dump computer chips --  selling them at less than fair market value -- in the United States, and to  increase American access to Japan's chip market.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Guaranteed Increase  </P> <P> Prestowitz wrote that there was a confidential side letter in which "the  Japanese said that they understood, welcomed and would make efforts to assist  the U.S. companies in reaching their goal of a 20% market share within five  years.  </P> <P> "The U.S. negotiators said that this commitment meant there would be a  guaranteed increase in the U.S. share of the Japanese market," Prestowitz  added.  </P> <P> Japanese officials will not confirm the existence of a separate document  accompanying the semiconductor agreement, but say there was no document that  holds them to increasing U.S. market share.  </P> <P> "In a sense, he (Prestowitz) is wrong because there are no legally binding  documents. In fact, U.S. government statements never admitted to the existence  of such a document," the MITI official said.  </P> <P> "In general there are a lot of letters of exchange between the U.S. and Japan  in any kind of trade negotiations," he said. "Sometimes they're secret and  sometimes they're not."  </P> <P> Asked if there was an informal agreement by the Japanese government on a 20%  share for U.S. chip manufacturers, the official said, "No comment."  </P> <P> But he added, "Imagine if there was such a letter. It wouldn't represent a  commitment to a market share."  </P></p>

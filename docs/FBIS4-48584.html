			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   Land Deal -- "President Mandela has acknowledged his need to  lean on the experience of Mr F W de Klerk and the Nationalists,"  however the "sly transfer of 1.2 million hectares" of land in  KwaZulu/Natal to the Zulu king "serves as a warning: Mr Mandela  had better be careful what lessons Mr de Klerk is permitted to  pass on to the new South Africa," an editorial in Johannesburg's  SUNDAY TIMES in English on 22 May on page 22 notes. While Mr de  Klerk has denied "the transaction was sly," it was "his duty to  announce to the public any transaction of this magnitude," "that  he did not do so was contemptible, but, alas, all too typical of  the wicked regime of the Nationalists." "The Nationalists have  made an art form of looting by law," as "the country is drowning  in debt, and people who helped run up that debt are leaving  office as virtual millionares -- and returning to office." The  "'experience' that the National Party brings to government: a  contemptible value system, ruthless greed in the exploitation of  pensions and public monies, and great skill at manipulating  legalities to achieve tricky ends. The Zulu land deal is a  typical example, and in defending it Mr de Klerk simply confirms  the need for the new government to treat his 'experience' with  care, lest it poison the entire administration sand defeat the  democratic purposes of the new government."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   Reconstruction, Develoipment Program -- A doubly expensive  RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] will not impress  investors, is the reaction on a page 12 editorial in BEELD of 19  May in Afrikaans to reports that the ANC's estimation of the  cost of the RDP has increased from 39 billion rands before the  election to between 80 billion and 90 billion rands. "Such a  radical modification of a program, which President Nelson  Mandela has dubbed 'our economic Bible,' will cause people to  wonder whether the new government realizes the realities of the  country, and whether it will take the right decisions on that  basis." "The ANC apparently has in its possession an  unpublished report on the RDP in which key issues are hopefully  handled. This report must be published as soon as possible."  The editorial points out that possible investors in South  Africa will hold their money back until they are satisfied that  the government is able to manage the economy responsibly. The  recent performance by the shares and capital markets, and the  record weakening of the rand reflect the view of investors. "If  the amount of the RDP has doubled within a matter of weeks, one  wonders whether it will double a few times more in the future."    Rwanda Decision -- A second editorial in the 19 May BEELD  titled "South Africa Not Heading for Rwanda" commends the  decision by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo that South Africa will  not make troops available to the UN for peace operations in  Rwanda. "It must be understood that the new government, now  that South Africa is no longer a reject in the international  arena, wants to do something in the short term to underline its  new status and its leadership role in Africa. But such actions  will have to be carefully and thoroughly assessed first, because  the disadvantages could easily outweigh the advantages  considerably within a short space of time." "The very first  priority is that the South African National Defense Force should  become a solid, well oiled instrument capable of becoming a  peaceful foreign policy instrument."  <H8>  ILANGA </H8>   Get to work -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 19-21 May in a page  8  editorial says: "Now that we are steeped in this time of change  in the entire country, including KwaZulu/Natal, everyone needs  to undergo an attitude change, to realize that this time of  change means buckling down to hard work in this country. It  would be unfortunate to have people who think it all means  getting laid back and doing nothing. On the contrary, this is  the time for each and everyone to work harder than ever before  in an effort to rebuilt our country. Now is the real start of  the struggle for freedom. Let the employees work harder now  than before, the teacher teach with more dedication than ever,  the nurse seek to give patients the best care possible. Let the  scholar study harder than ever before. Whatever you find to do,  do it to the best of your ability to raise the standard of the  country and your own as well." "This time of change throws us  the great challenge of standing firm to fight the enemies of  freedom of both black and white. These enemies are poverty,  disease and ignorance. Let us all mobilize to rebuild our  country."</p>

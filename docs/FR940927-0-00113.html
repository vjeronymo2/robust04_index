The deadline for late-season proposals was subsequently extended to September 9 in the September 7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 46320). These regulations would be proposed for certain designated members of the avian families Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans); Columbidae (doves and pigeons), Gruidae (cranes); Rallidae (rails, coots, moorhens, and gallinules); and Scolopacidae (woodcock and snipe). These species are designated as ``migratory game birds'' in conventions between the United States and several foreign nations for the protection and management of these birds. All other birds designated as migratory (under 10.13 of Subpart B of 50 CFR Part 10) in the aforementioned conventions may not be hunted. On June 8, 1994, the Service published for public comment a second document (59 FR 29700) which provided supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations frameworks. On June 23, 1994, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, as announced in the April 7 and June 8  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Registers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , to review the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these species and for other early seasons. On July 12, 1993, the Service published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (59 FR 35566) a third document in the series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents which dealt specifically with proposed early-season frameworks for the 1994&hyph;95 season. On August 4, 1994, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, as announced in the April 7, June 8, and July 12  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Registers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , to review the status of waterfowl. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these late seasons. On August 17, 1994, the Service published a fourth document (59 FR 42474) containing final frameworks for early migratory bird hunting seasons from which wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands selected early-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for 1994&hyph;95. The fifth document in the series, published August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43684), dealt specifically with proposed frameworks for the 1994&hyph;95 late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. On September 1, 1994, the Service published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a sixth document consisting of a final rule amending subpart K of title 50 CFR part 20 to set hunting seasons, hours, areas, and limits for early seasons. On September 7, 1994, the Service published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a seventh document announcing an extension of the closing date for the comment period on late-season regulations from September 2 to September 9. This document, which establishes final frameworks for late-season migratory bird hunting regulations for the 1994&hyph;95 season, is the eighth in the series. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Review of Comments and the Service's Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public-hearing and written comments received through September 9, 1994, relating to proposed late-season frameworks are discussed and addressed here. Ten individuals presented statements at the August 4, 1994, public hearing. Individuals and the organizations represented were: Dr. Rollin Sparrowe, Wildlife Management Institute; Walter Sikes, California Waterfowl Association; Brian Cavey, Office of Senator Max Baucus; Bruce Barbour, National Audubon Society; K.L. Cool, Central Flyway Council; Scott Sutherland, Ducks Unlimited; Congressman Jay Dickey, 4th Congressional District in Arkansas; Congressman Tim Petrie, 6th Congressional District in Wisconsin; Dr. Gary Will, Pacific Flyway Council; and Congressman Steve Gunderson, 3rd Congressional District in Wisconsin. The Service received 504 written comments that specifically addressed late-season issues. These late-season comments are summarized and discussed in the subject order used in the April 7, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Only the numbered items pertaining to late seasons for which comments were received are included. Flyway Council recommendations shown below include only those involving changes from the 1993&hyph;94 late-season frameworks. For those topics where a Council recommendation is not shown, the Council supported continuing the same frameworks as in 1993&hyph;94. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public-Hearing Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Dr. Rollin Sparrowe, Mr. Brian Cavey, Mr. Bruce Barbour, Mr. K. L. Cool, and Mr. Scott Sutherland expressed optimism for the recovery of duck populations this year due to the return of good water and improved upland habitat conditions. They noted that a variety of circumstances likely contributed to this improvement but praised the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the cooperative efforts of private landowners, State and Federal wildlife agencies, and conservation organizations for having played a significant role. However, Mr. Sutherland stated that several species, including the mallard, black duck, pintail, American wigeon, blue-winged teal, canvasback, and scaup are still below the North American Waterfowl Management Plan goals. He stressed the need to expand and improve population surveys and banding program databases which would allow the development of refined regional and flyway management plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Written Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The California Waterfowl Association urged the Service to consider the link between hunting opportunities and hunter support of habitat programs when formulating regulations. They believe that the current sizes of waterfowl populations justify a relaxation of restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An individual from California requested that waterfowl harvests be managed on a flyway basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dr. Robert McLandress, Director of the Waterfowl and Wetland Program of the California Waterfowl Association, expressed his concern for the 65 percent decrease in California waterfowl hunters during the past two decades and the impact of such losses on wetland habitat preservation and maintenance. He noted that the number of California waterfowl hunters was more highly correlated with pintail harvests and pintail breeding populations than with harvests and populations of other ducks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Walter R. Sikes, representing the California Waterfowl Association, noted that 1994 would be the second year of good production for Pacific Flyway duck populations which should provide relief to the existing regulations restrictions. He commented that reduced waterfowl populations and hunting opportunities had discouraged support for habitat restoration efforts in California; but nonetheless, California waterfowlers have spent millions of dollars on waterfowl habitat improvement programs in that State. He further indicated that historical data supported relaxation of regulations, noting that during years with similar duck populations, seasons were 31 percent longer, bag limits were 75 percent higher, and hunter numbers were at least 35 percent greater than in 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two local sportsmen's organizations from Massachusetts requested threshold figures for all species of waterfowl defining when seasons shall be opened or closed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Fund for Animals expressed concern that many States are establishing late-season migratory bird hunting dates prior to the publication of the final frameworks by the Service. They contend that such premature action by State agencies, regardless of the time constraint the agencies may face, conflict with the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. The purpose of publishing the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  proposed rulemaking document and allowing a subsequent comment period is to provide opportunity for interested parties to submit data and facts and to present their views. They maintain that this scenario places the Service in a difficult situation and compromises its ability to make changes. As a result, they believe that the Service does not seriously consider comments received and thus does not involve the public in the decision-making process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation expressed concern regarding the timing of the process required to establish final frameworks for setting migratory game bird regulations and asked that the Service modify the administrative process. They suggested that regulations should be finalized a month earlier in order to establish season dates and provide information to hunters in an orderly and timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Humane Society of the United States (hereinafter the Humane Society) expressed concern that the public was not well represented in the regulations-establishment process. They requested establishment of a system directly involving the non-hunting public. They also requested that the Service undertake efforts to obtain population estimates for all hunted species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When the preliminary proposed rulemaking document was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 7, 1994, the Service announced the comment periods for the early-season and late-season proposals and gave notice that the process of promulgating hunting regulations ``must, by its nature, operate under time constraints''. Ample time must be given to gather and interpret survey data, consider recommendations and develop proposals, and to receive public comment. Scheduled dates are set to give the greatest possible opportunity for public input. If States do take action to establish their seasons prior to the final decisions on the frameworks, they risk having to withdraw and modify those actions. The Service is obligated to, and does, give serious consideration to all information received as public comment. The Service has long recognized the problems associated with the length of time necessary to establish the final frameworks, and in conjunction with States, Flyway Councils, and the public, continues to seek new ways to streamline and improve the regulatory process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding population estimates, the long-term objectives of the Service include providing opportunities to harvest portions of certain migratory game bird populations and to limit harvests to levels compatible with each population's ability to maintain healthy, viable numbers. Annually, the status of populations are evaluated and the potential impacts of hunting are considered. The Service believes that hunting seasons are consistent with the current status of waterfowl populations and long-term population goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

The Council presented information on duck populations, hunter numbers, and duck harvest in support of their recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public-Hearing Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Dr. Rollin Sparrowe indicated that while a recovery of duck populations appears to be underway, a single year does not represent an upward trend. He noted that some liberalization may be warranted this year, but added that the major question was how much and how fast should these liberalizations be implemented. Mr. Bruce Barbour advised a cautious restraint and suggested that our goal should be to return as many breeding pairs as possible next spring to take full advantage of the likely excellent nesting conditions. Mr. Walter Sikes and Mr. Brian Cavey commented that with the increased breeding populations and improved fall flight of ducks, some liberalization in the hunting regulations was justified this year. Tim Petrie believed that Wisconsin hunters were deserving of additional hunting opportunities because of their support and participation in habitat programs. Mr. Walter Sikes accused the Service of imposing restrictions based on a trend towards continental waterfowl management and a desire to simplify regulations. He believed such restrictions were unnecessary on healthy populations and inconsistent with the status of populations and habitat conditions within a flyway. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Written Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries expressed their dissatisfaction with the decision by the Service to offer an option package on duck seasons this year. They indicated that most optional regulations regarding waterfowl hunting were abandoned years ago. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission commented that regulations changes should ideally result in measurable responses to those changes and that ``tinkering'' should be avoided. They maintained that the hybrid option proposed by the Service this year will further complicate evaluations and impede our capabilities to learn about the effects of those regulation changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission asked the Service to explain the basis of information used to change the proposed frameworks from those presented at the public hearing on August 4, 1994, to those published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 24, 1994. Further, they indicated that they were unaware of the opportunity to provide comments regarding the regulations frameworks prior to the publication of the proposed late-season rulemaking document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department was critical of the regulations-development process this year and questioned the partnership between the Service, States, and Flyway Councils. They indicated that certain perceptions or politics were driving the decision process rather than constructive compromise based on sound biology. They advocated the need for greater focus on population biology, current and projected habitat conditions, and concerns of those who still hunt ducks. They believe this will build the base of knowledge on which sound decisions should be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Central Flyway Council commented that the Service's proposal of one additional bird or 10 additional days was overly conservative, penalized hunters, and was inconsistent with our biological knowledge. They stated that it appeared as if biologically-based action had been overridden by risk-aversive conservatism and clearly amounted to ``tinkering'', which would impede learning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Delta Waterfowl Foundation expressed concern that the increase in the spring population survey represented a redistribution of ducks from unsurveyed areas, and raised concerns about the reliability of short-term population projections in justifying significant changes in harvest strategies. Given the fact that 1994 was only the first year of good production and considering the uncertain variability in the fall-flight index, they maintained that a conservative framework was justified. They further recommended allowing populations to rebuild during these potentially short-lived years of good cover and water conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federation of State Waterfowl Associations expressed concern that the Service was moving towards a continental waterfowl-management approach and a simplification of regulations rather than using the flyway concept to tailor regulations to specific populations and to promote habitat management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two individuals asked that shooting hours be returned to sunrise rather than one-half hour before sunrise to reduce crippling loss and aid in species identification and management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  During most of the past decade, drought conditions on the principal duck breeding grounds have resulted in depressed duck populations, with numbers of some species reaching all-time lows. This situation necessitated restrictions in hunting regulations to reduce harvest rates commensurate with the status of ducks. This year, habitat conditions were much improved and breeding-population indices for many duck species and fall-flight indices for both mallards and all ducks combined increased substantially. Further, the continuation of good habitat conditions into mid-summer this year increases the likelihood that breeding habitat conditions may again be favorable for good production in 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the increases observed in breeding-population and production surveys this year, the Service believed that some relaxation of the harvest restrictions that have been in place in recent years was warranted. The question was how much relaxation should occur in this first year of improvement. Several alternatives were available, including: (1) to continue harvest restraints one more year by making little or no change in regulations in an attempt to provide maximum population growth and potentially be in a better position to capitalize, in terms of duck production, on the prospects for good habitat conditions next year, or (2) to increase harvest opportunity to a greater extent this year and have a lesser chance for continued growth in duck populations. The Service felt that the first alternative offered the greatest opportunity for long-term benefit for both duck populations and harvest opportunity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flyway Councils felt that more liberalization in the hunting regulations was justified and recommended increases in both season length and bag limits for the duck season. In the Service's view, these changes would significantly increase harvests and were more in line with the second alternative identified above. Consequently, the Service opted for increases in bag limits similar to those recommended by the Councils, but preferred to retain last year's season lengths. The Service felt that this approach would provide additional harvest opportunity for hunters but would have a lesser impact on overall harvest than longer seasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the public hearing for late-season regulations on August 4, 1994, in Washington, DC, the Service proposed duck-season frameworks consisting of the same season length as last year and an increase of one bird in the overall daily bag limit. In response to numerous comments received after the public hearing, the proposed frameworks published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 24, 1994, were changed to include an option for States to select either the same season length as last year with a larger bag limit or a season length 10 days longer than last year with essentially the same bag limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service recognizes the wide divergence of views concerning an appropriate harvest strategy for ducks during this first year of significant improvement in the status of ducks. However, 1 year of significant growth does not constitute a full recovery and several years of growth are needed to rebuild the principal stocks in the surveyed area that were depressed during the 1980s. The Service remains committed to this goal and believes that in order to reach these desired population levels, we must take full advantage of the much-improved habitat conditions and prudently manage harvest rates. The Service welcomes this challenge and asks that States, Flyway Councils, hunters and the general public join in this effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regard to shooting hours, the Service has received considerable support for the proposed shooting hours. The Service has compiled information which demonstrates that shooting hours beginning at one-half hour before sunrise do not contribute significantly to the harvest of nontarget species.

Floating framework dates are recommended because (1) the flyway has traditionally been offered Saturday openings and Sunday closing for most migratory game birds, (2) fixed calendar dates will further restrict hunting opportunity in those States that traditionally open hunting on Saturday and close on Sunday, (3) departure from this traditional format will be confusing and unnecessarily restrictive, (4) there are no biological consequences to floating frameworks since we are dealing with only plus or minus 3 days in opening and closing dates, (5) a Saturday opening allows participation by school-age hunters and those that have a traditional work week, (6) there are no biological or political justifications which warrant a change from previous outside framework dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Written Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission requested the Service to consider the use of floating framework dates, rather than the proposed fixed dates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Humane Society recommends that all seasons open on Wednesday in order to reduce the high level of harvest associated with traditional Saturday season openings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The use of floating framework dates automatically allows earliest opening and latest closing dates to vary by almost a full week over a period of years. These kinds of annual variations tend to confound assessment of the impact of hunting regulations on duck populations.

He believed bag-limit restrictions for mallards in California were inappropriate given evidence of a preponderance of California-produced mallards in the harvest, consistently high nesting success and good brood survival. He believed the breeding population decline in California in 1994 was caused by the elimination of set-aside rice lands, favored by nesting mallards; however, there were significant increases elsewhere in the State. In addition to increased limits of mallards and pintails, he recommended an addition of 1 duck to the daily bag limit and 8 additional days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina commented that in light of the favorable data this year on duck populations, the Service should raise the limit to promote reasonable hunting privileges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation requested that the Service work with the Flyway Councils to cooperatively review its policy on the use of the point system for determining daily bag limits for ducks.

They cited strong evidence that many hunters are reordering their bag limits to achieve higher harvests and many are unable to distinguish ducks by species. As a regulatory tool, they claim that the point system is highly vulnerable to abuse. Further, they supported no increase in daily bag limits from the 1993&hyph;94 season. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California Department of Fish and Game asked that the Service consider adding a second pintail, of which no more than one could be a hen, to the daily bag limit in the Pacific Flyway. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Idaho Fish and Game Department and the Nevada Division of Wildlife expressed support for California's request to add a second pintail to the daily bag limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congressmen Calvin Dooley, Vic Fazio, Richard Lehman, Robert Matsui, and George Miller of California recommended adding a second pintail (no more than 1 hen) to the daily bag limit of 5 ducks in the Pacific Flyway. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several individuals from California asked that the Service support the Pacific Flyway Council's recommendation for a second pintail in the daily bag limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several individuals from California requested that the daily bag limit on hen mallards be increased to 2, as many hens are being thrown away in the field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An individual from Illinois requested a 4-bird daily bag limit including 2 drake mallards, allowing no hens, and a 2-scaup bag limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service, with input from the Flyway Councils, completed a comprehensive review of the point system in 1990, and established a policy that the point system should be restricted to a maximum daily bag no greater than that allowed under the conventional daily bag limit. In 1994, the Flyway Councils asked the Service to review this policy. The Service's review was completed in July 1994 and sent to all Flyway Councils. The 1990 review indicated that (1) there was little evidence that the point system was more effective than the conventional bag at redirecting harvest (2) major problems remained with determining appropriate species- and sex-specific point values (3) species closures eliminated the bird-in-hand identification advantage of the point system (4) reordering of point values in the field was an incentive under the point system and enforceability remained a major concern and (5) most problems with the point system were in application and not concept. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the 1994 review, the Service considered additional information that has been gathered since the 1990 review, and concluded that the point-system alternative to the conventional bag limit should be discontinued. Over the years, the Flyway Councils and States have had substantial opportunity to provide input into the review of scientific studies and analysis of this information. The completion of the 1990 and 1994 reviews and the decision to discontinue the point system have considered input from all entities. The Service has worked with the Flyway Councils on this issue several times in an effort to resolve differences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three of the four Flyway Councils recommended retaining the 1-pintail limit. Pintail breeding populations have not increased above levels of the mid-1980s, when major restrictions were first implemented, and winter population indices for the pintail in the Pacific Flyway remain at record low levels. While the production outlook has improved over the last 2 nesting seasons, the Service believes that, until more evidence of a sustained recovery is available, additional liberalization of the pintail in the daily bag limit is not warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> F.

About 3,500 acres of Tulare Basin wetlands are managed as duck clubs, compared to about 5,000 acres of managed wetlands in 1971. About 200 additional acres of wetlands had been flooded for waterfowl and other wetland-dependent wildlife in response to the creation of the zone. During 1991&hyph;93, this zone has allowed for a month delay in the opening date from the surrounding Balance-of-the-State and Southern California zones. This delay allows private wetland owners to take advantage of reduced electric pumping rates which become effective November 1, as well as reduced evapotranspiration rates which occur as temperatures decline. This results in an approximate 20 percent reduction in the cost of flooding. Any reductions in water cost provide an incentive for the continued flooding of private wetlands. The situation is not relieved by improvements in rainfall, because although surface water availability improves somewhat, ground water pumping costs are still high. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishment of the zone has not affected harvest. Estimated harvest of ducks from Kern, Kings and Tulare Counties constituted between 3.0 and 5.6 percent of the Statewide harvest in the periods 1961&hyph;1990. Since implementation of the zone in 1991, 2.5 percent of the State duck harvest has occurred in the zone. Pintail harvest in the zone declined from a high of 4.5 percent of the State harvest to 2.5 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Written Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two local sportsmen's organizations from Massachusetts requested continuation of zoning for their State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two individuals from Texas requested a third zone in Texas between the Mallard High Plains Management Area and the Eastern Zone, due to the size of the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Humane Society urges the Service to discontinue all split and special seasons and recommends that any State establishing such seasons reduce the total number of hunting days by a minimum of 10 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Boyd Gibbons, Director, California Department of Fish and Game, provided information on wetland habitat and waterfowl harvests in the Southern San Joaquin Valley Duck Zone and requested that the temporary zone be made permanent. Twenty percent of the remaining Tulare Basin wetlands are managed as private clubs, with most relying on costly, pumped groundwater. Allowing this zone to set a late, straight season which typically differs from adjacent zones would allow clubs to flood later when evaporative rates were lower and pumping costs significantly reduced. Estimated harvests of pintails and total ducks during 2 years with the zone (1991&hyph;92) were 16 percent less and 5 percent more, respectively, than during the 2 years prior (1989&hyph;90). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An individual from Minnesota expressed support for a straight (non-split) season due to cold weather onset at the first of November in the extreme northern portions of the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service acknowledges that the Southern San Joaquin Valley Zone in California appears to provide economic incentives for maintaining privately-managed wetlands, especially during recent years when season lengths have been relatively short. The Service will allow this zone to continue on a temporary basis for this year. With longer seasons, such as currently offered as an option to larger limits, the necessity and advantages for such a zone diminish. Regarding comments about zoning in Massachusetts and Texas, current zoning arrangements will continue until 1996, at which time States will have the opportunity to modify zone configurations in accordance with Service guidelines previously established. In reference to split seasons in Minnesota, the State has the option to change from 3-way splits to continuous seasons or 2-way splits if it wishes to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> G.

The use of 3-way splits as a harvest-management tool may have merit, but a more detailed proposal, including plans for a Flyway-wide evaluation and projections of potential impacts, should be prepared prior to implementing such a change.

The Flyway harvest strategy for this population of geese has not been completed, and some members of the Native American Community in Alaska have not endorsed portions of this recommendation. Further, changes in white-fronted seasons made last year have not yet been fully evaluated.

As an informational item, the Council recommended that Montana, Nevada, and Utah implement a monitoring program to assess the number of trumpeter swans, if any, taken accidentally during the tundra swan season. The Council also recommended that Utah be more restrictive than the Federal frameworks by ending its season on or before December 15 and closing the Green River Area to swan hunting. The 3-year-average midwinter population index of 79,406 tundra swans is well above the Flyway objective level of 38,000. Proposed frameworks will result in harvest levels within those prescribed in the 1989 Tundra Swan Hunt Plan endorsed by the Pacific Flyway Council. The changes are premised on the implementation of the State-Federal cooperative program for hazing trumpeter swans from winter concentration areas near Harriman State Park in Idaho to more favorable sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public-Hearing Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Dr. Gary Will reemphasized the Council's support for restrictions on tundra swan hunting in portions of the Pacific Flyway to minimize the accidental take of trumpeter swans and encouraged the Service to continue to cooperate with the Council and participating States in the management of the Rocky Mountain Population (RMP) of trumpeter swans.

He detailed the status and perceived threats to these swans, reviewed past and current management actions, and concluded that leadership, actions, and funding by the Service are inadequate to assure the population's recovery and believes they warrant listing under the Endangered Species Act. Among many recommendations directed at improving the effectiveness of range-expansion efforts directed at benefiting these swans, those germane to hunting regulations included: (1) not allowing either a permitted or incidental take of trumpeter swans during a tundra swan season, (2) having no open seasons for hunting tundra swans in the most critical trumpeter swan range-expansion areas, including all of Utah and Nevada, (3) modifying hunting regulations on National Wildlife Refuges in Montana, Utah, and Nevada to provide sanctuary for resting, reproduction, and rearing of cygnets, and (4) ending waterfowl hunting after October 20 at two sites on the Snake River in Idaho, at a site on the Green River, including Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge in Wyoming, and in unspecified areas within the Tristate Yellowstone region. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ms. Heidi Prescott, on behalf of The Fund for Animals, Inc., highlighted recent survey reports, reviewed portions of the Pacific Flyway Council's management plan and a report by Ms. Ruth Shea, a Service employee, and presented the group's views regarding management action pertaining to RMP trumpeter swans. The Fund for Animals, Inc., concurred with the recommendations of the Foundation pertaining to migratory game bird hunting contained in the aforementioned letter from Mr. D. C. Carlton of the Foundation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. D. J. Schubert, also on behalf of the Fund for Animals, Inc., reiterated certain concerns and needed actions deemed necessary for successful range expansion of RMP trumpeter swans. He believed that a mandatory check of swans taken by hunters in Utah and Nevada is necessary to measure the level of accidental take. While the purposeful hazing of trumpeter swans to more favorable winter sites has merit, it put more trumpeter swans at risk in tundra swan hunt areas; and he therefore recommended a new management strategy. The Fund for Animals believes there are two possible management strategy changes that would minimize excessive killing of trumpeter swans and still be consistent with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act: (1) prohibit hunting of tundra swans in Utah and Nevada; or, although less preferred, (2) prohibit hunting in certain critical areas in Utah. Under both options, security areas should be established in Idaho, and recreational activities such as waterfowl hunting and boating should be evaluated for possible negative impacts on trumpeter swan behavior and habitat use. Should intensive hazing be pursued to disperse birds to more favorable wintering sites, and if law enforcement policy is to be changed to facilitate the collection of information on the accidental take of trumpeter swans during the tundra swan season, the Fund for Animals recommended that: (1) both Idaho and Wyoming Game and Fish Departments provide sanctuaries in designated areas; (2) the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, at the maximum, not allow swan hunting or, at the minimum, not allow swan hunting in Box Elder, Cache, and Rich Counties; (3) the Nevada Division of Wildlife close Stillwater Wildlife Management Area to swan hunting; (4) the Service close all National Wildlife Refuges in Utah and Nevada to the hunting of tundra swans; and (5) should the aforenamed States not exercise the recommended action, the Service should do so. Additionally, all States should enhance their hunter-education programs to emphasize proper identification of swans and waterfowl to minimize the accidental take of trumpeter swans as a result of other hunting seasons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. D. J. Schubert, in comments representing both The Fund for Animals, Inc., and the Foundation, reiterated and elaborated upon previous recommendations from those two organizations for curtailing tundra swan hunting and waterfowl hunting to enhance RMP trumpeter swan winter-range expansion (see above and 59 FR 43691&hyph;43692) and made specific comments on the proposed frameworks. At a minimum, Mr. Schubert recommends prohibiting tundra swan hunting and restricting waterfowl hunting on all Federal lands in south-central Montana, southern Idaho, western Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada. He believes that the Service is negligent in not using to the fullest extent various management provisions afforded and mandated by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, the National Wildlife Refuge Administration Act, and the Refuge Recreation Act to protect RMP trumpeter swans. He described the historic RMP trumpeter swan populations, probable causes for their current restricted winter distribution, and past and current management efforts aimed at restoring the population; he offered management solutions to restore the population; and he argued in support of a petition for listing the RMP trumpeter as a threatened species which had been dismissed by the Service. He insists that the Service is obligated by law to restore the trumpeter swan to its native range. He contends that the Service is operating under an unpublished policy of nonenforcement of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act with respect to tundra swan hunters who might accidentally shoot a trumpeter swan. He recanted his previous recommendation for measuring the level of accidental take, by saying that there was sufficient information to know that it occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Michael Roy, on behalf of the National Wildlife Federation, expressed concern about the successful continuation of the RMP trumpeter swan range-expansion program, in part because of a perceived ineffective and confusing management structure that is not adequately represented by all interested parties, and in part by accidental take of trumpeter swans during tundra swan seasons in Utah. He believes certain recommendations provided by Ms. Ruth Shea, a Service employee, were reasoned and practical and, if implemented, would enhance range-expansion efforts. Premised on Ms. Shea's recommendations, he recommended that tundra swan hunting in Utah be discontinued from the southern boundary of the Bear River National Wildlife Refuge north and east to the Idaho and Wyoming borders for an initial 5-year period. This closure would be intended to minimize the accidental take of trumpeter swans during translocation activities and, hopefully, tundra swan hunting could be reinstated afterwards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ms. Louisa Willcox, representing the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, raised questions regarding the Service's role in managing RMP trumpeter swans and funding efforts to increase their numbers and expand their distribution. She asked how the Service will monitor the accidental take of trumpeter swans during tundra swan hunting seasons in Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah and what measures will be taken to minimize the potential losses. She also asked why the Service has not sought establishment of trumpeter swan wintering sites outside the Montana-Idaho-Wyoming region. She requested that the Service develop a long-term strategy to prevent wintering waterfowl, including trumpeter swans, from damaging vegetation and fish habitat at Harriman State Park in Idaho. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Humane Society recommended that all tundra swan seasons be closed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service concurs with the recommendation to extend the experimental tundra swan season in North Dakota one additional year, with a final report due by June 1, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conjunction with a larger Federal-State-Flyway effort to enhance and monitor both winter and summer distribution of RMP trumpeter swans, the Service believes that modification of tundra swan hunting seasons in the Pacific Flyway portion of Montana, in Utah, and in Nevada is warranted to minimize the accidental killing of trumpeter swans by tundra swan hunters. Accordingly, final frameworks require: (1) States to collect and report information on the accidental take of trumpeter swans in conjunction with tundra swan seasons, and (2) in Utah, the season must end on or before December 15 and four counties would be closed to swan hunting. The Pacific Flyway Council's request for additional permits to compensate for lost hunting opportunities in Utah is not without merit from the standpoint of tundra swan management; however, the Service denied the Council's request and believes a conservative approach is warranted because of the possibility of trumpeter swans moving into the general hunting area. Further, there has been no change in either policy or law regarding enforcement of migratory game bird hunting regulations as they apply to the illegal take of trumpeter swans. Monitoring of the winter distribution of trumpeter swans will provide the Service with additional opportunities to further modify hunt programs if warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trumpeter swans are expected to number about 17,000&hyph;20,000 individuals during the next range-wide survey scheduled for 1995 and have been increasing at about 6 percent per year during 1968&hyph;90 (1990 was the last year in which a range-wide survey was conducted). Populations such as the RMP warrant additional attention, which the Service continues to give with considerable assistance from State and other Federal agencies and moral, if not financial, support from several non-governmental organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding closure of all tundra swan seasons, the Service believes that the status of tundra swan populations does not warrant such closures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 23.

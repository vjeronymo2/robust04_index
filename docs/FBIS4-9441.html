			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 23 (ATA) -- "The recent detention by  the Ministry of Public Order are not and has not been done on  basis of nationality but according to their citizenship," the  spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday,  commenting on the detention for keeping arms without permission,  drugs and criminal anticonstitutional activity.    The spokesman said that the Ministry of Public Order  possesses incontestable proofs and will make them available for  any international investigating commission interested in them.  "Each Albanian citizen is equal before the law and the  intervention of any state for protecting them is unacceptable.  Such acts violate the sovereignty of the Albanian state," the  spokesman concludes.    Some 11 persons have been detained for keeping arms without  permission and many criminal anti-constitutional documentations  during a control made recently by the Ministry of Public Order.  The documentations proves the Greek expansionist intentions  against Albania and the Greek flagrant endeavour to Hellenize  the Albania's southern territories.</p>

The  head of Jordan's delegation to the environmental multilateral  talks, Dr. Anis al-Mu'ashshir, said no such agreement was  reached with Israel. He told ``News at Ten'' that there had been  a decision by the environment multilateral meeting to establish  three units in al- 'Aqabah, Elat, and Nuwaybi'.    Dr. al-Mu'ashshir said the units will be established with  the  help of the European Union, and will combat oil spills and  pollution as well as deal with emergency situations in the Gulf  of Aqaba.    He said the Europeans will discuss the implementation of the  decision with Jordan, Israel, and Egypt, but stressed that this  was in no way an agreement with Israel.</p>

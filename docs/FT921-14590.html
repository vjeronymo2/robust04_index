			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Iraq could have built 4 A-bombs a year IRAQ has acknowledged to United Nations inspectors for the first time that it had a large-scale uranium enrichment programme. It could have made enough uranium to build four atomic bombs a year of the size and type dropped by the US on the Japanese city of Nagasaki in 1945. The inspectors have no evidence that Iraq actually completed a nuclear bomb, though it is possible that one was made and remains hidden. Mr Robert Gallucci, who led the latest UN inspection visit to Iraq, said in Bahrain yesterday that the Iraqis admitted running enrichment centrifuges on a production scale, rather than just a research scale. A colleague at UN headquarters in New York, Mr David Dorn, said Iraq might have run as many as 10,000 gas centrifuges to convert natural uranium into material rich in U235, the isotope required for an atomic bomb. It emerged yesterday that German engineers had played a key role in supplying materials for the centrifuges. About five German companies are facing criminal proceedings for illegal exports of nuclear-related equipment to Iraq, according to officials in Bonn. All the companies were involved in exporting parts and equipment which could be used to make gas centrifuges to enrich uranium, but some of these could have a dual use and therefore may prove not to be illegally exported, the German Foreign Ministry said. Full details of the equipment supplied were handed by the German authorities to the UN special disarmament commission for Iraq last week. Mr Gallucci held talks with the German investigators in Bonn on January 9. 'The aim of this action is to show that we are in earnest in the exposure of illegal exports to Iraq,' a Foreign Ministry official said. 'We are determined to help the UN commission do its work properly by confronting Iraq with the evidence.' Centrifuges, which spin uranium hexafluoride gas very rapidly to separate the scarce U235 from the heavier U238, are regarded as state-of-the-art enrichment technology in the west, both for military purposes and for civil nuclear reactors. The uranium has to pass through 'cascades' of hundreds or even thousands of centrifuges before it is rich enough in U235 to fuel a reactor or bomb. In Washington, US officials predicted that the latest disclosures would lead to stepped-up UN inspections of undeclared sites. An option is for UN inspectors to destroy facilities dedicated entirely or partly to Iraq's nuclear and unconventional weapons programme. In a report to Congress released yesterday, President George Bush said that although UN inspection teams had destroyed 62 missiles, 33 warheads and quantities of additional missile equipment, the US believed that Iraq still possessed 'large numbers of undeclared ballistic missiles.'

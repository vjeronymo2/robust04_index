			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Leading Article: Airbus deal THE IMMEDIATE verdict on yesterday's settlement of the long-running dispute between the US and the European Community over Airbus financing is that it is a triumph for good sense. The longer-term question is how far it will succeed in its aim of preventing similar trade rows from breaking out again in the future. In the end, the agreement stemmed from the realisation that neither side could afford to pursue brinkmanship to its conclusion. So dependent is the aircraft industry of each on the other's market that both would have suffered unacceptably heavy damage had the dispute degenerated into an all-out trade war. That is encouraging at a time when the Uruguay Round trade negotiations hang in the balance: at the least, it suggests that should the Round fail, countries would think again before plunging into unilateralism. In this instance, the concessions by both sides seem about equally balanced. Direct government support for existing Airbus programmes will be allowed to continue, but aid for future projects will be limited to about 30 per cent of total cost - lower than Brussels wanted, but higher than Washington had demanded. The US, meanwhile, has acknowledged for the first time that its commercial aircraft makers benefit indirectly from government spending on defence and space projects and has agreed to limits on such aid. Though full details of the agreement have yet to be disclosed - and ratified by governments - it is clear that it will only work if the parties involved are prepared to co-operate in good faith in its implementation. In particular, that will depend on the US and the EC disclosing far more information about the financing of commercial aircraft programmes than they have so far done. It is also vitally important that the agreement be enshrined in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. First, because an independent mechanism is needed to adjudicate disputes. Second, because any international concordat on government subsidies will be short-lived unless it is also subscribed to by other countries, notably Japan and South Korea, with ambitions to develop commercial aircraft industries. Nonetheless, there is a limit to what even the most carefully-crafted system of multilateral guidelines can achieve in an industry which involves immense risks, brutal competition and huge investments of cash and national prestige. With so much at stake, there will always be a temptation for governments and producers to seek advantage by bending the rules if they think they can. In the last analysis, countries' crude self-interest is the most effective discipline. The real lesson of yesterday's agreement is that though nationalism may still colour the politics of commercial aerospace, its economics are increasingly driven by the growing international inter-dependence between producers and customers. The continuing globalisation of the industry is the best guarantee of fair trade in the future.</p>

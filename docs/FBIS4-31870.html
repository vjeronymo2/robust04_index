			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo was not spared the aggressor's  provocations today either, the Information Service of the 1st  Corps reports:    [Begin recording] There are no longer any naive people among  Sarajevo citizens, so the report that the chetniks pounded the  Igman road with antiaircraft machine-gun fire, fired infantry  arms at Mijatovica Kosa, and targeted the free territories with  cumulative mortars from Nedjarici, represents no surprise. This  was only a continuation of enemy activity that had started last  night when chetnik mortar bombs exploded on the region around  Vrbanja Most and at Vis.    A similar (?torture) was suffered by other regions covered  by  the 1st Corps, particularly around Vares where our positions  were pounded by antiaircraft guns and antiaircraft machine-guns,  Vratnica was pounded from Cekrcici, and Pljesivica and Visocica,  near Visoko, were exposed to fire from Vrela.

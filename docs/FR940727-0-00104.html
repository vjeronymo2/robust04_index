Captain Sawyer may not testify as an expert witness. This limitation is based on Army policy prohibiting Government employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private litigation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  32 CFR &sect;516.42.

This authorization is also subject to the approval of the witness' supervisors to be absent during the period involved. Finally, because this is private litigation, the witness' participation must be at no expense to the United States.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  32 CFR &sect;516.48.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If you have any questions, please call CPT Taylor at 919&hyph;882&hyph;4500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;&blank;Sincerely,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert V.

See 32 CFR &sect;&sect;97.6(e), 516.42. Several reasons support the exercise of strict control over such witness appearances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Army policy is one of strict impartiality in litigation in which the Army is not a named party, a real party in interest, or in which the Army does not have a significant interest. When a witness with an official connection with the Army testifies, a natural tendency exists to assume that the testimony represents the official view of the Army, despite express disclaimers to the contrary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Army is also interested in preventing the unnecessary loss of the services of its personnel in connection with matters unrelated to their official responsibilities. If Army personnel testify as expert witnesses in private litigation, their official duties are invariably disrupted, often at the expense of the Army's mission and the Federal taxpayer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Army is concerned about the potential for conflict of interest inherent in the unrestricted appearance of its personnel as expert witnesses on behalf of parties other than the United States. Even the appearance of such conflicts of interest seriously undermines the public trust and confidence in the integrity of our Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This case does not present the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify the requested witness' expert testimony. You have demonstrated no exceptional need or unique circumstances that would warrant (his or her) appearance. The expert testimony desired can be secured from non-Army sources. Consequently, we are unable to grant you an exception to the Army's policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If you have any questions, please call me or CPT Taylor at 919&hyph;882&hyph;4500.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;Sincerely,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert V.

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Grim backdrop for US budget: Uncertainties likely to affect economic planning THE BUSH administration will tomorrow unveil budget plans for fiscal 1993 against an uncertain economic outlook and deteriorating medium-term trends for the federal deficit. 'The deficit outlook is far bleaker than was expected when Congress and the president reached their budget summit agreement in the fall of 1990,' the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warned last week. This time last year the administration used that agreement - which cut prospective deficits by Dollars 500bn (Pounds 276.2bn) over five years - to justify its projection of a rapid decline of the budget deficit. Mr Richard Darman, the budget director, even forecast a slim surplus of Dollars 14bn by 1996. The CBO, set up to provide non-partisan advice for Congress, now believes such projections were too optimistic. In its budget assessment last week it forecast only a gradual decline in the budget deficit, from Dollars 352bn this year to Dollars 178bn in 1996. The deficit then begins to rise again, reaching Dollars 407bn by 2002. If distortions caused by the bail-out of savings and loans and the Gulf war are excluded, the CBO figures suggest the deficit will not fall below Dollars 200bn, or 3 per cent of gross domestic product, at any point during the next decade. Indeed, by 2002 the deficit will have risen to 4.1 per cent of GDP, the same ratio as expected for fiscal 1993. A budget deficit represents negative saving by the federal government. The CBO's projection of another decade of large deficits indicates that, on unchanged policies, the US will be unable to raise its low national savings rate. This in turn implies a low rate of capital formation and sluggish economic growth. What accounts for the deterioration in outlook for the deficit? In the short-term, the culprit is the more stubborn than expected recession. Last year the administration forecast a recovery beginning last summer. This failed to materialise and many economists expect the recession that began in July 1990 to be the longest since the Second World War. Most forecasters, including the CBO, now project a weak recovery in the second half of this year. But few economists are taking a recovery for granted and not many expect more than lacklustre growth of 2-3 per cent at an annual rate. In the longer term, the CBO blames the poor outlook for the deficit on projected spending trends. Provided permanent tax cuts are avoided in this week's budget, the organisation projects federal revenue to rise slightly as a share of GDP, from 18.9 per cent this year to 19.2 per cent in 1995 and then to hold steady. However, its forecast for spending shows outlays at or above 22 per cent of GDP for most of the next decade. Discretionary spending - on defence and domestic programmes - is projected to decline steadily over the next decade. But these gains are offset by a sharp increase in mandatory spending on entitlement programmes, mainly health care for the elderly and the poor, and pensions. Mandatory spending, estimated at Dollars 708bn this year, is already more than twice the size of the defence budget. The growth in spending on entitlements can thus easily outstrip even a large 'peace dividend'. Debt service will remain one of the government's largest programmes, absorbing 3.5 per cent or more of GDP. The CBO concludes that another round of deficit-cutting, rivalling the 1990 summit, is now 'urgent if the government's drain on national savings is to be curbed'. Mr Darman's talent for creative accounting will result in the most flattering possible presentation of long-run budgetary trends. But analysts striving to assess the US economy's long-term potential will be looking for concrete evidence of either reduced growth of entitlement spending or higher revenues. In the absence of either, the outlook for saving and capital formation is likely to remain poor, despite the large scope for cuts in the defence budget.</p>

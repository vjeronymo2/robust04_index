			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Overseas weakness leaves senior bourses in decline AN overnight fall in Tokyo and a weak Wall Street opening led most bourses lower, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM eased back slightly in spite of a warm reception for Philips' third quarter results. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.5 to 139.5, after a day's high of 139.8. Mr Ian Blackford of NatWest Securities said that the results were in line with expectations, suggesting that restructuring and cost-cutting measures were now paying off. The shares added Fl 1.10 to Fl 41.40 and Mr Blackford saw the results providing an impetus for the price to test the Fl 50 level. Polygram put on 30 cents to Fl 74.10. KLM, which released satisfactory second quarter figures but cautioned against expectations of substantially stronger full year results, lost 20 cents to Fl 41.70, after an earlier high of Fl 43.70. Mr Richard Brakenhoff of brokers Pierson noted that the airline's fate depended either on the success of the Alcazar talks or its ability to form links with another European airline. 'It needs a European market share of about 10 per cent,' he said, 'and at the moment it has just 3 per cent.' He remained a seller of the stock and commented that the airline had a long way to go in reducing its cost base. Akzo, confirming that it was holding merger talks with Nobel Industries of Sweden, gained Fl 5.30 to Fl 199.50. FRANKFURT moved from consolidation to correction as the DAX index dropped 21.75 to 2,062.61, turnover falling from DM8.9bn to DM8bn. Economic indicators were not good. The director of the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHT), Mr Franz Schoser, said on Wednesday that he saw a 0.5 per cent contraction in western Germany in 1994, compared to the German economic research institutes' 1.5 per cent growth estimate. Among blue chips, a minor chemicals leak at BASF's main plant followed Wednesday's news that talks to sell its acrylics business had broken down. The shares fell DM5 to DM275. PARIS fell back in the absence of major corporate news. The CAC-40 index shed 35.19 or 1.6 per cent to 2,135.97 in turnover of some FFr4.4bn. Roussel-Uclaf, which pleased analysts with its nine month results after hours on Wednesday, went against the trend with a rise of FFr10 to FFr693. Goldman Sachs upgraded its earnings, said that it should outperform the market and looked for a 12-month price target of around FFr855. MILAN had a day of political high drama after President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's television appearance to deny corruption allegations, claiming that they were part of a plot to destabilise the country. The Comit index shed 10.99 to 567.69 in thin trading. Mr John Stewart of InterEuropa in Milan commented that the market had held up well in the face of the day's events although he noted that the index had finished at a technical support level. Mr Stewart added that the developments had complicated the country's political and economic outlook. A volatile political situation was likely to delay passage of the budget, which in turn could hold up planned elections next year. Stet fell L114 to L4,002, dragged down by an anti-trust ruling that prevents Sip from developing or marketing its digital phone system. Sip fell L49 to L3,440 in heavy volume of 16m shares. ZURICH shed 1.6 per cent as foreign investors took profits in blue chips, leaving the SMI index 43.7 lower at 2,706.6. Among the most actively traded blue chips, Roche certificates fell SFr110 to SFr5,745, Nestle gave up SFr19 at SFr1,774 and Zurich Insurance SFr15 at SFr1,410. Swiss Re registered shares eased SFr10 to SFr3,870 as the company forecast improved 1993 figures and good prospects for 1994. BRUSSELS closed at a new high for the third time this week, edging up 3.12 to 1,391.99 in turnover of some BFr1.9bn. Options-linked basket buying reversed early losses in the cash market, following major transactions in the Bel-20 index contract. Industrials led the gains with Bekaert, the steel cord and wire maker, up BFr525 to BFr20,350.

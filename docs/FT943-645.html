			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lower costs help Britton to Pounds 3.75m Buoyed by lower polymer prices, pre-tax profits at Britton Group, the packaging company which on June 13 swallowed the larger NMC, jumped from Pounds 520,000 to Pounds 3.75m in the six months to June 30. Turnover rose from Pounds 6.39m to Pounds 30m. The shares edged ahead 1p to 153p. The results this time are essentially those of Britton's UK polythene subsidiaries - Taco and the now renamed Gelplas. However, the figures also include 18 days of profits and turnover - Pounds 790,000 and Pounds 6.45m respectively - from NMC, the London-quoted but US-based folded cartons company. The acquisition will result in Britton's turnover increasing to about Pounds 200m. NMC also brought with it some UK polythene packaging subsidiaries - NMC Security Products, Precision Packaging and NMC Coatings - which are to be integrated into Britton's polythene division. While Britton's operating profits jumped to Pounds 3.95m (Pounds 554,000), on a like-for-like basis they rose 20 per cent. Operating margins at the continuing businesses rose from 11 to 13.4 per cent, while the NMC figure was 12.3 per cent. Tonnage volume grew by 9.6 per cent, helped by a lower average selling price per tonne of Pounds 938 (Pounds 983). Mr Simon Beart, finance director, said that just as the lower prices had been passed on to customers, so would the current higher ones. Britton had a long book of six weeks of polythene supply, he said. Mr Robin Williams, chief executive, said Taco would concentrate on high margin areas like feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products, with less emphasis on nappies. Gelplas makes industrial packaging and intermediate handling products. Capital expenditure planned for 1995 is between Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m, mostly for the US but including Pounds 5m for buildings and the increase of capacity in the UK operations. Gearing is expected to hold at the current 33 per cent level. The interim dividend is lifted to 1p (0.6p), payable from earnings of 4.79p (2.78p).</p>

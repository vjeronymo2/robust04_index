			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: Tempting prospects in a Swiss market - As Britons gear up for their skiing holidays, Audrey Powell considers the resort properties available in Switzerland and France DIFFERENT nationalities shop for their ski resort properties at different times of the year. The British it seems, take an interest in buying from September. So should they begin looking at the well-built, spacious but pricey Swiss offerings? Buying opportunities in Switzerland are still limited for the foreigner, although you are told that since that country's application to join the EC restrictions 'are loosening a little.' But any slackening of buying rules seems to be only at cantonal level. Even so, it is worth seeing what is on offer. Villars, in the canton of Vaud, which allows purchases by foreigners, is a long-established Swiss resort attracting intermediate skiers. The merging of two major developers there - both family companies which have been in the business for years - has produced a single company with a wide selection of property for sale. Examples are a first-floor chalet apartment with balcony, in a private park, on a piste, at pounds 165,000, or a duplex with three bedrooms, on the top floors of a chalet, at pounds 202,000. Both are ready for immediate occupation. In another chalet, Villars keeps to the chalet tradition with its new building, one-bedroom apartments go from pounds 133,000. These are near the centre of town but within walking distance of skiing. They should be ready by Christmas. There are apartments in the Chalet Bristol, across the road from the aparthotel Bristol. Those in the Chalet are for normal freehold purchase, with no obligation to let, but owners can make use of the hotel's facilities. Studios in the Chalet Bristol start at pounds 52,000, one-bedroom apartments at pounds 173,000. These properties are among those available from the London offices of David de Lara (081-749-2188) or solicitor Osbornes (071-485-8811). The British have always enjoyed the Bernese Oberland, and Wengen, perched above the valley of Lauterbrunnen, is easily accessible by train from Geneva and Zurich. Buying a property in the resort has been more problematical, says Simon Malster, of Osbornes. But in the course of acting for a client attempting to purchase a chalet there, he found a property 'which I believe to be uniquely available to foreign buyers.' It is an hotel which closed and is being converted into large flats. Near the station - important, as Wengen is a traffic-free town - the balconied apartments with their long-ranging views sell at pounds 165,000 (for two or three bedrooms - the floor area is the same). Verbier, in the canton of Valais, provides an example of the difficulties outsider's may face in the Swiss market. In a referendum four years ago it was decided that no more sales to foreigners would be permitted. Subsequently that decision was reversed. Since, demand for property by foreigners has been so great that both last year's and this year's quotas of foreign authorisations have been used. Purchasers interested in resale property there are unlikely to get permission until the beginning of next year. 'There are some excellent properties available, but the situation and standard of finish, affect the price. Thus a new one-bedroom apartment could be between pounds 100,000 and pounds 200,000,' he says. For those with a budget of pounds 400,000 there are large apartments and individual chalets. If you want to go upmarket you could look to Gstaad, in the canton of Bern. It is expensive, exclusive and picturesque and offers plenty to entertain the non-skier. The 25-year old Chalet Petunia, with views of meadows and mountain ranges from its terrace and three balconies, is available. There are five bedrooms, four bathrooms, two reception rooms. The basement could be made into a self-contained flat. There is a double garage and garden. The centre of the village and ski slopes are a few minutes' walk away, although a four-wheel drive vehicle is advisable in winter. Its British owner has been letting the property and says between pounds 55,000 and pounds 60,000 a year can be obtained, two thirds of this between December 20 and March 20. Aylesford, in Zondon (071-351-2383) is inviting offers around pounds 1.6m. Arlette Adler, of Villas Abroad (Properties) in London (081-891-5444) has her own lists of ski resort homes - many resales among them. She takes a rather cynical view of the Swiss sector. When it comes to changing the buying rules, she suggests, 'haste has never been a Swiss malaise.' Adler adds: 'Confusion still reigns in the various departments of the cantons.' Properties sold in Champery (Valais) 14 months previously had still not had their authorisations ratified, although they had been granted. 'This means that they cannot be completed before a notary, nor can they be entered in the land registry. Nor, may I add, has the buyer had to pay for them ..' The most important development, predictably, has been the resale market. Numbers of foreign owners who bought Swiss properties more than ten years ago cannot sustain the mortgage and upkeep of a foreign property. But, one man's disaster is another's bargain and bargains there are. There were some 'truly remarkable opportunities' among quality properties. A four-bedroom chalet on three levels in the Valais, with a full-size dance studio (the owner taught dancing) was available for pounds 240,000. In Fribourg a chalet with integral flat, the whole totalling eight rooms, was on offer at pounds 358,000. At the other end of the scale, in Valais, a small studio apartment could be bought for pounds 24,000. A two-room apartment on the slopes of an extensive linked ski area was available for pounds 57,000 and one with three rooms, for pounds 83,000. All were furnished. The exchange rate had had its effect, too. An owner who bought a two-bedroom apartment at Leysin, in the Vaud, at pounds 133,000 ten years ago, had it on the market, furnished, at pounds 88,000. In French ski resorts there are no complications about a foreigner's eligibility to buy. Zigi Davenport, of Alpine Apartments Agency, in Leominster, Hertfordshire (05447-234) says she is almost embarrassed to admit that the market has been good and with the bulk of buyers British. 'Last year and the first six months of this year we have been incredibly busy, with an enormous increase in demand and actual sales, particularly in the more traditional resorts with easy access to Geneva and the lakes.' Many clients were now buying in the Alps for year-round holiday use, appealing to all age groups. 'True, demand is for chalets or larger apartments. The British have never liked the small 'rabbit hutch' type. A few years ago many French developers built far too many studio and one-bedroom apartments, to the detriment of the resort or village,' says Davenport. At Morzine , for example, the commune would no longer give planning permission for very small apartments, while builders of quality properties in the Haute Savoie were in demand, with buyers waiting for any resales. Chalets for sale in Megeve began at pounds 200,000 and went up to pounds 1m. Apartments in the renovated Hotel Beau Site close to the golf course were good value at pounds 129,000 for three bedrooms with terrace, says Davenport. La Clusaz chalets close to the piste, now started at pounds 140,000. Chamonix was a draw to tourists worldwide and its property prices were rising with demand from Italian buyers. Chalets at Les Houches went from pounds 120,000 but for something special, in a good setting, with views of Mont Blanc one had to pay pounds 260,000 up. A final thought with the investor in mind. A complete apartment building, close to the centre of Les Gets, comprising 17 units and 14 garages, is for sale at about pounds 900,000. It has nearly all-year rental income. An alternative option would be to sell most of the apartments and keep the top floor as a penthouse, suggests the agency.</p>

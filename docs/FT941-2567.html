			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Motoring: The real thing For my drive to Geneva this year, I chose a Mercedes C-250 diesel automatic. It gave me 34.25 miles per gallon (8 l/100km) over almost 1,200 miles (1,932km) of fast autoroute cruising, leisurely driving on near-deserted roads following the canal de Bourgogne, two crossings of the Col de la Faucille, and jostling with Geneva's traffic. Without retracting a word of my criticism of the nasty trim materials used in some C-Class cars in a bid to appeal to younger buyers, I have to say my leather-trimmed C-250 looked and felt a real Mercedes. It gurgled softly at start-up from cold, but then ran so quietly at anything between 60mph and 100mph (97-161kmh) that one forgot it was a diesel. One of the most agreeable aspects of driving a diesel is the way they reward roadcraft. By looking as far ahead as you can, and anticipating what is there, you cover the miles more smoothly and far more economically than any hot-shot driving a petrol-engined car on the accelerator and brake. And you arrive unstressed.</p>

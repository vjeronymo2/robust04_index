			<p>BFN     [Text] More questions than answers remain as the region  continues to discuss the controversial NAFTA accord. The latest  voice in what is proving to be a series of never-ending debates  is that of David Thompson. Thompson, the finance minister in  Barbados, says the region cannot afford to sit on the edge of  all that is happening.    NAFTA is a joint trade agreement signed last year between  the  United States, Mexico, and Canada. The big debate in Barbados  and the region is how the grouping will respond to NAFTA. There  already seems to be a split within Caricom [Caribbean Common  Market] circles as to whether or not the grouping should proceed  to enter NAFTA as a unit or to allow individual countries  desirous of doing so to be approved to proceed.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / People: Non-executive directors - MAI Richard Hooper, a consultant in media and telecommunications, will next month join the board of MAI, the television, advertising and financial services group 20 years after his first involvement with the company. From 1973-77 Hooper was managing director of Mills &amp; Allen Communications, part of Mills &amp; Allen, which eventually metamorphosed into MAI. It was during his early stint at Mills &amp; Allen Communications that Hooper met the present managing director of MAI, Lord Hollick, the Labour Peer. Since then Hooper, a former BBC trainee and Open University producer, has been director of Prestel, chief executive of value added systems and services at British Telecom and founding managing director of Super Channel. Hooper's experience of television should come in useful at MAI, which holds the majority stake in Meridian Broadcasting, the ITV franchise-holder for the south of England. Lord Hollick is also interested in the possibility of bidding for the Channel 5 franchise if a national channel is advertised. Hooper, 54, replaces Sir Graham Day who retires from the board having been a non-executive director since 1988.</p>

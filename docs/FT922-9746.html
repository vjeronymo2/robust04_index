			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (1): Hard-pressed suppliers seek signs of upturn - More than 3,000 manufacturers worldwide are hungry for recovery THE TWIN grinding wheels of world recession and political upheaval have worn down the Dollars 41bn world machine tool industry over the past two years, punching large holes into the optimism and self-confidence of the largest producers. Many of the estimated 3,000 builders of a huge variety of metal-cutting and metal-forming machines used in manufacturing - from the simplest lathes to the most sophisticated multi-function flexible manufacturing systems - have been feeling the pinch. According to the US magazine American Machinist, which annually collates global production and consumption figures, world output of machine tools fell 10 per cent last year to Dollars 40.9bn. The main culprits were downturns of varying length and intensity in leading western markets, which continue this year, and the collapse of markets in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union following the downfall of communism. Although the machine tool industry can always produce examples of companies flourishing in niche markets, the outlook can only get better for the bulk of producers. This is why manufacturers are attaching considerable importance to two leading machine tool exhibitions this month, Mach '92 from today until May 15 at the Birmingham National Exhibition Centre, and Metav, the German machine tool show at Dusseldorf, which runs from May 5 to 9. The shows are a chance, especially for British and German manufacturers, to show that new product development has continued despite market conditions which have exacerbated the European industry's chronic financial weakness - a result of its fragmented industrial structure. All the larger worldwide producers are aware, after all, that the demands of leading manufacturing customers for faster, more accurate and more flexible production techniques are increasing as they pursue their own global strategies. Big clients, with the exception of Japanese companies manufacturing in Japan, are no respecters of national boundaries when it comes to the purchase of machine tools. Reports abound in the industry of stockpiles of unsold equipment at dealers and distributors, especially in Europe. Even the Japanese manufacturers, which over the past 20 years have developed the strongest position in the market through a combination of high-volume, high quality production and marketing muscle, have been affected. Individual markets and industries have been hit in different ways by varying combinations of the current problems. In the UK, machine tool output fell last year to its lowest level in real terms since 1984, but producers are determined to survive and thus avoid wasting the improvements in product quality and delivery times forced on them after the 1980/81 recession. Although the UK producers have improved their export position strongly over the past decade, and particularly in the European community, their problems begin at home with a market that misses out on the financial incentives for manufacturing investment made elsewhere. This is compounded by the industry's lack of visibility and political clout, relatively less supportive banks and higher real interest rates - 'British producers tend to feel they have been left out to wither on the vine in a situation that was not of their own making,' says Mr Ron Bull, president of the UK Machine Tool Technologies Association. In the US, production fell about 20 per cent last year, in line with a 19 per cent decline in domestic consumption. Here too, though, the domestic producers are approaching export markets more systematically. Also, the position of the top two producers, Giddings &amp; Lewis and Cincinnati Milacron, has been strengthened over the past two years, raising hopes that the rise in import penetration by Japanese and European producers can be stemmed. THE mood in Germany, the largest producer in Europe, could almost be described as shell-shocked. Larger producers such as Maho, the big Bavarian-based milling machine builder, have been in the almost unprecedented situation of reporting losses. German producers are simply the victims of their own success. Germany is the world's biggest exporter in absolute terms, and along with the downturn in western markets, machine tool builders have had to cope with re-unification at home, which has not brought the bonanza seen in other sectors of mechanical engineering, such as construction equipment. On top of that comes tough new export restrictions introduced on militarily-sensitive industrial exports. But the biggest problem for the German producers has been the collapse of the eastern European and Soviet markets, where German machine tools financed by German banks dominated purchases of western equipment. For Japanese producers, too, the immediate outlook is gloomy. At the end of last year, monthly orders received were running about 40 per cent down on the previous year's levels, and output has been reduced since last summer due largely to the weakness of the domestic market. The downturn is a test of the financial strength of leading companies such as Amada, Yamazaki Mazak and Okuma, but also vindicates the big producers' strategy of expanding manufacturing overseas both to anticipate the European Single Market reforms and to forestall the trade friction that is inevitably fuelled by weak business conditions. And there is little evidence to suggest the big Japanese producers will emerge from the recession with their competitiveness damaged. Elsewhere, the Swiss machine tool industry, proportionately the world's biggest exporter with 88 per cent of output sold abroad, has been indirectly hit by the German downturn, while the large but technically unexciting Soviet industry is in disarray following collapse of the old purchasing networks. The near-disintegration of the Soviet industry, along with declines in output by east European countries which formerly relied heavily on trading within Comecon, has altered the global balance of power within the machine tool industry. According to American Machinist, both western Europe and the Pacific Rim countries were able to gain in share of the world's total output last year. The 12-nation Cecimo grouping in Europe raised its share of output from 45 per cent in 1990 to 48 per cent, while the Pacific Rim countries, headed by Japan but followed by Taiwan, China and South Korea, lifted their share from 29 per cent to 35 per cent. The question for the machine tool industry in the 1990s is whether further changes in the power balance are likely. The downturn in the Japanese market could encourage domestic producers either to try exporting more, or to step up overseas manufacturing, where the pace of investment has slowed in the past two years. At the same time, the ambitions of other Far Eastern producers - and, in particular, Taiwan which exports two-thirds of its production - may add to the pressure on producers in the US and Europe. ALTHOUGH the Taiwanese have not quite reached European or US levels of technical sophistication, their low labour costs give them a potential advantage on pricing. For European producers, that makes it all the more important to reduce manufacturing costs and increase the industry's financial strength. Most observers believe the pace of co-operation agreements and mergers between machine tool companies needs to be increased, and there is talk in Germany of bank-led initiatives to bring the bigger producers together. In the UK, 3,000 to 4,000 job-cuts in the current recession have widened the industry's relative cost advantage over German rivals, but raised a question over whether the industry can take advantage of the upturn - when it happens. On a brighter note, the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine as the UK's Trade and Industry Secretary has raised the hopes of machine tool builders on new financial stimuli for manufacturing investment. The future of the US industry will also depend partly on solutions to a similar problem in the domestic manufacturing base, according to Mr Daniel Meyer, Cincinnati Milacron's chairman and chief executive: 'Government can play an influencing role in incentives for investment. That's the underlying problem for US manufacturing.' The immediate question for virtually all machine tool-makers, however, is the timing of a recovery. All the evidence so far is sketchy, but there are signs that the US could be the first market to recover - Mr Meyer sees a recovery this year to 1990 levels but admits that was 'no great shakes.' There is less optimism about an immediate upturn on the continent, however, and in the UK a slight increase in order inquiries has yet to be matched by orders. Maybe Mach '92 will be the turning point.</p>

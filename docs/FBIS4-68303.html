			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Larin: "There are 360 Russians in the </F> Camps of Azerbaijan Refugees"]    [Text] At the invitation of the Russian community of  Azerbaijan, deputies of the State Duma Sergey Baburin, Ivan  Anichkin, Sergey Glotov and Anatoliy Greshnevikov visited the  Azerbaijan Republic from April 22 to 25.    The Russian parliament members met with the President of  Azerbaijan Gaydar Aliyev and other high-ranking officials of the  republic.    Members of the Russian parliament visited the camps of  Azerbaijan refuges from the regions of Azerbaijan that had been  occupied by Armenian armed formations.    As of today, Armenia has occupied around 20% of the  territory of the Azerbaijan Republic (including 7 regions  outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh proper: Agdam, Fizulin,  Lachin, Kelbajar, Jebrail, Kubatlin, and Zangelan). According to  official data of the Azerbaijan side, more than 700 populated  areas of Azerbaijan have been captured, and the majority of them  burned and looted. The area of the territories occupied by the  Armenian armed formations at present amounts to more than 17  thousand square kilometers. The advance of the Armenian  expeditionary corps continues, including active attempts to "cut  through" Tertery-Barda (Azerbaijan populated areas) and capture  the Tbilisi-Baku route.    The problem of refugees and forced emigrants, whose numbers  at present exceed 1 million (every seventh resident of  Azerbaijan), including 200 thousand refugee Azeris from Armenia,  is growing urgent. They are being accommodated in tent camps set  up by the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Turkish Republic, and  Arab charitable associations. As of today, 360 of the refugees  are Russian. Iran has undertaken to maintain 100 thousand  refugees and conducting a propaganda campaign about it.    The tent camps are in the steppe regions of Azerbaijan,  where  extremely high temperatures will set in within 1 to 1.5 months  and may result in deaths, particular of children.    The deputies note that after the hasty withdrawal of Russian  troops, and the virtual break in economic and cultural ties of  the Russian Federation with the Azerbaijan Republic, trust in  Russia on the part of the populace of Azerbaijan, including the  Russians, is steadily falling. In the opinion of the parliament  members, the region of vital Russian interests has gone without  due attention from the leadership of the Russian Federation and  the public, and this cannot continue.    They demand investigations into the statements of citizens  of  Azerbaijan that fighters are being recruited for the Armenian  armed formations on the territory of the Stavropol and Krasnodar  krays and the Rostov oblast of the Russian Federation.    Among the proposals of the members of the State Duma are:  immediate provision of material, financial and other assistance  (including the creation of a "cultural corridor") to the Russian  community in Azerbaijan, intensificaton of peace-making efforts  in the conflict zone, immediate withdrawal of Armenian troops  from occupied territories, creation of a Consultative Council  for Nagorno-Karabakh made up of representatives of sides with an  interest in a peaceful settlement, and provision of effective  assistance to refugees and forced emigrants from occupied  regions of Azerbaijan, including the establishment and  furnishing of a Russian tent camp, and delivery of medicines.</p>

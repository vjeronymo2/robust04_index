			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Cesar Gaviria's government has reaffirmed  it has violated neither the letter nor spirit of the  Constitution by authorizing the presence of foreign troops and  aircraft in national territory. Following the decision by the  Council of State--which is unconvinced by the president's  explanations on the issue--a copy of which was sent to the  Chamber of Representatives Commission to Investigate Charges and  to the Attorney General's Office, the Presidential Palace issued  the following declaration:    1. The Council of State, by saying the government's  explanations government are unconvincing, has adopted an  interpretation contrary to the traditional interpretation that  has prevailed in the nation for the past 45 years.    2. Therefore, points 1,2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Council of  State  statement on the absence of permission from the Senate or a  decision from the very council are the consequence of this new  interpretation. Neither Senate permission nor a Council of  State decision was requested, because it is considered we are  dealing with international treaties that do not so require.    3. The government does not believe the president of the  Republic has violated the letter or spirit of the Constitution.    4. The government has delivered to the media a copy of the  letter the president of the Republic has sent to the Council of  State in which the government cites what it considers a correct  interpretation of the Constitution on the issue.    5. What the Constitution seeks to establish is a procedure  for granting permits for the transit of foreign troops that have  intentions of war against third nations. It does not seek  whatsoever to regulate joint training operations, high-tech  operations, equipment maintenance, or technical assistance that  are part of international treaties in force.    6. The acceptance of the legal interpretation of the Council  of State would end military-technical cooperation between  Colombia and other nations, particularly cooperation on which  Colombia has insisted so much in its struggle against  drug-trafficking cartels.    7. Despite the Council of State's statement, this does not  have a bearing on the validity of international treaties signed  by Colombia, nor does it constitute a ruling or a sentence  regarding the government's conduct on the issue.    The Narino Presidential Palace declaration concludes by  stating President Cesar Gaviria is planning a news conference  during which he will once again broach the touchy issue.</p>

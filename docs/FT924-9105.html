			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Clinton appoints transition team GOVERNOR Bill Clinton yesterday made his first move since winning the US presidential election on Tuesday by naming Mr Vernon Jordan and Mr Warren Christopher to head the transition team managing the formation of his new administration. Mr Jordan, a lawyer, civil rights leader and former head of the National Urban League, will chair the transition team, with Mr Christopher, who served as deputy secretary of state in the Carter administration, in charge of day-to-day operations. Both men helped Mr Clinton with the selection of Senator Al Gore as his vice-presidential running mate, and their appointment to lead the transition team, in preference to some more overtly political aides such as Mr Mickey Kantor, chairman of the Clinton campaign, is viewed as a signal that the president-elect aims to take a pragmatic, issue-oriented approach to governing. Mr Christopher said the first priority was to set up an orderly process for the selection of Mr Clinton's cabinet, which will take office following his inauguration on January 20 next year. He expected economic policy posts to be the first filled, reflecting the initial priority of the new administration. Consideration would also be given to forming an economic council similar to the existing National Security Council. Mr Clinton, who spent yesterday nursing his ailing voice and continuing his telephone conversations with world leaders, has said he plans a 'laser' concentration on the economy. Senator George Mitchell, leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, added yesterday that he expected an economic programme in the first 100 days of the new administration. Mr Christopher, who has been suggested as a possible secretary of state or attorney general, said he assumed his role in the appointment of the government would rule him out for any prominent post in the future administration. He said he would not assume the same exclusion for other members of the team, which will include Mr Kantor, Mr Henry Cisneros, former mayor of San Antonio, former governor Madeleine Kunin of Vermont, and Mr Mack McLarty, chairman of the Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Company.</p>

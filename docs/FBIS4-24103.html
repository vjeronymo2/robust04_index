			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pedro Nacuo] </F>   [Excerpts] In northern Nampula Province, Islam has been  experiencing an unprecedented crisis over the past few years.  It is now clear that there is division among its followers.  There are three leading sects -- namely, the Mozambique Islamic  Congress, the Mozambique Islamic Council, and the Muhammadan  Association (Sunni sect). [passage omitted]    Leading Islamic figures in the Isle of Mozambique and in the  port city of Nacala say: "We are being invaded by Islamic  fundamentalism. The whole world knows the signs of it, notably  those relating to radicalism which leads to violence."    They made an accusation: "It is the Sudanese who have been  introducing Islamic fundamentalism here in Nacala and in the  Isle of Mozambique..."    We asked [Mozambique Islamic Council member] Habibo Amade  for  an explanation.    He said: "As a matter of fact the danger lies in that  interpretation because it has been fabricated in the West. We  ought to be very careful and realize that right now, in line  with what has been reported in the Western press, Islam is  regarded in the West as more dangerous because communism is no  longer around. So, there will be new fabrications and subtly  they will try to infiltrate us."    "Why would the West be so interested in, so to speak,  overthrowing or even weakening Islam?"    "The example from Bosnia is more than clear about that. Now  that there is an arms embargo, the West is doing its best to  prevent those people from defending themselves because they do  not want the establishment of an Islamic state in that part of  the world. They say it is a violent society and make other  accusations like the ones about Iran, Algeria, and other Islamic  countries." [passage omitted]</p>

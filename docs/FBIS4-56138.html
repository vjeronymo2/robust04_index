			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 25 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus  and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec today confirmed that former  Chilian dictator Augusto Pinochet, currently the commander of  the Chilean ground troops, would indeed come to the Czech  Republic. At the same time they distanced themselves from his  visit.    Zieleniec said today that Pinochet's visit had nothing to do  either with the Czech Government or with Czech authorities. He  said a Chilean delegation is touring European countries to study  the possibilities of military equipment purchases. The  delegation is to come to the Czech Republic at the invitation of  a commercial firm trading in arms. "There will be no contacts  between Czech Government representatives and this delegation,"  Zieleniec told journalists.    Zieleniec did not specify the firm which had invited the  Chilean delegation. According to diplomatic sources it is the  Omnipol joint stock company. The same sources told CTK that  Pinochet would come to the Czech Republic on Monday [30 May] to  stay for three days. CTK failed to contact Omnipol's  representatives today.    The Chilean Foreign Ministry today officially confirmed that  Pinochet would visit some European countries including the Czech  Republic and Slovakia. It refused, however, due to security  reasons, to give any details about his trip, including the date  of his departure and the precise number of the countries he  intends to visit.    Klaus told journalists the visit would take place "at the  invitation of our firms. Not to Pinochet but to a Chilean  military delegation which is coming to several European  countries, including the Czech Republic, to buy some equipment."  "As far as I know it is an exclusively private visit which is  not being organized by any Czech state institution," Klaus said.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Vit Kurfurst told CTK that the  ministry had not invited Pinochet and had not participated in  the preparation of his programme.</p>

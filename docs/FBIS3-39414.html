			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD (SVD): "NATO Has Not Requested Belgian </F> F-16's -- Which Have No Countermeasures"; as released by  Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 15 Feb (BELGA) -- NATO has made no request  to Belgium to supply planes for possible air strikes in Bosnia-  Herzegovina, the Belgian Defense Ministry stated on Tuesday [15  February].    But privately military officials confirm that the Belgian  F-16's are not sufficiently well equipped -- especially with  electronic countermeasures, designed to locate and perhaps jam  antiaircaft defense mechanisms such as those used by the Serbs  around Sarajevo -- to be used in an operation of this kind.  "Belgium has received no request for air power from NATO,"  declared a spokesman from the defense minister's office, Mr. Leo  Delcroix.    NATO's air and combined air and sea forces deployed in Italy  and the Adriatic consist of some 220 aircraft, including more  than 150 fighter planes supplied by the United States, France,  the Netherlands, Turkey, and Great Britain. But no Belgian  plane is included in this force, known as "deny flight" and  charged since 12 April 1992 with preventing any military flights  in the Bosnian airspace.    A senior air force official recently admitted that without  any electronic countermeasures (ECM) it would be difficult for  the Belgian F-16's to take to the sky over Bosnia without  jeopardizing the lives of the pilots. The Bosnian Serb Army is  equipped with numerous antiaircraft systems, often similar to  those used by the former Warsaw pact countries.    The F-16's, which are used in Belgium for both air combat  and  ground attack missions, are to be fitted from the beginning of  next year -- two years behind the initially scheduled date --  with their first "carapace" ECM systems, designed by the French  electronics company Serge Dassault (ESD).    Military sources report that four prototypes of the carapace  system have already been built by ESD following a lengthy  development phase which was completed in December 1992. Two  such systems have been fitted to planes which left for the  United States in April last year for twelve months of tests at  the Eglin test polygon (Florida).    Mr. Delcroix' office reports that production of the first  systems should begin in March. Delivery of the first planes  equipped with the ECM system is scheduled for early 1995, the  same source indicated.    The carapace system -- developed exclusively for Belgium --  is a purely passive system, which means it can detect an enemy  radar and inform the pilot. Ideally, it should be supplemented  by an active system able to jam radar systems. It does,  however, have the advantage of being fitted inside the aircraft,  thus leaving all arms attachment points free and not causing any  extra drag.    Observers recall that the lack of any ECM's on the F-16's  was  one of the reasons why mirage fighters had been preferred to  American fighters when Belgian planes were sent to Turkey just  before the outbreak of the Gulf war, in January 1991.    The Dutch and Turkish F-16's stationed in Italy and which  make daily flights over Bosnia are equipped with electronic  countermeasures. The Dutch Air Force has acquired a number of  ECM pods which can be attached to a wing or the fuselage. The  Turkish F-16's have internal ECM's.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Fractional decline at Liberty IN SPITE of a surge in interest charges from Pounds 475,000 to Pounds 1.23m, Liberty, the retailer and wholesaler of upmarket goods, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.23m in the year to February 2 1991. That represented only a marginal decline from Pounds 7.4m in the year to January 27 1990, and was the second-highest profit reported in its 125-year history. Turnover increased by some 9 per cent from Pounds 85.2m to Pounds 92.5m. Tax took Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 3.1m) and minorities Pounds 137,000 (Pounds 89,000), after which earnings per share came out at 26.13p (26.32p). A final dividend of 5.2p is proposed, making a total for the year of 6.9p (5.95p). Mr Harry Weblin, chairman, said that although the retail market had been extremely difficult, trading profit from retailing activities had improved from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 2.19m. The converting and wholesaling division had concentrated on exports, he said, but the adverse affect of currency fluctuations put pressure on margins, and trading profits here fell to Pounds 4.47m (Pounds 4.64m). Fabric printing in France showed substantial improvements in both sales and profitability, and there was a continuing demand for printing and dying. Property rents increased to Pounds 937,000 (Pounds 821,000).</p>

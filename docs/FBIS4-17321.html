			<p>BFN     [Text] Only one parliamentary faction, Yabloko, will not  sign the agreement on public accord, presidential aide Georgiy  Satarov declared at a briefing on Friday in the Kremlin  commenting on Boris Yeltsin's meeting with representatives of  Russia's leading political forces. In his words, all other  factions and parties are looking for their own ways to sign this  document.    Satarov underlined that the working group in charge of the  preparation of this agreement for signing still receives  proposals both from political structures and individuals. As he  said, the final text of the agreement is due to be ready on  April 26. On April 27 the State Duma will have to pass a  decision on the text which cannot be changed.    Satarov believes that the overwhelming majority of the  Russia's constituent regions and republics will sign the  agreement. According to available information, a total of nine  regions have still not reported about their decision to sign  this document.    Satarov informed journalists about the conversation held  between Yeltsin and participants of this meeting. He said that  Yeltsin had declared that his attitude to any group not signing  this agreement would not change so as to avoid a new spiral of  confrontation.</p>

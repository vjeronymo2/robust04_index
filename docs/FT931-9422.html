			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Sport: Big boys must not cry - Soccer THERE HAS been some sniggering. The first season of the Football Association's Premier League has been accompanied by a strident advertising campaign by BSkyB, its television paymaster, proclaiming: 'A whole new ball game.' Even those who are busy banking BSkyB's cash have found it difficult not to smirk. Robert Chase, chairman of Norwich City, said: 'They are the same teams as in last season's First Division, playing each other on the same pitches with the same players and watched by the same people. The only difference the average supporter on the terraces would notice is that the referee's shirt is a different colour.' But there is a difference. The league table tells the tale. The lead has changed hands 15 times this season, Norwich themselves are a close third after two-thirds of the season. Just below them are other surprise contenders Coventry City and Ipswich Town. If the top three keep collecting points at the same rate they have over the first 28 games, the champions will finish with about 76 points. This would equal Arsenal's total in 1989, the lowest since the change to three points for a win in 1982 and Arsenal played only 38 games. The top half of the Premier League contains only one championship winner from the last 24 seasons - Aston Villa, who won the league in 1981. The old order has changed and the redistribution of television wealth, which was the main plank of BSkyB's bid for the Premier League contract, has a lot to do with it. Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton are struggling below midway and Nottingham Forest are bottom. The table is topsy- turvy. This sort of volatile, tightly-packed league race was for many years the norm in the first division. Only after 1968 did the competition become increasingly limited to just a few big clubs. This period began and ended with Leeds United as champions - but it is, of course, the Liverpool era. In almost any ten-year period between 1919-20, when the first division settled at 22 clubs, and 1968, the average number of points gained by the champions was, at most, 58 - 16 ahead of the average club. The only blip was between 1957 and 1961, when the general standard was mediocre and a series of outstanding teams turned the championship race into a procession. In 1956-57, Manchester United's Busby Babes won their last championship with 64 points. The next year, Wolves also gained 64. In 1960-61, Spurs totalled 66. In 1969 the pattern changed. Leeds set a record of 67 points. The next 24 championships were shared by just seven clubs. Liverpool won 11, Arsenal, Leeds and Everton three each. In that time the champions averaged just over 60 points - the gap between the top teams and the rest had widened. Three points for a win did not discourage draws. These peaked in years when the chances of relegation grew: in 1973-4, when the number of relegation places rose, and in 1987-8, when the play-offs were introduced. The rich clubs were getting richer and richer and those with astute managers  -Bob Paisley at Liverpool, George Graham at Arsenal and Howard Kendall at Everton - used their financial muscle to overpower the competition. One source of increased revenue was Europe. When Liverpool won their first European Cup in 1977 they did so with the squad so astutely collected by Bill Shankly. A year later they won again with three 1977 purchases: Kenny Dalglish, bought for a British record fee, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen. The pattern of the next 15 years was set. The financial inequality increased in 1983. That year brought the first large television contract. It was worth Pounds 5.2m for two years, peanuts by today's standards, but, as with all the subsequent ITV contracts, the bulk of the cash went to the five or six clubs which could attract the biggest TV audiences. It was also the year that the big clubs persuaded the Football League to allow home teams to keep gate receipts rather than share them with the away team. Even the European ban could not erode the big boys' advantage. The ten championships after those reforms were shared by Everton, Arsenal and Liverpool. They won their titles with a quality of play that has not been seen this season. But, off the pitch, English soccer became a sour and unpleasant game. A cheque-book madness crept in. It reached its apogee in 1991 when Liverpool paid Pounds 2.9m for Dean Saunders - a player they did not need and who did not fit their style - simply, it seemed, to stop him joining one of their rivals. There were seemingly endless wrangles between the clubs over the growing pot of television and sponsorship money. The break-up of the old Football League last season was the inevitable, disillusioning result of all this. But at least it has brought a temporary rebalancing of power. The changes have been wrought by BSkyB and also by the Taylor report on safety. Every Premier League ground must be all-seater by the 1994-5 season. Converting stadia costs money. For the big clubs with big stadia it is disproportionally more expensive. Turning terracing into seats involves a loss of between a third and a half of capacity. For medium-sized teams with lots of empty terracing this is not a problem. They can refurbish. Clubs drawing near-capacity crowds must rebuild to seat all their fans. The maximum Football Trust grant of Pounds 2m goes a long way at Norwich or Ipswich. It is a spit in the ocean at Anfield or Highbury. Ipswich and Norwich, the two clubs closest to meeting the requirements, lie third and fourth in the table, Arsenal are 12th and Liverpool 13th. One sign that the big clubs are feeling the pinch is the moribund transfer market. In November, for example, total spending was half what it was in the same period a year earlier. The bulk of activity this season has come from Blackburn Rovers and Derby County, which are spending not revenue but the private fortunes of their owners. When the new stands at Highbury, Anfield and Old Trafford are completed, with executive boxes, banqueting suites and expensive seats, the balance of power will tip back. But for now there is the prospect of an old-fashioned title scramble to look forward to. The favourites are the wealthiest of them all, Manchester United, who are rebuilding Old Trafford but still have a little cash to spare. Over the last 25 years they have provided a healthy antidote to the worst excesses of the Liverpool era. They spent more money than anyone else in an increasingly dour, desperate and vain pursuit of the title, but providing a healthy reminder that there is more to soccer than cash. This year United have been relatively restrained in the marketplace. Their one purchase was Eric Cantona for a modest Pounds 1m. He has helped the Alex Ferguson's abrasive team rediscover the joy of football. If United win the title for the first time since 1967 it really would begin a new era.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Pumping ends today at Durham colliery Pumping at disused Murton colliery in County Durham is to end today after detailed technical discussions between British Coal and the National Rivers Authority, the river pollution watchdog. The NRA said yesterday that it was satisfied that the end of pumping at Murton, which ceased production two years ago, would not cause water pollution. But British Coal, which has been spending about Pounds 6m annually on pumping in the Durham field, will retain mine shafts at the former Dawdon and Easington collieries, to which Murton's abandoned workings are linked, so pumping could resume if required.</p>

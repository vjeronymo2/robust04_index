			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER RAIL LINES  </P> <P> Why can't the citizenry of Los Angeles County show some foresight and guts? We  now have the opportunity to purchase rights of way for a basic transportation  system from the railroads. Yet some are adamantly opposed to doing anything  except maybe "study" until the idea is dead or it's too late.  </P> <P> Now is the time to act. In five or 10 years the cost will be five or 10 times  greater and the transportation smog problem in the basin will be further away  from a solution than ever.  </P> <P> If the idea is not feasible, the County Transportation Commission can sell the  property for an enormous profit and spend it on some other system.  </P> <P> A.C.

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Springboard for 'Somewhere' UNDER the aegis of its Springboards Festival, the National Theatre is staging a series of new plays at its own Cottesloe Theatre, in collaboration with the Royal Court Upstairs and Bush Theatres in London, and with studios at the Leicester Haymarket Theatre, the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and the Salisbury Playhouse. This welcome association comprises nine plays, and continues until July. Springboards opens at the Liverpool Playhouse Studio with Somewhere by Judith Johnson. The series looks diverse and exciting, and should be a fillip for new writing. The regional work will arrive in April and May at the Cottesloe sure of a venue; while in Leicester and Liverpool, where two of the plays open, the productions will have the prospect and purpose of a London run. At Liverpool, Somewhere is an affecting, discursive play about the effects of the 1980s on people now. It opens on school leaving day, when the role models were Sid Vicious and Debbie Harry, and when every cigarette was clamped between thumb and second finger and smoked with an anarchic squint. The music was Punk and the tattoos, like the entertainment, home-made. The play follows a group of teenagers through a month's partying, and fixes on the loose relationship between Dawn, a strong, wild girl revelling in her capacity to shock, and Lee, a quiet manic likely to burst into violence. Around them are victims, co-dependents and one Thatcherite - 'I want to be an entrepreneur, me.' Lee becomes a soldier throughout the 1980s, demobbed after Desert Storm; Dawn becomes a prostitute in King's Cross and now Amsterdam, where the two meet ten years on in a brothel, still in love. Somewhere tries to uncover the past while developing a situation in the present. The balance is not yet right, tilted more toward reminiscence - fine 1980s retrospective - than current interchange. Perhaps a larger theatre and a revolving stage would juxtapose past and present more starkly. Since no plot imposes a structure on the piece, the pacing of scenes is crucial. Here, the lighting (Mark Rickards) and the direction (Polly Teale) could drive the action faster and focus it sharper. The simple, strong staging works well in the studio space: a lounge becomes a park and a coffee-table a coffin within a wire fence set. Johnson's dialogue is funny, brash, bawdy and clever, but it leaves too little unsaid. However, she has written two fine strong parts for Katrina Levon (Dawn) and John Hannah (Lee); both act them with power and conviction, and it is these performances which carry the play. Other highlights include Karl Draper as a sad thug too timid to leave his home town and Ian Dunn as Barry the barman, now the nightclub entrepreneur he always dreamed of becoming. Liverpool Playhouse Studio until April 17; Cottesloe Theatre, London from April 24 to May 15. Information about Springboards on 071-633-0880</p>

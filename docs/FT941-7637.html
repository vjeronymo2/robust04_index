			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Fund managers face private trading curbs: Protecting US investors The firing of a senior fund manager for failing to report details of his private share dealings has started a debate in the US mutual fund industry over the widespread practice of managers trading their own share portfolios while running large investment funds. Mutual funds regulations may be tightened to ensure investors do not lose confidence in the huge US fund industry. There is no law against fund managers trading stocks for themselves while managing their clients' money. They are required, however, to inform their company when they do so. It is up to the company to ensure managers do not conduct trades that benefit themselves at their customers' cost. Such abuse includes illegal practices such as 'front running' (fund managers buying shares for themselves before buying them for the fund), accepting hidden fees from a company when they buy its shares for the fund, or accepting favours from a client who does business with the fund (such as being granted privileged access to private stock placements). The firing in January of Mr John Kawecke, a successful and high-profile money manager at the Invesco fund group, was not as a result of illegal behaviour. He was accused of failing to report his personal trades to the fund company. Mr Kawecke's departure attracted a lot of attention because he was well known in the industry and the publicity quickly led to revelations of apparently similar cases at a number of leading fund companies. A few days after Mr Kawecke was fired, for example, it was revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating personal trades by employees of Fidelity, the country's largest fund group. Other cases involving possible conflicts of interest in fund managers' dealings were publicised, including the news that the Chicago-based investment group Kemper had paid Dollars 9.8m in October to settle government charges that one of its mutual fund managers had kept profitable futures trades for an employee profit-sharing account while dumping unprofitable trades into two of the firm's mutual funds. Fund companies and politicians in Washington began to worry that investors would start to lose confidence in the mutual fund industry. At the behest of Congressman Edward Markey, the chairman of a House finance subcommittee, the SEC launched a study into fund managers' trading activities. The Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry trade body, has announced the launch of its own study into fund managers' personal share dealings. Like the rest of the industry, it sees nothing wrong in fund managers running their own portfolios. It is, and always has been, a common practice. 'Most companies believe (allowing managers to run their own portfolios) keeps them hungry, and ensures that they're paying attention to their funds. It's a way of keeping people sharp,' says Mr Jim Coursey, a mutual fund industry analyst who works for Morningstar, the Chicago-based financial services and information firm. However, Mr Stanley Sporkin, a Washington DC district court judge who led the SEC's enforcement division during the 1970s, believes the industry should, to eliminate all possible conflicts of interest, consider requiring professionals to place their investments in a blind trust while they manage mutual funds. The debate has focused attention on the broader concern that the mutual fund industry may have outgrown its regulatory framework. The industry's recent growth has been dramatic. In 1980, just 6 per cent of all households owned mutual funds worth Dollars 135bn. Today, 27 per cent of all households, or almost 40m people, have more than Dollars 2,000bn invested in funds. Although most observers believe the regulations are adequate, some legislators are worried that the SEC, the chief regulator of mutual funds, lacks the staff to enforce them properly. The structure of the industry has also changed. Whereas once, only investment firms and securities houses sold mutual funds, today commercial banks are aggressively marketing in-house mutual funds to depositors. Legislators fear that as banks become more involved in the securities industry through mutual funds and other activities, regulators will find it increasingly difficult to determine the safety and soundness of bank finances. They also fear that customers may be buying mutual funds from banks without realising that their investments, unlike the money in their bank account, are not backed by a federal guarantee. Congressman Markey would like to see banks conduct all their mutual fund and other securities industry-type activities in separate corporate entities. He also would like the SEC to take on more staff to regulate the fund industry, and wants regulations governing the marketing of mutual funds by banks tightened so that customers are fully informed about what they are buying.</p>

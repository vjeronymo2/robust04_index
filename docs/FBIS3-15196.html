This  would agree with Russia's plans and tactical and strategical  goals, he added. Ukraine cannot afford financing the  construction of the ship alone. Meanwhile, the Varyag is  blocking the embankment, creating problems and incurring new  expenses. The project has already cost the budget a pretty  penny and it would be absurd to scrap the ship. Shipyard  officials are now in Kiev to discuss the future of the ship.</p>

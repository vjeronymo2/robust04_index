If this demand is not conceded Sudan will reject the  report in its entirety and will review its cooperation with the  UN agenda on human rights. This was stated in letters sent by  Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih to the UN secretary general,  the chairman of the Human Rights Committee, the ICO secretary  general and the OAU secretary general.    A responsible source at the Foreign Ministry told SUNA that  the letters explained that the report contained paragraphs  serious in their meanings and aims, but reflecting a lack of  respect for Islam. Biro called for action against the Sudanese  penal code, which is derived from Islamic law [word indistinct]  international and demanded that it be canceled.    The letters pointed out that because the rapporteur's  allegations had wronged the whole Muslim nation, he must be  interrogated and condemned by all states, organizations and  bodies which respect the right of all peoples to choose their  legal and political systems.    Moreover, the people's organization in defense of faith and  homeland in a statement today called on the UN secretary general  to withdraw Biro's report, to put the rapporteur on trial  immediately, and to expel him from the United Nations. The  United Nations should also apologize to the Islamic nation.</p>

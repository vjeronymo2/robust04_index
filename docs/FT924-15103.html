			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Senate overrides Bush's veto of cable TV bill THE US Senate yesterday overrode President George Bush's refusal to sign a bill regulating the cable television industry in its first successful challenge of the presidential veto since Mr Bush came into office. Congress has failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to overturn Mr Bush's veto on 35 previous occasions. Despite last-minute lobbying of senators by Mr Bush, the Senate voted by 74 to 25 with one abstention to back the legislation, which would empower the Federal Communications Commission to set 'reasonable' rates for basic cable services, except in the few districts where cable operators already face competition. The House was also due to vote on the legislation again, which it originally passed by 280 votes to 128, or by more than the necessary two-thirds margin. Since de-regulation in 1984 prices for basic cable services have risen by more than 50 per cent. Broadcast television and consumer groups have mounted extensive advertising campaigns backing the legislation and attacking what they see as the cable companies' exploitation of monopoly positions in many districts. The tussle over the cable legislation had become a test of political strength in the final weeks ahead of the US presidential election. While debate over the issue sometimes cut across party lines, Mr Bush's opposition to the bill allowed Democrats to paint him as siding with the interests of the cable industry against the consumer. However, Mr Bush opposed the legislation on the grounds that regulation of the industry would push up, rather than cut, cable rates because of provisions laying down service standards and requiring cable companies to negotiate with broadcasting stations before carrying their signals. The legislation would 'cost American jobs and discourage investment in telecommunications,' he said.</p>

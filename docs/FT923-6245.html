			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Papua New Guinea gold mine to reopen THE TROUBLED alluvial gold mine at Mount Kare in Papua New Guinea is to reopen following the completeion of a deal between CRA, the majority shareholder, and Placer Pacific, operator of the nearby Porgera mine. Mount Kare, located in PNG's rugged highlands, was closed in January after an attack by gunmen who destroyed equipment and caused damage estimated at more than USDollars 1m. Placer Pacific said that Placer Niugini, its Papua New Guinean subsidiary, would operate the Mount Kare mine on behalf of CRA, which owns 51 per cent of the alluvial rights, and local landowners, who own 49 per cent. CRA will lend about Dollars 1.5m to finance the recommencement of mining, it added. The deal replaces an earlier agreement under which CRA planned to sell all but 12.75 per cent of the alluvial rights and 25 per cent of its hard rock prospecting rights in the surrounding area. Placer said that the first gold from the reopened mine would be produced in early September. It expected Placer to take about three months to bring the mine back to full production. Mt Kare is capable of producing up to 25,000 troy ounces of gold a year from alluvial mining, compared with more than 1m ounces a year at Porgera, one of Papua New Guinea's biggest mines. The Australian government yesterday cleared the way for development to go ahead at an ADollars 290m (Pounds 104m) zinc, lead and silver mine planned by MIM at Macarthur River in the Northern Territory. The Macarthur River scheme is the first major project to be processed through a fast-track approval procedure introduced by the government earlier this year to shorten the lead time between the discovery and development of mineral deposits. Mr Laurie Brereton, parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, said the mine had been approved on the recommendation of the Foreign Investment Review Board, following a review of proposed participation by four Japanese companies. Mr Brereton said that the approval represented a 'showpiece for what the new facilitation arrangements are all about'. The government also said that it would fast-track proposals put forward by Zapotan for a gold mine at Mount Todd in the Northern Territory.</p>

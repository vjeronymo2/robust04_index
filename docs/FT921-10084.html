			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity The striking thing about the price deal announced yesterday between eight of the UK's regional electricity companies and their regulator was the ease with which it was reached. Clearly the RECs could teach the generators a thing or two about keeping on the right side of the Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer). Granted, Offer adopted a moderate position from the outset last October, so the odds were always on the companies avoiding a damaging confrontation. Yesterday's modest settlement on next year's price increases means they will not have to compromise their progressive dividend policies. Consumers have less reason to be pleased. But at least the settlement means they will pay Pounds 35m less next year in compensation for having been overcharged before. Neither do the RECs have much to fear from Offer's remarks on the general need to reduce the role of inflation forecasts in setting prices. The implication seems to be that Offer would prefer to impose its own central forecast. That might prove awkward if Offer were to err persistently on the low side; but if so, it would bear the blame for subsequent price increases. True to form, the RECs' shares barely reacted yesterday. Over the last year, the shares have been moved principally by political sentiment. The curious thing is that the sector's present yield premium to the market is not far short of past peaks coinciding with Labour's largest leads in the opinion polls. While the market is demanding such a wide degree of comfort, there seems little additional investment risk attached to a Labour victory. If the Tories were to be re-elected, the shares would be correspondingly cheap.</p>

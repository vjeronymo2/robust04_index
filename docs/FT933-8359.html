			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on the franc IN THE WAKE of the recent turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism, dealers will look for more pressure on the French franc and the Danish krone this week, writes James Blitz. On Friday both currencies were subjected to a new bout of selling against the D-Mark, with the French currency dropping to its lowest London close against the D-Mark. The Danish krone also fell sharply, ending more than 8.5 percentage points lower than the D-Mark in the ERM grid. Many currency dealers are certain the franc is heading for the FFr3.60 level against the D-Mark. The big question is whether it will get there sooner rather than later. Dealers will wait to see what the Bank of France does to interest rate policy in its money market operations today and on Thursday. The country's industrial production figures for June, due out the same day, could also depress the franc if they are particularly bad. Dealers will also look closely at France's weekly foreign exchange reserve figures on Thursday to see whether the central bank has restored them since the widening of the ERM's fluctuation bands. In Germany, the M3 money supply figures for July are due at the end of the week and these will indicate how big a monetary overhang there is after the Bundesbank's intervention in currency markets. Economists at Paribas Capital Markets anticipate a rise to 8.2 per cent from 7.0 per cent in June. In the UK, attention will focus on prospects for another cut in interest rates. The Retail Prices Index, due on Wednesday, will reveal whether there are further inflationary pressures in the economy. The UK's visible trade figures, due on Friday, will indicate whether exports have been adversely affected by the pound's recent strength.</p>

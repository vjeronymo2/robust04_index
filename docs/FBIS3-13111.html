The incident occurred when a Border Police  patrol was stoned, and troops opened fire at stone throwers.  One person was killed and the second fatally wounded. Attempts  by an Army doctor to save his life failed. Hospital officials  in Hebron named the victims as 25-year-old Samir Duwayq, and  22-year-old Wahil al-Natshah.    There was also unrest in the Gaza Strip today. An Associated  Press photographer was lightly wounded by a rubber bullet when  soldiers dispersed a riot in the Jabalyah refugee camp. Also in  Jabalyah, an Israeli Army patrol caught 22-year-old 'Amr Ahmad  Matar, who is suspected of killing 80-year-old Morris Eisenstadt  on the day of the Hebron massacre.    In Bani-Suhaylah, the car of two terrorists who attacked a  police jeep and slightly wounded a soldier and policeman has  been found. It was burned out and contained many blood stains  and bullet holes.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Increase in prison places heads priorities Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, announced that funding for Home Office services next year would be nearly Pounds 6.3bn. The funding allows for: Maintaining the current level of policing. Extra prison places. New measures to combat juvenile crime. Mr Howard said: 'Alongside the very considerable public investment which we are providing for over the next three years, we expect significant private capital investment in prisons and other areas. 'Spending on the police service in England and Wales next year will increase by more than 4 per cent over this year's provision. This will sustain current levels of policing and provide for the organisational reforms announced in the recent white paper as well as changes in pay, conditions and rank structure announced in response to the Sheehy report. 'For the prison service, priority will be given to increasing the number of prison places in order to accommodate the offenders we expect to be sentenced to custody. Over 2,000 extra places will be provided by 1996-97 through building houseblocks at existing prisons.'</p>

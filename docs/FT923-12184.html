			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Regional airlines warn of fare rises AIR FARES within the UK and to the rest of Europe may rise if new charges proposed by the Civil Aviation Authority are brought in, the European Regional Airlines association warned yesterday. The CAA is proposing to increase landing and take-off charges to help pay for better air traffic control equipment. Airlines overflying the UK, largely from the US, would therefore pay a lower proportion of the CAA's total income. Mr Mike Ambrose, director-general of the association, said: 'Airlines using smaller aircraft providing essential regional services would be worst affected. They would seek to recover these additional costs through fare increases.' The changes also mean greater costs for the CAA and less for the European air traffic control organisation. The CAA said the reorganisation of charges was a proposal and it was seeking responses from airlines. Any changes should be finalised by the end of the year and in operation from April. The changes in air traffic control should allow 30 per cent more aircraft to use the same airspace.</p>

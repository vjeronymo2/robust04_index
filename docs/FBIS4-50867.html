			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- The state-run Export-Import  Bank of the Republic of China [ROC] is planning to open a  reprsentative office in Vietnam as part of its efforts to help  promote the government's "southern strategy," a spokesman for  the bank said Saturday [21 May].    The strategy encourages Taiwan manufacturers to increase  investment in Southeast Asia.    If all goes well, the spokesman pointed out, the Vietnamese  office will be the bank's second such office in Asia. The bank  established an office in Jakarta, Indonesia in 1990.    The bank, which renders services in overseas investment  credit and insurance as well as medium and long-term  export-import loans, will be able to give a helping hand to  Taiwan investors intending to go to Vietnam, he elaborated.    Taiwan was the largest foreign investor in Vietnam at the  end  of 1993 with 117 investment projects totaling U.S.$1.53 billion.    Currently, only two Taiwan financial institutions maintain  offices in the Indochinese country. The International  Commercial Bank of China has a representative office in Ho Chi  Minh City and the Cathay Investment and Trust Co., Ltd.  maintains a branch in Hanoi.    The spokesman stressed that the export-import bank is  willing  to help pioneer Taiwan's overseas markets.    To help achieve the goal, he said, the bank opened offices  in  Mexico City, Mexico and Budapest, Hungary last year.</p>

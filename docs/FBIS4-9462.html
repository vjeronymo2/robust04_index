			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 24 -- Lignite miners continued their  protest action on Sunday [24 April] requesting that the demands  of the Solidarity trade union and these concerning their branch  be implemented and the decision on restructuring the lignite  mining industry be revoked. The strike that started on Thursday  is to be staged until further notice.    In view of the strike adversly affecting the country's power  resources, Director of the National Power Control Centre Jerzy  Tabaka on Sunday resolved that radio communiques reporting about  the power supplies for industry and inhabitants would be resumed  after a two-year break.    Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol appealed to the miners  to stop their action and start negotiations but the miners  refused to start talks with the government claiming that the  decision on the restructuring of lignite industry had not been  revoked.    "Determination among the striking miners is growing and the  protest action may escalate, leader of the national protest  action headquarters of the lignite mines Solidarity Union  Zdzislaw Boksa told PAP on Sunday afternoon. [no closing  quotation mark as received]    Minister Marek Pol confirmed Sunday that he had suspended  his  decision concerning transformations in the lignite industry  until the time the way of transformations is worked out by  representatives of the government, trade unions and employers.    Under Minister Pol's decision the existing lignite mines and  power engineering plants were to be transformed into three  holding companies.    Head of the National Commission of the Solidarity Trade  Union  Marian Krzaklewski said that the government was recognizing the  strike as a "trial of strength."    The striking miners are providing power generating plants  with only enough fuel to keep the furnaces just operating.  Officials at the Industry and Trade Ministry responsible for  the power engineering sector were put on "alert" in connection  with the strike, Grazyna Lewandowska, spokeswoman for Industry  and Trade Minister Marek Pol, said Sunday afternoon.    She explained that talks with the striking miners can be  started any time and added that Minister Marek Pol, who had been  out of Warsaw for personal reasons, would come to the ministry  on Sunday night.    The strike in lignite mines proved to be profitable for hard  coal power generating plants which say that due to limitations  in lignite-generated power they are able to sell larger amounts  of their product.    "We are able to satisfy the country's demand for power for a  certain period of time," Wladyslaw Wojcik from "Siersza" power  generating plant in Trzebinia, Katowice Province, said.    He added that due to the existing situation the plant can  work "at full steam." The problem is that power generated from  hard-coal is more expensive due to the costs of hard-coal  extraction.</p>

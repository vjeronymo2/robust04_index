"I  am extremely grateful for this cooperation."    Angelov is visiting Energy &amp; Environment Netherlands  (E&amp;EN)  in Zoetermeer, the organization set up two years ago to help  Netherlands companies secure contracts within the context of aid  for Central and East Europe. Over the past few days, he has  established contacts for projects concerned with the improvement  of gas supplies, the generation of electricity, coal  vaporization, the cleaner combustion of lignite, and  technological training in his country.    Bulgaria relies heavily on Russian supplies of natural gas,  nuclear energy, and lignite for its energy requirements.  Lignite is the only energy source that is amply available in  Bulgaria, but the processing and combustion of lignite cause  tremendous environmental pollution, forming dust and emitting  sulfur into the atmosphere. Consequently, Deputy Minister  Angelov is enthusiastic about the new technology that the  Rotterdam-based company Ecofire is implementing at a lignite  mine to the northwest of Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, following  arbitration by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and E&amp;EN.  "The  pilot project that Ecofire is putting into practice in  conjunction with us is working superbly. I hope that it will be  extended rapidly on a commercial scale, because we want to  comply with Western environmental standards as soon as  possible." [passage omitted]    Over the past few days, Angelov has also signed a contract  with several Netherlands companies covering technological  training for Bulgarians who are going to set up a gas  distribution system in his country. A next step, which could  also mean orders for the Netherlands, will involve the  construction of pipelines, control equipment, pumps, and  compressors. The engineer Hans de Ruiter, the CEO [chief  executive officer] of E&amp;EN, believes that Netherlands energy  companies like Gasunie, and the major distribution companies in  this sector, can do far more to conquer a share of the East  European market. "Look at what British Gas, Gaz de France, and  German companies are doing in Hungary, Poland, and the Czech  Republic. They pay for the first feasibility studies and then  receive contracts as a matter of course." De Ruiter believes  that the shareholders of Gasunie -- Shell and Esso -- are  clinging to the brakes. As a result, the ideal envisioned by  Prime Minister Lubbers, who saw a leading role being set aside  for Netherlands companies with his energy plan for East Europe,  is materializing slowly.    Probably together with the Delft-based company Hagoort,  Gasunie will advise Bulgaria on the storage of natural gas in an  empty gas field to the north of Sofia. Bulgaria urgently needs  a buffer of this kind, because the supply of Russian gas is  being interrupted due to technical or political problems.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / US inflation tepid despite rapid growth US consumer price inflation remains subdued despite further evidence of robust economic growth, official figures indicated yesterday. The Labour Department said consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent last month and by 2.7 per cent in the year to November - in line with market projections. The 'core' consumer price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components and thus provides a better guide to underlying trends, rose only 0.1 per cent last month and by 2.8 per cent on an annual comparison. Over the past three months core consumer prices have been even better behaved, rising at only 2.3 per cent a year. The encouraging inflation figures were not expected to dissuade the Federal Reserve from pushing short-term interest rates higher in coming months, although they reduced pressure for a rise next week. Separate figures from the Federal Reserve yesterday indicated the economy was rapidly absorbing spare productive capacity. Industrial production rose 0.5 per cent last month, bringing the gain in the past year to 5.7 per cent. Manufacturing output rose 0.8 per cent last month and by 6.7 per cent on an annual basis. The rate of capacity utilisation in manufacturing rose to 84.4 per cent, well above the long-run average. Production gains were broadly based with output of consumer goods, business equipment and construction supplies rising 0.6 per cent, 0.7 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively last month. Figures yesterday also showed a small increase in the current account deficit to Dollars 41.7bn (Pounds 26.7bn) in the third quarter from Dollars 37.9bn in the second period. While agreeing that immediate prospects for economic growth and inflation are excellent, many US forecasters have reservations about the outlook for 1995.</p>

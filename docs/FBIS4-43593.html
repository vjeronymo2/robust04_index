			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, who returned  last night from his visits to United States and London,  expressed hope that a new approach and process on the Cyprus  issue would soon begin. He said: The process should begin from  the UN secretary general's latest report and, after seeking  various options, aim at creating political will on the Turkish  side. Mr. Mikhailidhis added: The Greek Cypriot side is  interested in knowing the other side's position on the  confidence-building measures [CBM's] so that the new process may  offer us the possibility to deal with more vital questions.  Such questions, he explained, are all those that affect  Turkey's lack of political will, such as the presence of  occupation troops in Cyprus, questions of security, guarantees  of a possible solution, questions of settlers, and a series of  other questions.    Mr. Mikhailidhis said that he reiterated to his  interlocutors  the Cyprus Government's positions on the various aspects of the  Cyprus issue and expressed his satisfaction of the UN secretary  general's crystal clear stand on the 21 March document. Mr.  Mikhailidhis added that he will brief President Glavkos  Kliridhis today on the substance of his meetings in the United  States and London. He noted that he will also brief President  Kliridhis on the information he exchanged with Greek Deputy  Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou with whom he travelled from  London. Mr. Papandreou and Mr. Theodhoros Pangalos concluded  their contacts in London on behalf of the European Union's [EU]  Greek presidency within the framework of preparations for the EU  summit in Corfu.    Referring to criticism on some of his visits, Mr.  Mikhailidhis expressed his regret because, he said, some people  should be a little patient until they are briefed on what  actually happened. He also hoped that all the political parties  would like to hear the views of the permanent and nonpermanent  Security Council members, which will determine further  developments.</p>

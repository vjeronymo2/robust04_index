			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Royal Bank of Canada posts strong recovery Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), the country's biggest financial institution, has underlined the banking sector's robust recovery by almost quadrupling annual earnings. RBC is the first Canadian financial services group to post annual profits of more than a billion dollars, with net earnings climbing to CDollars 1.17bn (USDollars 852m), or CDollars 3.19 a share, in the year to October 31. Earnings the previous year, totalling CDollars 300m, or 46 cents a share, were dented by hefty restructuring charges and loan write-downs. Return on equity improved to 16.8 per cent from 2.4 per cent. RBC, with assets of CDollars 173.1bn on October 31, ascribed the strong improvement mainly to sharply lower loan losses, a shrinking non-performing loan portfolio and the absence of one-time restructuring charges. Loan-loss provisions were more than halved to CDollars 820m from CDollars 1.75bn, but the drop includes a CDollars 250m reversal in general provisions. Non-performing loans at the year end fell 36 per cent to CDollars 2.1bn. RBC was hit in the early 1990s by heavy exposure to the troubled property market, especially in the Toronto area, and to resource industries. The bank has written off 15 per cent of its commercial real estate exposure. Loans to business and government have shrunk by 3 per cent in the past year as part of efforts to reduce exposure to large companies and to commercial property. The strongest growth has come from personal financial services, including a 36 per cent jump in mutual fund revenues and a 64 per cent rise in the fledgling insurance arm. Residential mortgages and consumer loans rose by 1 per cent. RBC strengthened its personal finance business in 1993 with the acquisition of Royal Trust, Canada's second-biggest trust and loan company. It now has close to 3,950 automated teller machines, giving it the widest ATM network of any North American bank. In spite of the Royal Trust takeover, RBC's payroll has dropped from 52,700 to 49,200 in the past year, reflecting aggressive efforts to cut costs.</p>

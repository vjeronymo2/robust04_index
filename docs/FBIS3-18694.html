			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Leaders of the Baltic and Nordic countries are  holding a conference in Stockholm today. Here is Audrius  Braukyla with more details about it:    [Braukyla] Efforts by the Baltic states to become members of  the European Union were assessed positively by the Nordic  countries, Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius said.    Together with the colleagues from Latvia and Estonia, the  Lithuanian delegation headed by him held a discussion today with  the prime ministers of the Nordic states. According to  Linkevicius, [word indistinct] especially strong political  support by the Nordic countries to the Baltic states in the  spheres of security and economic cooperation.    The problem of the withdrawal of the Russian troops from  Latvia and Estonia, which was the main topic of discussion, has  been reflected in the statement made today by the five Nordic  states. It stresses, among other things, that it is important  that the Russian troops were withdrawn by the date that had been  fixed by Russia itself--that is by 31 August 1994.    Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, speaking at a news  conference, stated categorically that the withdrawal of the  troops was the norm of international law and that it should not  be linked with any other issues.    Answering a question regarding what the reaction of the  Nordic countries, and especially Sweden, would be in case a  danger to the independence of the Baltic states arose, the head  of the Swedish Government said that the danger to Lithuania,  Latvia, and Estonia would also mean the same danger to the  Nordic countries, as well as a danger to all of Europe. In this  case, not only the Nordic states would have to react, but also  the entire international community.    However, according to Bildt, it is too early to think about  direct military assistance by the Nordic states to the Baltic  countries in the event of aggression.    The observers think that cooperation between the Baltic  states and Nordic countries based on the formula five plus three  is gaining momentum. According to Latvian Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs, the Baltic states are absolutely satisfied at the  moment with the assistance received from the Nordic states. He  said that today's meeting was an important stage in the  implementation of specific projects.    This is Audrius Braukyla for Lithuanian Radio from  Stockholm.</p>

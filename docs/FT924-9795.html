			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Schlesinger sets terms for interest rate cuts THE BUNDESBANK yesterday set a string of conditions for further cuts in German domestic interest rates and said it would not allow its monetary policies to be dictated by financial markets, Reuter reports from Leipzig. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the bank's president, told reporters in the east German city of Leipzig that lower rates depended on success in cutting public sector deficits, on the level of wage deals in the 1993 pay round, and on reining in money growth. His deputy, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, told a news conference in Hamburg that the Bundesbank aimed to keep short-term German money market rates below 9 per cent. He added, however: 'We will not allow ourselves to be pushed in one direction or the other by market expectations. We will make a sovereign decision.' Both men were speaking at events to mark the election of new vice-presidents to two regional German central banks. Mr Schlesinger's remarks were interpreted on some markets as meaning that further cuts in official Bundesbank interest rates may be more distant than market analysts had expected. German interest rate levels have forced other western governments to keep their own rates up to defend their currencies against the strong D-Mark, despite a desire to make borrowing cheaper for recession-hit industry and consumers.</p>

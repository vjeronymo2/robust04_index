			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lulu Yu] </F>   [Text] Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has agreed to  sell its remaining 15.1 percent stake in South China Morning  Post Holdings (SCMP) to Malayan United Industries (MUI) -- a  Malaysian conglomerate controlled by reclusive tycoon Khoo Kay  Peng -- for $1.036bn, giving Malaysian interests a 50 percent  holding in the newspaper group. Khoo is a close friend of  Robert Kuok, the Malaysian sugar, hotels and property magnate  who last year bought a 34.9 percent stake from News Corporation  and became the largest single shareholder in the SCMP group.    MUI's purchase prompted Hong Kong's Securities and Futures  Commission (SFC) to consider referring the deal to Hong Kong's  takeovers panel for inquiry into possible concert party action  by the Malaysian tycoons. "We will look into the matter to see  if an inquiry is warranted," Robert Nottle, the SFC chairman,  said. Under local takeover rules, shareholders whose control  reaches 35 percent of a company are required to make a general  offer.    After the sale, SCMP will remain one of only two foreign  controlled newspapers in the territory, the other being the  Taiwanese-owned United Daily Chinese-language broadsheet.  Although it was widely expected that Murdoch would divest his  remaining stake in SCMP, his deal with Khoo came as a surprise.    Khoo, a born-again Christian, is believed to have had  problems with Malaysian authorities. Late last year, his MUI  group sold subsidiaries in MUI Bank and MUI Finance to the  Malaysian Hong Leong group and has since then been sitting on a  big pile of cash. In February it bought holdings in two Hong  Kong companies -- a 52.8 percent stake in travel group Morning  Star Holdings and a 30 percent stake in Kuok's Kerry Financial  Services, a stockbroking and merchant bank concern.    MUI's interests in Malaysia include the Ming Court Hotel  chain, cement operations and department stores. It also has a  major stake in the revamped New Heritage USA, a large U.S. theme  park and resort formerly linked to disgraced Christian  television evangelist Jim Bakker. MUI's wholly owned  subsidiary, MUI Media, signed an agreement on Wednesday to buy  226.5 million shares at $4.575 each from News Finance (HK), MUI  told the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.    Kuok paid US$349m (about HK$2.7bn), or HK$5.16 a share, for  his 34.9 percent stake in October. SCMP shares yesterday closed  unchanged at $4.225.    Media analysts said the sale should give Murdoch much-needed  cash to finance his loss-making Star TV operations and would  make little difference to the running of SCMP's newspaper,  magazine and publishing business. "The change in ownership  should not affect SCMP. There should be some friendly  cooperation between the two Malaysian shareholders. The  prospects of the paper are not bad, although revenues are not  expected to grow significantly," Brian Oung of DBS Securities  said.    Fred Bowers of Nomura Research Institute said he had been  disappointed with SCMP's revenue growth in the past two years  and expected the company's margins to shrink. "Its performance  has been below expectations. I'm bearish on the stock because  of rising labour and newsprint costs," he said.    KM Chang of OCBC Investment Research in Kuala Lumpur said  MUI's acquisition reflected the group's effort to diversify  overseas.</p>

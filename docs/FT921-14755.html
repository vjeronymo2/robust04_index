			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Tomkins The 10 per cent increase in Tomkins' interim earnings was impressive enough to raise the question of whether the merits of contra-cyclical conglomerates have been underestimated. Given that Tomkins' shares have outperformed the market by 45 per cent over the last 18 months, the answer might seem in the negative. The slightly less fashionable Williams Holdings also recently joined the FT-SE, so conglomerates are scarcely under-represented. All the same, veterans like Hanson and BTR have had a harder time. It is instructive to go back 10 years and discover that their shares did even better in recession than Tomkins has managed this time around. Over a similar 18-month period from the start of 1980, Hanson and BTR both outperformed the market by 70 per cent. Hanson in particular really took off after that, so Tomkins is perhaps taking a view on the spirit of the 1990s in allying itself more to BTR as an asset manager. In addition, BTR won its battle for Hawker Siddeley last year, whereas Hanson managed only an agreed deal with Beazer. If Tomkins had treated its restructuring costs as extraordinary in the traditional way, yesterday's 15 per cent dividend increase would have been more in line with earnings. As it is, it reinforces the impression that the group is finally limbering up for a UK bid of its own, possibly using its highly-rated paper. While Tomkins' managers are still buying their own shares, investors will doubtless choose to hang on for a while yet.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mt Edon withdraws bid for Burmine The long-delayed, three-way merger involving Europa Minerals, a UK mining finance house, and two Australian groups with which it already has close associations - Burmine and Austmin Gold - is set to go ahead today. This follows the withdrawal yesterday of rival bidder for Burmine, Mount Edon, another Australian gold company. Burmine and Mount Edon have called an end to the litigation which has held up the merger, first mooted in July last year. Each side will bear its own costs but Mount Edon has agreed to pay ADollars 125,000 (Pounds 61,576) to Burmine and its managing director Mr Guido Staltari. During the battle Mount Edon sold its 19.9 per cent stake in Europa and directors said yesterday that its 22.6 per cent shareholding in Burmine had now also been sold - to a group of Australian institutional investors. Total net profit for Edon on the two disposals was ADollars 3m (Pounds 1.4m). Mr Tony Brennan, Mount Edon's managing director, said the decision to sell the Burmine holding was made, 'when it became clear that the merging of Burmine's gold assets with Mount Edon's would only be achievable after still further legal actions and at a cost which would not have been in the interest of Mount Edon's shareholders.' Sir David Hardy, chairman of both Europa and Burmine, said he was delighted that Mount Edon had conceded defeat. He said that, after lawyers signed the final agreements between Mount Edon and Burmine in Melbourne today, the Burmine offers for Europa, valuing the UK group at about Pounds 15m, and Austmin would be declared unconditional. This would lead to Europa's London Stock Exchange quotation being removed. Sir David indicated that the delay caused by litigation had not been wasted and that the enlarged Burmine group expected quickly to make one or two mining acquisitions.</p>

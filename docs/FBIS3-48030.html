Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the Cabinet  at its weekly meeting today accepted the offer as it was a sign  of goodwill from the Indonesian Government. [passage omitted]    "However, the RMAF will evaluate the technical aspects of  the  Super Puma and its after sales support before taking delivery of  it," Najib said.    He said this to newsmen after receiving Brunei's Navy  commander Colonel Pehin Datuk Paduka Kefli at his office in  Jalan Padang Tembak.    Earlier, Pehin met Royal Malaysian Navy chief Laksamana  Madya  [Rear Admiral] Datuk Sri Shariff Ishak. [passage omitted]    On Pehin's visit, Najib offered to train more Brunei navy  personnel here and build naval warships for them. [passage  omitted]</p>

According to Mr. Durmov such a document is vital as Serbia has  not signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.  Belgrade showed readiness to start immediate discussion of  confidence building measures, Gen. Miodrag Terzic of Serbia's  Defence Ministry said, quoted by the daily. [passage omitted]    Within a year at the latest Bulgaria could lay territory  claims to the present state of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], demanding first official  protection for the Bulgarian population there, NOVINAR says  today, quoting a high-ranking diplomat of the Foreign Ministry  in Sofia. This dramatic reversal of Bulgaria's position towards  Macedonia would be a consequence of Russia's increased activity  in the Balkans, the paper adds.</p>

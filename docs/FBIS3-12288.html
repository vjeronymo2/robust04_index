The Fatah Central Committee would like to emphasize the  following:    1. This new ugly Zionist crime clearly reveals the true  nature of the racist Zionist grudge and the Zionist enemy's  practices and massacres against our Palestinian and Arab people  in Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Qibya, Nahhalin, Sabra, Shatila,  South Lebanon, the Golan, 'Uyun Qara [Rishon LeZiyyon], and  al-Aqsa Mosque. This ugly crime clearly confirms the role and  function of the Zionist entity, which is weighing heavily on the  land of Palestine and which is seeking through all hostile and  racist means to uproot our people from their homeland as a  prelude to Judaizing the land of Palestine and ending the  national identity of our Palestinian people.    2. This criminal bloody massacre is the first fruit of the  treasonous agreement 'Arafat and his Zionized team signed with  the enemy. It is a natural result of capitulation, submission,  and normalization with the Zionist enemy. The enemy practices  against our people and nation have been further confirmed by its  crime in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. This clearly proves that  there could be no peace or reconciliation with this Zionist  entity.    3. While we hold the Zionist enemy and its leadership and  settlers fully responsible for this heinous crime, we hold  'Arafat and his Zionized team responsible for the blood of the  Ibrahimi Mosque martyrs and wounded.    O masses of our Palestinian people, O masses of our Arab  nation:    By this crime, the enemy sought to extinguish the spirit of  revolution and valiant intifadah of our people in the occupied  homeland, who reject the 'Arafatist treasonous agreements. It  also sought to bring about the surrender of our struggling  masses, which insist on maintaining confrontation with the  enemy. The enemy targets, however, have foundered on the rock  of the spirit of struggle and confrontation which manifested  itself immediately after the early news of the Zionist crime.  Popular anger swept through the entire Palestinian territory in  the form of clashes with the Zionist enemy through which our  struggling people emphasized that the spirit of struggle and  resistance is always glowing and that their insistence on  continuing their confrontation with the enemy and toppling the  treasonous agreements and liquidatory plans cannot be stopped by  the continuing Zionist massacres and repressive acts in the  occupied homeland.</p>

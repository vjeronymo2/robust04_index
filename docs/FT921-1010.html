			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Matsushita reforms atone for past dealings MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics company, will overhaul its senior management and establish a new subsidiary today as part of reforms intended to atone for past dealings with Japanese stock and property speculators. The moves also highlight the tension among Matsushita executives, who are widely reported to be arguing over the company's direction now traditional strengths in consumer and industrial electronics are under challenge in sluggish markets at home and abroad. Mr Shoji Sakuma, 59, an executive vice-president tipped to be the company's next chief executive, will resign and become a 'corporate adviser' to take responsibility for the group's exposure to Ms Nui Onoue, the bankrupt Osaka restaurateur who used seances for advice in investing huge sums in Japanese stocks. Another executive vice-president, Mr Masahiko Hirata, 60, is also to be demoted, though Matsushita did not suggest that either of the two officials was directly linked to Ms Onoue, who is now awaiting trial for alleged fraud over Y269bn (Dollars 2.01bn) raised from financial institutions. Mr Sakuma had been a board member at National Leasing, a small finance company established in 1979 to assist corporate clients' purchases of Matsushita equipment, but which lent a reported Y52bn to Ms Onoue and unknown amounts to property speculators in a total of Y380bn in outstanding loans. A new company, NL Finance, is to be formed today with Y4bn in capital comprised of Matsushita stock holdings in other Japanese companies, in particular, banks. Matsushita reckons that while the stocks' book value is Y4bn, a market value of between Y30bn and Y35bn will be a cushion against bad debts for the new subsidiary, which will oversee National Leasing's loans. 'We can't say how much of these loans will be bad. The loans went to various types of companies and we don't know how they used the money,' Mr Akira Nagano, a Matsushita spokesman, said yesterday. It will be NL Finance's responsibility to reduce the loan exposure, while the parent company is expected to write-off about Y20bn in bad debts this year. The series of embarrassments for Matsushita, which is expecting a 43 per cent fall in profits this year, also prompted the company's chairman, Mr Masaharu Matsushita, and president, Mr Akio Tanii, to accept a 50 per cent reduction in pay for three months from the beginning of the new financial year next month. Matsushita hopes the changes will mark the end of its own excesses during the 'bubble' era of the late 1980s, when many leading industrial companies, or their subsidiaries, were entangled in questionable stock and property deals. Late last year, Matsushita said central control would be tightened over subsidiaries, and the company has already reviewed its financial operations. But Matsushita is yet to resolve an internal debate over how far the company should stray from its traditional philosophy of providing 'good quality at a low price'. The question has become more pressing recently, with continued weakness in the consumer audio-visual equipment market and a slowdown in Japanese industrial demand. The departure of Mr Sakuma, who had publicly called for a change in outlook, and the demotion of Mr Hirata, who had handled Matsushita's Dollars 6.59bn purchase of MCA, the US entertainment company, could shift company policy towards a re-emphasis of core businesses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA) -- The Iraqi National Assembly  has declared its willingness to discuss all outstanding issues  with a delegation from the Kuwaiti parliament in the service of  pan-Arab issues and the interests of the two sides, leading to  stability and barring dispute.    In a statement to INA in reaction to a recent speech by  Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sa'd al-'Abdallah, Sa'di Mahdi Salih,  speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, said: We are ready to  discuss with a delegation from the Kuwaiti parliament all  outstanding issues in the service of pan-Arab issues and the  interests of the two sides, leading to stability and barring  dispute. Many parties, which have become well known and  exposed, are seeking to fuel disputes following the Mother of  Battles. These parties are seeking to increase doubts,  misgivings, and fears in the ranks of the Arabs and drive the  rulers of Kuwait to the point of no return in order to serve the  interests of these parties, including tampering with the  security of the region, capturing its wealth, and impoverishing  their peoples.    The National Assembly speaker added: We proposed this  earlier to several Arab states. We suggested a delegation from  the Kuwaiti parliament visit Iraq. We said we are willing to  open the door to it and to give it access to all information and  facts to confirm that claims that Iraq holds Kuwaiti nationals  are exposed lies and fabrications that have suspect and mean  political objectives. It has been proven to us that the  Government of Kuwait did not convey our proposals to the  parliament because it did not want the parliament to know the  facts as they exist and to know Iraq's true Arab policy.    The National Assembly speaker added: While reiterating  this proposal, and our seriousness about this issue, we do not  mind having other Arab parties, to be agreed upon, take part in  the discussions. We also do not mind an Arab side making  shuttle tours between us and the Kuwaiti parliament to reach  mature ideas in this regard and so as not to allow the  government officials in Kuwait to drive things toward the worst,  as they did before 2 August 1990.    The Kuwaiti heir apparent and prime minister delivered a  speech a few days ago in which he cited a pack of lies about  Iraq and its positions. He also spoke about the situation in  Kuwait. The following is part of what he said: "The world is  now like a big volcano. We do not know where and when it will  erupt. Small countries stand fearfully before this terrible  scene and are looking for a safe haven to avoid the danger of  fierce storms, preserve their freedom and sovereignty, and  protect their entity and independence."</p>

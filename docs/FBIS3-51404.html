			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Conception Campa, director of the Finlay  Institute, has announced that this afternoon Cuban authorities  received the document authorizing Cuba to freely market its  meningococcal meningitis vaccine in Argentina.    [Begin recording] As you all know, this has been a long  struggle which has taken many complex turns in terms of its  approval or rejection. There was great pressure exerted by the  Argentine people, by pediatricians, and by mothers who wanted to  vaccinate their children.    Up to now, no permit had been issued to register the  vaccine;  therefore, there was no permit to sell it or to let the people  buy it. This is what the great news we received a few minutes  ago is about. I received a call telling me that we already have  the registration in our hands. This opens the doors to freely  market the vaccine and for the mothers to buy it and vaccinate  their children, for the pediatricians to recommend it.    Up to now we were not able to do this. This represent an  important step to protect those children who are in the midst of  a full blown epidemic and who were not allowed to get the  vaccine. This is also something very important for us: To be  able to sell a product which offers no risks and has extremely  high potential to fight that epidemic in Argentine. [end  recording]    Dr. Concepcion Campa received today the 23 October award  from  the Federation of Cuban Women, a homage to the Cuban woman who  gives to science and Cuba the best of her intellect.</p>

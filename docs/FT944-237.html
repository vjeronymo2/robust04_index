			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Regulating derivatives Even by the standards of today's unstable markets, 1994 will go down as a year of unusual financial turbulence. Such has been the political fall-out in the US that a powerful regulatory response is inescapable, carrying with it the risk of over-reaction. Nowhere is this more true than with derivative financial instruments such as swaps, forwards and options, which have prompted feverish anxiety on Capitol Hill. A sense of perspective is badly needed. At the risk of stating the obvious, derivative instruments have not, despite the fiendish qualities attributed to them, seriously threatened the stability of any banking system in the developed world this year. The biggest loss incurred in the markets - Dollars 2bn by Orange County in California - stemmed less from dealing in derivatives than from the use of sale and repurchase agreements in the bond markets. This was one of several examples of leveraged dealing where fund managers borrowed to increase returns, only to find that leverage can magnify losses as well as profits. With Procter &amp; Gamble and other end-users of derivatives, losses have highlighted potential conflicts of interest in the role of the banks. But it is not the task of central bank regulators to protect large industrial companies from their bankers or to monitor corporate governance arrangements. So what should their priorities be? The precise extent of the systemic threat is hotly debated. What is beyond dispute is that while derivatives have great potential to increase capital market efficiency, the gap between individual firms' knowledge of their trading and risk management practices, and the information available to outsiders, has sharply increased. Risks on and off the balance sheet can change hourly in a business that is increasingly conducted in over-the-counter (OTC) markets rather than organised exchanges. Lack of transparency The resulting lack of transparency is such that risk may be mispriced, while uncertainty over a bank's exposures could lead to a run on deposits. The threat of contagion within the financial system is highly concentrated: in the derivative markets in the US 10 banks account for more than 90 per cent of credit exposures. Most important, banking supervision simply cannot keep abreast of the quickfire changes in the risks that commercial banks now run in the normal course of business. This is a powerful argument for moving to a two-tier banking system in which the safety net of deposit insurance is denied to the commercial banks' derivatives trading activity. It also highlights the importance of a rapid move towards real-time gross settlement to reduce the risk that the failure of a counterparty will disturb the whole payments system. Market fluctuations The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is amending its capital regime, currently directed exclusively at credit risk, to cope with the impact of market fluctuations. Yet capital is probably a less effective defence against trouble than a sound approach to risk management. On this score a recent BIS discussion paper has urged public disclosure of banks' internal risk management systems, a proposal promptly taken up by JP Morgan. A more radical suggestion, made by David Folkerts-Landau and Alfred Steinherr in a recent American Express Bank prize essay, is that the regulators should seek to divert business away from OTC markets into a formal exchange or clearing house structure. This would have the advantage of greater transparency and liquidity, together with the discipline of collateral requirements that are tougher than a conventional capital adequacy regime. Critics of this approach argue that it ignores the efficiency of private-sector decisions in this area and that a majority of business is done in OTC markets for good reason: customised contracts provide flexibility. The big banks also fear the loss of the competitive advantage that they derive from high credit ratings. Yet the Amex authors claim that a majority of OTC contracts are little different from standardised exchange traded products. Moreover, the current capital adequacy regime contains a bias in favour of OTC dealing. The private sector also faces high costs in setting up a clearing house, where the returns on the investment are partly social and public. In the present fiscal climate few governments will look favourably on subsidies for clearing arrangements. Yet they have good reason to look at the case for a more level playing field between OTC and exchange-traded derivatives, not least because financial stability is an important public good. That is why increasing the transparency of the derivatives markets should be a high priority in any reform of the regulatory framework.</p>

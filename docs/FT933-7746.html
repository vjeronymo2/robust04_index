			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Madrid scale new peaks SENIOR bourses saw new highs in Frankfurt and Madrid, and some near misses, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT raised its sights to include the April 2, 1990 DAX all time high of 1,976.43 as the DAX index rose 25.55 to a new 1993 peak of 1,935.86. But it widened them, too, to incorporate potential short-term volatility as DTB options expire tomorrow. Turnover rose from DM8.2bn to DM10.4bn. Ms Heidemarie Hoppner, at B Metzler in Frankfurt, wondered whether Volkswagen would be able to hold a DM400 striking price on Friday, or Bayer DM300, or BASF DM260. Yesterday, these three rose DM4.80 to DM400, DM3 to DM302, and DM2.90 to DM260.60 respectively. Options-related buying was credited, too, for the DM23 rise to DM744 in Daimler, recommended by DB Research along with Siemens, up DM5.60 yesterday to DM690.50, and Allianz, which justified its beta stock rating with a gain of DM57 to DM2,475. Meanwhile, the trading sell of Schering from the same source, on a reworking of the sums for its Betaseron multiple sclerosis drug, seemed to have run its course for the time being as the stock recovered DM26.50 to DM961. MADRID extended a climb founded on interest rate hopes, the general index closing another 3.60 higher at a new 1993 high of 290.46. Dealers said that Wall Street quoted stocks, Telefonica, Repsol, Endesa, Iberdrola and a few of the big banks, had led prices upwards. Telefonica rose Pta55 to Pta1,560, and Repsol by Pta50 to Pta3,715, as turnover climbed again from Pta26.7bn to Pta31.55bn. PARIS, encouraged by the continued strength of the franc, added another 24.46 or 1.1 per cent to the CAC-40 index which closed at 2,160.75. Turnover was strong at FFr4.1bn. Brokers at the Paris office of James Capel said that interest had shifted to recent market laggards, such as Alcatel Alsthom, up FFr20 at FFr725 and Rhone-Poulenc, FFr6.10 higher at FFr166. Interest has also been strong in Alcatel ahead of an announcement from South Korea, due this week, on the award of a railway contract. Siemens of Germany is another leading contender for this contract. Rhone-Poulenc has recently attracted a buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson, which forecast a rise in the shares, helped by an upturn in the chemical sector next year. AMSTERDAM switched its attention from the publishing sector, strong on Tuesday, to foods. The CBS Tendency index gained 2.1 or 1.6 per cent to 128.8. An analyst at the Amsterdam brokers, Pierson, commented that it was evident that institutions were being sector specific at present, concentrating on those which had underperformed the market in recent weeks. The present rally, he added, was sentiment driven on expectations of lower European interest rates following the next Buba council meeting later this month. Among active stocks, Unilever gained Fl 3.50 to Fl 199.20, Heineken Fl 4.70 to Fl 180.50 and Bols Wessanen Fl 1.80 to Fl 41.80. The positive mood was enough to underpin Nedlloyd, the shipping and transport group, which reported a worse than expected half year loss of Fl 116m, and the shares closed down just 50 cents at Fl 45.50, although off an intraday year's high of Fl 48.50 just before the announcement. Hunter Douglas, the building components company which pleased the market with Tuesday's six month figures, put on Fl 9.50 or 16 per cent to Fl 68.70. ZURICH ended almost 1 per cent higher, the SMI index rising 22.4 to 2,487.2. There was good demand for selected industrials and banks, the latter after results from Credit Suisse which left bearers in its parent, CS Holding, SFr85 higher at SFr2,910. Among industrials, Nestle added SFr11 to SFr1,104 and Brown Boveri SFr20 to SFr949, the latter in advance of today's half-year results. STOCKHOLM featured strength in banks and a rise in Electrolux B of SKr12 to SKr273 on good half year results. The Affarsvarlden general index advanced 37.2 to 1,339.1 in heavy turnover of SKr2.9bn. OSLO's All-share index was up 5.91 to 586.37 in turnover of NKr918m, assisted by a gain in Hafslund of NKr4.50 to NKr135.00; and, in HELSINKI, the HEX index put on 2.9 per cent to 1,489.6. MILAN remained in strong form, although some sporadic profit-taking was evident towards the close. The Comit index ended up 10.73 or 1.8 per cent at 618.98. Generali built on Tuesday's 4.7 per cent rise, adding another L647 to L41,703. The telecommunications sector also came under the spotlight with respective gains in Stet and Sip of L38 and L75 to L4,400 and L3,527. DUBLIN barely scraped to a new 1993 high although, on the day, the ISEQ overall index rose 28.04, or 1.6 per cent to 1,745.86 with financials 2.2 per cent ahead.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 18                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1296.00    1298.32    1298.75    1300.56 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1377.81    1379.68    1380.52    1382.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1302.59    1301.88    1302.36    1303.09 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1385.26    1386.51    1386.37    1387.63  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 17    Aug 16    Aug 13    Aug 12    Aug 11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1284.89   1276.32   1276.24   1280.84   1274.70 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1368.15   1359.35   1354.67   1359.88   1354.98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1303.22; 200 - 1388.84 Low/day: 100 - 1295.38  200 - 1377.34.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

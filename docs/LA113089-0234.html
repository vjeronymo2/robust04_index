			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> GOSS BROTHERS SETTLE LIBEL SUIT  </P> <P> Luke and Matt Goss of the Bros pop band settled a libel lawsuit Wednesday with  a newspaper they claimed had suggested that they took heroin.  </P> <P> The People, a tabloid weekly, agreed to pay the 21-year-old twins a six-figure  sum and publish an apology in next Sunday's paper, prosecutor Richard Hartley  said. Hartley said the exact amount would not be disclosed, but six figures in  British pounds is the equivalent of at least $160,000. The brothers, avid  campaigners against drugs, testified at a libel hearing that articles in the  newspaper in September, 1988, spoiled their "squeaky clean" image in the eyes  of their mainly teen-age fans.  </P></p>

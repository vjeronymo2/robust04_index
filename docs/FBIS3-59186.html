			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 27 (AFP) -- Germany's  Chancellor Helmut Kohl directly linked the future well-being of  the Western world with the success of economic and political  reforms in the former Soviet bloc in a major speech Thursday [27  January].    Delivering the keynote address at the annual meeting of the  World Economic Forum, he said the West must continue to support  the emerging democracies of Central, East and southern Europe on  their road to free market democracy.    "A failure of the reform efforts in these countries, in  which  some 380 million people live, would bode ill for West Europe  directly, but also for the Western world as a whole," Kohl said.    "This would raise the danger that, in their disappointment,  these people would leave their homes and try their chances in  the West -- not only, as till now, in Germany, but also in other  West European states," he warned.    Success of the reforms, on the other hand, would offer all  countries the chance of lasting peace and prosperity, the  chancellor said.    Kohl said the West must continue to make every effort to  build a market economy in these states. Germany had not  restricted itself to promises, but assumed a "way over normal"  responsibility in this respect, he observed.    Of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries,  Germany had provided by far the greatest financial support for  the reform process in Russia, he said -- nearly 90 billion  [German] marks [DM] (51.5 billion dollars) for states of the  former Soviet Union and about DM37 billion (21.2 billion  dollars) for those of Central, East and southern Europe.    However, it was clear the West could only provide "help for  self-help" and that credits and advice alone could not bring the  desired results, Kohl said.    "With consistent pursuit of the economic reforms already  begun, these countries hold in their own hands the key to a  step-by-step resolution of their economic problems. No one can  take on this responsibility for them."    The German chancellor saw support for the reform process in  the former East Bloc countries as part of a four-point approach  to counter unemployment, take up new economic challenges, and  ensure a stable and secure future for Europe.    His first proposal was to "press ahead full speed" with  European political and economic integration.    Extension of European Community membership to Austria,  Finland, Norway, and Sweden beginning on 1 January 1995, would  "further strengthen Europe." A standstill in the integration  process, on the other hand, carries the danger of political  power rivalry and a throwback to earlier times, he said.    Kohl further called for a strengthening of economic links  with the dynamic young market economies of Asia, and for further  opening up the world trade system.    In his speech, the chancellor also warned about the war in  the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying  military intervention would require "hundreds of thousands of  ground troops" and lead to a great number of casualties,  including civilians.    He also doubted it could produce a lasting peace. "The truth  remains -- there is no ready-made solution to this conflict," he  said.</p>

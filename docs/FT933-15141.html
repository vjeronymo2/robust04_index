			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Ireland drops veto on EC aid plan: Dublin may still reject share-out of funds if not satisfied THE IRISH government yesterday lifted its veto on the EC's 1994-99 regional development and structural aid programme, following conversations between European Commission president Jacques Delors and Irish premier Albert Reynolds. This means that the six sets of rules for the Structural Funds  - Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 109.4bn) of the Ecu157bn aid package  - are likely to go through the European Parliament next Wednesday. If this deadline had been missed, disbursement of the funds from this, the biggest ever EC development aid programme, would almost certainly have been delayed well beyond the beginning of next year. However, in a statement that the Irish ambassador to the EC was due to give Ireland's partners yesterday, Dublin makes clear that it will reject the share-out of the funds if it is not satisfied it has secured 'an equitable outcome', when EC foreign ministers meet in Brussels on July 19. 'We don't want to be accused of holding up the timetable,' an Irish official in Brussels said, 'and there are sufficient signs of progress to lift the reserve.' But the official added that 'if we're not satisfied, we're saying that on the 19th we're prepared to vote against the allocations then.' Mr Reynolds is holding out for the IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.6bn) he says Commission officials guaranteed him at the Edinburgh summit, where the size of the overall package was fixed. But senior Commission officials say it is hard to justify any figure for Ireland above IPounds 7.5bn. Nonetheless, in Dublin yesterday, government officials were hinting that the IPounds 8bn figure was now in sight. The IPounds 7.5bn figure the Commission was sticking to would be over the seven years 1993-99, thereby adding in the allocation Ireland is already receiving for this year under the last aid package. But officials closely involved on both sides said yesterday that improvements at the margin were being sought to bump up the Irish figure without having to subtract funds from other Community member states. One cosmetic possibility mentioned was to transfer the figures from the 1992 Ecus in which they were originally calculated to 1993 prices  - thereby adding a nominal 4 per cent or so for inflation. In terms of real money, the Commission got about Ecu1.4bn more than expected from the package, for EC-wide regional aid programmes which Brussels runs, rather than allocating to member state programmes. Officials were understood to be exploring whether part of this could be channelled towards Ireland.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vientiane, April 12 (KPL) -- Lao Labour and Social  Welfare Minister Thongloun Sisoulit, on April 9, signed with the  visiting Vietnamese minister for labour, war veterans and social  welfare a memorandum of understanding on missing Vietnamese  volunteers in Laos during the war time.    The memorandum refers to the minutes of the 16th meeting of  the joint cooperation commissions of Laos and Vietnam. This  document stipulates the return of the remains of Vietnamese  volunteers who lost their lives in Laos during the war time, and  the building of a 'militant solidarity' monument in Laos.    The two ministries agreed to closely coordinate in carrying  out the excavation and removal of the Vietnamese volunteers'  remains back to Vietnam this year from three cemeteries in the  Provinces of Oudomsai, Xieng Khouang and Attopeu. On their  bilateral cooperation on labour and social welfare matters, the  two ministries will exchange technical documents and experience.</p>

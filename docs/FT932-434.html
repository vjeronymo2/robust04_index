			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Iraq bombing wrecks cross-party consensus LABOUR mounted a fierce attack on the government's backing for the US bombing of Baghdad at the weekend, challenging its basis in international law and saying that it should never have taken place. The cross-party consensus between the two front benches on the government's approach to Iraq, which survived through the Gulf war, broke down yesterday as Mr George Robertson, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, condemned the US strike as 'dubious in legality, questionable in morality, haphazard in its military impact and potentially devastating in diplomacy'. The fracturing of opinion at Westminster was underlined by the fact that a couple of Tory backbenchers joined opposition MPs in expressing fears about what the attack meant for the future role of the United Nations and for relations with moderate Arab regimes. But Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, insisted that the response to the alleged plot to assassinate former US president Mr George Bush was justified and proportionate. It had to be seen in the context of Iraq's pattern of attempted defiance and obstruction of the international community and its sponsoring of state terrorism. Downing Street also emphasised that Mr John Major's response to news of the impending attack had been to emphasise that it should be limited and directed at those specifically implicated. 'Only through firmness can Iraq be persuaded to conform to the standards of behaviour required of it by the international community,' he said. Mr Hurd conceded the risk - raised by Mr Cyril Townsend, a leading figure in the Conservative Middle East Council - that the attack would strengthen the position of Islamic extremists. However, he believed that, as on previous occasions, Arab critics in the coalition would feel safer and more satisfied that the US had been prepared to show leadership. The main charge from the opposition was that the attack had damaged the UN and hopes of a post-cold war world order, since it could not properly be based on article 51 of the United Nations charter. Sir David Steel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said the article was intended for use when there had been an attack on a UN member, until the Security Council could act to restore peace. But Mr Hurd argued that it allowed force to be used in self-defence against threats to a country's nationals, and that Iraq's support for state terrorism meant there was a constant threat of further attacks. He urged the other parties not to adopt the rule that specific mandates had to be sought from the United Nations when member nations were acting in self-defence, since this would lead to a 'dangerous state of paralysis'. Responding to MPs' concern about the three Britons held in prison in Iraq, Mr Hurd insisted that the government was doing all it could to secure their release.</p>

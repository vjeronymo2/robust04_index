			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Technology: Laptops pull into port - Docking stations for notebook computers allow far greater mobility It is no longer just Luke Skywalker and his compatriots from films such as Star Wars and Alien that are making everyday use of docking stations. At P&amp;O Properties, in London, managers have also recognised their benefits. Their docking stations may not be in outer space, but they do give managers mobility. Notebook computers taken back into the office can be slotted into the docking stations - almost like slotting a video into a VCR. The docking stations are connected to the office power supply and computer network, so the notebook is effectively transformed into a desktop PC. Because these notebooks double as desktop machines, Stanley Monger-Godfrey, information technology director at P&amp;O Properties, believes the docking station approach will enable the company to equip far more of its staff with portable machines. 'What this means to us is that we can offer the facility at a fraction of the price,' he says. Prices vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, as some models are designed to be used with the notebook's integral screen and keyboard while others are designed to have a full-sized keyboard, large colour screen and mouse attached. Alan Rogers, product manager for portables at Olivetti in the UK, says purchasers can expect to pay a 10 per cent premium for 'the docking concept' over a standard desktop PC. That puts the cost of a docking station and notebook at between Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 4,000. Rogers believes the premium is a fair price to pay for portability. Interest in docking stations has been fuelled, he says, by changes in office organisation. 'I believe there is a requirement in offices today for a more mobile user. I'm in the office three to four days a week. I may not want to use my PC when I'm out, but I may want to use it at home. I believe there are more people like me today.' Rogers argues the traditional laptop machine does not answer all these needs. 'I believe people want the machine and the information they work with during the day. They don't just want computing capacity.' This idea has contributed, say manufacturers, to an enormous take-off in sales of notebooks and docking stations. Mike Lunch, director of Toshiba's UK PC division, believes two further factors have contributed: developments in technology and price. Prices dropped because the screen technology became more reliable, and therefore less expensive, and because market pressures in the recession forced manufacturers to squeeze profit margins. By last summer, notebook machines were available with the latest 486 central processors, full-colour monitors and massive storage. Toshiba machines, for example, have an internal hard disc which is 2.5 inches wide but can store 205 megabytes of data - enough to store 40m words or their equivalent. This, says Lunch, means users can get exactly the same facilities on the notebook that they can on a desktop machine - such as full-colour graphics and Windows software. When the independent notebook is opened on a train, building site or at home, the screen the user sees is identical to the one on the PC in the office. Network communications apart, the PC can do everything the larger machines can do. Deborah Gallo, product marketing manager for Compaq, says these breakthroughs in screen and processor technology promoted the credibility of notebooks as primary machines. The result, says Lunch, is that between 30 and 40 per cent of the more sophisticated notebooks sold by Toshiba today are sold with a 'desk station'  -Toshiba's name for the docking station. IBM reports similar buoyant sales. The company is now selling docking stations with 50 per cent of its ThinkPad notebooks. With the most powerful model, which incorporates a colour screen, the percentage is even higher. Although Monger-Godfrey acknowledges that 'price is paramount', he believes there are other benefits from using a notebook machine with a docking station. If a manager's notebook is connected to the company network until the moment he or she takes it home, the machine will inevitably hold the latest information from the corporate database - not data that was downloaded on to a disc that morning, yesterday or even a week ago. 'If you're working on out-of-date material it can be quite serious,' points out Monger-Godfrey. Then there are the niggly details of transferring data from a standard desktop to a notebook. Notebooks often take different size discs from the office machine, or one uses double density discs, the other single density - the sort of problem designed to irritate profoundly non-technical staff. Losing discs between home and the office can be commonplace in many organisations. One reason why Monger-Godfrey has been so willing to purchase docking stations is that they have fitted in easily with the company's IT strategy. 'They have allowed us to move into the portable arena without compromising our three-tier strategy for IT or compromising our security.' This three-tier strategy involves a PC on every desktop - some 500 in all - linked to a departmental machine running under the Unix operating system. This, in turn, is networked to a corporate ICL 3900 mainframe computer. To dispel worries about data security, inevitable with such a high number of PCs, Monger-Godfrey has built in a series of access control mechanisms at each level of computing. The same security extends to the notebooks. If one is stolen the culprit would have to crack the password before getting access to the information. Both Rogers and Monger-Godfrey acknowledge there will always be certain members of staff who will never need to use a notebook - data entry staff, accounts clerks and so on. Of the 500 staff at P&amp;O Properties, Monger-Godfrey believes 100 are out on the road much of the time - surveyors, for example - and so are obvious users of notebook machines. A further 100 managers, who spend some time out of the office, could also take advantage of the combined units. Elsewhere, Rogers believes a growing number of large corporations are beginning to show an interest in docking stations simply for the flexibility they deliver. He cites the example of one company in a high-rise building where the management is keen for the number of internal meetings to grow. The only current answer is for staff to print out the information on yards of paper before trudging up and down stairs to attend the meetings. Some of the more traditional notebook users are also hooking up to docking stations. Paul Jordan, surveying director with the Willmott Dixon social housing refurbishment division, has had a laptop computer for several years. Two years ago he and five colleagues had a single docking station installed in the office so that they could exploit a standard colour screen and high-quality printer to make reports writing easier. All that had to be done was to configure the notebook and portable to work together. This gave the machine what Jane Burley, product marketing manager at Apple in the UK, refers to as a 'dual personality'. 'As a notebook, it knows, say, that it only has a small screen. But once it is in the docking station it automatically locks on to servers, for example - something it knows not to do as a notebook.' Monger-Godfrey is now such a convert that he says he would no longer consider buying portable machines unless they had docking stations. 'If this had been around two years ago we'd have bought a lot more. Most of our people would have had them,' he concludes.</p>

Foreign businessmen who have plunged into Beijing's  commercial market seem confident of their future.    A recent survey of 700 households in the city showed that  over 11 percent of the people buy costly consumer goods.    Among Beijing's existing 375 joint ventures in commerce,  Cvic  [as received] Yaohan, a shopping center noted for its the  largest amount of imported goods and open-shelf sales, has quite  a few frequent customers, though prices there are three times  higher than those on the same items in ordinary stores.    The center's general manager Hu Zhengjiang said the  customers  are mainly entrepreneurs and celebrities in the entertainment or  sports circles.    According to Wang Yaozhang, an office director of the  Friendship Shopping City in the Beijing Lufthansa Center, 60  percent of its commodities and 90 percent of its imported  commodities have gone to domestic buyers.    The shopping city, invested by German, South Korean and  Chinese companies and operated by Chinese and Singapore  managers, is the first joint venture in the field. It grossed  670 million yuan in sales last year, ranking fourth in the  city's commercial sector.    Over 50 food restaurants have been opened by foreign  investors from more than 10 countries and regions, such as the  U.S., Britain, France, Japan and Thailand.    The world's largest snack supplier, McDonald's Food Co.  Ltd.,  opened its first branch on Wangfujing Street on April 23, 1992.  It received 13,000 people that day, setting a new record in its  history.    Strolling down the streets in Beijing, one may choose from  Italian pizza, American Kentucky Fried Chicken, California beef  noodles and hamburgers.    Beijingers have also become fashion-conscious. Name-brand  clothing boutiques like theme, apple, crocodile and gold lion  have attracted many shoppers.    French fashion designer Pierre Cardin has recorded handsome  profits, despite its prohibitive prices for ordinary  bread-winners, since the company took the lead in setting up a  branch in the city.    The huge influx of foreign money is also an impetus to  state-run enterprises in the sector. Many department stores,  hotels and restaurants have improved their shop windows and  services to compete for customers.    Last year, there were 187 joint ventures in Beijing,  equalling the total for the previous 14 years. The promised  investment reached 271 million U.S. dollars and retail sales  topped 54.9 billion yuan.</p>

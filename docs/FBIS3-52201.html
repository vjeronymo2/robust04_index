The Israeli deputy foreign minister, Yosi Beilin, and his  Vatican counterpart, Bishop Claudio Celli, signed this documents  which has 15 articles.    This said agreement will become official after its  ratification by the parliament of the Zionist regime and pope,  the leader of the world Catholics. The two sides will then  exchange ambassadors.    The signing of this agreement between Vatican and the  Zionist  regime is considered by political analysts as an important  development in Vatican's policy toward Israel.    Following the end of the war of oil in the Persian Gulf and  the beginning of Middle East peace talks, Vatican started  extensive efforts to have presence in these talks.    However, the Zionist regime had set establishment of  official  relations as a condition for Vatican's presence in the talks.    Nevertheless the establishment of the diplomatic relations  between the two sides was an obstacle in view of Vatican's  policy toward the Zionist regime.    Vatican, too, considered the implementation of the 1947 UN  resolution in which the international administration of Bayt  al-Muqaddas [Jerusalem] had been envisaged as the prerequisite  for establishing relations with Israel.    However, international conditions over the past couple of  years have been such that Vatican seems to have withdrawn from  its position.    In the document signed by Vatican and the Zionist regime, no  reference has been made to Bayt al-Muqaddas, while Vatican has  rejected the issue of Jesus Christ's betrayal by the Jews.    In this relation the spokesman of Vatican, while referring  to  the unnecessary nature of the implementation of the UN  resolution, stressed that the Catholic Church no longer supports  UN resolutions on Bayt al-Muqaddas.    In the meantime, in the document signed by Vatican and  Israel, the question of freedom of religion in harmony with the  laws of the Jewish state has been envisaged. Nevertheless this  issue has not reduced worries that the Jewish state may treat  Christian sects from a superior position.    On this basis, recognition of Israel by Vatican has caused a  negative reaction among Christian sects with the retreat of  Vatican policy toward the issue.    In the meantime, although the White House has welcomed  Vatican's recognition of the Zionist regime, this issue has been  condemned by the opposition Palestinian organizations and  parties.    The two Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of  Palestine in a joint statement have announced that under the  conditions that the suppression of the Palestinian nation still  continues, this recognition will not help to end Palestinian and  Arab territories' occupation by the Zionist regime.    Political analysts believe that in the view of the nature of  the Zionist regime and the Jewish state's performance since the  occupation of Palestine, which are based on superiority of Jews,  religious discrimination, and rejection of other religious  minorities and faiths, recognition of Israel by Vatican is  considered as a mere political move and one can not conceive any  worthy role for Vatican in this connection.</p>

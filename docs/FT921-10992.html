			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Monday Interview: Full speed ahead for 'Fujimobile' - Alberto Fujimori, president of Peru When agricultural engineer and university rector Alberto Fujimori decided to run for President of Peru, a campaign organiser told him to forget it. Even a seat in the senate was unthinkable. Mr Fujimori fired the consultant and got his family painting posters and distributing leaflets. He pressed into service an elderly tractor as a campaign vehicle that soon became known as the 'Fujimobile'. That Peruvians chose as their president this political novice, of Japanese parentage, backed by a rag-bag party of unknowns was a measure of their disenchantment with traditional politicians from right and left. In a decade of democracy after 12 years of military rule, they had opted for a free-spending, patrician elder statesman and then for a young, charismatic populist who left Peru on the verge of economic collapse. As a first generation Peruvian made good, Mr Fujimori provided hope for both immigrants and the mixed-race majority, traditionally despised by the ruling Hispanic elite. The antithesis of his predecessors, he came to power offering a new direction. Accurately reading the Peruvian mood, he named his party 'Cambio (Change) 90'. Once the jewel in the Spanish imperial crown, Peru had become one of the poorest countries in South America. At home, the state was under threat from left-wing guerrillas. Abroad, it had defaulted on all its foreign debts and, partly as a result, had become an international pariah. In 18 months of government, Mr Fujimori has not solved Peru's problems. But even his critics admit he has made progress towards his goal of radically changing the country. 'In legislative terms,' says a confident Mr Fujimori, 'there is virtually nothing left to do. What we must concentrate on now is putting our reforms into full effect.' Among successes, he has reduced inflation from an annualised 3,000 per cent upon taking office in July 1990 to about 4 per cent a month; tax collections, while still inadequate to cover essential services, have doubled; a bloated and inept state bureaucracy has been trimmed; financial and commercial reforms have converted Peru into one of the most liberal regimes in the continent and relations with international financial organisations have been normalised. However, austerity has plunged more people than ever into poverty and economic reform is reckoned by critics to have benefited only a small group of businessmen. Mr Fujimori is under attack as an autocrat for ruling by decree and by-passing the legislature. He has been criticised for his closeness to an army accused of human rights violations, and for using repressive measures to combat the guerrillas. In the faded splendour of Lima's government palace - an operatic stage-set of a building complete with marble halls, French gilt mirrors and magnificently-attired story-book soldiers - Mr Fujimori cuts no dash. His private office is austere. He sits with shirt sleeves rolled up, a flickering television screen permanently showing the silent images of a favourite afternoon soap opera. Mr Fujimori is a self-proclaimed pragmatist and technocrat. His Spanish lacks eloquence, his vocabulary is limited. Not for him the rhetorical, sonorous discourses of his predecessors, Mr Fernando Belaunde and Mr Alan Garcia. He rarely departs from the text of competent but dull speeches, read in a tightly controlled monotone. Even his occasionally colourful verbal attacks - he has called judges 'jackals' and parliamentarians 'pachyderms' - are rehearsed. But for a man who lacks a power base, he has attacked some of Peru's most powerful institutions. The judiciary, Congress and the Catholic Church have all felt his waspish tongue. Establishment ripostes frequently smack of racism - the jumped-up 'chinito' (Chink) - but the average Peruvian admires oriental hard work and honesty and Mr Fujimori has learned to joke about the shape of his eyes. In recent months, Mr Fujimori has been travelling more. Late last year he went with an entourage of Peruvian businessmen to the US, Europe and Asia to court potential investors. He has started a bridge-building exercise with traditionally hostile Ecuador and has signed a treaty giving landlocked neighbour Bolivia access to the Pacific. Trade and economic benefits underpin each diplomatic initiative. This week, he arrives in Britain, primarily to deliver a lecture at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew on ecology and the environment on a visit likely to attract demonstrations from environmentalists, human rights groups and supporters of the guerrillas that are fighting the government. Peru has recently awakened to the fact that, as the principal world producer of coca, the raw material from which cocaine is made, it possesses at least one product in which the international community is intensely interested. 'The subject that interests me most is drugs trafficking, in relation to ecology' he says. 'I'll be raising the alarm over the damage being done to the Amazon basin by the drugs trade,' says Mr Fujimori. Processing coca leaf into cocaine paste or base releases thousands of tonnes of kerosene, sulphuric acid and quicklime into Amazonian tributaries, while jungle hillsides are ravaged as growers slash and burn trees to make room for the lucrative coca bushes. He will aim to present Peru as caretaker of a unique world treasure. Mr Fujimori hopes to win economic help from governments, including those of the US and Spain, in the drugs battle. But private sector contacts are higher on the Peruvian agenda. Foreign investment is needed elsewhere in the economy too. Last year's 2.4 per cent economic growth rate made scarcely a blip in a steep 23 per cent decline over the preceding three years. But for all its mining, fishing and agro-industrial potential, will foreign businesses come to a land where an 11-year guerrilla war has already cost some 25,000 lives and Dollars 20bn in material damage? Mr Fujimori's eyes gleam with messianic conviction. 'I am certain that I will defeat terrorism before I leave office. We are making real progress in pacification.' Although many Peruvians are not so sure, the president claims the government is winning its battle against South America's deadliest left-wing guerrilla groups, the Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) and the MRTA (the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement). Both are finding 'they have little physical or political space to manoeuvre now that the population as a whole is supporting us more.' Initial parliamentary reaction to presidential decrees on what he calls 'pacification' was hostile, but much of his plan has now been accepted. The president will personally lead a new 'united pacification command' to co-ordinate civilian and military strategy against the guerrillas. He has made the controversial move of arming peasant self-defence groups, the 'rondas', who now form the front line (cannon fodder, say opponents) against terrorism in the generally lawless Peruvian countryside. The army and 'the people' are now the twin pillars on which the Fujimori government rests. In a strategy to bring the two closer, the army is now charged with 'civic action' programmes, helping rebuild badly deteriorated road infrastructure, providing basic medical assistance and distributing international food aid to rural communities. Mr Fujimori is also pledging this year to start implementing a social emergency programme to cushion the impact of his economic reforms. The ending of subsidies on basic foodstuffs and higher prices for public services has plunged another 5m Peruvians into 'extreme poverty'. More than half of Peru's 22m people now exist below the poverty line. The Fujimori knack of reducing apparently insurmountable problems to simple steps is disarming to some, alarming to others. 'It all boils down to planning and methodology,' he says, whether it's getting elected president or beating the continent's deadliest guerrillas. Making a virtue out of an absence of organised support, Mr Fujimori likes to claim he has no personal allegiances. 'My four children and my wife are my only friends,' he says. A succession of overworked ministers and advisers, summarily tossed aside once their usefulness has expired, can testify that loyalty is not a presidential failing. Increasingly, his tersely authoritarian public style - which conflicts with a mild-mannered, gently humorous private disposition - is being called dictatorial. 'It's just my own personal style,' Mr Fujimori insists, 'neither oriental nor Peruvian; and I haven't developed it since becoming president. I've always preferred tough, outspoken criticism to the silence of complicity.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1934    Fujimori's parents arrived in Peru from Japan. 1938    Born in Lima. 1956-61 Studied agricultural engineering at National Agrarian         University of La Molina, Lima. 1984-89 Rector of National Agrarian University, La Molina, and         president of National Assembly of University Rectors. 1989    Formed Cambio (Change) 90 party. 1990    Elected president.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

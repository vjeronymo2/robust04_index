			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Rates and rafting in the Rockies: Monetary officials focus on financial innovation at Wyoming talks CENTRAL BANKERS and financial market 'speculators' called a truce this weekend when they gathered at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for white-water rafting, western barbecues and breakfast trail rides, writes Michael Prowse. Senior monetary officials spoke of the need to enlist markets as 'friends rather than enemies'. Referring to the effective collapse of the exchange rate mechanism, Mr Michael Mussa, research director at the International Monetary Fund, quoted Shakespeare: 'The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our stars but in ourselves.' Leading financial market analysts, meanwhile, complimented the US Federal Reserve on its adroit handling of monetary policy, which had struck exactly the right balance between the risks of recession and inflation. The excuse for the frolics was the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual monetary symposium, one of the most popular conferences on the international circuit because of its all-star cast and spectacular location high up in the Rockies. Some notables dropped out at the last moment. Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury undersecretary, stayed in Washington to mastermind attempts to halt the dollar's long slide against the yen. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, sent a detailed statement contradicting most of the views of his American hosts, but stayed away. European participants focused mainly on the role that speculative capital flows played in helping undermine the ERM. Many seemed convinced that fixed but adjustable systems such as the old ERM were no longer feasible: logic dictated either freely floating or irrevocably fixed rates. A gradual approach to eventual monetary union was no longer possible. Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, urged ERM members to consider reforms based on Israel's innovative approach to currency management. Israel allowed its exchange rate to fluctuate in a narrow band around a central parity which is adjusted regularly to reflect the difference between the targeted inflation rate in Israel and that expected in its main trading partners. This compromise had allowed Israel to maintain steady downward pressure on inflation while sustaining robust economic growth. Americans were mainly preoccupied by the effect of financial innovation in destabilising capital markets and the economy. Particularly worrying was a sharp decline in the market share of commercial banks and a corresponding surge in personal holdings of risky assets such as stock and bond mutual funds and pension fund assets - which now account for 32 per cent of household assets, double the ratio in 1980. Mr Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street analyst, argued that households' increased exposure to financial risk meant consumer spending, hitherto stable, could become much more volatile, greatly complicating efforts of policy-makers to smooth economic fluctuations. Others noted that no lender of last resort facilities existed to counter the equivalent of 'bank runs' affecting these risky household assets. Mr Robert Johnson, of financier George Soros's fund management group, said the biggest systemic risk over the next five to seven years lay in the possibility of defaults on government issued bonds. Depressed economic conditions were leading many governments to compensate for tight monetary policies by running 'excessively loose fiscal policies'. Yet bond investors seemed oblivious of the dangers. There was sharp disagreement about conduct of monetary policy. Most Americans agreed that financial innovations had destroyed the credibility of monetary targets and made ad hoc policies, involving reliance on a broad array of indicators, inevitable. Mr Tietmeyer, however, said in prepared remarks that money supply targets still worked well in Germany and would not be dropped. He noted that the Bundesbank, unlike Anglo-Saxon central banks, had suppressed financial innovations likely to destabilise monetary policy.

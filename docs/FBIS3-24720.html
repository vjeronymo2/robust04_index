			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with African National Congress Chairman Nelson </F> Mandela by Marcella Emiliani; place and date not given; "`I  Shall Prevent Civil War' -- The Black Leader Appeals for  Confidence in the New South Africa"; first paragraph is L'UNITA  introduction]    [Text] "The toughest opposition to the transitional  government currently comes from the Inkatha Freedom Party, which  does not favor mediation." Nelson Mandela talks about the  obstacles that the new South African democracy encounters in its  path: the white extremists and the black ones. He promises to  practice an "open-door policy" toward the international  community, without "tyrannizing" investors. Pre-election  opinion polls give the ANC 60 percent of the votes.    [Emiliani] Mr. Chairman, apartheid in South Africa is  officially dead. The blacks have finally gained admission to  the transitional government whose task is to organize the first  free general election, to be held on 27 April. And yet the  enemies of peace and democracy in the country seem to be  multiplying. Who are the die-hards?    [Mandela] The toughest opposition to the transitional  government currently comes from Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha  Freedom Party and some of its fellow members of the Freedom  Alliance. They sit at the negotiating table with us and do  nothing but pursue an "all or nothing" tactic. Inkatha above  all does not favor mediation, whereas the ANC -- the African  National Congress -- has made mediation the rule so that as many  sides as possible may be involved in the negotiations and the  greatest number of political demands can be taken into account.  Believe me, we are doing all we can to stop Inkatha and the  other parties in the Freedom Alliance from walking out of the  negotiations, now and again going far beyond the limits that we  had set, just to keep the negotiations open.    [Emiliani] But the opposition in South Africa is now an  armed opposition, and violence is spreading throughout the  country. Which do you consider the more dangerous: the  extremism of the whites, the hard-liners who want a return to  apartheid, or that of the more radical black groups?    [Mandela] The African National Congress has never refused to  talk to the right-wing groups, Inkatha and the Afrikaner  People's Front included. As far as we have been able to  establish, some of the leaders of the Afrikaner People's Front  are inclined to be reasonable and are perfectly aware how  dangerous it is to threaten civil war at the drop of a hat. Our  discussions with them have been fruitful, and we are  understanding one another better. Unfortunately, I cannot say  the same of our talks with Inkatha. At times we come out of the  negotiations with Buthelezi's party with the distinct feeling  that we have made not the slightest step forward in mutual  understanding. Nevertheless, we shall continue talking with  Inkatha in the hope of persuading them to take part in the  negotiating process again, and above all in the election on 27  April.    [Emiliani] So what point have the transitional government's  negotiations with the parties forming the Freedom Alliance  reached?    [Mandela] As such, the transitional government, or rather  the transitional executive council, is not negotiating with the  Freedom Alliance. It is a structure conceived under the interim  constitution to organize and monitor the election, an election  that must be free and fair. The negotiations involve all the  parties and organizations forming the transitional executive  council, which have made some, albeit still inadequate, progress  in the course of the negotiations. We are doing our best to  speed things up, but there are limits beyond which we cannot go,  issues on which we cannot compromise, such as the date of the  election itself, which is set for 27 April.    [Emiliani] What is the ANC in particular doing in this  connection?    [Mandela] The ANC's role in the negotiations is absolutely  central. We are the guardians of the mediation process, and we  are conducting it in the most all-inclusive manner, placing the  interests of South Africa above any party interest.    [Emiliani] The more radical black groups, too, are raising  difficulties and rejecting the negotiations. How are relations  between the ANC and the Pan-African Congress at the moment?    [Mandela] We are both liberation movements. There are  obviously differences between us, but we are working together as  partners in the mediation process. We are pleased that the  Pan-African Congress has decided to take part in the 27 April  election.    [Emiliani] And what about relations between the ANC and  AZAPO, the Azanian People's Organization?    [Mandela] Our relations with AZAPO, too, take account of  the fact that we are both organizations working for the  liberation of the oppressed black people of South Africa.  However, we are different organizations, and the ANC is  exterting strong pressure on AZAPO to fight the election.  However, the fact that it has decided to boycott it does not  detract from its being an organization working for liberation.    [Emiliani] According to the latest opinion polls, the ANC  could win over 60 percent of the votes on 27 April. What is  your economic program, what are your priorities once you are in  government?    [Mandela] The opinion polls and the meetings that we are  holding all over South Africa so that people can inform the ANC  of their needs all point to the most sensitive issues being  unemployment, the housing shortage, lack of education, and  inadequate healthcare provision. As a people's liberation  movement, in other words a movement that sets out to meet the  people's needs, these are also the ANC's priorities.    [Emiliani] How have the business world and the international  economic community, reacted to the transitional government? Are  they showing confidence in South Africa?    [Mandela] I hope with all my heart that they start to  believe in South Africa again. Since the ANC's appeal to the  United Nations to repeal sanctions, the response has been  favorable, and the Johannesburg stock exchange has recently  shown a considerable increase in the volume of trade. Some  major international companies are still put off by the spread of  violence, but I am confident that as soon as we manage to create  a true democracy and take measures capable of putting an end to  the violence, we shall be able to create the conditions required  to attract further investment.    [Emiliani] What sort of policy does the ANC intend to pursue  toward foreign companies?    [Mandela] An open-door policy that avoids "tyrannizing"  investors. What I mean is that we believe foreign investments  must not be penalized by over-restrictive currency regulations  and that the best way to attract them to South Africa is to give  companies a wider range of investment opportunities. We should  also like to see investment directed increasingly toward our  country's emerging black business class, which apartheid has  kept on the sidelines for a long time.    [Emiliani] One last question, Mr. Chairman. In your heart  of hearts, to whom have you dedicated your Nobel peace prize,  apart from the South African people?    [Mandela] You are right in saying that the courageous, long-  suffering South African people, deserves the Nobel peace prize.  Apart from South Africa, I believe that the president of the  Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, and the  Israeli prime minister, Yitzak Rabin, deserve it for the effort  that they are making to bring peace to the Middle East.</p>

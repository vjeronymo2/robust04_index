			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Fed should consider interest rate cuts, says White House THE US Federal Reserve should be prepared to ease monetary policy further if the economic recovery expected this spring fails to materialise, Mr Michael Boskin, the White House chief economic adviser, indicated yesterday. Releasing the 1992 Economic Report of the President, he said monetary policy had to be 'forward-looking'. He said the Fed had been surprised by the very slow monetary growth despite repeated cuts in interest rates. The White House, as spelt out in last week's budget, expects the US economy to remain sluggish early in 1992, with first-quarter growth of 0 per cent to 1.5 per cent at an annual rate, but the picture should improve later in the year. Mr Boskin predicted a 2.2 per cent growth through 1992 if Congress adopted Mr Bush's anti-recession proposals, but just 1.6 per cent if they were not approved. Mr Boskin defended the administration's claim that budget measures to stimulate the economy would raise annual growth in gross domestic product by 0.4 percentage points in coming years. This reflected 'confidence effects' as well as the impact on incentives of measures such as the proposed capital gains tax cut and temporary investment allowances for companies. The report insisted that fundamental conditions for growth were falling into place, with interest rates lower than they have been in decades and inflation expected to stay down in the near-term. But the White House's economic forecast for 1992 assumed the Fed board would ease interest rates again if necessary, Mr Boskin said. In congressional testimony on Tuesday, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said he would not rule out further interest rate cuts if the economy failed to improve but he hoped the existing stimulus would be sufficient. Mr Boskin acknowledged that the administration had not yet gained control of the budget deficit. There was 'still a huge gaping hole in the budget', he said, referring to this year's expected shortfall of Dollars 400bn (Pounds 221bn), a record 6.7 per cent of GDP. The best way to reduce the deficit in the medium-term would be to restrain growth of spending on entitlement programmes such as health care for the elderly, he said. This would free resources for private sector investment. The report also contains a detailed analysis of trends in family incomes. It seeks to demolish claims that incomes have stagnated in the past two decades and argues that researchers have not corrected properly for changes in the cost of living. The report says mid-range family income has risen 24 per cent in real terms since 1967. The rise since the 1973 business cycle peak, however, was a modest 5.9 per cent. Bush appeal, Page 5</p>

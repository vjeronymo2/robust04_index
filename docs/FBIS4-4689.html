			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Space Development Agency [NASDA] and  such space-related industrial firms as Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. plan to  radically redesign the H-2 rocket, Japan's major large-scale  launch vehicle, to make it practical for commercial use.  Considerable modifications are to be made, including  improvements to the "LE-7" main engine, in a bid to reduce  current launch costs 30 percent within three years and  eventually to cut costs in half. It cost 16 billion yen to  launch the first H-2 rocket recently.    Currently, Arianespace of France holds a 60-percent share of  the world's market in the rocket business for launching  communications satellites and other payloads. NASDA and the  Japanese companies plan not only to gain a foothold in this  domain, but also to help promote further achievements in  Japanese space development efforts, which include the "Hope"  project.    Makers of space-related equipment and the Rocket System  Corporation (based in Minato-ku, Tokyo, with Takaaki Yamada as  president), a space industry consortium set up to handle  procurement of the H-2, have compiled a list of several hundred  modifications, the major points of which are as follows: 1) to  reduce the number of components of the LE-7 main engine; 2) to  use less expensive material for the rocket's fairings; and 3) to  reconsider major components of the rocket's second stage "LE-5"  engine. These modifications are expected to help reduce costs  by taking full advantage of the merits of simplifying the  manufacturing process and mass production techniques.    Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has proposed the development of  a  improved version of the LE-7, which is the heart of the H-2  rocket. The company hopes to save several hundreds of millions  of yen by saving extra work in the manufacturing process through  such procedures as repositioning engine components, while  leaving the engine's main structure untouched.    Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries plans to reduce the  number of parts for a turbo pump that is a major component for  the LE-7 and LE-5 engines.    Kawasaki Heavy Industries has proposed using less expensive  material where possible. For example, it has suggested changing  titanium parts used in the H-2's fairings to steel parts for  sections that do not require extremely high-quality parts.    Nissan Motor Company, which handles the production of  auxiliary rocket boosters, plans to improve manufacturing  processes.    NASDA plans to make a decision on which proposals to adopt,  hopefully by mid-April.    Currently, it costs approximately 19 billion yen to launch  one H-2 rocket, including both manufacturing and fuel costs.  Costs cannot be cut back for the next two launches. There is a  considerable difference between the cost of launching an H-2  rocket and that of launching an Ariane rocket; it costs  approximately 10 billion yen to launch the latter. Therefore,  NASDA has asked concerned companies to submit proposals  regarding improvements in the H-2's design.    Modifications are to be made to the H-2 for its sixth and  seventh launches scheduled around 1997-99. Plans are to reduce  manufacturing costs by 30 percent.    Furthermore, for the H-2's twelfth launch scheduled after  2000, plans are to cut back manufacturing costs by 50 percent to  8 billion yen, with total launch costs, which includes the cost  of the rocket's maintenance and inspection as well as fuel,  reduced to approximately 11 billion yen.</p>

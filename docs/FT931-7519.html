			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Managment: An unwelcome visitor calls - The imminent arrival of works councils After more than 20 years of wrangling between the European Commission, employers and unions, the European works councils will soon become a reality  -and there will be no escape for about 100 of Britain's larger multinational companies. Within a couple of years companies such as ICI, Shell, British Airways and Unilever, will have to meet representatives of employees at European level at least twice a year to inform them of key investment, rationalisation and merger decisions. It will not cost them much - perhaps Pounds 50,000 a year to cover travel and interpreters - but the majority of employers strongly resist the proposal arguing that the councils will merely interfere with companies' existing information systems. They are also frightened by the enthusiasm for councils shown by unions, which see them as the first step towards Europe-wide collective bargaining. About 18 European multinationals, mainly French and German, have voluntarily established Europe-wide councils and according to the research group Industrial Relations Services another 31 are planning to follow. Those companies are convinced that councils can help improve worker integration and productivity but they are in a small minority. The imminent arrival of mandatory works councils in British companies will come as a surprise to many. Is not the EC's social dimension in retreat, as a result of recession and disagreements between member states? And has not Britain achieved its famous 'opt-out' from key aspects of future social legislation? Both points are true, but, as the recent dispute over Hoover's transfer of jobs from France to Scotland shows, the rhetoric of the social dimension still has political resonance. And it is Hoover that has placed the European works council back in the limelight. Assuming that Britain continues to block the introduction of works councils through existing mechanisms for social legislation and assuming the Maastricht treaty is ratified, the issue will move to the Social Chapter mechanism agreed at Maastricht before the end of this year. The Social Chapter, from which Britain has excluded itself, allows a far wider range of issues, including works councils for informing employees, to be covered by majority vote (rather than unanimity), and most observers believe that legislation on works councils will be top priority. The 11 Social Chapter countries will probably then send the issue to the 'social partners' - European employers and unions - for nine months of discussion to see if they can reach agreement on the controversial details. Employers say that the current directive, which has just been amended by Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, has an arbitrary trigger mechanism requiring a council to be set up in companies with more than 1,000 workers which operate in at least two EC countries (with a minimum of 100 workers in one of the countries). Senior managers who make the important Europe-wide decisions must meet employee representatives at least once a year. But the criterion for subsequent meetings is vague - any management proposal with 'serious consequences' for the interests of employees - which IBM Europe says could have required 3,000 meetings last year. About 900 undertakings operating in Europe would have been hit by the original works council plan, of which more than 300 are British. About one-third of those UK companies will still be hit, despite the opt-out, because they qualify even excluding their British operations. British companies with a council for their German, French and Italian workers are unlikely to exclude their British workforces, even though they could. But Alan Wild, personnel director at Grand Metropolitan, says that if companies include their British workers why not the Scandinavians too - and at GrandMet's Burger King the relevant management decision-makers also cover Africa and the Middle East.</p>

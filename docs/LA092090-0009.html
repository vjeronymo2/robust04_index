			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUTTING ELECTRIC CARS ON THE ROAD  </P> <P> I'm afraid you gave a very misleading and false impression of electric cars in  your editorial.  </P> <P> Here are the facts:  </P> <P> 1) Although Detroit may not be producing electric cars, our small company is  currently producing and selling them!  </P> <P> 2) Our electric cars are not cumbersome, quite the contrary, they're fun to  drive.  </P> <P> 3) Our electric cars can easily run up freeway ramps and even maintain freeway  speeds.  </P> <P> 4) 90% of all second-car driving is under 21 miles per day, making today's  electrics feasible for about half of all driving needs.  </P> <P> 5) Our cars are affordable ($10,000 to $15,000) and available for purchase now.  </P> <P> GARY STARR  </P> <P> Chief Executive Officer  </P> <P> Rohnert Park, Calif.  </P> <P> Solar Electric  </P></p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Pounds 1.7bn of tax written off The amount of tax written off by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise has mounted steeply during the recession, according to the National Audit Office. The Inland Revenue wrote off Pounds 1.7bn last year, almost double the amount written off in 1991. More than three-quarters of the total is accounted for by insolvency. Customs &amp; Excise wrote off Pounds 825m of value added tax and customs duties as either remitted or irrecoverable last year, up from Pounds 553m in 1991. Most of this is also because traders became insolvent. The Inland Revenue figures show that more than 60 per cent of large employers fail to hand over employees' tax deducted under PAYE within the 14-day time limit after the end of the month. The Revenue has been much more successful at collecting information on the taxable fringe benefits received by more than 3.4m employees. According to the audit office tax offices have achieved a 50 per cent increase in the number of P11D forms they receive from employers giving details of employees' benefits in kind. There remains evidence of a high error rate in the assessment and coding of benefits, however. The audit office says that efforts to catch moonlighters with second undeclared incomes and 'ghosts', people unknown to the tax authorities, yielded Pounds 86m in tax in 1992-93. This is about 5.4 times the cost of the collection work.</p>

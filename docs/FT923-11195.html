			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Cabinet fails to revive Tokyo stocks AN emergency meeting convened by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday failed to bolster the Tokyo stock market, which plunged 3.4 per cent to 15,497.79, a six-year low, and appeared likely to fall further next week. Reports of the unprecedented meeting had encouraged the market on Thursday, but prices fell yesterday after it became clear that the government would simply restate the intention to stimulate the economy later this year with a supplementary budget. Mr Miyazawa's statement appeared to confirm earlier comments by finance ministry officials that the government would not actively intervene in the market in spite of widespread fears of further falls in the Nikkei stock average in coming days. After the meeting, Mr Miyazawa announced that an official large-scale supplementary budget would be decided by mid-September. As for support for the market, the meeting failed to come up with specific measures, and the cabinet and leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic agreed to meet again next Tuesday. Most investors consider the government's move as a 'gesture' indicating concern before tomorrow's upper house elections. Other market participants pointed out that it would take more than lip service to help share prices. 'The market is in a worse condition than the government probably assesses,' said Mr Hiromichi Ishikawa, managing director at Yamaichi Securities. 'Measures which require the market to wait for the effects are not good enough,' he added. Bearishness over the economy in the past week has been cited for the faltering stock market. The Bank of Japan indicated that the recovery it had forecast for the autumn would be delayed and that the economy was still in a 'severe adjustment phase'. The central bank's assessment was supported yesterday by the release of June chain store sales figures showing the first decline in five years, with a 1.1 per cent year-on-year fall. Department store figures for June saw a fourth consecutive decline, falling 3.7 per cent from the previous year. World stock markets, Page 21</p>

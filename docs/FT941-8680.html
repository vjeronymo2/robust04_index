			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Picking up tab for ill-conceived energy gimmick Sir, Bronwen Maddox's article (Business and the Environment, February 16) about funding the Energy Saving Trust by putting a surcharge on fuel bills throws the spotlight on a thoroughly disreputable proposal. The whole concept of centrally inspired energy efficiency is deeply flawed. First, it presupposes that a whole host of microeconomic decisions can lead to a predictable and desirable macroeconomic result. Second, it is neither one thing nor the other: it does not lead to optimal economic resource allocation, nor can it be the basis of targeted energy savings. This is because its effects are unpredictable as well as being economically sub-optimal. Thus the economy as a whole is set to bear the burden of mis-allocation of resources and individual fuel consumers - including those like me who clearly see the flaws - are paraded to pick up the tab for an ill-conceived gimmick.

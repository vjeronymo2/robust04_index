			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALTADENA COMPOSER IS NO. 1 AT KENNEDY CENTER;  </P> <P> MUSIC: WILLIAM KRAFT RECEIVES THE TOP PRIZE AT FRIEDHEIM AWARDS FOR NEW  AMERICAN MUSIC IN WASHINGTON.  </P> <P> Southern California composer William Kraft has taken home the top prize in the  prestigious 1990 Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards for New American Music.  </P> <P> One of four finalists, Kraft was presented with the award Oct. 28 at the  Kennedy Center in Washington.  </P> <P> Kraft shares the first-place slot with Chicago composer Ralph Shapey. Each  received $4,000.  </P> <P> "Of course anyone would want to be the first-place winner," Kraft, 67, said  from his hillside Altadena home. "But I am very proud to be the first-place  winner along with Shapey. He's an extremely respected composer, and I'm very  honored."  </P> <P> During the ceremony, the Orchestra of the Mannes School of Music, conducted by  Michael Charry, played the four chosen works for a small audience and for the  three judges: Tim Page, a New York Times music critic, and conductors David  Zinman and Werner Torkanowsky.  </P> <P> Kraft's composition, "Veils and Variations for Horn and Orchestra," was  nominated by Paul Polivnick, music director for the Alabama Symphony Orchestra.  </P> <P> Kraft has written about 100 compositions, including "Concerto for Four  Percussion Soloists and Orchestra," first conducted by Zubin Mehta and now  Kraft's most oft-played work. Kraft was a percussionist for the Los Angeles  Philharmonic for eight years, a timpanist for 18 years and later  composer-in-residence and assistant conductor there. He also founded the  Philharmonic New Music Group, and today teaches at various California colleges.  </P> <P> Kraft's appearance at the Kennedy Friedheim competition marks the third time he  has been nominated. In 1986 his "Timpani Concerto" took second prize, and in  1987 he was a semifinalist for his string quartet "Weavings."  </P> <P> "It's been wonderful," Kraft said of snaring first place at last. "I've never  had so many congratulatory greetings."  </P></p>

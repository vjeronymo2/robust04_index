			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda  Enclave-Armed Forces of Cabinda [FLEC-FAC] has once again  claimed responsibility for the attack on Malongo in Cabinda. A  spokesman for the organization says the attack on the Chevron  installations in Cabinda was aimed at making sure that Luanda  did not use oil revenue for buying arms to kill Angolans. The  FLEC-FAC source said Cabinda oil accounts for two-thirds of the  state's revenues, three-fourths of which are spent on war. The  Luanda government, as was the case of Malanje, wanted to blame  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola for the  attack on Malongo. This is after all an old communist method  which is still used by Luanda to score advantages over political  and military situations.</p>

To this  end, the economic staff of President Kim has been engrossed in  pushing for financial reform.    The obsolescence of the finance sector had long been cited  as  a fundamental reason for manipulation of the economy by the rich  and the powerful for their own monopolistic ends instead of it  being nourished to provide benefits to all sectors of society.  After thirty years of such manipulation, the income gap has  widened to a point were it could spark social conflict, which  could throw further economic development into a dilemma.    Against this backdrop, the implementation of the real name  financial transaction system had given fresh hope to all. The  real-name system was pushed decisively ahead in last August last  [as published] by an emergency presidential decree as the core  part of the administration's economic reforms. The real-name  financial system was to eradicate all kinds of underground  economic malpractices including speculative transactions and  black market deals.    The second stage of interest rate liberalization was another  achievement of the new administration. The second phase called  for the liberalization of interest rates on all loans excluding  government policy loans. The deregulation of lending rates was  aimed at bringing financial market mechanisms back to normal in  a bid to correct the distorted flow of funds. The prolonged  control of interest rates had functioned as a nucleus giving  birth to mammoth underground curb markets.    Despite the drastic financial reforms, they have failed to  bring about hopeful surge in investment activities and equitable  prosperity. The recent economic trend rather signifies the  sufferings borne by the general public. During the first two  months of this year consumer prices rose by 2.4 percent  threatening already to surpass the target of 3 percent  stipulated in the government's New Economy plan. Last year, the  annual inflation rate was recorded at 5.8 percent, reaching far  beyond the target level for the year. On the contrary, the rich  extravagantly spent on imported goods with new money. Equipped  with abundant liquidity, the rich play in the casino-like stock  market. As a result the unprivileged still stand deprived of  hope.    More gloomy the benefits of increased exports which are made  by the appreciation of the Japanese yen are monopolized by big  businesses. [sentence as published] The lopsided business boom  could tear the economy into two extremes, i.e., excessive boom  for big businesses and serious suffering for small businesses.    The fundamental reason for the negative trend lies in that  the financial reforms were pushed largely in the context of  political show off. The primary purpose of the real-name system  was to bring the underground markets out into the open, thus to  lawfully divert unlawful funds into industrial purposes.  Nevertheless, the government was just busy enough to trap  illegal funds under their control utilizing tax probes.    Such a political and bureaucratic approach immediately  produced an uneasy economic environment discouraging business  activities. The depression of business activities was amplified  by the significant increase in the collapse of small business  firms. More than 40 percent of their funds had been secured  from the curb markets. Upon implementation of the real name  system, the curb markets were virtually frozen causing small  business firms to suffer financial difficulties. Although the  government instantly came up with measures to offer financial  support, the effects bore little results.    What was important to the government was the fact itself  that  the real-name system was implemented rather than the content on  how the new system would affect the economy. Actually, the  real-name system implemented by the government did little but  provide legitimacy to illegal financial transactions by the use  of borrowed names. Out of a total of 33 trillion won in  financial assets estimated to have been traded under non-real  names, only six trillion were changed into real names, which  implies some 27 trillion won of assets still are hidden under  borrowed names disguised as real.    The government plan for the second phase of liberalization  of  interest rates was not effective either in terms of invigorating  financial market functions and correcting underground financial  transactions. The government did not allow free deposit rates  under the second phase. After implementation of the real-name  system, the liberalization that had been needed desperately was  the decontrol of deposit rates. Affected by the real-name  system, the underground funds were frozen and the velocity of  money has significantly fallen. Meanwhile, the government has  continuously supplied new money in a measure to rescue business  firms from their financial difficulties. Theses two factors  combined to put the economy into a trap of liquidity. Under  this situation, the need for decontrol of deposit rates was  absolute in order to have financial institutions absorb the  excess liquidity and channel the funds into productive  investment.    Most defective of the government's financial reforms, the  independence of the central bank was put off for good. The  revision of the law for an independent central bank was on the  list of major election pledges made by President Kim. The  independence of the central bank carries crucial importance as  it halts the vicious political business cycle. It is a general  consensus among economists that only an independent central bank  can pursue a stable monetary policy that may be politically  unpopular yet in public interests.    The current uneasy economic trend may be termed as another  vicious business cycle escalated by political pressure in the  absence of the independence of the central bank. Immediately  after taking office the administration unveiled a 100-day  economic boosting measures in a bid to restore vitality to the  stagnant economy.    The 100-day plan was not adequate at all as it did not take  into account the structural dilemmas faced by the economy.  After the collapse of the large bubble of speculation, the  economy had been experiencing structural stagflation. Thus the  prime economic task was to maintain a stabilization policy and  then to reform the structure. Many economists pointed out that  should an expansionary policy be adopted the stagflation would  spread rapidly to every sector of the economy.    The 100-day stimulus plan was considered by economists as a  political scheme to turn the economic trend into a mood of  celebration. The 100-day plan called for massive expansion of  money supply, pushing business firms to initiate new investment  ventures. Concurrently the plan called for sharing the pain  asking workers to abide by low wage increases and business firms  to freeze prices of goods to control inflation. During the  100-day plan some six trillion won in new money was poured into  the economy. The new printing of money did not stop here. In  the wake of implementation of the real-name system, the  government initiated another round of injeting new money to  soothe adverse impacts. With this, some four trillion won was  printed. Meanwhile the liberalization of interest rates brought  about a third phase of money expansion as a measure to reduce a  possible hike in market interest rates. Some two trillion won  was again released on this account. As feared in the beginning,  the money expansion set inflation on fire which is now pushing  the economy into a state of disorder.    To make matters worse, the government has successively  yielded to foreign pressure to open domestic financial markets.  Last year some five trillion won in foreign funds flowed into  local securities markets as hot money to blow a speculation  wind. Encouraged by the inflow of foreign funds the stock  market index rose to nearly 1,000 points which is the highest  since 1989. The massive inflow of foreign capital raises public  concern that it paralyzes economic stabilization by making  monetary policy impotent in controlling money supply. This  year, another 10 trillion won in foreign funds is yet to come.    Overall, the defective financial reforms are producing an  economic quagmire. Thus corrective measures are needed to  remedy the limping real-name system, such as early  implementation of the global income tax system. Without a  global tax system, the real-name system functions little because  the system has no tool to penalize illegal transactions. Once  the global system is installed, the lenders of names will have  to pay taxes. Thus, the irregular transactions under assumed  names would disappear.    From the legal point of view, a legislative measure is  necessary to outlaw financial transactions under assumed names.    The decontrol of deposit rates remains another task of the  government. The controlled low deposit rates continuously  discourage national savings making scare funds available for  industrial purposes. From this, the problem of printing new  money and the rise in underground curb markets has naturally  stemmed.    The revision of the central bank law must be hurried in  order  to have the financial reforms function the right way.    To root out irregularities, the severance of the unhealthy  tie between politics and economics is a prerequisite. It is a  tie that has subordinated the central bank to the Ministry of  Finance as a window to print money.    The Ministry of Finance has had the central bank serve  virtually as a money pump for political spending. With no power  to resist this, the central bank could only wring its hands as  the economy endured disastrous inflation of 20 to 30 percent per  year. The painful experience of money pumping was repeated  again last year.    The financial reform plan made by the government includes  the  major overhaul of the existing financial industry structure to  modernize the obsolescent market system under the heavy-handed  guidance of the Ministry of Finance. A serious concern rises  that the government's determination of business boundaries for  each financial institution and restructuring of the financial  industry may rather deteriorate the development of financial  market functions because it will legally erect entry barriers  and limit free business activities. The arbitrary government  intervention has been the major cause for the prolonged  obsolescence of the finance industry in Korea. The government  plan may well be regarded as another bureaucratic attempt to  build an iron wall against the growth of market viability.    The ultimate choice for the government to take is to allow  full-fledged deregulation and let financial institutions  determine autonomously the relevant industry structure and  operation rules to their liking. If a free hand is given, a  competitive market mechanism will be formed to push each  institution to develop its own specialty for survival. And the  efficient industry structure will emerge as an evolutionary  process based on market needs in a long run perspective.</p>

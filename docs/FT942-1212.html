			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Bond faces art-fraud charges Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt Australian businessman, has lost his application to delay the art fraud court case being brought against him, on grounds of ill-health. The case concerns four art fraud charges relating to the multi-million dollar acquisition and sale of La Promenade, a French Impressionist painting, while Mr Bond was a director of Bond Corporation in the 1980s, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Mr Bond's lawyers, who had asked for a six-month adjournment, claimed that Mr Bond was suffering from depression and brain damage following open-heart surgery, and was not well enough to instruct solicitors. But Mr Ivan Brown, a Perth-based magistrate, said yesterday that Mr Bond had chosen to spend his time conducting business transactions, and ruled that the case should proceed as planned on July 18.</p>

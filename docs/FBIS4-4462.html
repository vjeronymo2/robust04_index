			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Le Huu Nghia: "Maintain Political Stability and </F> Renovate the Political System"]    [Text] Over the years, we have made initial yet very  important achievements in maintaining political stability and  renovating the political system despite a very complex  international and domestic situation caused by the crumbling of  socialism in the Soviet Union and East Europe, the increase in  sabotage against our regime by hostile domestic forces, and the  occasionally acute difficulties with the economy and everyday  life. The maintenance of political stability as it has been in  the past has become a prerequisite for ensuring success in the  renovation process. Political stability is also an essential  factor in broadening international relations and attracting  foreign investment capital. Political stability prevents people  from losing confidence in the party and state.    The past few years have seen changes for the better in the  organization and mode of operations of the party and state.  Political and social organizations have developed in a more  diversified fashion and their social character and dynamism have  increased. The process of democratization has been initiated  within the party and in society. Democracy has become more  lively in political, cultural, and ideological activities. The  roles of the National Assembly, various mass organizations, and  the mass media have increased sharply.    Without our economic renovation achievements, the  aforementioned achievements would have been impossible. Recent  achievements in economic renovation have emerged as the most  prominent ones. It is because of economic renovation that we  have maintained political stability and renovated our political  system in accordance with economic development requirements.    Our achievements in maintaining political stability and  renovating the political system are the result not only of  economic renovation, but of other important factors as well:    -- The role of various factors in the political system,  especially the role of our party, which has been quick to come  up with a correct renovation policy that suits the objective  reality and meets the aspirations of the masses, and which knows  how to undertake renovation in accordance with principles and  appropriate steps.    -- Our people and our nation have a tradition of following  the party. They voluntarily recognize party leadership. They  do not want political instability or the collapse of the  socialist regime. All of our people desire political stability  so they can "earn their living," achieve economic development,  and improve their livelihood. They do not want political  pluralism or multiparty opposition, as this will only create  social disturbances.    -- Our Army and security forces are also loyal to the party  and the people. They have a lot of experience in defending the  fatherland and maintaining political security, public order, and  safety. They are taking the initiative in effectively fighting  attempts at "peaceful evolution" by hostile forces.    In addition to the achievements we have already made, there  are many issues yet to be tackled:    -- Recent economic achievements have only been preliminary.  The market economy has just taken shape. Efforts to set a  socialist course for the market economy are still uncertain and  unclear, both in theory and practice. There is no way that the  development of the market economy and the multisector economy  can avoid creating an impact on the social and class structure,  thereby affecting the political system. It is likely to create  new complications in the political field. In addition, hostile  forces are exploiting our effort to open ourselves economically  and culturally to carry out sabotage activities aimed at  creating political instability conducive to a change in our  political course.    -- Our state's ability to regulate and manage the market  economy is still poor and weak, thus creating occasional  confusion in the socioeconomic situation and encouraging  activities that violate the law and good ethics (including tax  evasion, production of fake goods, embezzlement, smuggling, and  so forth). This only benefits opportunists and speculators who  work hand-in-glove with degenerate officials in various state  agencies. It should be noted that this is the main cause of  corruption and smuggling.    -- A segment of our people -- including cadres, party  members, and especially our youth -- have not firmly grasped the  real concept of the socialist ideal and orientation.    -- Renovation in the organization and activities of the  party, state, and mass organizations has not been effective.  Likewise, renovation of the political system has not paralleled  that of the economic domain, especially the strengthening of  organizations and mechanisms. It can be said that bureaucratism  and cumbersomeness are still prevalent in our state apparatuses.  Our legal system is still poor and inconsistent, while law  enforcement is carried out loosely, thus encouraging violations  of laws and regulations.    -- Our party activities to promote the market economy are  inconsistent, while many issues related to the building of a  law-governed state have not been resolved. The working  mechanism designed to delegate authority and define duties and  responsibilities between the law-building, law enforcement, and  administrative agencies in the market economic system has not  been fully established.    -- A number of adverse factors have emerged that may cause  political instability and promote the schemes of "peaceful  evolution," sabotage, rebellion, and overthrow being carried out  by reactionary forces at home and abroad. We should not  belittle these factors. Instead, we should carefully study  their complexity, dangers, and consequences in order to  formulate active measures to prevent, overcome, and stop them.    Through our efforts to maintain political stability and  renovate our political system in past years, we have drawn on  some experiences and deem it necessary to carry out the  following tasks:    1. Resolutely maintain party leadership while renovating  party activities; reject political pluralism and the multiparty  system, because this will allow the enemies of the class  struggle to have a chance to compete with our party, thereby  causing political instability and rebellion against our system.    2. Strive to combine correctly the economic renovation task  with that of renovating the political system, taking the former  as the main task.    3. Continue to take economic renovation as a basis for  developing the economy and resolving various pressing problems  in people's daily lives. Through these tasks, we will be able  to restore people's confidence in the party while promoting  ideological and psychological work.    4. Strive to resolve various social issues to create healthy  social conditions for renovating and stabilizing the political  system. To attain this goal, we must strive to: overcome  promptly such pressing problems as corruption and smuggling;  prevent decadent culture from coming into our country in various  forms; oppose social injustice; create more jobs for the people;  narrow the gap between rich and poor; settle the land problem in  the countryside satisfactorily to prevent "serious causes" that  may create social conflict; strengthen vigilance against the  "peaceful evolution" scheme; and foil resolutely all sabotage  and rebellious activities by reactionary forces at home and  abroad.</p>

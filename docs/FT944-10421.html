			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Four-year surge in ADR and GDR issues - Emerging markets have put depositary receipts in the spotlight The global depositary receipt has been thrust into the spotlight by the increasing globalisation of equity markets and a steep increase in demand for capital from companies in the emerging markets of Latin America, Asia and eastern Europe. Since its birth with the first humble Dollars 40m issue in 1990, the market for global depositary receipts (GDRs) has experienced rapid growth. Issues to date this year exceed Dollars 5.5bn, an increase by a factor of more than a hundred times since 1990. The more traditional American depositary receipt (ADR) has also seen a surge in issuance from companies in emerging markets, following the modification of US securities laws in 1990. The passage by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Rule 144a amended securities legislation governing private placement issues to 'qualified institutional buyers' - effectively large institutions. This eliminated the holding period - the period of time for which buyers must hold shares before trading them - and introduced greater liquidity to the US market. Foreign companies can also raise capital through the 144a market without incurring the expensive regulatory and accounting burdens entailed with the direct issue of shares. 'The rule 144a market has had a very positive effect on the globalisation of the US capital market,' said Mr Mark Bach, global sales director of Citibank, which launched so-called rule 144a depositary receipts in 1990 and now acts as depositary for 41 per cent of the issuers launching depositary receipts. The rate of growth of this instrument has outpaced that of the international bond markets, where issuance doubled to Dollars 481bn between 1990 and 1993. During the first nine months of 1994, 184 companies from 40 countries launched new ADR or GDR programmes, compared with only 96 during the same period of last year. In the third quarter alone 80 companies launched programmes, up 135 per cent on last year's figures. Emerging market issuers now account for 61 per cent of the new depositary receipts, compared with 11 per cent of new programmes issued in 1990. 'The emerging markets are by far the fastest growing segment of the depositary receipt business today,' notes Mr Bach. Aside from the rapid growth in global equity issues in general and the growing popularity of foreign issues for US investors, two other other factors help explain the popularity of the depositary receipt mechanism for companies in emerging markets seeking to raise capital from institutions in the United States, Europe and Asia. Depositary receipt programmes allow investors to circumvent problems caused by poor or unwieldy settlement systems. That has been a particularly attractive factor in India, where the Bombay Stock Exchange has a 45-day settlement period. It could also play an important part in expanding the DR market as companies in Russia, where settlement systems are primitive, seek to raise capital on world markets. International investors have little confidence in the ability of domestic institutions to safeguard securities, which makes trade in the depositary receipt proxy an attractive alternative. Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, is planning a multi-billion GDR issue for Gazprom, the country's giant gas company, which aims to sell a 9 per cent stake to international investors next year. Last week, international trading in shares held by a Cyprus-based holding company of RNGS, the giant Russian oil and gas construction company, began. The shares are held by the holding company, which in turn holds the RNGS shares, along the lines of a depositary receipt issue. The use of a depositary receipt allows international investors access to equity markets which would otherwise be out of reach. Jardine Fleming, the UK-based investment bank, has constructed a Dollars 250m issue for Benpres, the largest broadcasting group in the Philippines, to allow foreigners to own receipts but not the underlying shares. Local legislation places restrictions on the foreign ownership of the shares of media companies. Among big issuers of depositary receipts this year are Korean companies, which have raised Dollars 473.9m so far in 1994, bringing total issuance by companies from the country to Dollars 1.19bn since 1990. Last month Korea Electric Power, Korea's biggest company by capitalisation, became the country's second company to list on the New York Stock Exchange, when it raised Dollars 300m in a global equity offering of 14.9m ADRs. October also saw one of Asia's biggest ever international equity offerings through DRs, when Indosat, Indonesia's international telecommunications company, raised more than Dollars 720m through an issue of 22.5m ADRs. Citibank also singles out Hong Kong (17 issues), Brazil (16 issues) and Mexico (16 issues) and South Africa (10 issues) as highly active issuers of depositary receipts in the first nine months of this year. However, growth has been particularly rapid in India, where more than 29 companies have issued depositary receipt programmes in the first nine months of the year. Indian companies have raised more than Dollars 2.2bn in DR issues alone so far this year compared with less than Dollars 900m last year. And since the first Indian DR was issued in 1992, 50 Indian companies have received almost Dollars 4bn of the Dollars 11bn raised from DR issues. Mr Ian Hannam, a director of Jardine Fleming, believes India has many attractions over other emerging markets. 'The real attractions are the existence of a middle class the size of the entire USA, and a recognised legal and accounting framework for the ownership of assets.' The absence of a legal framework for the ownership of assets is a problem for the emerging economies of eastern Europe, but not for India, he said. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the prospective sale of Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the state-controlled international telecommunications monopoly, prospects are still regarded as good, with overall DR issuance alone in India expected to climb to Dollars 2.5bn by the end of the year. Indeed, the Indian DR market could be about to enter a new phase following the change in rules governing the issuance of DRs. The government has ended the use of warrants, which give investors the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future. Warrants were often used to make an offer more attractive, since they could be priced more cheaply than existing shares. The end of warrants is likely to mean a two-tier market emerging for Indian GDRs, believe some investment bankers. Whereas blue-chip companies such as Bajaj Auto, whose issue was priced at a premium to the underlying share, are likely to find an enthusiastic welcome, second-line companies are likely to struggle, bankers believe. However, with more than 20 permissions given by the Indian government for fundraising issues of Dollars 100m currently outstanding, the GDR has an active future. At least one London merchant bank is believed to be looking at using GDRs to finance telecom projects in India, which is likely to remain the biggest market for GDRs.  --------------------------------------------         HOW THE BANKS LINE UP IN GDRs  -------------------------------------------- Bookrunner               USDollars m    No of                                        issues  -------------------------------------------- 1  Goldman Sachs             2,120        14 2  Jardine Fleming           1,579        10 3  CSFB                        777         8 4  HSBC                        770        10 5  Morgan Stanley              770         7 6  BZW                         696         8 7  Baring Brothers             624        10 8  Banco Roberts               535         2 9  Banque Paribas              446         6 10 Lehman Brothers             368         5 11 Merrill Lynch               316         5 12 Salomon Bros                304         3 13 Schroder Wagg               280         2 14 JP Morgan                   276         2 15 Kleinwort Benson            225         2 16 Deutsche Bank               142         1 17 Citicorp                    126         2 18 Daiwa                       118         2 19 Smith Barney                107         1 20 SG Warburg                 95         2 21 Peregrine Capital            90         2 22 Crosby Securities            55         1 23 Banque Indosuez              52         2 24 Banamex Accival              51         1 25 NM Rothschild              50         1 26 Lazard Brothers              35         1 26 Lucky Securities             35         1 26 Nikko Securities             35         1 29 Dresdner Bank                18         1 29 UBS                          18         1  -------------------------------------------- Total since 1990 11,113114  -------------------------------------------- Source: Euromoney Bondware  --------------------------------------------</p>

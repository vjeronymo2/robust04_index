			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Ticket agencies aim to curb touts Ticket agencies plan a self-regulating organisation to curb touting and deal with complaints, Tim Burt writes. Executives from some of the largest agencies have drafted a code of practice and proposed a Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers to improve the industry's reputation. They said action needed to be taken against touts charging exorbitant prices and pledged to curb intimidation and forgeries. Under the code of practice, up to 4,000 ticket outlets would agree to 10 pages of regulations covering items such as 'fair value', booking fees and compensation, funded from annual fees paid by agencies adopting the code. The move follows frustration among theatre owners and event promoters that the government has decided to make touting illegal only for football matches. Agencies said the code would be recognised by the Office of Fair Trading and the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Stock index futures fell steeply yesterday, blighted partly by heavy selling from a number of US houses, and premiums to the cash market narrowed dramatically. In relatively heavy trading volume, the FT-SE 100 December contract retraced all of the previous session's gain, closing a full 60 points down at 2,996. At this level the premium to the cash market is 3.5 points - in market contrast to Wednesday's occasional 20 points-plus - with the fair value premium at around 19. Most of the morning and early afternoon was characterised by modest activity. But some US houses, notably Citicorp and Goldman Sachs, weighed in heavily with selling orders after 3pm. The December contract bounced back above 3,000 after the official close, but traders said the level of last-minute support had been tentative at best. At the 4:10pm official close, trading volume was 14,021 contracts, broadly in line with the previous day, rising to 16,321 by the end of the day. Traded option turnover edged lower to 28,981 lots from the 30,859 of the previous session. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume totalled 9,305 contracts. Ladbroke was the most actively traded stock option at 2,413 lots, followed by Argyll Group at 2,068 contracts and Forte at 1,563.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the session of parliament in Georgia on Thursday  [19 May]. Opposition parties again demanded to disavow the  agreement on cease-fire and the disengagement of troops, which  was signed in Moscow on 14 May following the results of the  Georgian-Abkhazian talks. The document envisages the withdrawal  of the Georgian and Abkhazian units from the line of  confrontation passing along the Inguri River, the deployment in  the "buffer zone" of peacekeepers. The opposition believes that  the materialization of the document will lead to the loss of  Abkhazia.    Deputy Irakly Tsereteli demanded that question be raised on  confidence to the head of state Eduard Shevardnadze. If this is  not done before 26 May, Day of Independence, he said, people  will do this, instead of parliament.    The argument caused by the signing by Georgia of an  agreement  on the settlement, nearly broke the session of parliament on  Tuesday.    Commenting in an interview with INTERFAX on the demands to  hold early parliamentary elections, leader of the Republican  Party, Ivlian Khandrava said that he did not see any legitimate  mechanism for holding them.    The only way, he said, is the consent of two-thirds of the  current parliament which is impossible to obtain. All the rest  steps, including referendums and decisions by the head of state  would not be legitimate, he said.</p>

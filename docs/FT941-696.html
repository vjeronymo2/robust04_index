			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Firms decide against merging operations - Legal briefs Against the expectation of the legal services market, the Norton Rose/M5 group of English law firms has decided not to merge its operations into a single national partnership. A review of the group's activities has concluded that there is at present no business case for merging all seven firms into a national practice and the present structure remains the one best suited to help group members deliver the service their clients require. The group will therefore continue to collaborate on professional development and support, including training, recruitment and exchange of information and know-how and also in business development, particularly by marketing the firms as a group overseas. Mr Jonathan Barclay, a partner of Norwich solicitors Mills &amp; Reeve and chairman of the group's board, said nine months ago he would not have guessed this would have been the outcome of the review. But the more they looked into the actual needs of clients, the clearer it became that there was no significant advantage in merger.</p>

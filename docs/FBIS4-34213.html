			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Correspondent Tania Monetiro] </F>   [Text] Cartagena, 14 Jun (AE) -- President Itamar Franco  today gave an optimistic speech regarding the implementation of  the economic stabilization plan during the opening session of  the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Chiefs of State and  Government. "The Brazilian economic stabilization program meets  the political and economic demands of openness and fiscal  balance which are essential to correct the serious distortions  caused by the high interest rate we are enduring," President  Itamar said. In reply to those who say that the economic  measures are aimed at helping Fernando Henrique Cardoso's  candidacy for president of the Republic, President Itamar took  the opportunity to point out that the economic plan "is not  aimed at short-term goals; it attempts to make the Brazilian  people recover their confidence in the future."    Meanwhile, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said  during an interview that it is not enough for Brazil to follow a  correct path to consolidate the economic plan. "The  international environment should also be favorable," he said.  Amorim today commented ironically on an article published in the  Colombian press which stated that Brazil is the inflation champ  in the American continent. He said: "That is so only until 1  July," after which he added that in two, three, or four months  the situation of Brazil will be privileged. Amorim added that  despite the high inflation, one-third of foreign investments in  Latin America are invested in Brazil, even before the economy  stabilizes.    In his speech, President Itamar mentioned the government  measures to make the state efficient. "The people and the  government are united with the same determination. We no longer  permit the antiethical behavior that threatened the foundations  of civilian society," the president said. Franco said that the  economic plan is entering a decisive stage and that it will soon  establish a new macroeconomic standard in the country.    During his speech, Itamar took the opportunity to enumerate  the accomplishments of his administration during the past 18  months. He mentioned that the Brazilian GDP increased by 5  percent last year and that the same rhythm of growth will be  maintained this year. Brazilian foreign trade is experiencing an  unprecedented openness. "We abolished all the non-tariff  barriers on imports; we reduced the average import tax from 54  percent to 14 percent." The president also mentioned the  exchange reserves which amount to approximately $38 billion, the  76 million tonne agricultural harvest, and the 9.6 percent  industrial recovery. He also mentioned the Brazilian foreign  debt agreement with the international financial community.    For Franco, "stability is not an objective by itself." He  added: "The resumption of growth cannot be isolated from  policies that comprise a social dimension." According to Itamar,  the benefits of modernization should reach everyone. "Social  exclusion, poverty, and hunger must be eliminated from our  countries and the world, because the presence of these evils  weakens our society and undermines international cohesion," he  said.    President Itamar also directly alluded to the 3 October  elections: "During a pre-election period, which must yield  important results for the future of Brazil, we are witnessing a  process of political maturity among our citizens, with the  certainty that democratic conviction will be the great winner in  this electoral dispute," he said.</p>

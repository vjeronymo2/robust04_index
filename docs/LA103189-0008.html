			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PIXLEY;  </P> <P> 2 CHILDREN DIE, BABY SAVED IN FIRE  </P> <P> A woman in the Tulare County community of Pixley smashed a window in her  family's burning mobile home and tossed her 2-month-old infant out to safety,  but two other children were trapped inside and died, authorities said. The  bodies of 3-year-old Steve Lenox Jr. and his 8-year-old sister, Amy, were found  a few feet from the front door, county fire officials said. The children's  mother, Sandra, had crawled through the broken window after throwing her infant  out, deputies said. But when she and her husband, Steve, tried to get back into  the burning structure to save the others, the flames held them back. Lenox was  in serious condition at a Fresno hospital, and his wife was treated for minor  burns and released.  </P></p>

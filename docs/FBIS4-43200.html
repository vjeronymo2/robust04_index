			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 10 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin said on Friday [10 June] that the Netherlands struggled  against terrorism within its legal framework adding that it  tried to prevent terrorism activities.    Cetin met Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans during the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council meetings and said Dutch laws  did not ban an organization or an association which is not  directly involved in a violation.    `Kooijmans conveyed that they are obviously taking  additional  measures and they struggle with possible terrorism activities  that could come from other sides of Europe,' Cetin said.    `Kooijmans said there were reported ones who are under  custody and some of them were extradited. They stressed  importance to preventing terrorism activities rather than  banning,' he added.    Cetin said European friends and allies should give support  to  Turkey on terrorism adding that giving this support is an  international obligation.    He also said they discussed developments in the European  Union [EU] and Turkish-EU relations.</p>

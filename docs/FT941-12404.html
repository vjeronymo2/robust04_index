			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Futures trading loss at Codelco may hit Dollars 200m Codelco, Chile's state copper company, yesterday admitted that losses on futures trading over the past four months amounted to a 'provisional' Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m), double the figure announced last week. Mr Juan Pablo Davila, Codelco's chief futures trader, is alleged to have committed a series of errors - without the knowledge of his superiors - which led to the unprecedented loss. 'Unfortunately, in the past two days, we have detected that there were also operations in gold and silver. . . in which we have made losses of more than Dollars 50m,' said Mr Alejandro Noemi, Codelco president. Losses in copper futures were about Dollars 150m, he said. Mr Noemi said internal controls - including ones that set a maximum loss of Dollars 1m in any single operation - had proved ineffective. 'The failure of these controls permitted Mr Davila to lead the company to this disaster,' he said. Mr Davila, who has admitted through his lawyer to having conducted loss-making transactions, has been helping Codelco executives to quantify the extent of the problems. However, he has been unavailable for public comment. Mr Noemi refused to answer questions as to how Mr Davila, acting alone, could have extended lines of credit with brokers above normal limits. 'I have to keep this secret,' he said. Mr Jorge Bande, acting vice-president for marketing, said: 'We are investigating who requested the lines of credit, if they were indeed requested, and who approved them, if they were approved.' Referring to reports that Mr Davila had committed Codelco to futures contracts involving 1.8m tonnes of copper, Mr Bande said: 'This figure appears enormous, being nearly twice Codelco's (annual) production. But you have to understand that these operations involve entering and leaving the market several times a day. Therefore the operating volume could reach 1m tonnes or more.' About half of these contracts, maturity dates for which will come due throughout 1994 and 1995, remained open, he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's statements  during a breakfast meeting in Mexico City have sparked much  interest among the attending diplomats. During the final phase  of the meeting, he took a question from one of the ambassadors.  The Nicaraguan ambassador asked a question regarding the future  dissolution or reduction of the Guatemalan Army.    [Begin recording] [Nicaraguan Ambassador Jose Ernesto  Fonseca] [Words indistinct]    [De Leon Carpio] Army reduction in our case is not viable,  and I believe in general this is not possible, because even  countries that supposedly have no armies do in fact have them.  Our Constitution clearly establishes the presence and  establishment of a single army and does not accept another armed  group or any irregulars; thus, according to the president, there  is no room for this topic.    Regarding the first part, indeed there have been talks  within  the Armed Forces on retraining and even on reduction. A study  is being undertaken in accordance with Guatemalan Army plans and  with conditions that are going to take place, but naturally the  armed conflict must end before this can happen. It is  impossible to ask for an Army reduction while subversives are  present, while there is an enemy inside the country.    Much has been said about the Civil Defense Patrols, and I am  going to broach the subject right away, because there have been  requests for their dissolution. They form part of, precisely,  Guatemala's defense system. The Civil Defense Patrols are  groups of people who have joined together. There have been many  discussions as to whether they are really volunteers. A poll  was taken recently by the human rights ombudsman, who replaced  me, and the result was very surprising, as far as the level of  volunteers is concerned, by those who comprise the so-called  PAC's, Civilian Self-Defense Patrols, which are now called  Civilian Defense Volunteer Committees.    Much has been said to the effect they should be dissolved,  because some members of these patrols commit abuses; this is  true, and we admit it. We are aware of this and have issued  orders that whenever these abuses take place, when these occur  and illegal acts or crimes are committed, they will be placed on  trial just like any ordinary citizen. We admit they have caused  us problems, but to go as far as eliminating those who have  halted the advance of subversion is illogical and naive.    In Guatemala, many groups are asking for the elimination of  these defense volunteers, not only groups within Guatemala but  groups abroad, and I have always said when groups like this  request this elimination, they are either naive or do not want  the subversives' advance to be stemmed.    These civilian defense patrols have been an example the  world  over on the way one can counter and hinder the advance of  guerrilla warfare to such an extent that many countries have  regrettably copied this. I say regrettably, because I regret  guerrilla warfare has also taken place in other countries.    Other countries have copied the way our people--who are  angered by their sufferings, their orphans, their widows,  etc.--have become organized to defend themselves. It is  difficult for the Guatemalan Army or any other Army in the world  to control terrorists' advances. The organized civilian efforts  have furthered our country's military defense, however, because  they have stopped the guerrilla's advances; this is what they  have done and that is why we have won the military war. The  rebels have been militarily defeated.    In this respect, I would like to add there is already a  disposition for [words indistinct] in the places where there is  no confrontation. The defense minister will confirm there are  no guerrillas in two-thirds of the country, and in the other  [words indistinct] there are no Civilian Defense patrols.    I have noticed, however, there is a great deal of confusion  regarding groups such as the Civilian Defense Patrols and the  Peace and Development Committees. They are very well-organized  groups, which, in the future, when they no longer need weapons,  can be of great help in furthering economic and social  development in their own communities. We would like the defense  minister to add to our comments.    [Guatemalan Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez Morales]  [Passage omitted] Messrs Ambassadors: With regard to  dissolving, reducing, modifying, or renovating the Army, we  [words indistinct] a draft to the president of the Republic on  how to renovate the Guatemalan Army once the guerrilla threat  has ended. Many of the suggested actions are already being  implemented by those who have the constitutional responsibility  to do so and in compliance with the orders of the constitutional  president of the Republic. We believe those reforms will allow  us to modify and strengthen certain areas; for example, [words  indistinct], to become more effective.    The Army reforms will allow us to change quantity for  quality. The measures have to be organized and will include the  [words indistinct] studies from the military academy, the  university, and the centers for military studies. A person who  graduates as an officer cannot be ranked as such if he does not  have a [words indistinct] of a liberal career. Nobody will be  able to take [words indistinct] course and much less the command  staff course if he does not have a university degree or a  master's degree in any of the liberal disciplines. This program,  gentlemen, has already started. [Passage indistinct]... because  there is still an ongoing armed conflict. There is, however,  [words indistinct] to change quantity for quality in the  Guatemalan Army. The president of the Republic knows this well  and, moreover, he has approved such efforts. I do not want to  take more of your time, so I will not add further. Thank you.  [end recording]</p>

Inflation seems to have been brought under control, reaching  close to zero in France and suffering only minor hiccoughs in  Germany, and market ups and downs have been proved nothing but  temporary hitches in what is a mainly stable environment.    These elements, the sources said, prompted something akin to  optimism amongst the European bank governors, who may now begin  putting pressure on Germany to separate its economic policy from  that of the United States, where recovery is already under way.  Germany will be asked to act for itself with greater  determination.    The Germans have promised not to let future decisions be  overshadowed by January's massive growth in money supply, and  other European nations are now looking forward to a downturn in  interest rates, the sources said.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Japan plays uneasy host to environment debate WHEN 27 former prime ministers, presidents and other eminent persons gather in Tokyo today to discuss the financing of environmental protection, the Japanese government will be relieved if the talk is of lofty ideas rather than down-to-earth proposals. The meeting, an important precursor to the Earth Summit in June, is an indication of Tokyo's determination to be a leader in the debate on the environment. However, the three-day gathering could also highlight the contradictions of a Japanese environment policy that means well but has yet to be given the substance of hard political decisions. Hosted by Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, and sponsored by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), the meeting will produce a 'Tokyo Declaration' intended to stimulate pre-Earth Summit debate and provide guidelines for assisting the economies of developing countries. After the meeting, the eminent persons, including Mr Jimmy Carter, former US president, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, former Singapore leader, and Mr Barber Conable, former World Bank president, will be expected to exercise an enlightened influence on their own governments' summit proposals. However, the meeting could provide evidence that the expectations for the June summit are too great, and highlight the reluctance of governments to support fine sentiment with policy changes and money. Mr Takeshita, who still runs the largest faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, has previously explained that holding the conference here reflects 'Japan's intention to play an active role'. It is appropriate that the Keidanren, Japan's Federation of Economic Organisations, is co-hosting the conference, as its presence will be a reminder of the important role Japanese industry plays in influencing official policy. Larger Japanese companies have publicly embraced environmental themes with enthusiasm, but their strong opposition to policies limiting domestic growth has hampered Tokyo's role in the international debate on the environment. The government is discussing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, but the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) opposes such a tax. Japan has two targets for the stabilisation of carbon dioxide emissions, a Miti target and a target set by the Environment Agency, and depending on whom you consult, each is the 'official' target. The Environment Agency calls for a freezing of total emissions at present levels by the year 2000, while the Miti target allows for an 8 per cent increase in emissions by 'freezing' at per capita levels. Japan has gone much further than the US in the carbon dioxide debate, but the ambiguity of these policies has contributed to lower expectations of Tokyo's influence on the environmental debate. The country is still often seen as more a provider of funds than of inspiration. Miti takes the view that technology transfer is a useful Japanese contribution to the environment. The eminent persons' conference will discuss the delicate issue of who should pay for developed countries' technology transfers. It is a question particularly relevant to Japan during a period of economic slowdown. The large increases in Japanese aid during the late 1980s were supported by the longest period of post-war economic development, but the stock market collapse and a slowing of tax income has put pressure on the aid budget. Conference delegates will discuss a timetable for a gradual increase in official development assistance to 0.7 per cent of developed countries' gross national product (GNP), with a view to using some of the increase for environmental protection. In Japan's case, that would mean a rise from 0.31 per cent, an increase that the finance ministry will not tolerate in the present financial conditions. Fujitsu, the electronics maker, yesterday announced that it will phase out by next March the use of harmful chlorofluorocarbons in semiconductor washing. And, a few weeks ago, Toyota Motor, the largest car maker, announced its own Earth Charter, drafted by a newly formed Toyota Environment Committee. The eminent persons should applaud such corporate commitments to the environment, but they would also be advised to emphasise to the Japanese government that its own contribution to the debate needs to be as unambiguous as the promise made by Fujitsu.</p>

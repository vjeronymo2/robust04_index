Northwest states that the smaller design capacity would be adequate to deliver the current MDDO of 128 dth per day at this point. Northwest states that the estimated cost of replacing the facilities at the Genesee Meter Station is $30,440, including the $2,622 cost of removing the retired facilities. Northwest indicates that since it initiated this project to replace obsolete equipment, Northwest would not require any cost reimbursement from Water Power. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, Northwest states that no significant impact on Northwest's peak day or annual deliveries is projected from the proposed facility replacement. Northwest's tariff does not prohibit the modification of delivery point facilities and any volumes delivered to the Genesee delivery point would be within the authorized entitlements of any shipper. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If not protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

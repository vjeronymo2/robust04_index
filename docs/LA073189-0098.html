			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOG ALL HUD CALLS, FORMER SENATOR URGES  </P> <P> Top officials in the Department of Housing and Urban Development should have to  keep a log of every visitor and telephone call as a means of discouraging  influence-peddling that pervaded the agency, a former senator proposed today.  </P> <P> "Some will say that requiring such reports as a matter of law is too  burdensome, is an interference with privacy or is micromanaging," former Sen.  William Proxmire (D-Wis.) told a House panel. "Keep in mind these are public  officials. They are on the public payroll. They are dealing with hundreds of  millions of dollars of the public's money."  </P> <P> Proxmire, who was chairman of a Senate subcommittee with responsibility for  overseeing the department, acknowledged today that he was "chagrined that I had  no idea what was going on at HUD" until congressional hearings began in recent  months.  </P> <P> Witnesses before the House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and  employment have said that HUD contracts worth millions of dollars were awarded  on the basis of political influence.  </P> <P> HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who took office this year with a pledge to clean up  the department, has estimated that the corruption has cost the government $2  billion.  </P> <P> Many of the deals now under investigation involved former HUD officials or  well-connected Republicans who used their influence at the top levels of the  agency to gain approval for projects in which they had some financial interest.  </P> <P> Proxmire said his proposal, requiring reports on such meetings be given to  Congress and the news media, would force HUD officials to make an immediate  public accounting of their actions in the future.  </P> <P> The subcommittee heard later today from Maurice Barksdale, a former HUD  assistant secretary, and John Knapp, former general counsel to the department.  </P></p>

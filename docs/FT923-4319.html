			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Canada counters E Asia's Nafta fears MR Michael Wilson, Canada's industry and international trade minister, has rebutted statements by Malaysia and other East Asian countries about the North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) being a trade bloc and barrier to trans-Pacific trade growth. 'Nafta is a free-trade agreement. It's not our intent to see any increase in barriers with other countries,' he said in Kuala Lumpur. Japan and Malaysia, meanwhile, agreed yesterday to issue a 'strong warning' to the US, Canada and Mexico over Nafta. Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister of international trade and industry, said he had agreed with his Malaysian counterpart, Mrs Rafidah Aziz, to issue the warning. Asked to elaborate, Mr Watanabe said: 'We will express our opposition to regionalism and protectionism in all cases.' The Japanese have expressed concern that Nafta could lead to the world splitting into trade blocs. Mr Watanabe said the warning would be issued at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) talks in Bangkok on Thursday. Asked if he discussed a two-year-old proposal for an East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC) aimed at economic and trade co-operation, Mr Watanabe said: 'We discussed the future of Asia from a broader perspective, including all of these matters.' Japan has not supported the EAEC concept. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian premier, has been pushing for EAEC. The US opposes it, saying it would 'draw a line through the Pacific'. The issues are likely to head talks at the Apec talks.</p>

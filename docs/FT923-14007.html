			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Brussels warned by consumers EUROPE'S leading consumer group and a former European commissioner yesterday warned that over-zealous attempts to assert the principle of subsidiarity might undermine the benefits of the single market. Mr Peter Sutherland, a former competition commissioner now chairing a committee on the single market, said yesterday that the EC should not compromise the 1992 objectives for fear of treading on its member states' toes. 'I'm extremely dubious about having exceptions to the single market, because I think they would be abused,' he said. Following the Danish vote against the Maastricht treaty, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has said it might be preferable to settle for an incomplete single market, rather than a perfect market which might be rejected by EC citizens. Mr Sutherland said: 'I think generalisations like that are extremely dangerous.' The European Consumers' Union identifies a number of existing and potential problems, including omissions and exceptions to the market.</p>

The first major public signs of fear, tension and  conflict within the Prague government are begining to appear as a possible  consequence of the high-level message, the newspaper said. Moscow is reported  to have cautioned Prague not to make the same mistakes as those made by party  hard-liners elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the paper said.  </P></p>

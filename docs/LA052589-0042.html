			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  HINTS FROM HELOISE: SPICES WON'T SPOIL BUT THEY MAY LOSE THEIR POTENCY AS TIME  GOES BY  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: How long can one keep spices in the cupboard? We will be moving  in the near future and I was wondering if I should throw them all out and start  anew since I have had some of them for a few years.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE, Belleville, N.J.  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: Before you throw away all those spices, check each one for its  individually strong, full-bodied aroma and a fresh look. Spices will not go bad  or spoil; instead, they may lose their potency as time goes by.  </P> <P> The oils in spices, which give them their flavor, escape when exposed to heat,  moisture or air and eventually deteriorate if stored for a long time. This is  why it is very important not to store any spices near or over areas of  higher-than-normal heat or humidity such as over or near a stove, sink or  dishwasher. Also, a good habit to get into is to replace the lid of a spice  container as soon as you are through with it to keep it fresh.  </P> <P> If you have added a particular spice to a recipe and the food does not taste  properly seasoned, the spice has probably lost its potency and should then be  thrown away.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Here is what I do to remove any lingering odor of oven cleaner: I  spread a thick layer of newspaper on the floor of the oven and with a spray  bottle filled with warm water, I spray the top and sides of the oven well.  After drying the inside of the oven with a clean cloth, I roll up the newspaper  carefully and discard it.  </P> <P> This removes all of the oven cleaner residue and prevents bad odors when I  first turn the oven after it's been cleaned.  </P> <P>  -- FRANCES, Delta, Utah  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have heard of several ways to flour a cake pan. Some say to use  cocoa powder when baking a chocolate cake and others say to substitute biscuit  mix for flour for light-colored cakes. I would like to add my method that has  never failed me.  </P> <P> After greasing the cake pan, I use the mixed dry ingredients of the recipe to  flour the pan. If I am using a cake mix, I use some of the dry cake mix. When  doing this, always remember to return any excess dry mix to the mixing bowl and  proceed with the recipe.  </P> <P> I have never had a problem with a white dusty look on the bottom of any of my  cakes.  </P> <P>  -- E.L., Norwalk, Conn.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have found a way of cooking pasta without overheating the  kitchen.  </P> <P> I first boil the water, to which I have added a pinch of salt and a little  olive oil, then I add the pasta. When the water begins to boil again, I cover  the cooking pan with its lid and turn off the burner, leaving the pan on the  same burner for the recommended cooking time without the heat.  </P> <P> After the recommended time I remove the lid and drain the pasta. It always  turns out just right this way.  </P> <P>  -- LORI, Sacramento, Calif.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I recently bought a couple of cast iron skillets.  </P> <P> The saleswoman gave me a tip: She said that after I wash and dry them to put  them in the oven to dry completely. Moisture can make cast iron deteriorate.  It's a good idea to place paper towels between the pans when stacking them so  there's no trapped moisture.  </P> <P>  -- SUSAN, Amarillo, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have a hint that saves me a lot of time and irritation from  chemicals of commercial oven cleaners.  </P> <P> I use baking soda to clean my oven and I even use it around the burners when  something that was spilled around them has become baked on. I just wet the  inside of my oven with a wet rag and then sprinkle baking soda around (more  heavily on soiled areas) and let it set for about 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Then I use a scrubbing pad and all the baked-on mess comes off real easily. If  there are some bad spots, use extra soda and scrub a little harder. Rinse out  the oven. It will be sparkling.  </P> <P>  -- BEVERLY, Boardman, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: If you happen to break anything that leaves tiny fragments of  glass all over the floor, here is a great tip that will help pick up all the  pieces.  </P> <P> I was staying at a cabin on vacation. While doing the dishes I dropped a glass  and it shattered all over the floor. I looked for a vacuum or broom, but  couldn't find either. I remembered a tip that my aunt told me many years ago,  so I tried it.  </P> <P> After picking up the large pieces of glass, I wet a piece of newspaper. I put  the paper on the tiny bits of glass, lifted the paper and the glass clung to  the paper. I did this all around to make sure I got all the pieces.  </P> <P> It worked. I never found a piece of glass during my stay there.  </P> <P>  -- JUDY, Reno, Nev.  </P></p>

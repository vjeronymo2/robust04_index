			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Chiu I (5941 3015): </F> "China Sternly Cracks Down on Pirated Compact Discs"]    [Text] Shanghai, 10 Jun (WEN WEI PO)--In recent years,  more and more pirated audio and video tapes and compact discs  (CDs) have emerged in the domestic audio visual market and have  spread to the international market. This phenomenon is becoming  rampant. In particular, pirated CDs earn great profits so their  numbers are on the rise and this adversely affects the  law-abiding audio visual producers within the country. More  importantly, they have infringed upon the intellectual property  rights of the original composers and producers and caused  grievance in the international community. Regarding these  serious lawbreaking actions, the Chinese Government has always  strictly banned such actions and has organized many campaigns to  crack down on it. However, it still exists despite the efforts  to ban it.  <H5>  CD Production Lines Uncontrolled </H5>   What is the reason? Lu Lu, the person in charge of the  Shanghai Municipal Audio Visual Management Office, offered an  analysis: First, CD production lines are seriously uncontrolled  and this is the "source" of illegal pirated CDs. According to  statistics, the whole country now has some 30 CD production  lines, mostly situated in Guangdong Province. Based on the  calculation that each CD production line produces 3 to 3.5  million CDs each year, these production lines produce a total of  100 million CDs every year. The whole country now has some 200  registered publishing units but they do not produce many  programs and they require only about one-tenth of the  abovementioned supply of CDs. Consequently, many manufacturers  do not have sufficient work to fill production capacity. Many  CD production lines are established joint-venture style and,  when the contracts are signed, most foreign parties promise to  fulfill a certain production capacity. Under the condition that  the normal channels cannot satisfy their needs, factories  acquire pirated CDs from abroad in order to survive and these  products are being sold in the domestic market while some have  spread to the international market.    The reason for this uncontrolled situation regarding CD  production lines is, according to analysis, because the audio  visual management departments in some localities have different  units implementing different policies and many departments have  the power to approve the establishment of CD production lines.  With approval being granted by different departments, plus the  lack of consideration for overall demand, there are more  production lines than needed. Second, proceeding from local  interests, the local departments in charge of examination and  approval duplicate the production lines.  <H5>  Pirated Products Earn Great Profits </H5>   The second reason for the rampant pirated CD situation is  that producing and selling pirated CDs can earn great profits.  According to information, the lowest profit rate is 100  percent. At the same time, speaking theoretically, the fidelity  of pirated CDs is nearly 100 percent. The production costs of  pirated CDs are low and their selling prices are low, so they  are acceptable to the consumers in the country and they have  their market foundation.    In addition, as a distributor who legally imports CDs, China  National Publications Import and Export Corporation cannot  compete with those who sell pirated CDs because of the tariff  (the tax rate for CDs containing popular songs is 120 percent  and the tax rate for general CDs is 40 percent). In the market,  the price for a pirated CD can be as low as 15 or 16 yuan, while  the original CD imported by China National Publications Import  and Export Corporation has a price tag of 100 yuan or more.    Apart from the abovementioned reasons, lax management of the  audio visual market in the country is also a main reason.  <H5>  Manage the Audio Visual Market According to Law </H5>   How can we check pirated CDs? Lu Lu thinks that the crux is  to control the "source" -- the number of production lines. He  said that the central authorities have already shown  determination in this regard. At the same time, he called for a  great decrease in tariff for original CDs, to enable the lawful  operators to compete in the market. In addition, management of  the audio visual market should be strengthened.    Shanghai, as the city with the best management of the audio  visual market in the country, has already promulgated the  country's first set of audio visual management regulations --  Shanghai Municipality Audio Visual Market Management Procedure,  to manage the market according to law. Beginning 1 July 1994,  the municipality will thoroughly examine the current 1,200 audio  visual products stalls and then issue them with permits and  qualification certificates so that they can operate. The  relevant department will strictly manage the source of CDs in  wholesale units; encourage the establishment of business points;  organize classes for people in the trade to teach them the  relevant regulations and ethics and improve their quality; and  will establish a mechanism to ban pirated CDs and bring  prosperity to Shanghai's audio visual market.</p>

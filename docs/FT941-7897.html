			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / China steps up drive for Japanese trade links China's strategy of improving economic and political relations with Japan, its largest trade partner, takes a step forward today when Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji begins a nine-day visit to Tokyo. Mr Zhu, the main influence on Chinese economic policy, will be the first senior Chinese leader to visit Japan since Premier Morihiro Hosokawa came to power last August. He is expected to meet Mr Hosokawa, who is considering a visit to China next month, and other government ministers for an exchange of views on bilateral relations, intended to be the start of a series of routine exchange visits. It comes when Japan's coalition government is changing its policy towards China, as signalled by Mr Tsutomu Hata (Mr Zhu's Japanese counterpart as deputy prime minister and foreign minister) on a visit to Beijing in January. Mr Hata told his hosts the two should be more frank in discussing sensitive issues, such as human rights, China's military build-up and the disputed status of Taiwan. This contrasts with the previous emollient stance of former Liberal Democratic party governments and echoes the new frankness in Japan's most important bilateral relationship, with the US. Chinese officials had feared Japan's government would take a tougher line, but support Japan's resistance to Washington's trade demands. Mr Zhu's visit could provide an indication of whether China will now become more direct with Japan. Economic relations between the two have grown in importance as China has become a valuable export market and a tempting investment location for Japanese business. China was Japan's second largest trading partner after the US last year, with total exports and imports of Dollars 37.8bn (Pounds 25.5bn), a 30 per cent increase over 1992, when it was only Japan's fifth trade partner, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation. Main growth areas are cars, and telecommunications equipment. Japan's main imports from China, up 21 per cent to Dollars 20.6bn last year, include clothes and vegetables. Jetro expects another 40 per cent rise in Japan's trade with China this year. China, which is seeking Japanese help for readmission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, recorded Dollars 39bn-worth of two-way trade with Japan in 1993.</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (2): Tension in the highest circles - Politics THREE WEEKS after Mr Mario Soares, president of the republic, visited the slum dwellings and shanty towns of Lisbon, amid massive media coverage, the Social Democrat government of Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, presented a multi-million-dollar package to abolish such degraded housing forever. To all appearances, the government move seemed like a hasty reaction to the highlighting of a renowned failure of its social policy. The incident, like many others, appeared to place Mr Soares in the role of leader of the opposition instead of the independent political arbiter that he is supposed to be. The prime minister has never stooped to criticising Mr Soares for interfering in party politics. But further down the Social Democrat hierarchy there have been bitter accusations that the president does everything in his power to block legislation he is opposed to and to lay the government open to criticism over policies of which he disapproves. The president has perfect credentials for being leader of the opposition Socialists, who hold 72 seats in the 230-seat parliament, as opposed to the Social Democrats' 136. He is a founder of the Socialist Party and three times prime minister of Socialist-led governments. But - now in his second and final five-year term - he was elected on a platform of being 'president of all the Portuguese', committed to Portugal's constitutional system of being a neutral referee of the political system. Mr Soares is accused by many of taking on the role of a one-man opposition. He has achieved this in various ways: by speaking out against social injustice and poverty, which the government has taken as direct criticism of its own policies, and, chiefly, by blocking legislation by vetoing it or sending it to the constitutional court for vetting to decide whether it contravenes the constitution. Mr Soares has done this with a series of important laws and has been vindicated by the decision of the court on most occasions. The question arises: who is responsible for the open tension that often arises between president and government? For the Social Democrat ranks, Mr Soares is the clear protagonist, using his power to make up for a political vacuum left by a weak and divided Socialist Party that has failed to take advantage of the Social Democrats' weaknesses. But for the Socialists, it is the government that has adopted a deliberate policy of provoking Mr Soares. 'The president has fulfilled his roll with absolute neutrality,' says Mr Antonio Guterres, leader of the Socialist Party. 'But the government has adopted a systematic policy of seeking confrontation with the president, with the aim of both undermining the role of Mr Soares and at the same time denigrating the Socialist Party for allegedly failing to be an adequate opposition.' The two main parties are running neck-and-neck in the opinion polls. This should be comforting for Mr Cavaco Silva, considering he is at mid-term, the country has lapsed into recession and new independent television stations and newspapers are revealing cases of alleged corruption at high levels. But it also has to be remembered that the Socialists have caught up 20 percentage points in the polls since the last general election in 1991. The poll of polls will take the form of nationwide municipal elections in December. The Socialists inflicted a humiliating defeat on the Social Democrats in the last local government poll in a backlash vote against the government. To maintain any semblance of a firm opposition in this election the Socialists will have to hold on to key cities such as Oporto and Lisbon, where they are running in a coalition with the old-guard Communist Party. Looking ahead to the next general election in 1995, the recessive economic climate is likely to push unemployment and Portugal's degraded education, health and social security systems to the fore as voting issues. This could be enough to prevent the Social Democrats winning a third, consecutive overall majority. 'In that climate,' forecasts Mr Guterres, 'Mr Cavaco Silva may decide to cut his losses and give up a bid to be re-elected prime minister and instead run for president in 1996.'</p>

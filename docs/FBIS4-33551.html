			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program hosted by Osvaldo Rodriguez of </F> BOHEMIA magazine with guests Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine and  Eloy Concepcion of TRABAJADORES newspaper; date not given --  live or recorded]    [Text] [Rodriguez] Cuban agriculture and its new formulas:  I believe we have discussed this issue on other occasions and  from different angles. For example, one day Eloy and I  discussed whether or not Cuban soil could feed the Cuban people.  We discussed the basic cooperative production units and  criticized some things in the agriculture sector on other  occasions. Today, I suggest we examine the new formulas for the  agriculture sector, how they can influence Cuban life and how  and to what extent they can solve the food problem. Luis, I  propose that you begin the debate because I see you are eager to  begin a lengthy dissertation.    [Sexto] No, let me tell you that you have put me in a tight  spot. I respect Eloy a lot because I believe he is a good  journalist and because the issue of agriculture has been one of  his constant campaigns. I also know that he is a specialist, an  agricultural technician. He does not know it, but I know that  he studied in an agronomy school way back in his youth. In  fact, I recognize his authority due to his dedication to the  topic as a journalist and due to his knowledge about the  agronomy sector. That is why you have put me in a tight spot.    [Rodriguez] Alright. You must begin as the youngest man.    [Sexto] Alright. I accept if you put it that way.  Agriculture is a very critical issue. It is very critical  because it has a direct influence on the population, it is part  of the people's livelihood. In fact, we currently see that our  agricultural sector is not fulfilling the people's nutrition  needs. I might ask: What happens? Is it true that our  agricultural sector is as inefficient as the empty marketplaces  show us? Is it true that it has always been that inefficient  over the last 35 years? We must ask that question. There is  another question we must ask: Why has there been another  organization? We have answered this question, but it would not  be a waste of time to discuss the issue again.    I endorse the view that agriculture has not always been a  failure. I think Cuban agriculture has gone through various  phases. I think the last 5-year phase has not been the happiest.  It has not been the happiest because our agriculture suffered  an overwhelming blow. It was a highly technical agriculture; it  was an agriculture that relied on machinery, fuel, and chemical  products, and it practically lost its suppliers of machinery,  fuel, and chemical products. In Cuban slang, it was an  agriculture that found itself naked all of a sudden. Therefore,  right now, at this point, we cannot demand miracles from our  agriculture, which is striving, seeking solutions, seeking  solutions and even asking the people to go that extra mile to  overcome this depressive phase.    [Rodriguez] What does Eloy Concepcion think about this?    [Concepcion] It is like Luis Sexto says. Now then, there is  an essential element that I always like to bring up when I talk  about everything. Our country is dutybound to do what is part  of the most sacred and beautiful thing that the revolution has,  meaning the pledge to provide for 11 million people on an equal  basis. Any analysis must bear this in mind. If we do not make  that analysis, we will not find the truth. If we did not have  equal distribution, the analyses would be different and  production would be easier because we would opt for the  so-called market economy and the policy of every man for  himself. Those 11 million people sometimes multiply because we  have hospitals, schools, the so-called social consumption, and  the workers' cafeterias, which charge prices that fail to cover  the costs of the products being offered, etc. etc. Those issues  must be considered.    [Rodriguez] Cuban agriculture and its new formulas: That is  the issue Luis Sexto, of BOHEMIA magazine, and Eloy Concepcion,  of TRABAJADORES newspaper, and myself -- Osvaldo Rodriguez, of  BOHEMIA magazine -- are reviewing in "Straight Talk." Luis  Sexto is requesting the floor as if we were in a meeting.    [Sexto] Osvaldo, we are in a meeting. I want to say that  many myths have existed regarding Cuban agriculture, above all,  myths that are curently being used in certain enemy propaganda  and in certain views within the country because they cannot  understand what happens in Cuba, what were the basic causes that  propitiated this situation. That is why they are resorting to  myths. I want to talk about the myth concerning  prerevolutionary Cuban agriculture, meaning Cuban agriculture  prior to the revolution. In fact, it is said... [pauses] A  scheme of the enemy propaganda states Cuban agriculture produced  everything for everyone before the revoluution.    I believe one-third of the Cuban population was not born  yesterday; two-thirds were born after 1959. That says a lot  about the Cuban revolution. One-third was born before 1959. I  am part of that third, and I have a memory. In addition to  having a memory, I have eyes to read and delve into my country's  files. I spend a lot of time delving into my country's files.  I want to remind those over there -- and some over here -- that  Cuban agriculture prior to 1959 did not produce everything for  everyone. I want to state that there was practically no Cuban  agriculture. I do not think you can talk about agriculture in a  country that had 9,000 tractors in 1959, a country whose soil  had almost no chemical fertilizers, a country in which  irrigation was almost unheard of.    I do not think we can talk about agriculture. What  agriculture are we talking about?    Let me give you some figures: A country which imported 63  percent of its grain could not have agriculture. In other  words, what do they mean when they claim everything was produced  for everyone prior to 1959? I also want to add: In 1957, a  Catholic university group comprised of professionals and  students who had nothing to do with communism, who had nothing  to do with the left -- because many of them now live in Miami --  published a poll they had conducted in our countryside. They  proved with figures resulting from careful research that only 2  percent of the peasants who comprised the rural population in  Cuba -- 3 million people at the time, 34 percent of the  population -- ate meat, only 4 percent ate eggs, and only 1  percent ate fish. In other words, what agriculture do they  claim existed in the past?    Granted, there was the sugar industry. The country also had  100,000 caballerias of idle land waiting for the time the U.S.  mills needed them to sow sugarcane. Of course, there was a  developed sugarcane agriculture with giant companies and 100,000  caballerias of idle land, whereas 46 percent of the rural  population was unemployed, all this in 1958.    [Concepcion] The sugarcane industry was developed, but the  sugarcane was cut by hand.    [Sexto] Yes, that is right. That was a relative development.    [Concepcion] Now more than 80 percent is mechanized.    [Sexto] Obviously. That development was relative. That is  what I was talking about.    [Rodriguez] I think that is very important. It is  appropriate to mention those things. I have discussed this  issue many times. I believe, however, we must return to the  topic we mentioned at the beginning of the program and talk  about today's agriculture. Like you said earlier, you believe  this agriculture has not always been a failure. I do not  believe it has been a failure, either. I do not think Cuban  agriculture today is a failure even. I think plans have failed,  I think branches of agriculture have failed, and I think other  branches of agriculture have set a tremendous example. I always  use the national poultry enterprise and the development achieved  in the cattle sector, which suffered a setback at a given moment  but achieved great progress in the genetic and milk production  sectors, nevertheless, as examples.    We are talking about Cuban agriculture and its new formulas.  Let us talk about the new formulas.    [Concepcion] This is what happens, Osvaldo. Many people are  not aware our agriculture -- edible roots and vegetables -- is  not only a state enterprise. Many people do not know there are  105,000 individual peasants who own land in Cuba. Many people  do not know there are 1,180 agricultural-livestock cooperatives  [CPA] comprised of peasants who gave their land. Many people do  not know that the basic cooperative production units have been  created in the last 6 months. The government has granted the  workers permanent usufruct of the land, and it has sold them the  means for production.    Also, many people do not know that 92 percent of the garlic  produced in the country is produced by private landowners rather  than the state. A total of 58 percent of the tomatoes is also  produced by the CPAs and individual farmers. The same goes for  46 percent of the yucca, 54 percent of the sweet potato, and 91  percent of the carrot. In other words, those are abysmal  figures. Many times we hear people talk about agriculture, and  they put all the blame on the state. Well, the state is also to  blame; logically, it must bear most of the blame because the  state has been unable to provide enough fertilizer and fuel  throughout these years. All this sensibly affects the  agriculture in a tropical country.    From what I said at the beginning and with the abrupt  suspension of supplies from six socialist countries -- on top of  the blockade, which continues to have a decisive effect on our  economy -- it would be foolish or evil to think we can solve the  agrarian products' supply problem overnight or by the grace of  God.    [Sexto] Of course, the creation of the basic cooperative  production units is the result of the audacious decision adopted  by the party and the government because they are trying to seek  formulas which encourage work under these conditions. Our  country has practically been compelled to render part of its  80,000 tractors useless.    [Rodriguez] Luis Sexto, now that you talk about  encouragement  there is an interesting thing: You know that at least 1 million  workers will join the basic cooperative production units. If  you multiply this by four, which is the average Cuban family,  you get 4 million persons. These persons would be directly  involved in and enjoy the benefits of the basic cooperative  production units. Also, they would be encouraged by the new  production formula... [pauses] There is a lot of talk about  incentives, and I believe there are extraordinary incentives.  Many of those basic cooperative production units have already  solved their self-supply problem and have sold edible roots and  beans to those workers and their families.    [Sexto] The measure is very intelligent. The measure will  yield expected results in the medium or long term. Now then, I  want to state that our state agriculture, when it had all those  fuel and fertilizer supplies, meaning the state agriculture  which some people have always termed as a failure -- I say it  has not always been a failure -- once produced more milk and  eggs than a capitalist country. It once produced 50 percent of  the rice consumed in Cuba, and once it produced citrus as has  never been done in a capitalist country.    [Rodriguez] Undeniably, the topic is far from over. I invite  you, my friends, to continue this in another "Straight Talk"  program. Thank you, Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine and Eloy  Concepcion of TRABAJADORES newspaper for your straight talk  about Cuban agriculture and its new formulas.</p>

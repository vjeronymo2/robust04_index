			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Restore reportage on parliament Sir, In the last five years, press reporting of what happens in Parliament has been cut by three-quarters. Now the Financial Times has abandoned altogether its designated Politics page. Readers were not told the reasons. Instead, there was a curt, four-line note of this fait accompli on the day after Parliament re-assembled. In preparing a report on the decline in press reporting of Parliament, I spoke to many political journalists. In private many oppose what they see as high-handed and short-sighted decisions by their papers' executives. Parliament has many faults. Unlike newspaper editors, I dare say politicians have feet of clay. But Parliament is the centre of our democratic system. If people are to understand the system, and if they are to have both faith in it and the ability to criticise it, they must be informed of its operation daily. Newspapers of record should ensure they are. The FT has a dozen separate, designated sections, from Management, Construction, and the Arts, to Managed Funds. The relegation of reporting of Parliament on to the general home news pages is, thus, gratuitous. When are the FT's readers to be told the reason? Your readers will be denied much information important to them and their businesses. Gallery reporters used, for example, to monitor written answers in Hansard - a crucial source of information about government and a means by which ministers are held to account. No more. Gossip and intrigue now fill more column centimetres than serious reporting. Your change is an excuse for lazy journalism. The only people who benefit are public affairs consultants. As serious newspaper coverage of Parliament has slumped, businesses have to pay exorbitant fees to an ever-growing army of lobbyists. I hope that the FT will think again. It seems a strange way to practise the 'open government' which it so often preaches from its leader page. Jack Straw, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Airline group lodges complaint against alleged anti-competitive practices at Hamburg The association representing the 90 airlines using Germany's airports has lodged a formal complaint with the European Commission's competition directorate over alleged anti-competitive practices at Hamburg airport, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The complaint from the Board of Airline Representatives in Germany (Barig) follows a complaint from seven EC airlines about alleged abuse of ground-handling monopolies at Milan, Frankfurt and a number of Spanish airports. The move is designed to highlight the lack of competition in ground-handling services at Germany's airports as a whole.</p>

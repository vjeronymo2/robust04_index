			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Moscow makes a collective show of disunity THE Russian cabinet sat down in front of the world's press yesterday to show how united it was, then blew the whole thing. The young radical reformers, fortuitously massed to the left of a long table, were conspicuous for the absence of their leader, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister made a show of taking charge, but opened the proceedings with a denial that he and other new 'industrialists' in the cabinet were promoting a U-turn in economic policy. Mr Gyorgy Khizha, one of the other new cabinet members, called for increased cash hand-outs as the main solution to the crippling debt crisis among enterprises, but Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation and 'co-ordinating' economic reform, was quick to differ. It was normal practice to increase working capital to keep up with inflation, but 'any excessive' provision of new credit would trigger hyper-inflation, he said. When Mr Shmako left open the possibility Russia might miss financial targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund ('We and the fund are clever people who can always find an accommodation'), Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy premier for foreign economic relations, stoutly defended the IMF accords. 'I'd like officially to declare that we are pursuing these targets not because they are demanded by the fund but because they are required by our own policies,' he said. 'We don't need hyper-inflation and a huge budget deficit.' The economic debate continues to be confused with arguments over external political influence. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper predicted yesterday that foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev's days in office were numbered because of his pro-western focus. He denied there were any problems. But this still did not stop him from complaining minutes later that he had not even been consulted over the drafting of new regulations on the movement of foreigners within Russia - although he is in charge of operating them.</p>

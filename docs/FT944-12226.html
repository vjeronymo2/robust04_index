			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Oppenheimers like to keep business in the family - The question of management succession is occupying minds at Anglo American Mr Harry Oppenheimer, doyen of South African industrialists, celebrated his 86th birthday last week. He is becoming a little more hard of hearing, a little more frail, but he still prefers to pour the champagne himself for luncheon guests at his home, Brenthurst, in Johannesburg. He complains, very gently, about the vindictiveness of the National Party government which did not like his vocal disapproval of apartheid. The government saw to it that a main highway was built at the bottom of his garden and also a large hospital was put up on the hill overlooking his front door. 'It is very noisy,' Mr Oppenheimer complains. 'I don't think Nicky (his son, Nicholas) will want to live here.' There is a more important question about Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer. Some observers wonder if he has the ambition or the ability to step into his father's shoes when the time comes. The Oppenheimers in effect control Anglo American Corporation - South Africa's biggest group and the world's leading gold producer - as well as its closely-bound sister companies De Beers, the world's largest diamond company, and Minorco, which is responsible for many of the group's non-diamond interests outside South Africa. Between them these three represent a stock market value of about Dollars 27bn. The question of management succession at Anglo is increasingly relevant now Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of all three companies, has reached the age of 61. Given his tremendous executive burden, analysts are asking when will Mr Ogilvie Thompson retire and who will replace him? Some suggest jokingly he is the only person apart from Mr Harry Oppenheimer who understands the group's immensely complex structure. Not that 'JOT', as he is known at Anglo's Main Street headquarters, believes it is particularly complex. At a recent presentation he pointed to the chart (see above - values have risen since) and said, without the slightest hint of irony, 'Many people believe we have a rather complicated structure. We do not believe this is so.' Yet there is no sense that Anglo is self-satisfied or resting on its laurels. Mr Ogilvie Thompson is leading the group through one of its most dynamic phases. Its financial strength is enabling Anglo to expand in several directions at once: there is a R1.7bn (Dollars 485m) Moab extension to the deep level Vaal Reefs gold mine; a R1.4bn project to develop one of the world's biggest mineral sands operations at Namakwa Sands in the North West Cape; a 50 per cent stake in the R3.5bn Columbus stainless steel project, which will become the world's third-largest producer; and a R1. lbn investment to expand coal production. There is also an unspecified sum to be spent to double the size of the newest acquisition, Del Monte Foods International, which cost R726m. Through Minorco the group is investing Pounds 300m (Dollars 490m) in a plant at Aylesford in the UK to produce newsprint from recycled waste paper, while De Beers is expanding its jointly-owned diamond operations in Botswana as well as those off the coast of Namibia. At Mr Ogilvie Thompson's instigation, Anglo has also been tidying up its structure. However, under his chairmanship, Anglo has eschewed fashionable 'unbundling'. Small countries such as South Africa, Sweden and the Netherlands need large companies to carry the flag internationally, he insists, and, obviously, such companies will dominate the domestic economy. Neither will he consider splitting up his three chairmanships. Having separate chairmen for each company when the companies are so closely tied would produce enormous problems, not the least of which would be personality, he insists. As for when Mr Ogilvie Thompson will retire, the Oppenheimers let it be known inside the group recently that they hoped he would continue his tripartite role 'well beyond the year 2000'. Nobody at Anglo's headquarters questions that decision. Mr Harry Oppenheimer retired as chairman as long ago as 1982, but the men he left in control were all hand-picked by him and all regularly consult him on company policy. When he is in Johannesburg or London, he still shows up every day at the Anglo offices. 'Although I retired some time ago, they still sometimes ask for my advice,' he says disarmingly. But it is clear to any visitor to Main Street that no big decision is taken without his nod of approval. To this extent Anglo still feels very much like a family business, even though the Oppenheimers own only about 8 per cent of it. Mr Harry Oppenheimer sees nothing wrong with family companies. He points out that nearly all his family's wealth is tied up in Anglo and Minorco. 'If you are in that position, people in your organisation know that you are likely to be very careful about the interests of shareholders and not only about the interests of managers.' It would seem a foregone conclusion that Mr Nicky Oppenheimer, now 49, would eventually follow JOT into the three chairmanships - except for his apparent shyness and reluctance to move into the limelight. He obviously enjoys the diamond business, particularly meeting the traders, who also usually represent family companies. But he shows little obvious enthusiasm for some other parts of the empire, even though he diligently does all the paper work required. However, those close to Mr Nicky Oppenheimer say that, when the time comes, he will take over. Mr Leslie Boyd, the Anglo director responsible for the industrial operations, points out that similar doubts were expressed about Mr Harry Oppenheimer when Sir Ernest, Harry's father who founded the group in 1917, died in 1957. Mr Harry then seemed more interested in his political work - he was MP for Kimberley - than in his career at Anglo. Yet he immediately resigned his parliamentary seat and gave his full attention to the family company. Mr Boyd suggests: 'Nicky will do as his father did - take his place and then make sure he has a team of highly effective, professional managers around him to run the business.'</p>

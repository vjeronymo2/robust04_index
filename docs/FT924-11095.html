			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Citicorp warns of further cost cuts MR JOHN REED, the chairman of Citicorp, warned yesterday that the bank's holdings of bad property loans would mount next year, as would the number of property fore-closures. He also said that more jobs would have to be cut in Citicorp's domestic and international operations as part of a sustained effort to rein in costs. In an address to a financial services seminar in New York, Mr Reed said that because of the sluggishness of the economy, and the continued problems with non-performing loans, any improvement in the bank's earnings would have to come from cost savings. He predicted, however, that Citicorp's operating margin would improve slightly in 1993. Mr Reed expects the bank to raise between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn in capital through a variety of measures and earn an after-tax gain of as much as Dollars 800m from the sale of assets during next year.</p>

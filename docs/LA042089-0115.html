			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Women in Iran may be punished with up to 74 lashes if they wear makeup or  see-through stockings in public, the government has warned. A notice by the  State Security Council published in Iranian newspapers this week said that laws  punishing violators of hijab, or Islamic covering, will be strictly enforced  beginning Friday. The notice listed eight types of violations involving the  face, body and legs. These include exposing the hair in a vulgar way, using  lipstick and eye-shadow in a provocative manner, wearing clothes that  accentuate body curves and see-through stockings not covered by trousers. Men  were also warned that they should not wear "gaudy clothes which are at odds  with public decency."  </P></p>

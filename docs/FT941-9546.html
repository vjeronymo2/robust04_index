They will try to persuade Russian president Boris Yeltsin that the Nato ultimatum threatening air strikes against Serbian forces does not signal a break with the West's commitment to a negotiated settlement in Bosnia. Mr Major will also stress that western financial support for President Yeltsin depends on reform continuing. Mr Hurd plans to hold a meeting with the leaders of the three Baltic states in the Latvian capital Riga. Belarus protest Committees at some 22 enterprises plan a one-day protest to demand the resignation of the conservative government and early elections.

After December's controversial agreement by European Union industry ministers, approving Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.1bn) of state aid in return for 5m tonnes of capacity cuts, non-aided producers are holding back from offering capacity reductions.

It was originally planned as a trade trip in connection with the creation of the North American Free Trade area. However, as Seoul becomes increasingly concerned the war of words between the US and North Korea may escalate into confrontation, Mr Han is likely to recommend the US adopts a more conciliatory tone. On Saturday, he goes on to Mexico (to Feb 23). UK retail price index UK retail price index for January will be scrutinised, after last week's surprise interest rate cut. As the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report spoke of an 'asymmetric risk' that 'a rise in underlying inflation seems more likely than a further fall', analysts will be looking for evidence that the cut was justified. The headline rate is expected to rise to 2.6 per cent, from 1.9 per cent in December, as mortgage rate cuts in January 1993 drop out of the annual figure. Underlying inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) is expected to rise from 2.7 to 3 per cent. Papal letter on the Family The Pope's Letter for the Year of the Family is due to be published.

The sale is likely to bring in more than Pounds 1m. 18 FRIDAY Yeltsin unfolds his plans Russian president Boris Yeltsin's first state of the nation address to the joint chambers of parliament is expected to reveal his position on economic reforms after changes to the composition of his government. Fiji national elections start on Friday, and continue for the following week. The poll was called in November by Sitiveni Rabuka, the prime minister, after his coalition government saw its 1994 budget defeated.

Led by deputy prime minister, Josevata Kamikamita, it was formed by the dissident MPs who forced the budget's defeat. UK money supply After a long spell in the doldrums, the growth of the broad M4 measure has picked up sharply in recent months, giving further evidence of economic recovery.

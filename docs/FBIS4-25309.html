			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By He Jun: "Scientists Called On for Greater Influence"] </F>   [Text] China's top science and technology administrator has  urged the country's newly-nominated academicians to actively  involve themselves in the government's decisionmaking process.    Song Jian, State Councillor and Minister of the State  Science  and Technology Commission, made the request yesterday in Beijing  at the closing session of the inaugural meeting of the  newly-established Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) and the  seventh academician conference of the Chinese Academy of  Sciences (CAS).    He asked the scholars of the two organizations to give more  suggestions and advice for the drafting of the country's Ninth  Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the 15-year plan that sets goals  to 2010.    The plans are expected to be finished by the end of next  year  and be submitted for approval at the March session of the  National People's Congress in 1996.    China's population will continuously expand during the next  40 years to reach 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion, Song said.    Therefore, by the 2030's or 2040's, China's grain output  needs to increase by 50 per cent just to ensure that the current  modest supply remains level; electric energy production should  expand 14-fold to reach the current per capita standard of  moderately-developed countries; and all agricultural and  industrial sectors and infrastructural facilities should be  greatly expanded, he added.    China's modernization requires the constant efforts of all  social sectors, especially science, for at least the next half  century, he said.    Song stressed the importance of developing pollution-free  production, reducing waste discharges, protecting the ecological  balance, and establishing an environmental protection industry.    He also promised that the government will try its best to  increase its investment in science and technology.    The total input from all social sectors in research and  development should account for more than 1.5 per cent of the  gross national product by the end of the century, instead of the  current 0.7 per cent, he said.    At yesterday's session, the CAS also announced the  appointment of its first group of foreign academicians.    The 14 foreign scientists include Derek Barton and Joseph  Needham of Britain, and Peter Raven and Herbert Simon of the  United States.    The others are all Chinese-American scientists, including  the  Nobel Prize winners Samuel Chao Chung Ting, Chen Ning Yang, and  Tsungdao Lee.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Risky business of a high-tech future: Products to watch out for in '94 So rapid is the pace of technological change that one year's runaway success could well be the following year's flop - or vice versa. As companies strive to ensure their high-tech products turn out to be hits rather than embarrassments, they have to take considerable risks. The danger is of consumers holding back from buying products until they are well established  -compact discs, for instance, took six years to take off. Some of the following products to watch in 1994 may not become popular overnight, but they should point the way to the future. Apple Computer's Newton received plenty of brickbats when launched last year, mainly because it appeared shaky at recognising users' handwriting. But sales of the pen-based message pad computers have been rising. Other manufacturers have also brought out single products combining the functions of a diary, personal organiser, games player and information provider. Though the Newton is not cheap, at Dollars 699 in the US (Pounds 645 in the UK), and the extra software applications lighten the purse further - new features will include the Fortune 500 top business guide and the UK's Good Food Guide - the market has definitely been created. You have heard of virtual reality, but how about virtual acoustics or even virtual instruments? The new offering from Japan's Yamaha will be keyboards designed to mimic the way wind, string and other instruments play rather than using stored sounds. The software simulates the vibrations and resonances of real instruments. Using a keyboard, musicians will be able to produce the sounds of a clarinet, saxophone or electric guitar; they will also be able to manipulate the sounds, creating, for example, a hybrid based on woodwind, brass, strings and electric guitar. The keyboard will cost about Pounds 4,000, making it a product for the professionals. In the office, the trend is towards all-in-one machines. Oki had a hit in 1993 with DOC. IT, a combined fax, printer, copier and document scanner. Now another Japanese company, Ricoh, is introducing its IFS (intelligent facsimile system), which also communicates with personal computers. Developed with Microsoft, the US software company, the IFS is operated with a touch-screen panel. Text and graphics files can be sent between personal computers through the IFS, which has built-in security features. Tomorrow's telephones will be far cleverer than those used today. The phones on Mercury's One-2-One mobile network in the UK contain an array of electronic circuitry that enables users to record messages and check their current charges. Made by Motorola of the US and Germany's Siemens and costing Pounds 250, the One-2-One phones, which comprise about 70 electronic components, are operated with simple press buttons. Each One-2-One phone has a smart card with a chip for users' personal numbers, billing details and a personal phone directory; it also enables them to use other compatible phones. Consumers are not rushing to buy digital compact cassettes (DCC) and players, but Philips of the Netherlands and Matsushita of Japan remain confident that the products will win a place in the audio market. Pre-Christmas sales of DCCs and their players were tiny. But Philips is pinning its hopes on portable and in-car systems where the market is bigger than for home units. Most parents may despair at their children's appetite for video games, the market for which is growing inexorably. Games such as Acclaim's Mortal Kombat are played by millions of teenagers. Mortal Kombat, says 13-year-old Californian teenager Erick Arnold, was 'the biggest 'gimme' for kids aged between nine and 13 at Christmas'. Why do they want this gruesome game? 'Because it's cool.' Many parents hate it, however. Nintendo has left the horrific bits out of its version while Sega requires the user to punch in a special code to access the most violent images. The CD is becoming the all-purpose information carrier, reproducing music and voice and storing computer data. It is a prime component of the growing family of multi-media products. Philips has invested heavily in its interactive compact disc (CD-I), a multi-media system combining digital sound, pictures and text. A simple connection to a television enables video games and full-motion digital videos to be played on the TV, as well as music CDs. At Pounds 550, the full CD-I player, combining voice, pictures and music in a single higher-quality home entertainment system, is good value. Some people have trouble taking still pictures, let alone moving ones. So makers of camcorders vie with each other to make their products smaller, quicker and simpler to use. Sharp's ViewCam has a tiny screen instead of a viewfinder, so the user can see what is being filmed even if it is being held up to shoot over crowds. The UK price ranges from Pounds 899 to Pounds 1,399. There is no excuse for getting lost any more. The use of satellites to pinpoint location at sea is common. Now, with falling prices and improving software, so-called 'global positioning devices' are being targeted at those who enjoy hill walking and hiking, yachting, mountain biking or hunting - any pursuit where knowledge of location and direction is needed. US companies Magellan and Garmin are among those concentrating on this growing consumer market. Magellan's simplified hand-held electronic navigators with graphic display screens cost about Pounds 440; its Meridian model is designed for use on yachts and power boats and the Trailblazer for land. When news of US approval for Betaseron, the multiple sclerosis drug, came through last summer, shares of Schering, which developed the drug, shot up. Made for the German company by California-based Chiron, the drug does not cure MS, which weakens the nervous system, but is the first effective treatment for the disease. The main problem for Schering is whether Betaseron can be made fast enough to meet demand; US approval came more quickly than expected. For those keen on exercise, but not on jogging, cross-country ski machines for the home may be the answer. NordicTrack of the US sells its products by mail order in Europe; Lillywhites, the London sports store, has started selling a machine made by Precor, also of the US. With adjustable stride and tension, it enables the user to exercise in a way which is 'easy on the joints and muscles'. For those wanting an element of 'enhanced motivation', set speeds can be programmed. Jogging in the open is cheaper, though. Precor's machine costs Pounds 699.</p>

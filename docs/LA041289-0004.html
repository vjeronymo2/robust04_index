			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL PLAYOFFS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BRUINS ELIMINATE SABRES  </P> <P> When the Buffalo Sabres trounced the Boston Bruins, 6-0, at Boston in the first  game of their playoff series, it looked as if a sweep was in the making.  </P> <P> The Bruins, who were 0-5-3 against the Sabres during the regular season, looked  pitiful in the playoff opener.  </P> <P> But Boston regrouped behind Cam Neely as the resurgent Bruins won four in a  row.  </P> <P> Tuesday night at Boston, Randy Burridge scored a short-handed goal in the  second period, but it was Neely who applied the clincher in a 4-1 victory.  </P> <P> Neely's fifth goal, with 6:56 remaining in the second period, gave the Bruins a  3-0 lead. With Andy Moog playing his third consecutive solid game in the nets,  it was all over. Twice earlier in the series, Neely scored the game-winner.  </P> <P> "My question to the players (after the opener) was, if it's important to you,  you have to play like you want it," Coach Terry O'Reilly said. "They did."  </P> <P> The Bruins, who finished second in the Adams Division, will meet the Montreal  Canadiens, the division winner, in the next best-of-seven series. It will not  begin until Monday. Last year the Bruins knocked out the Canadiens in the  second round and made it to the Stanley Cup final.  </P> <P> The Sabres began to lose some of their offensive thrust when Christian Ruttu  suffered a shoulder injury in the second period of Game 2 and never returned.  </P> <P> "We shut down their offense pretty well in the last three games," Reilly said.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 8, Washington 5 -- In helping his Flyers take a 3-2 lead in the  series, Ron Hextall made history when he became the first goaltender to score a  goal in Stanley Cup competition.  </P> <P> Two late goals by Pelle Eklund had given the Flyers a 7-5 lead at Landover, Md.  But the desperate Capitals were working on a power play and pulled goalie Pete  Peeters.  </P> <P> Hextall stopped the puck behind the net, skated to the goal line and fired the  puck at the empty net. Nobody touched it and into the net it went.  </P> <P> Hextall, who has made a career of handling the puck well up the ice, was the  first goalie in NHL regular season to score a goal, too. He did it, in similar  fashion against Boston, Dec. 8, 1987.  </P> <P> The sixth game will be played at Philadelphia Thursday night.  </P> <P> St. Louis 6, Minnesota 1 -- The Blues also moved into the second round of  Stanley Cup competition by whipping the North Stars, four games to one.  </P> <P> Peter Zezel made this one at St. Louis the easiest win of all. He scored three  goals and had two assists. Two of the goals and an assist came in a four-goal  outburst in the second period. He completed the hat trick in the third period.  </P> <P> The Blues won the first two games at home in overtime, then scored a 5-3  victory at Minnesota before losing Sunday night.  </P> <P> Calgary 4, Vancouver 0 -- Goaltender Mike Vernon decided to take matters into  his own hands as this series returned to Calgary. On home ice, he was flawless,  stopping 18 shots.  </P> <P> For the first time in this series, the Flames resembled the team that posted  the best record in the league during the regular season.  </P> <P> They outplayed the Canucks from the start to take a 3-2 series lead. They can  clinch it with a win at Vancouver Thursday night.  </P> <P> Joe Nieuwendyk, with his third playoff goal, gave Vernon all the help he really  needed before the game was six minutes old. But the Flames never took the  pressure off.  </P> <P> Joe Mullen, Mark Hunter and Hakan Loob, who assisted on the first goal, added  goals and kept making it a little easier for Vernon.  </P> <P> Detroit 6, Chicago 4 -- Petr Klima and John Chabot scored 59 seconds apart in  the third period at Detroit to keep the Red Wings' playoff hopes alive.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks, who led, 4-3, before Klima scored at 7:23, lead the series,  3-2, and can wrap it up Thursday night at Chicago.  </P> <P> The Red Wings are trying to become only the sixth team in Stanley Cup history  to win a series after trailing, 3-1.  </P> <P> The Wings beat goaltender Alain Chevrier, who had a 3-0 record against them  after the Blackhawks acquired him from Winnipeg late in the season.

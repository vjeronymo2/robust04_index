			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow weakens despite sharp rise by bonds Wall Street HEAVY profit-taking left US share prices sharply lower across the board yesterday as investors ignored further gains in a booming bond market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 26.83 down at 3,607.10. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.82 to 458.52, while the American SE composite shed 5.29 to 456.28. The Nasdaq composite was particularly hard hit, surrendering 10.36 to 739.35. New York SE trading volume was 229.5m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 1,234 to 756. Dealers and investors returned from the long holiday weekend in a downbeat mood, thanks in part to losses on overseas markets. Analysts said that if the strong rally in bond prices continued it may not provide much of a help to stocks because investors are increasingly worried that the bull market in both stocks and bonds may soon face a correction, temporary or otherwise. The autumn is traditionally a time to reassess market conditions, and analysts worry that the record-breaking summer for both stock and bond prices might prompt a quick and sharp sell-off by investors fearful that both markets have become overbought. This theory was put forward as a possible explanation for why another big decline in bond yields yesterday failed to lift stocks, which initially traded in a narrow range below opening values before falling sharply in the final 90 minutes of the session amid heavy program selling. Baroid Corporation advanced Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 8 3/8 in volume of 3.2m shares after Dresser Industries announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire the oil services company for Dollars 900m in stock. Dresser lost Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 22 1/4 . Gold shares dropped as the bullion price plunged on the commodities exchanges. Newmont Mining lost Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 45 1/4 , Homestake Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 16 1/4 , Battle Mountain Gold Dollars 1 to Dollars 7 7/8 and Newmont Gold Dollars 3 to Dollars 39 7/8 . Falling interest rates buoyed bank stocks, which have been a neglected sector of the markets lately. Chase Manhattan put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 35 1/2 , Chemical Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 41, Banc One Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 42 1/8 and First Chicago Dollars 1 at Dollars 45 5/8 . Advanced Micro Devices, down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 27 1/2 , ran into heavy selling for the second consecutive day in the wake of last week's revelations about its microprocessor development programme. On the Nasdaq market, Total Pharmaceutical Care soared Dollars 8 to Dollars 21 1/4 in volume of 1.6m shares on the news that the company is being bought by Abbey Healthcare (down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 22 1/8 ) for Dollars 197m. Canada THE Toronto exchange ended sharply lower in busy trading after a sell-off in the gold shares sector sent the market on its biggest single-day plunge in almost four years. The TSE 300 index, which set an all-time high of 4,143.7 last Wednesday, tumbled 101.9 points, nearly 2.5 per cent, to close at 4,023.7. Declines overwhelmed advances by 630 to 194 after volume of 71.6m shares valued at CDollars 777m. The golds sub-group index dropped 9.9 per cent as the price of the precious metal in New York sank USDollars 13.80 to USDollars 350.55 an ounce.</p>

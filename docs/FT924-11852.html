			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Craig &amp; Rose ahead to Pounds 134,000 Although margins remained under 'severe pressure', Craig &amp; Rose, the Edinburgh-based paint and varnish manufacturer and decorators' supplier, announced increased interim profits. Increased exports helped turnover rise to Pounds 2.96m (Pounds 2.83m) and despite exceptional payments to employees - the workforce was reduced by some 10 per cent over the period - pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose to Pounds 134,000 (Pounds 40,000). Earnings per Pounds 1 stock unit emerged at 25.25p (7.01p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 2p.</p>

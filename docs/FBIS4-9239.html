			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 21 (ATA) -- In the course of his  visit to Albania, Norman Anderson, the chairman of CSCE mission  in Skopje, met the Albanian President Sali Berisha, Deputy  Foreign Minister Arjan Starova, public order and transport  ministers, Mr. Musaraj and Mr. Bitincka respectively, on April  20. In these meetings Mr. Anderson was interested in knowing  Albanian views in reference to the Albanian-Macedonian  relationship in general.    They focused mainly in the situation of Albanians in the  Macedonian Republic [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM]. They pointed out in the meetings that Albania will  continue to demand the respectability of the rights of Albanian  people in Macedonia and wherever they are, which constitutes one  of the priorities of Albanian foreign policy. The  respectability of the Albanian rights constitutes an important  element of stability in the whole region.    Firstly, in this framework Albania is interested in  achievement in conformity to the international laws as soon as  possible of the population census and the demands of the  Albanians should be taken seriously by the census law.    At the same time was stressed the good will of the Albanian  side to offer its territorial advantages for the passing of  goods, because Macedonia suffers from Greek embargo. Not only  for this reason but also foreseeing the future development of  economical and commercial relationship with Macedonia, Albanian  authorities pointed out the readiness for the further  intensification of the relations, making concrete proposals to  specific fields.</p>

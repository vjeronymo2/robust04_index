			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rationale for the Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice of determination is issued in response to the Court's remand. The FHWA has analyzed the Court's decision and its effect on the vision waiver study, and has evaluated evidence that was not before the Court, including considerable data gathered through the vision waiver study during its two years of operation. As of September 30, 1994, there were 2,411 individuals participating in the vision waiver study. Unless the agency acts on the D.C. Circuit Court's remand, the waivers, without which most of these drivers would not be qualified, would have to be rescinded immediately because the decision of the Court, when mandated, will invalidate the existing rule authorizing the waivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, a truck driver's ability to operate is demonstrated by possession of a currently valid commercial driver's license or other authorized license, and based upon other safety-related information pertaining to the type of vehicle to be operated. A commercial driver's license or other authorized license is issued after subjecting the driver to knowledge and performance tests usually administered in the course of a few hours. Some employers may add a performance test, or a safe driving probationary period before permanent employment. How safely the driver may operate thereafter is based on compliance with traffic laws and regulations and involvement in accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The drivers accepted for the waiver study had to meet the licensing requirement of their States and any employer-mandated prerequisites, in addition to demonstrating beforehand a safe driving record for three years as required by the Vision Waiver Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By allowing these drivers to continue to drive under a waiver program, i.e., in effect, grandfathering them, the FHWA placed itself in the position of receiving information on the relationship between visual capacity and the ability to operate a CMV safely. Because they did not meet existing vision standards, these drivers could not be allowed to operate in interstate commerce, unless they obtained waivers. The Court acknowledged that ``this approach may be entirely reasonable,'' but it found that the FHWA lacked data to support the conclusion that the conditions it imposed on the granting of waivers assured consistency with the safe operation of CMVs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to revalidate the waivers, and to remain consistent with the Court's remand, the FHWA is relying upon several research studies demonstrating the effectiveness of methods to ascertain the probability of an individual experiencing accidents in the future based on accident history. The first major effort in this area was done in England by Greenwood and Yule in 1920. Subsequent studies, building on that model, concluded that accident rates for the same individual exposed to certain risks for two different time periods vary only slightly. (See Bates and Neyman, University of California Publications in Statistics, April 1952.) Other studies demonstrated theories of predicting accident proneness from accident history coupled with other factors. These factors, such as age, sex, geographic location, mileage driven and conviction history, are used every day by insurance companies and motor vehicle bureaus to predict the probability of an individual experiencing future accidents. (See Weber, Donald C., ``Accident Rate Potential: An Application of Multiple Regression Analysis of a Poisson Process,'' Journal of American Statistical Association, June, 1971). A 1964 California Driver Record Study prepared by the California Department of Motor Vehicles concluded that the best overall accident predictor for both concurrent and nonconcurrent events is the number of single convictions. This California study used three consecutive years of data, comparing the experience of drivers in the first two years with the experience of those same drivers the final year. Copies of the several studies relied upon here have been added to the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

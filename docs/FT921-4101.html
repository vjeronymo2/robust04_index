			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Gatt report welcomes Ghana trade reforms GHANA's trading partners in Gatt yesterday welcomed its 'substantial progress' in liberalising its economy but urged further reforms, Frances Williams reports from Geneva. They acknowledged a more open economy made Ghana more dependent on better access to foreign markets and a strengthened international trading system, and thus on a successful end to the Uruguay Round. A report on Ghana's trade policies by the Gatt secretariat, discussed yesterday by its governing council, said sweeping reforms since 1983 had made a highly protectionist economy an outward-looking one. In face of constraints posed by Ghana's dependence on primary commodities and high indebtedness, the reforms had succeeded in improving economic efficiency and reviving the traded-goods sector. Cocoa still accounts for about half Ghana's export receipts. Half Ghana's trade is with the EC, which gives preferential access to its cocoa and other agricultural exports under the Lome Convention. Ghana's reforms have included several currency devaluations and introduction of a market-based exchange rate system.</p>

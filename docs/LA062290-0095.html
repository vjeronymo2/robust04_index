			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Howard Spira's arraignment on charges of trying to extort money from New York  Yankee owner George Steinbrenner was postponed to July 5.  </P> <P> Spira was indicted in Tampa, Fla., on March 23, but the case was moved to New  York after his attorney, David Greenfield, complained that Steinbrenner would  have an unfair advantage in Florida.  </P> <P> Spira, 30, appeared with Greenfield in Manhattan Federal Court for the brief  hearing before U.S. Magistrate Michael Dolinger. Afterward, Greenfield said  Spira will plead not guilty to the charges and that the case will go to trial,  possibly later this year or early next year.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner originally said he paid Spira $40,000 "out of the goodness of my  heart." Later, he claimed he gave Spira the money to stop him from disclosing  embarrassing information about former Yankee employees.  </P> <P> Spira said he was paid to collect damaging information on outfielder Dave  Winfield, who had a longtime feud with Steinbrenner. The Yankees traded  Winfield to the Angels last month.  </P></p>

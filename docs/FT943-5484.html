			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: Solid earnings growth at Roche Roche, the Swiss health products group which recently acquired the Syntex pharmaceuticals company of the US for Dollars 5.3bn, achieved first-half net income of SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.2bn), on SFr7.3bn in sales. It is the first time the group has reported interim profit figures, and no comparative data was given, except for a 2.4 per cent gain in sales. However, it said earnings 'continued to improve', thanks to a steady growth in the operating result and higher financial revenues. Roche's financial managers again performed well, showing an increase in earnings on the group's SFr14.6bn liquid assets in spite of the upheavals in world securities markets. Net financial income was SFr506m, equivalent to 64 per cent of the amount earned in the whole of last year. Both of the group's Basle rivals, Ciba and Sandoz, suffered sharp reversals in their financial earnings in the first half. Roche also outperformed its local rivals at the operating level: its SFr1.56m operating profit reflected a 21.3 per cent margin on sales. Sandoz's operating margin was 16.5 per cent, while Ciba's was 17.2 per cent. Roche said sales growth in the second half would be slower than the recent trend. It blamed government pressures on prices of drugs and laboratory services and said profits would be lower than in the first half. However, it forecast 'a further significant rise' in net income for the full year, a more optimistic outlook than in mid-July, when it announced first-half sales.</p>

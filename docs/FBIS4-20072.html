			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The majority of Swedish economic aid to  East Europe will go to the northwest part of Russia and will  focus on small-scale projects. According to a report by Mikael  Holmstrom in the 10 April SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 13, Swedish  aid to East Europe had previously concentrated on Poland and the  Baltic republics. Now, however, Foreign Minister Margaretha af  Ugglas, who just returned from a visit to northwest Russia,  declares that "the Baltics are on the right path, and it is time  to increase efforts in Russia." Currently, the region receives  10-12 percent of the total 1 billion kronor earmarked for East  Europe; this is expected to increase quickly. The aid will be  concentrated on individual projects instead of large-scale  government plans. Holmstrom notes that this support "from below"  makes it easier to tailor efforts to the individual needs of the  eight northwestern regions. The city of St. Petersburg will  receive the most aid followed by the other seven regions:  Murmansk, Novgorod, Pskov, Kaliningrad, Karelia, the Leningrad  Oblast, and Arkhangelsk.</p>

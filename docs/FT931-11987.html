			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Hat trick for British Aerospace: Europe's largest defence contractor hopes it has restored credibility with a Pounds 5bn Saudi order for Tornado aircraft Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, was in high spirits yesterday afternoon. 'I feel above all a sense of relief,' he said, slouched in a chair in the company's offices near London's Charing Cross Station. 'I've consistently been in a minority of one, telling the world we would do this deal,' he added. He was referring to the Pounds 5bn defence contract for 48 more Tornado combat aircraft and other equipment signed with Saudi Arabia on Thursday by Mr John Major, the prime minister. With the big Saudi order, BAe has managed to clear in the space of two months the three biggest uncertainties which had been clouding its future as Europe's largest defence contractor and one of its principal commercial aircraft manufacturers. The three 'home runs' as BAe calls them - the compromise with Germany in December enabling the European Fighter Aircraft programme to continue; the partnership signed last week with Taiwan in the regional jet business; and the Saudi Arabian order for Tornado aircraft - have now dramatically changed the investment community's sentiment about the company. BAe's share price has more than doubled in the past six months from a low of 100p to 253p at yesterday's close. But although the company appears to have confounded its many doubters, it is not yet entirely out of the woods. Mr Evans underlined the point when he said: 'I don't want anybody in the company to run away and think that we can now sit back and lean on our shovels.' All its main activities, from defence to commercial aircraft, from cars to property, are still in depressed markets with few signs of imminent recovery. It is also still a long way from restoring its profitability, badly dented by its diversification and takeover binge of the late 1980s following its privatisation. But Mr Evans said BAe had now at least been given some stability. 'We can now begin the process of regaining some credibility,' he added, emphasising that the priorities were 'to keep the business under tight control and weather out the recession while we continue developing alliances to give greater robustness to the group'. He candidly admitted that BAe had gone through a rough time. 'No doubt about it, management last year faced up to a hell of a jolt and we've had a particularly difficult 18 months. 'What brought BAe down to its knees in the first place was that five- to six-year period when it suffered massive cash outflows because of what was clearly an unsustainable investment rate,' said Mr Keith Hodgkinson, aerospace analyst at the investment house of Shearson Lehman. While having to face the difficulties of an extremely tough business climate, it has also had to confront the internal traumas of a highly publicised top management shake-up following the boardroom coup to force out Professor Sir Roland Smith as chairman 16 months ago. The appointment last May of Mr John Cahill, the former chief executive of BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate, as chairman did little at first to retore morale and confidence inside Britain's biggest exporter of manufactured goods. As if the company did not have enough troubles of its own, in June Germany dealt BAe a body blow by threatening to pull out of the four nation EFA project. Even after the new chairman announced a recovery programme, involving the restructuring of the company's loss-making commercial aircraft activities, the closure of its historic Hatfield aircraft manufacturing plant near London, and more job cuts (the company lost 13,400 people in 1991 and has announced an additional 8,000 job cuts last year), the City of London and BAe's shareholders remained unimpressed. Mr Evans said at that time BAe had to address the three critical issues of the future of EFA, securing a new Saudi order, and resolving the problems of the regional jet business, to set in motion the recovery strategy aimed at cutting losses and refocusing BAe on its core defence, aerospace and car-making ties. The compromise with Germany over EFA, now rechristened Eurofighter, and the long-awaited Saudi contract have underpinned the future of BAe's profitable military aircraft business. 'If we had not received the Saudi order we would have had to shut down completely the Tornado line in a couple of months' time,' explained Mr Evans. 'We can now also plan sensibly our medium-term production before EFA production comes on stream,' he added. The partnership with Taiwan Aerospace has also ensured, for the time being at least, the future of BAe's presence in the regional jet market. It will also enable the company to address the next stage of its commercial aircraft restructuring. BAe will now be able to release some of the Pounds 750m restructuring provisions it made in its accounts last year largely to cover a possible total shutdown of regional jet activities for the restructuring of its turbopropeller commuter aircraft business. The company is already considering an alliance with other partners and contacts are believed to have already begun with the Franco-Italian ATR turboprop commuter aircraft group. Mr Evans remains confident of the longer-term prospects of Airbus, the European commercial aircraft maker in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake. 'The trouble with the civil aircraft business is that it follows sod's law: we know the market will turn around but we don't know when, and when it happens the industry will not be able to keep up with the demand,' he said. Also at Rover, Mr Evans is waiting for the car market to recover. 'When it does, I think Rover will turn the corner,' he said. Rover continues to be heavily dependent on the depressed UK car market and its challenge will be to improve its penetration of the continental European market. The company is now pinning big hopes on the launch in April of the new Rover 600, a medium-sized family saloon which will complete the new Rover car range. 'April will be enormously important for Rover, and with the 600 we will be taking on the BMW3 series head to head,' Mr Evans added. BAe is also continuing to review possible disposals of assets which do not fit its refocused strategy. Some parts of its property business could be hived off, although Mr Evans said the company was in no hurry and would not sell at any price. The same applies to the space division and to the corporate jet division. Both were put up for sale last year, but BAe has now decided to hold on to these activities because it failed to receive any sufficiently attractive offers. Restoring credibility in the group has become all the more important as BAe continues to explore new alliances and partnerships at a time of growing consolidation in the defence and aerospace industries. Having already established close links with the German and US aerospace industries in military aircraft programmes, BAe is anxious to build up strong relations with the French industry now in the throes of restructuring. 'It was a tragedy France did not come in on a European military aircraft programme and our company has to have a better working relationship with both Aerospatiale and Dassault of France,' Mr Evans said. The triple breakthrough on the Saudi, EFA and Taiwan fronts may now also reduce the prospect of a takeover. At the time of BAe's management crisis in 1991, the General Electric Company was widely tipped as a likely bidder. With the share price recovering and the company showing renewed confidence, some analysts suggest GEC may have now missed its opportunity and become 'a victim of its own over-cautiousness', in the words of one. Others, however, believe GEC is still waiting in the wings to strike and was not prepared to move until BAe clinched the new Saudi deal. Mr Evans did not seem very concerned. 'We and GEC need each other. In some small cases we compete but much of the time we are complementary,' he explained. As for the possible intentions of Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, on BAe, Mr Evans simply said: 'My guess is that Arnold Weinstock is delighted to see we have turned the corner and got to grips with some of our problems.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BRITISH AEROSPACE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Sales                                1991           1991         1992 Results by sector            full year    2nd half end   1st half end Pounds m                                      Dec            Jan  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Defence systems                4,036         1,918          2,021 Commercial aircraft            1,651           839            659 Motor vehicles                 3,744         1,863          1,651 Property development             287             8             30 Construction                     592           307            314 Other businesses &amp; headquarters  252           155            157 Less: Intra-group               (550)         (204)          (204)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                         10,562         4,886          4,628  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Operating profit (loss) before interest Results by sector               1991           1991         1992 Pounds m                      full year      2nd half     1st half  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Defence systems                  500           281            296 Commercial aircraft              (37)          (32)          (286) Motor vehicles                   (52)          (43)           (31) Property development             (24)           (5)            (6) Construction                      40            20             12 Other businesses &amp; headquarters  (73)          (35)           (14) Less: Intra-group                  -             -              -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                            354           186            (29)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

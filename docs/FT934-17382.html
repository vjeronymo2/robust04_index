			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Cook attacks City 'short-termism' MR Robin Cook, the shadow trade secretary, yesterday launched an attack on the City for 'short-termism' and 'its obsession on growth through acquisition'. He called instead for a long-term policy of investment in industry. He said business practice needed to be overhauled to reverse the UK's decline in manufacturing industry. Hostile takeovers were singled out for particular criticism, although the number of mergers and acquisitions has fallen significantly over the past year. He said: 'As things stand a predator can go ahead with a takeover unless it is against the public interest. We want to turn that around and say unless the predator can demonstrate public interest it should not go ahead.' Labour's plans to develop a longer-term approach to investment were recently set out in the party's paper on industrial strategy, Making Britain's Future. While Mr Cook underlined the emphasis in the paper on allowing and encouraging change rather than legislating to enforce it he said he was now convinced that Labour may have to establish new institutions to help implement its policy. He suggested that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission should look into the banks' internal operations as well as considering whether there should only be four big clearers.

Companies must disclose the aggregate of all directors' pay, and the total pay of the chairman and of the highest-paid director when different. The code requires them to separate out the level of bonus in total directors' pay and in that of the chairman or highest paid director. Although the code is voluntary, many of Britain's 100 largest companies meet the code of best practice on disclosure of directors' pay. Mr Darling said it was essential that all companies complied with the code. He added that self-regulation in the City had been a 'monumental failure', citing Lloyd's of London and the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. 'The days of gentlemenly agreements in supervising the banks are over. It's no good how many times a governor of the Bank of England raises his eyebrows, if you are dealing with people who want to take you for a ride they will.'</p>

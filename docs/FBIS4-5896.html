			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government announced Friday it has decided to withdraw  unconditionally its demand on an inter-Korean envoy exchange as  a condition for Pyongyang to hold further high-level talks with  Washington.    The decision represents a major concession by South Korea  and  the United States and will likely raise the pressure on North  Korea to allow additional checks of its nuclear facilities.    The government also said it will accept all North Korean  escapees from Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia wishing to  settle here.    The deputy prime minister and head of the National  Unification Board (NUB), Yi Yong-tok, made the announcement  following a meeting of cabinet ministers concerned with  reunification and national security policy.    "The government has determined that it was practically  impossible to resolve the nuclear issue through an exchange of  special envoys," since North Korea has clearly shown that it has  no intention of doing so, he said. Consequently, the government  has decided against pushing the envoy exchange as a condition  for a third round of U.S.- North Korea high-level talks any  longer, Yi explained.    "However, there is no change in the government's position  that the nuclear problem will have to be resolved above  everything else," he said. "Inter-Korean dialogue must go on for  mutual and simultaneous inspections of each other's nuclear  facilities based on the joint declaration for denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula," Yi said.    The deputy prime minister added that IAEA [International  Atomic Energy Agency] checks of North Korea's nuclear sites will  also have to be realized soon. With regard to North Korean  loggers, Yi said the government, based on humanitarian grounds,  has decided to accept all escapees seeking asylum in the South  after following the proper legal procedures.    Seoul has received a promise from the Russian Government on  the matter, he said, adding that concerned South Korean  ministries would take early steps to accept them.    Based on the decision, the government is expected to discuss  a third round of U.S.-North Korean talks and other problems  related to the nuclear issue when Robert Gallucci, U.S.  assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs,  arrives in Seoul Friday.    "The United States' talks with Pyongyang are linked with  inter- Korean dialogue," Yi said. Therefore, any decisions on  U.S.-North Korean negotiations will be made in close  consultation between Washington and Seoul, Yi said.    The deputy prime minister, however, hinted that inter-Korean  dialogue besides the special envoy exchange would not be a  condition for the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks.    Meanwhile, the government is expected to hold a  working-level  meeting of Foreign Ministry, Chongwadae [presidential office]  and National Unification Board officials Friday afternoon to  discuss ways to accommodate North Korean loggers seeking asylum  in the South.</p>

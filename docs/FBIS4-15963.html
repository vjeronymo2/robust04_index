			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe approved of Latvian-Russian interstate agreements  initialled on 15 March, because Russia would undertake the  internationally controlled commitment to withdraw its troops  from Latvia by 31 August. According to Juppe, Latvia can rely  on French support on the issue of the Russian Army withdrawal.  He also said that France has always considered that the army  has to be withdrawn unconditionally and it cannot be related to  other issues, for example the status of Russian-speaking  residents in Latvia.    Juppe supported Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis' proposal  to  set up an international support fund to eliminate the  consequences of the work of the Skrunda radar station and the  social tension caused in Latvia by Russian military pensioners.  According to Ulmanis, with the creation of such a fund talks  would continue and internal political crisis in the Baltic  region would be abated.</p>

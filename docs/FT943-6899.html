			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Management: 'Modelnetics' of life - An unorthodox style of promoting participation and flexibility Claude Bebear, chairman of France's Axa insurance group, enjoyed an unusual evening this summer in the company of a team of Chinese jugglers and a chorus of opera singers. Together with 170 managers from 10 of Axa's international operations, Bebear then spent the night on China's Great Wall. Amid the charred remains of a roasted lamb and crates of empty bottles of wine from the group's French vineyards, the managers slept in sleeping bags and rose at 4.30 to watch the sun rise. Their bonding experience, part of a seven-day trip to China, reflects Bebear's unorthodox approach to managing the group, which over the last five years has become one of Europe's biggest and most rapidly growing insurance companies. Indeed, since taking a 49 per cent stake in Equitable Life of the US in 1991 Axa has signalled its ambition to play on an even bigger stage. These aspirations were underlined last week when Axa acquired Boreal Assurances, the Canadian insurer, in an acquisition which will make the company the fourth largest insurer in Canada. Axa also recently secured provisional authority to set up a life insurance business in Japan and announced plans to invest Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) in the venture over the next five to seven years. The China escapade is one of the most striking examples of Axa's - and Bebear's - iconoclastic and radical style, in an industry where management has traditionally been slow moving, status conscious and parochial. Vestiges of that conservatism are still visible in some corners of Bebear's empire. At Axa Equity &amp; Law, for example, the High Wycombe-based UK life insurance company taken over by Axa in 1987, managers - curiously known as 'officials' - are still rewarded for each upward move in the company hierarchy with tiny improvements in their work surroundings. Desk sizes, floor coverings and even the equipping of offices with hat stands are tied rigorously to seniority. But commercial pressures have already begun to force a change in attitudes. Four hundred jobs have disappeared since 1990 - many of them middle managers squeezed out as the company sought to flatten the management hierarchy. There were 'an awful lot of titles which didn't carry any responsibility', comments David Thorley, marketing director. Bebear's approach is designed to reinforce these sorts of changes across the organisation, preparing senior mangers for a much more competitive environment and making them more flexible and responsive to change. In particular, the company is concerned to build on its international strengths by obtaining maximum benefit from the range of management and specialist expertise at its disposal. Before the China visit, for example, six teams - each drawing their resources from separate parts of the Axa empire - worked in their free time on competing proposals about how Axa could penetrate the Chinese market. Wherever necessary they made use of the company's communications facilities, such as video conferencing. During the China visit, each group presented its conclusions to the committee responsible for corporate strategy. Axa has taken other opportunities to bring its senior executives together. Since 1987, for example, Bebear has masterminded three other adventure workouts in unusual locations. Managers spent a week in tents in the Sahara desert in 1987; Bebear hired a train to take them around Europe in 1990; and two years ago, top staff were flown to the Caribbean island of St Martin. Attempts to improve communications are not confined to the top. The company is also keen to promote greater direct contact between managers at lower levels, especially in specialised areas such as telecommunications, information technology and fund management. Rather than communicating through managers, Thorley says 'it is far better for the guy installing telephone systems in France or the UK to talk directly to his counterpart in the US'. One method of improving communications favoured by Axa is 'modelnetics', a management training system developed by Main Even Management Corporation, a California-based group. The system uses 151 'models' - buzzwords and symbols  -to promote use of management concepts that promote participation and flexibility. Axa has been using it for the last few years. Its managers in High Wycombe are quick to use modelnetics jargon. 'Slot machine management' - frequent moves of personnel and resources within an organisation - and 'management smog' - the lack of communication associated with dense bureaucracies - are deplored. Employees are encouraged to think laterally or outside 'the logic box'. Thorley sees it as 'a common language that helps us understand common problems'. Currently, Axa is placing more stress on the development of its own central training programme at its 'university', a training centre attached to the group's Bordeaux vineyards. Richard Nicol, human resources director who joined Axa earlier this year after long spells with Total and Airbus Industrie, plans to unveil an ambitious new training scheme for all his company's managers later this year. The scheme - which involves a rolling programme of one-week courses - will subject each of Axa's 5,500 managers to peer group and subordinate assessment for the two months prior to the course. Nicol says the emphasis is on participative management. Summarising his experience with Axa, which he joined after working for a range of top UK businesses, Thorley says: 'Most companies I've worked for define the frame and everything inside the frame. They tell you everything you can do and can't do,' he says. By contrast Axa 'provides the framework, and how you go about it is very much up to you. Bebear has sent a clear signal that he doesn't want little clones everywhere.'</p>

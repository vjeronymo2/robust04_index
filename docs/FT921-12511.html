			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Dons divided on university's future: The row over higher education in Wales THE future shape of the century-old University of Wales has become the subject of a sharp debate among academics which would do credit to CP Snow and his novels on Cambridge life. Accusations of 'centralist philosophy' and 'central bureaucracy' are some of the more polite expressions being bandied about. The head of University College, Swansea, has warned senior colleagues of the dire consequences of proposed changes in the university's structure. Five of the principals of the six colleges have written to Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, telling him of their opposition. The cause of the imbroglio is debate about the way the university should be administered after government changes to the funding of universities. Three years ago the university looked at itself and decided changes were necessary if Wales, a federal body encompassing five university colleges at Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff, Lampeter and Swansea and a college of medicine in Cardiff, was to stay in the top rank. One of the recommendations was the appointment of a deputy pro-chancellor, Sir John Meurig Thomas, a distinguished chemist, to assist the pro-chancellor, Lord Cledwyn. Lord Cledwyn is also Labour leader in the House of Lords. Sir John's proposals for the future have provoked the dispute among academics. The University of Wales was established as a loose federal body, awarding degrees, undertaking some central functions and leaving the colleges largely autonomous. Sir John says there are flaws in the way federalism is working. 'We now have a wonderful opportunity to take a federal university which is not really functioning as one in a proper federal direction,' he says. Opposition to his proposals is supported by a minority who did not want anyone appointed to a role they saw as undermining their own powers and influence. 'We are living in a world of increasing financial stringency and also of increasing sophistication,' Sir John says. 'To meet the new world we need to be more sophisticated ourselves - to undertake more advanced research, more effective teaching, more seminars, more tutorials of the sort at which Oxford and Cambridge are pre-eminent.' Sir John would like to use the university's video link, for instance, to set up inter-college teaching, so that a lecturer in, say, Bangor would simultaneously teach students in the other colleges. 'Many departments in the colleges undertake world-scale work,' he says. 'Microbiology at Aberystwyth, advanced materials at Swansea are just two of them.' Video links would bring this world work in specific departments to the whole university. Moving along such a course would make Wales a world university. To Mr Brian Clarkson, principal of Swansea, it all smacks of centralism. In November he wrote to his senior colleagues accusing Sir John of 'building up a central bureaucracy and attempting to usurp the planning role of the colleges'. Sir Aubrey Trotman-Dickenson, principal at Cardiff, followed with a letter to Mr Hunt on behalf of the five principals, saying the university should remain 'primarily as a degree-awarding body, while retaining some general functions such as management of endowments'. Lord Morris, who was principal of Lampeter until he retired last month, was not included in the joint submission. There is an implied threat that if Sir John's view holds sway, the colleges might break away from the university and seek individual full university status themselves. The opposition to tighter federalism is closely linked to the government's new funding proposals for higher education. Mr Hunt has announced the setting up of a Higher Education Funding Council for Wales when the government replaces the Universities Funding Council. The five principals in Wales believe Sir John will use the opportunity of the change to ensure money for Wales comes through the university administration and is then allocated to the colleges. The colleges want to deal directly with the funding council. 'The removal of the redundant University of Wales machinery could provide a useful financial contribution towards the running of the Welsh funding council and save immediate capital expenditure,' Sir Aubrey has stated. Sir John has counteracted strenuously, calling Sir Aubrey's letter to Mr Hunt, 'tendentious'. Not all the staff agree with the principals. Many are concerned that if the colleges go their own way they might be cut off from finance for research and the ability to attract outside money. Sir John is determined to introduce change. He has told the principals that 'my experience tells me an element of central planning - not interventionist bureaucracy, which nobody wants - is absolutely essential. This is one of the key facts that I learnt at Cambridge. It is what will improve our rankings as a university.' Two meetings this spring should settle the issue. Sir John hopes everyone will 'work harmoniously together' in the new year. It is about as likely as any of the plots CP Snow devised about life in Cambridge.</p>

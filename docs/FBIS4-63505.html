			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine's Supreme Council has adopted a resolution  on halting the operation of the law of the Republic of Crimea on  renewing the constitutional basis of the Republic of Crimea's  statehood:    On 20 May 1994, the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Council  adopted a law on renewing the constitutional basis of the  Republic of Crimea's statehood, which renews clauses of the  Republic of Crimea's Constitution in its 6 May 1992 form. These  clauses in the Constitution were changed in September 1992 by  the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Council itself in accordance  with the law of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between  the state authority bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea.    Above all, it is about establishing relations between the  Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements and  about introducing Crimean citizenship. This is a step toward  Crimea leaving the composition of Ukraine, which violates the  territorial integrity of Ukraine and its state sovereignty, and  runs counter to the universally recognized principles of  international law.    In accordance with Article 75 of Ukraine's Constitution, the  Crimean Autonomous Republic is a constituent part of Ukraine and  can resolve independently only those issues attributed to its  authority. The competence of state authority bodies of the  Republic of Crimea is determined by the above-mentioned law of  Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the state bodies  of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. In accordance with  Article 11 of this law, the higher bodies of state authority of  the Republic of Crimea do not have the right to resolve issues  belonging to the exclusive authority of the state bodies of  Ukraine. The extent of the powers of the Republic of Crimea, in  accordance with Ukraine's legislation, cannot be changed by the  Republic of Crimea without the consent of Ukraine's Supreme  Council.    Taking account of the above, and with the aim of protecting  state sovereignty and ensuring the supremacy of the laws of  Ukraine on all of its territory, and in accordance with Point 31  of Article 97 of the Constitution of Ukraine, Ukraine's Supreme  Council resolves:    1. To halt the operation of the law of the Republic of  Crimea  of 20 May 1994 on renewing the constitutional basis of the  Republic of Crimea's statehood as such that runs counters to the  Declaration on Ukraine's State Sovereignty, the demands of  Articles 31, 70, 75, and 77 of the Constitution of Ukraine, and  the laws of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the  state authority bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea and  on citizenship of Ukraine;    2. To propose that the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Council  brings the Republic of Crimea's Constitution into line with the  Constitution of Ukraine and the laws of Ukraine on the  delimitation of powers between the bodies of state authority of  Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea within 10 days.    3. That this resolution loses its validity from the moment  when the Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea revokes the  law on renewing the constitutional basis of the Republic of  Crimea's statehood.    You have been listening to Ukraine's Supreme Council  resolution on halting the operation of the law of the Republic  of Crimea on renewing the constitutional basis of the Republic  of Crimea's statehood.</p>

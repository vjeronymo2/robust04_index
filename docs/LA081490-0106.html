			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Deloitte Leaves First Executive: The accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche has  removed itself as auditor of First Executive Corp., the battered Los Angeles  insurance company.  </P> <P> Neither First Executive nor the accounting firm gave a reason. First Executive  recently hired a number of Deloitte &amp; Touche executives. Once one of former  junk-bond financier Michael Milken's best customers, First Executive lost  $775.6 million last year, largely because the value of its junk bonds plunged.  </P></p>

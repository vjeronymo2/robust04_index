			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Head of BNL in temporary step down The chairman of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro announced last night he was stepping down temporarily following unspecified criticisms by the Bank of Italy. Mr Giampiero Cantoni's announcement after an evening board meeting shocked bankers and immediately prompted speculation about the bank's transactions. BNL, which is Italy's largest commercial bank and is controlled by the Italian treasury, reached international notoriety in September 1989 when it was revealed that its Atlanta, Georgia, branch had been the source of huge unauthorised loans to Iraq. The 'Atlanta affair', which is still being investigated, led to the replacement of BNL's then chairman, Mr Nerio Nesi, by Mr Cantoni. There was no suggestion last night that Mr Cantoni's move was related to the Atlanta affair. More recently, Italian banks have come into the spotlight in the country's two-year-old political corruption scandal, which has led to allegations of politically-influenced lending decisions or financial transactions on which kickbacks were paid to political parties. Last week, Mr Roberto Mazzotta, chairman of Milan's big Cariplo savings bank, temporarily stepped down after being implicated in alleged financial misdemeanours involving the bank's pension fund. Mr Mazzotta, who was in London when magistrates issued an arrest warrant against him last week, gave himself up to magistrates in Milan yesterday. The developments involving Mr Cantoni appeared to be linked to judicial inquiries into allegations of loans by the bank to members of the Cantoni family for property dealings in the Milan area. BNL said Mr Cantoni's decision was taken entirely 'for personal reasons' and related to investigations into alleged infringements of land-use regulations in the Milan suburb in which he lived. 'Such events are of a personal nature and absolutely unconnected in any way with the bank,' said BNL. BNL also announced Mr Cantoni had informed the bank that he intended to terminate his contract as chairman ahead of schedule in order 'to dedicate himself to his business and university activities'. Mr Cantoni is the founder of a Milan-based electro-engineering group. BNL, which has been trying to put the Atlanta affair behind it, has reported a steady profits improvement since Mr Cantoni's arrival. However, the bank, which is still closely identified with the now discredited Socialist party, remains undercapitalised and has appeared increasingly isolated in the present government's privatisation drive.</p>

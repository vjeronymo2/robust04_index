			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Marriott acts smart to grow in lean times: Nikki Tait and Michael Skapinker explain the worldwide implications of a decision by the US hotel operating group Few companies have better illustrated the change from 1980s riches to 1990s rags than Marriott Corporation, one of the largest US hotel operators. For much of the 1980s, the group powered ahead, posting annual earnings gains that were usually in the high teens and sometimes more than 20 per cent. However last year the group made an after-tax profit of only Dollars 82m (Pounds 48m) compared with more than Dollars 232m in 1988. Marriott's announcement this week that it is splitting its hotel management operations and property assets into two separately quoted companies is an attempt to find a way to expand in straitened times. It has implications for hotel companies worldwide. In the US, hotel companies have traditionally found investors to buy properties which the hoteliers could then run. In Europe, hotel groups have tended to own or lease properties themselves. The downturn in the US and UK property markets and tax changes in the US have made both strategies less attractive. During the 1980s, Marriott effectively became a property development company, building hotels, then recovering its investment by selling these to limited partnerships which used the start-up losses as a tax write-off. Marriott retained operating control of the new hotel assets. Today, the group operates more than 700 hotels or motels, from luxury properties to the budget Fairfield Inn chain. That compares with less than 100 properties in the early 1980s. Unfortunately for Marriott, a change in US tax law curtailed the use of such development financing methods in the late 1980s. Then as the decade turned, the good times halted decisively when the US property market collapsed. Marriott shares slumped from more than Dollars 40 in 1989, to less than Dollars 9 in 1990. At one stage, a serious financial threat overshadowed the group. Since then, Marriott has struggled to become a more conservative company in the face of a hotel market laden with overcapacity. The company suspended new hotel building in 1990 and shed non-core assets, such as airline catering and its fast food and restaurants business. Marriott's rebirth has not been made easier by the dearth of buyers for hotel property assets; by a long-term debt burden which still amounts to almost Dollars 3bn; nor by the general economic recession which has curtailed business travel and holiday spending and has led to cut-throat competition in the travel industry. Against this background, it is easy to understand why Wall Street should have welcomed the demerger plan, marking the shares almost 9 per cent higher. In essence, the scheme will place the Dollars 3bn long-term debt, most of the property assets, and the group's airport and toll road concessions in one quoted company, Host Marriott. A second, separate company  -called Marriott International - will contain the hotel management operations. In the short term, the latter is clearly a more attractive creature. Marriott argues that there are 'properties available for management at substantially less than it costs to build'. Marriott International, with pro forma sales of Dollars 7.4bn last year and operating cash flow of nearly Dollars 500m, should be well placed to expand. A lightly leveraged business with solid profits, it should have fairly easy access to credit markets if it needs to raise more capital. As Ms Margo Vignola at Salomon Brothers in New York says: 'In this way, Marriott International could take advantage of domestic and global opportunities without the hobbling overhang of real estate and its cost.' The difficulty is that if hotel groups do not wish to buy property themselves, they need to find someone else who will do so and award them the contract to run the establishments. Mr Paul Slattery of Kleinwort Benson in London says: 'I can't identify at the moment any significant appetite for people to own the properties. I can't tell you of any major institution that wants to go into hotel ownership.' Hotel groups refuse to accept that the situation is so dire. Mr Michael Hirst, chairman of Hilton International, owned by Ladbroke of the UK, argues that hotels, which still have a reasonable level of occupancy, are a better bet for property investors than office blocks, which are standing empty, or shopping malls. Mr Hirst says Hilton believes there is scope to expand through a variety of means. 'We adopt a very flexible approach,' he says. Of its 157 hotels, 92 are wholly owned or leased. It has contracts to operate 50 hotels on behalf of owners. In the case of 15 hotels, Hilton has partial ownership. Mr Hirst says: 'There are management contracts available in Europe if you're prepared to take some equity investment.' Late last year Hilton bought the Dom Hotel in east Berlin, now the Berlin Hilton. A month later, it sold a 60 per cent stake to an unnamed buyer and retained the management contract. Hilton has acquired long-term leases on hotels in Weimar and Dresden, offering the owners payments, tied to business performance, in addition to the rent. Mr Slattery says US-owned hotel companies will find the idea of taking even partial stakes in the properties they manage unattractive, because of less favourable US tax regulations. Some hotel groups believe the way ahead is to find franchisees willing to use their brands and pay franchise fees without demanding property investment. Marriott this year saw its name on 15 UK hotels thanks to a franchise agreement with Scott's Hospitality, a Canadian company, which owns and manages them. Holiday Inn, owned by Bass of the UK, says 85 per cent of the 1,700 hotels that bear its name are run by franchisees. Mr Hamish Swan, vice-chairman, says that persuading hotels to conclude franchise agreements will be its primary route to European growth. There are, he argues, a large number of privately held or family owned European hotels that would want to adopt an internationally known brand and gain access to Holiday Inn's worldwide reservation system.</p>

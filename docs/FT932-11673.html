			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Record fine for insurer over sales of pensions INTERLIFE Assurance has been fined a record Pounds 160,000 by Lautro, the UK insurance industry's self-regulatory body, for persuading possibly hundreds of nurses to leave their employer's pension scheme and buy less attractive personal pensions. Interlife, controlled by several continental European insurance companies, was also selling long-term endowment policies and whole-of-life policies - which do not pay off until the policy-holder dies - to young student nurses on low incomes. Lautro said Interlife's sales agents misled the nurses about the surrender terms of the endowment policies, which heavily penalise those who cancel them in the early years. The number of policy-holders who can expect compensation has not yet been determined, but 70 to 80 complaints were found in the company's own files alone. Lautro said the fine was the largest it had ever imposed. It might have been higher if regulators had not been concerned that Interlife could have become insolvent after victims had been compensated, according to Lautro. Mr Sid Payne, Interlife's finance director, said a preliminary agreement to sell the company had been reached and wassubject to approval from the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Boris Sackville, chief executive, had recently resigned, he said. Between them, the two men own 3.8 per cent of Interlife's shares. Its corporate shareholders are Athens-based Europolitan Investment Corporation (35 per cent), Sweden's Trygg-Hansa Life (20) Interamerican Group Athens (14), Interamerican Bermuda (15.2), and Germany's Aachener Re (12). Interlife sold largely through a single 'tied agency' sales force based in the Manchester area and targeted nurses and student nurses, visiting them in their residence halls despite specific instructions from hospital authorities not to do so. When complaints were made to the company about its sales agents, it did not investigate them. The tied agent employed up to 20 agents at a time, sending them into hospitals and residences in teams of eight. Mr Payne said Interlife was no longer using the tied agent and its business had fallen sharply.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Markets: Jitters shake the builders - The Bottom Line Shares of construction and building material companies, like the rest of the stock market, are suffering an attack of the jitters. Fears about possible interest rate rises, which have depressed stock markets worldwide, have been accompanied by concern that previous optimism over the pace and quality of the housebuilding and construction recovery could have been overdone. As a result, construction shares have fallen sharply, in spite of a return to profits by businesses which, only a year ago, were announcing record losses. Amec, the large UK construction, engineering and property group, was the latest to be affected with shares falling 5p to 135p on Thursday despite unveiling a Pounds 21m pre-tax profit last year following a Pounds 88.2m loss in 1992. The turnaround was lower than expected, but what really concerned the market were remarks, made by chairman Sir Alan Cockshaw, about the continuing poor state of UK construction - in particular, the low profit margins (some would say, non-existent) on many domestic jobs. The problem, as Cockshaw made clear, was that there were too many companies chasing too little work. The industry was in sore need of rationalisation but he did not believe this was likely to happen. Over-capacity was such that margins were likely to remain dull even when output recovered. In consequence, this year was likely again to be tough; shareholders would have to wait until 1995 for recovery. By then, however, the UK industry will be facing public spending cuts on roads and other infrastructure. These may be offset, only partially, by increased private investment. The answer, according to Amec, is to pursue higher margin work overseas or try to establish long-term relationships with customers to reduce dependence on conventional competitive bidding where margins are likely to remain thin. Similar comments have been made by other UK contractors during this results season, suggesting that competition even for these kinds of projects is likely to be intense. Neither is the outlook for housebuilders as unclouded as might once have appeared. This is one sector of the industry where output is rising sharply. Margins also have begun to recover as expensive land, bought late in the 1980s, has been used up. The problem, according to Howard Seymour, construction analyst with stockbroker Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is that the rise in housebuilders' share prices over the past 12 months suggests that investors expect profits to rise faster than might be achieved. 'It is difficult,' says Seymour, 'to see where the earnings are going to come from to justify the multiples some of these shares stand at - unless we return to climate of high house price inflation.' Particular concern has been caused by the way in which land prices have been chased up as builders seek to replenish depleted stocks. According to David Wilson, chairman of Wilson Bowden - which announced an 85 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 31.2m last year - prices for quality sites have risen by an average of 20 per cent nationally, and by up to 50 per cent in south-east England, during the past 12 months. But Wilson says house prices, in a low inflation environment, are unlikely to rise enough to justify such a big increase in land costs. Building material companies have been more successful in reducing capacity and costs and, therefore, are more likely to gain from increases in volume., They are even managing to increase prices - particularly in industries where there are only a few players, such as plasterboard and cement. This situation does not apply to all materials. Hepworth created another flurry of concern on the stock market when it announced that over-capacity was still affecting many of its products, inhibiting price recovery. Mark Stockdale construction analyst with SG Warburg, says: 'Given that stock market valuations have assumed that earnings recovery would accelerate, any perceived inability to deliver will be punished.'</p>

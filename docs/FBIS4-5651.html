			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Denmark's Foreign Minister  Niels Petersen on Friday [8 April] indirectly expressed support  for Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the United  Nations Security Council, Foreign Ministry officials said.    Petersen agreed with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in a  dinner meeting on the need to reorganize the Security Council,  the officials said.    Petersen, who arrived in Japan Thursday on a four-day visit,  was quoted as saying it is necessary to reorganize the council  to "reflect reality."    In talks which covered a wide range of topics, Hata told  Petersen Japan is very concerned about North Korea's alleged  development of nuclear weapons, the officials said.    Hata and Petersen agreed it is necessary to seek a solution  to the problem through dialogue instead of placing pressure on  North Korea, they said.    On trade, Petersen said European nations are concerned that  Japan and the United States might reach a bilateral agreement  from which other nations might not benefit.    He called on Japan to keep other nations informed of the  results of negotiations with the U.S., they said.    Petersen is to leave Japan on Sunday.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Single Market Watch: Expectant hush in barrier-free Community - Information is awaited on its progress IT is just over a month since the European Community abolished most of its internal barriers to free movement of goods, people, capital and services, and the single market is quiet - too quiet. 'At the moment it is a kingdom of silence, but there will come a point when we will be overwhelmed by good or maybe bad news,' said Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the new internal market commissioner, last week. Mr Vanni d'Archirafi meets EC internal market ministers today in Brussels, for the first time since the Community passed its January 1 deadline for a barrier-free Europe. Everyone will be asking each other the same question: how is it going? In theory, the proposed legislative work is almost done. Of the 282 measures in the original 1985 single market programme, only 18 have not been agreed. At the end of last month, member states had transferred an average 72 per cent of the adopted measures into national law. In practice, it is hard to tell how the market is working. Specific complaints, particularly about continuing passport checks at internal borders, have been notified to Brussels. But national officials responsible for the single market had their first 'consultative' meeting last Tuesday and concluded no evidence existed that free circulation of goods, services and capital was being impeded. That said, Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, 61, seeks to dispel the idea Brussels will be pursuing a hands-off policy to the single market in the first half of this year. A former senior Italian diplomat, he was clearly taken aback by reaction to his first press conference last month, when he suggested an 'armistice or truce' on the single market. His comments gave the impression there would be a three or four-month 'grace period' in which the Commission would turn a blind eye to infringements of the market's new rules, and even ignore governments which dragged their feet on implementation of single market directives. As such, his stance was roundly criticised by the European business community, relying on the Commission to ensure governments transpose EC directives into national law and enforce them. But as he explained last week, this was not the signal he wanted to send. 'As far as transposition is concerned there will be no mercy.' The commissioner says the first months of the market will be spent gathering information, preparing a 'master plan' for enacting some of last year's Sutherland committee recommendations on how to make the single market work. The real test comes when genuine cross-border complaints start to feed back through the EC network. Mr Peter Sutherland, the former commissioner who headed the committee on implementation of the market, has warned member states may try to abuse the principle of subsidiarity, by claiming that in certain areas of the single market Brussels is tinkering with the responsibilities of national governments. Mr Vanni d'Archirafi says Brussels will have no hesitation in following up abuse of market rules. 'The Commission has to be guardian of the construction (of the single market), here I'm referring to transposition of directives in particular. The goal is not to be deliberately soft or strict; the goal is to make sure the single market works.' National representatives are trying to consolidate a network of contact points to help people transmit difficulties with the new area of free movement to the relevant authorities. Only when it comes to passport checks is the new commissioner likely to be more cautious. He is sympathetic to the problems member states have with lifting controls on travellers within the EC, especially at airports, pointing out that architects of the single market never forecast the increase in immigration from eastern Europe. He wants to persuade member states to meet 'deadlines' of the end of June for scrapping all controls on internal land borders, and the end of December for ports and airports. As for Britain, which wants to retain passport checks, he says: 'I will try not to let the division (between the UK and continental member states) become greater.'</p>

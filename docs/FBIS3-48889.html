			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ichiro Ozawa by Taiichiro Kobayashi, staff </F> reporter; place, date not given: "Ichiro Ozawa Talks on Japan  and Politics"]    [Text] Ichiro Ozawa is extremely logical and rational  in his thinking. However, it is another thing if his thinking  can gain easy acceptance with the climate of Nagata-cho and with  Japanese society. He refers to a disparity between the views  that one expresses officially and that one really holds at  heart.    [Ozawa] I decided not to meet reporters on their evening and  morning rounds. I have observed this policy since the general  election in July, but there seems to be some misunderstanding in  this regard.    At any rate, while making evening and morning rounds,  political reporters thus far clung to politicians and walked on  their heels to cover news. However, this kind of practice is  meaningful only in Japanese-style politics, where it has been  common for politicians to hold both official views and real  views and choose to use either of them according to  circumstances. They cannot express their real heartfelt views in  public, but instead reveal them in places where there are only a  few intimate reporters. Reporters hear the real views and use  them as reference, but they do not report the portions  mentioned off the record.    This is not just the case in politics, but also in the  entire  society of Japan. Citing a company for example, at a conference  of directors, they talk only about official positions and wrap  up the meeting quickly. They instead conduct varied talks on  other occasons and shape up positions through backstage  maneuvers. Politics is typical of this practice.    However, politics, economics, and daily life in Japan have  now reached a point where they can no longer allow such a  Japanese way of conduct and contrivances. One should clearly be  allowed to express views and make decisions, but also accept  one's own responsibility squarely. One should quit telling lies  as a result of selectively using official or real views to suit  the circumstances. By so doing, one has to get along well with  others in the upcoming new era, particularly in international  society. This is why I am saying that political reform is linked  to reform of Japanese consciousness.    I do not tell things that should not be revealed, and I also  do not selectively use real or official views according to  circumstances. Therefore, it is meaningless for reporters to  cling fast to me from morning till night. I quit the membership  formula and instead decided to go public so that I will become  accessible to anybody who visits me for an interview and so that  I can talk about as many things as possible.    Abolition of the reporters' on-duty system arouses, in a  sense, questions about the reason for the existence of the  political desk. However, mass media were accustomed to such an  old system, thereby saving politicians from showing their clear  views on each separate issue.    For example, when Mr. Hosokawa was asked what was the  difference between his government and the past Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] regime, he clearly answered that he  will accept the responsibility if the political reform-related  bills did not pass. In politics thus far, no one has clearly  said that he will take the responsibility and quit should he  fail to achieve this task. In a nutshell, no one has ever  clarified where his own responsibility lies. Or, we may say that  no one has ever been so self-assertive.    This is a tremendous change in politics. I was deeply  impressed by the Mr. Hosokawa's attitude when he clarified where  his responsibility lay, and I think that we did not err when we  recommended him for his post.    [Kobayashi] In his book Blueprint for Building a New  Japan, Mr. Ozawa is advocating the need to reform all  political, economic, and social structures. What is it that has  made Mr. Ozawa really feel Japan's crisis and driven him toward  reform?    [Ozawa] It was the Lockheed scandal that made me think that  Japan would go wrong if left as it was. I got a horrible shock  emotionally. I have kept calling for system reform since I was  first elected. When I saw my boss, who was so close to me,  arrested, I was further prompted to consolidate my thoughts. I  thought I had to do something.    I also entertained doubts about how the court of law should  be. It is no good to grumble about the judicature because it is  one of the three powers, but it, including the court, committed  acts transcending the law during the investigation into the  Lockheed scandal. Japan is a law-governed country, but the  judicature committed acts which could not be allowed within the  bounds of Japanese law. If things transcending the law are  allowed because a case involves the prime minister's scandal, it  means that the judicature can exercise its influence  arbitrarily. I thought at that time that such a practice would  really mislead democracy. For example, the other party  implicated was questioned after being given immunity at a  meeting of judges, and what was obtained from the questioning  [in the United States] was used as evidence. There is no such  rule in Japanese law. That was when Mr. Miki was governing.  That way of politics in the style of Mr. Miki and such a way of  administering justice made me think about many things.    [Kobayashi] In the Lockheed scandal, when asked by the Tokyo  District Public Prosecutor's Office to interrogate those  involved from the U.S. side, the U.S. Department of Justice  sought their testimony after giving immunity from criminal  charges.    Mr. Ozawa calls former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka father.  In the Marubeni Route case of the scandal, in which this father  was accused of accepting a bribe, Mr. Ozawa attended all of the  191 public trial sessions from the first public hearing (27  January 1977) to the first trial ruling (12 October 1983). Why  did he need to attend them?    [Ozawa] That's what made me think about politics. Why did  such a thing happen to my father? I suspected that the political  mechanism itself might be the reason for it.    Politics really requires money. However, its mechanism fails  to ensure the way to obtain money properly. It requires money,  but it is quite difficult to obtain donations because there are  such things as the Political Fund Control Law enacted in the  name of principled policies. Accordingly, that created spots  where money secretly flows in and out. After all, since  people could not get necessary money, they seeked it secretly.  Such was also the case with Mr. Kanemaru.    I doubted if, with all this, Japan's entire democratic  system, including its politics, would still be all right.    Since then, I have kept thinking that if I ever come to  the position where I can push for reform, I will act one way or  another to that end.    [Kobayashi] The forces for defense of the Constitution are  opposed to Mr. Ozawa, calling him "a nationalist" and taking  issue with his strong arguments for the dispatch of the  Self-Defense Forces to UN peacekeeping operations and with his  position for a single-seat constituency system. What is Mr.  Ozawa himself thinking about this?    [Ozawa] It is a totally absurd assertion that I have  nationalistic thoughts, aim to build a superpower, or a  minipower, and do not attach importance to the livelihood of  ordinary working citizens. I would have to accept such a view if  I were asserting that we, as a nation, should exercise more  political or military influence on the world even at the cost of  lowering the people's living standards and victimizing them.  However, I am not saying such a thing at all.    Japan is enjoying an affluent, happy, and peaceful life. The  people all wish to continue such a life for long. In other  words, it is the role and goal of politicians to realize this  wish. Therefore, the question is what we should do to this end.    During the Tokugawa era, when the people were living in  isloation on the four islands of the Japanese archipelago, Japan  had a population of 30 million and people still had a hard time  feeding themselves. However, at present our 120 million people  are enjoying an abundance of food. How has Japan, which is  totally dependent on foreign countries in terms of resources and  markets, been able to reach the present status? It is because it  has been able to maintain friendly relations with various  foreign countries and because the world has been peaceful.  Conversely, Japan will have to lose all it has gained and return  to the Tokugawa era if it cannot maintain cooperative relations  with foreign countries; that is, if Japan gets isolated in the  international community.    If people say such a situation is okay with them, that is  another story, but as long as they wish to maintain affluence,  happiness, and peace, they have to act in such a way that  various foreign countries consider Japan as one of their fellow  associates. This is my assertion.    Of all relations, the relations with the United States are  the most important to Japan. Will relations keep moving for the  better as they do now? Or will they move for the worse along a  mistaken course in history? We are now at the crossroads in this  regard. I believe that the situation is far more critical than  others think.    The United States still exists as the number-one country,  but  its power has gradually been weakening in a relative sense. It  is natural that the country make more demands as it gets  weaker. After our defeat in the war, the United States protected  Japan across the board. It afforded us generous assistance and  furnished us with broad markets. It told us to make utmost  efforts only in the economic field, promising that in other  areas the United States would do all things for Japan.    Such a generous country as the United States has been  weakening and making various demands. Not all of the demands  are just, but it is now Japan's turn to cooperate. I think that  we have to respond to these demands as best as we can as long  as it is the precondition for Japan's existence that Japan gets  along well with nations in the world and with the United States.    A certain expert said: Japan should straighten itself up in  response while the United States is clamorously making various  demands. It might soon stop making any demands at all. The  time may come soon when it says to Japan, "Do as you like. You  are no longer my associate and so I will make no request to you.  Just live by yourself."    I shuddered and was seized with fear at his remarks.  Fortunately, things may not be too serious yet because the  country is still levying complaints against us; however, I think  we have to take proper responsive measures before it is too late.    Last time, I said that the collapse of the LDP government  and  the Meiji Restoration bear a resemblance to each other. What  symbolizes the black ships this time is the collapse of the cold  war structure, is it not? The other party is still the United  States. That is why I am warning so much. Our opposite number  was the United States at the time of the black ships and at the  time of the Pacific war as well. And this time again....</p>

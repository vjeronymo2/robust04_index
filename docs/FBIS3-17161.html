In his words, the instruction No 53-RP was signed on  February 4 after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Japan, however, only that part of the instruction which talks  about re-burial of Japanese citizens whose graves are on Russian  territory was made public.    In Ilyukhin's estimate, this instruction to the Defense  Ministry testifies to the beginning of a gradual transfer of the  Kuril islands to Japan.    Ilyukhin also reported that according to available  information, one company of the ground attack air forces has  already been withdrawn under the pretext that it was armed with  obsolete aircraft. Ilyukhin proposed to commission the State  Duma Committees on International Affairs and on Defense to  verify this information.    Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the parliament's lower house,  reminded that on Friday Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is  expected to deliver a speech during the so called "government  hour." Rybkin proposed to put corresponding questions to the  Defense Minister. According to a protocol, the State Duma  International and Defense Committees were commissioned to verify  Ilyukhin's information.    The State Duma refused to include the issue of no-confidence  in Russia's government into Wednesday's agenda. This proposal  was put forward by deputy Igor Muravyev (the New Regional Policy  group).    While explaining his demand, Muravyev reminded that the  Russian government has been acting freely without any control  since October 1993. He reproached the government for failing to  develop an anti- crisis program until now and for not solving  the non-payment and debt crisis in the agricultural industrial  complex and defense enterprises. According to Muravyev, the  government was to submit the draft budget for 1994 at the moment  the State Duma started its work in January, not at the end of  March.    As many as 81 deputies voted for Muravyev's proposal, 106 --  against, and 106 abstained.</p>

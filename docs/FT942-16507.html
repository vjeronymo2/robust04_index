			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Markets: Risk, yes - but be intelligent about it - Serious Money When the predatory Hanson is sizing up a target, it looks hardest at the downside. If there is any significant risk that an acquisition will explode in its face, Hanson walks away. It is an example worth noting. The concept of risk and reward is crucial to all investment decision-making. Very few professional investors have a cavalier attitude to risk. American fund manager Michael Hirsch starts one of his books with the words: 'Investing should be boring. As boring as watching a tortoise race against a hare . . . B-O-R-I-N-G' He points out that, once you have made a significant loss, it is virtually impossible to regain your lost ground without taking on additional risk. So - do not expose yourself to excessive risk in the first place. That, of course, raises the question of what constitutes excessive risk. There are two points to consider. First, does the probable return justify the apparent risk. Second, what kind of risk / return mix is appropriate for you. A couple of articles in this week's Finance &amp; the Family section exemplify the point. John Cuthbert's analysis of different unit trust sectors (page VI) operates a double screening process for the trusts. First, he selects funds which do better than his chosen benchmarks. Then, he relates the performance of each fund to its risk - is the price of the units more volatile than those of its peers? Last, he puts the two measures together: does the performance justify the risk profile? What you are looking for are funds which produce an unusually good performance given their conservative attitude to risk. What you want to avoid are funds with humdrum performance that fail to justify their high risk exposure. The guaranteed equity products described on page III also involve a risk/reward calculation. But what is crucial here is that they are intended for investors who are so risk-averse that they are reluctant to buy a normal unit trust. When we asked a specialist to pick some schemes for us, he avoided those which put investors' capital at risk, even though they might well produce higher returns under favourable market conditions. Like Hirsch, he was happy to settle for tortoises. But what happens if you cannot tell a tortoise from a mad March hare? The increasing use of derivatives means that many investment products designed for relatively unsophisticated investors are exceedingly complicated. Only financial Luddites want to abolish the derivatives market. Futures and options give investors a flexibility they should welcome. Yet, it is hard even for professionals to choose between guaranteed equity schemes. You need a computer model to calculate how various schemes might have behaved in the past, let alone how they might behave in the future. People are, increasingly, expected to make their own financial provisions rather than rely on the Nanny State or the Nanny Company. But it is getting ever harder for them to do so intelligently. ***** Asked why Barclays was bribing people to defect to Barclaycard, a surprised employee replied: 'To get more customers'. In many ways, it is a heartening sign. Competition has often seemed sadly lacking in the financial services 'business.' But even now, competition is very patchy. Mortgages have been sold competitively ever since the clearing banks entered a market dominated by building societies. Baring's defection from the personal equity plan market this week underlined how competitive that has become. Execution-only stockbroking services also compete on price. But all too many financial services seem virtually untainted by competition. Take conventional banks. They are deeply uninterested in customers with current accounts or small deposits. All would love to start putting charges on current accounts but are hoping someone else will go first. Instead, they do it the sneaky way: imposing penal charges on overdrafts. It is that kind of attitude which has opened the way for such rare innovators as First Direct, the telephone banking service. It has won a large slice of the market by giving customers what they want. What is more, its low cost base means it should soon make reasonable profits. Sharelink has had similar success in execution-only stockbroking. More worrying is the vast morass of life insurance and pensions. The table on page III, showing the gulf between the returns on different pension top-up plans, is a typical example of the enormous variations in performance in this area. But the subject is so opaque that it is very hard for real competition to break out. There are several messages for customers here. First, it is sensible to take advantage of price competition only if you pay attention to quality when it is relevant. A cheap Pep is good value only if it performs well. But a telephone bank that is open 24 hours a day has few obvious drawbacks. Where competition does not exist, it is crucial to shop around as intelligently as you can. ***** One mortgage company has started offering 'no-property mortgages.' The snag? If you do not then find a property, it keeps your fee. Healthy competition?</p>

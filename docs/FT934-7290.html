			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Judge suspends Ramsden sentence: Guilty pleas avoid a daunting trial after SFO's most demanding investigation MR TERRY RAMSDEN, former chairman of Glen International and acknowledged 'king' of the Japanese warrants market, yesterday pleaded guilty to four charges of fraud at the Old Bailey. His plea marks the end of the most complex prosecution yet brought by the Serious Fraud Office, and avoids a trial most lawyers predicted would be particularly complicated and arduous. After what the SFO called 'constructive discussions' with him, Mr Ramsden admitted four counts of making reckless or false statements to induce investments. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment, suspended for two years. The complexity of Mr Ramsden's multi-million pound trading in Japanese warrants (long-term options on stocks) and his 'back of an envelope' accounting methods had made the case the SFO's most demanding investigation. Lawyers for the SFO yesterday responded to public criticism of the office by claiming Mr Ramsden's plea demonstrated the effectiveness of its operations. They said the case had been seen by some people as unprosecutable. Mr Jeremy Roberts QC, for the SFO, told the court that Mr Ramsden had a 'meteoric' rise in the City through the success of Glen International. However his fall, when the company collapsed in September 1987 owing Pounds 100m, was even more meteoric. Between the end of May 1987 and July that year, he had persuaded banks and securities houses to invest many millions of pounds in his warrant trading 'funding circles' which involved a risky and complicated series of transactions. At that time he had known there was a substantial risk Glen International could not meet its obligations, Mr Roberts said. Mr Ramsden's problems had stemmed from his taking money out of Glen International to finance other activities such as buying racehorses, Mr Roberts said. By taking money out of the profitable parts of his business, he had left himself exposed to the large losses he sustained on the volatile warrants market. His problems had become serious when he had defaulted on an agreement to buy warrants from Nikko Securities which then stopped acting as a partner in his funding circle. He had then been forced to look for other investors. Among the new investors he had found were the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and the Japanese securities houses Cosmo Securities and Taiheiyo Europe. He had raised a total of Pounds 90m from these institutions knowing his company might have problems eventually buying the warrants from them as he had agreed. Mr Ramsden had not set out to defraud his creditors, but was guilty of criminal recklessness, Mr Roberts said. He added: 'The prosecution say it was quite wrong to obtain new funds without a full and frank disclosure of the mess that Glen International was in.' Judge Pownall QC, passing sentence, said Mr Ramsden had built up an honest and phenomenally successful business of which he could be proud. 'It is all the more sad that by your plea you have had to admit recklessness,' he said. Explaining his decision to suspend the four concurrent two-year jail sentences, the judge said the offences to which Mr Ramsden had admitted would normally result in immediate prison sentences. However, Mr Ramsden had tried to repay creditors before being declared bankrupt owing Pounds 25m. He had also had to endure almost six months imprisonment in the 'quite appalling' conditions of Terminal Island jail in Los Angeles. Mr Anthony Arlidge QC, for Mr Ramsden, had earlier said that the jail had a threatening and violent atmosphere with dangerous gangs operating inside it. Mr Ramsden, the son of a postman, left school at 16 and began working in the settlements and clearing areas of the stock exchange before starting to trade the foreign stocks, particularly Japanese ones, upon which his reputation grew. At the height of his success, Mr Ramsden was noted for his lifestyle of conspicuous consumption. The owner of some 80 racehorses, he was also billed by the racing press as 'the biggest punter in the history of the turf'. In 1985 alone, his gambling losses were said to total Pounds 26m. Yesterday he left the Old Bailey saying: 'I have had a very difficult time in my life. I am glad it is all over.'</p>

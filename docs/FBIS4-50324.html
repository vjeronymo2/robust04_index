			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Another H share of a  state-owned enterprise from the Chinese mainland was today  listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, thus bringing to eight  the total number of such shares listed in the territory.    Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry (Group) Company Limited  (Tianjin Bohai), the largest marine chemical manufacturer in  China, has issued a total of 340 million H shares in Hong Kong  with each share valued at 1.2 HK [Hong Kong] dollars (0.15 U.S.  cents).    The newly-issued H share today closed at 1.1 HK dollars on a  turnover of 81 million shares on the Hong Kong stock market upon  its first trading day.    Analysts here attributed the drop mainly to the fear of the  possible increase of the U.S. dollar interest rate in the near  future.    Cai Chaoqun, general manager of Tianjin Bohai, said that his  company will bring the best possible returns to investors in the  long run.</p>

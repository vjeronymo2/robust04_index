			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAYING TAXES  </P> <P> What kind of people are willing to sacrifice their daughters and sons but  refuse to sacrifice their money?  </P> <P> The only concrete way in which most of us can show our patriotism is to pay our  taxes.  </P> <P> Flying the flag and singing "God Bless America" are symbolic ways of showing  our gratitude for what our country has given us. But we have schools and  freeways and hospitals to use because someone paid for them -- with taxes.  </P> <P> Incredibly, many so-called patriotic Americans are contemptuous of men and  women who object to sacrificing their lives in pursuit of a questionable  foreign policy. These same "patriots" see nothing inconsistent in voting  against anyone who suggests that paying taxes is a necessary part of good  citizenship.  </P> <P> The only war most "conservative" patriots ever opposed was the "War on  Poverty." They opposed it because it attempted to take some of their money and  use it to help other Americans. Apparently, it's OK to send our youth away to  help defend other governments, but it's not OK to send our money to help our  own!  </P> <P> ROBERT C. VON BARGEN  </P> <P> Toluca Lake  </P></p>

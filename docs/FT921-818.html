			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Letter: Key election issue is interest rates, not fast tax footwork Sir, The only issue which matters to me in this election is whether interest rates go up or down. All the fast footwork over marginal tax rates seems irrelevant when the impact of a 1 or 2 per cent interest rate change is considered. Yet this is the issue which dares not speak its name; no politician mentions it, even the retiring Thatcherite gang to whom it once seemed so important. This joint political conspiracy to deny debate is a scandalous rigging of the electoral agenda. Will debate really send the markets into a spin or, even worse, direct the new bank to Frankfurt? Meanwhile, we Britons sacrifice our prosperity on behalf of eastern Germany. There they aspire to a better lifestyle while here we contrive to constrain our own. Is there not one politician prepared to break a vow of silence over the ERM orthodoxy. What price are we expected to pay for 'convergence'? With real interest rates at 8 per cent or more the political consensus is for a deflation far exceeding the Pounds 2.3bn palliatives all parties claim will lift recession. I suppose we can look forward to a time when, with our industry completely destroyed, we may benefit from EC Regional Aid swollen with the contributions from prosperous East Germany] What are the gains from unnecessary high interest rates and artificial exchange rates? The politicians have fled both from reality and the consequences of explaining all to the electorate, guided, I suspect, by the same Treasury bureaucrats who have shown such skill in managing the soft landing of our own economy.

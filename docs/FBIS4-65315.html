			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, May 14 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav President Zoran  Lilic and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou agreed on  Saturday [14 May] that the ministerial meeting on Bosnia held in  Geneva on Friday was major step in the direction of a political  settlement of the crisis in former Yugoslavia.    The officials stressed as the most important that the whole  negotiating process had been brought back to the framework of  the European Union and its plan for Bosnia.    President Lilic is on a one-day visit to Athens en route  from  South Africa where he attended the ceremony of inauguration of  President Nelson Mandela.    The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, Great  Britain, France and the European Union's "troika" (Belgium,  Greece, Germany), meeting in Geneva on Friday, invited Bosnia's  warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats to agree to a four-month  ceasefire, "with provision of extension," in which to open talks  on a settlement of their disputes under the guidance of the  recently formed contact group.    The ministers coordinated a common strategy in the efforts  for solving the Bosnian conflict, and approved the European  Union's formula for Bosnia under which that war-wracked former  Yugoslav republic should be divided in such a way as to give the  Moslems and Croats 51 percent of the territory in which to form  their federation, and the Serbs the remaining 49 percent.    Lilic and Papandreou stressed the need for an equal  treatment  of all sides to the conflict in order that a just final solution  might be reached, and agreed on the necessity of abandoning the  practice of pressure, ultimatums, intervention and imposition of  patent solutions.    They hoped that the resumption of Geneva talks would be  dominated by reason on all sides in order that a peace [word  indistinct] might be signed and the crisis resolved.    The talk brought to light the view that the lifting of the  UN  Security Council's sanctions against Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro), which were voted in place in May 1992 in  retaliation for the country's alleged involvement in civil war  in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, is a precondition for a  peaceful settlement of the overall crisis in former Yugoslavia.    Lilic expressed his dissatisfaction that the Geneva  ministerial meeting had not taken the position that the  sanctions should be lifted, but added that the reference to  their phased easing was nonetheless a positive step and an  improvement on the earlier attitude and threats of intensifying  pressure on Yugoslavia.    Lilic thanked Greece for its principled and firm position on  the crisis in former Yugoslavia, particularly the problem of the  sanctions.    He expressed fear that Turkish and U.S. military influences  in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and [word  indistinct] might be a threat to the Balkan's and to Europe as a  whole.</p>

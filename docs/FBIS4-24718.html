			<p>BFN     [Text] Lu Ping, the director of Beijing's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office, last night signalled China's willingness  to make progress on the much-delayed talks over the building of  the territory's ninth container terminal and the new airport.  Lu's remarks indicate a significant gesture by China to improve  the atmosphere surrounding talks on economic matters. However,  Lu's seeming desire for progress in talks has in the past been  followed by serious backtracking.    Lu told a Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce delegation in  Beijing  that the issue of Container Terminal 9 (CT9) should be  approached "from the commercial perspective" rather than "mixing  it up with political factors." Lu said, however, that China  could not proceed to discussions with the British side before  the Hong Kong Government had finalised arrangements with  developers. He said that "economic rules", rather than  "political trading" should be the guideline for building CT9.    Anson Chan, the Chief Secretary, last night welcomed Lu's  remarks. "We accept Lu's comment with delight but the  government has never mixed the CT9 issue with any political  factors. The government is now discussing development rights  with consortia," she said, adding Hong Kong hoped to settle the  matter as soon as possible as container terminals were very busy.    Lu also said Beijing "genuinely wished" to maintain its  cooperation with Britain in other areas, citing the progress  made during the latest talks on the financial arrangements for  the new airport project. Both sides had agreed to discuss the  Airport Corporation Bill and hoped to reach a general agreement  on financial arrangements.    John Meredith, managing director of Hong Kong International  Terminals (HIT), has said that construction costs have increased  by about 20 percent as a result of the lengthy delay.    Interested developers include a consortium formed by Modern  Terminals Ltd (MTL), HIT, the state-owned China Ocean Shipping  Corporation, and the Jardine Pacific-led Tsing Yi Container  Terminal group.    Turning to other matters, Lu called for an increase in the  number of meetings of experts from both sides under the Joint  Liaison Group (JLG). He urged the speeding up of work on  localizing Hong Kong's laws, only some of which could be left  until after 1997. He invited Hong Kong's "business friends" to  suggest which laws had to be adapted and approved (by the JLG)  as soon as possible.    On the issue of permanent right of abode for returning Hong  Kong emigrants, Lu said China welcomed Hong Kong returnees. He  promised that China would formulate a "lenient policy" and "more  simple approaches" to enable them to continue to live and work  in Hong Kong.</p>

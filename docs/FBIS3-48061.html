			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yindi Loetcharoenchok in Rangoon] </F>   [Text] THE fate of Burma's detained popular leader Aung  San Suu Kyi remains uncertain despite earlier speculation she  will be released in July, five years after she was placed under  house arrest. It is, however, obvious that the ruling State Law  and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) has no immediate plan to  set her free and has instead devised legal measures to continue  her unlawful detention and to bar her future participation in  Burmese politics.    There remains ambiguity over the state of Suu Kyi's  detention  and her freedom, but a group of Slorc's legal advisers told  visiting foreign reporters on Friday that she will not be  released when her five-year term of detention expires on July 20.    They ambiguously explained that Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel  Peace  Prize laureate and the most outspoken critic of the military's  heavy-handed policies against pro-democracy demonstrations can  be held up to six years according to "existing laws". They also  strongly rejected the term "detention" used to describe Suu  Kyi's house arrest, arguing that it is only a "restriction" and  that the military rulers have been dealing with her "leniently".    Five of Slorc's legal experts led by Chief Justice U Aung  Toe  and Attorney General U Tha Tun told a press conference Suu Kyi's  house arrest "was not decided by the court", but by the  "existing laws which stipulate that her restriction period will  not be construed as expiring on July 20 this year".    They said her case "is an executive issue and not a legal  issue", and that "at the decision of a three-member central body  a person can be restricted up to one year, and at the decision  of the government a person can be restricted up to five years".  The central body, they said, comprises the ministers of foreign  affairs, home affairs and defence.    Burmese and foreign observers here said it was the first  time  they had heard of the existence of such a central body which  could arbitrarily sentence people to a year in prison. They  believe Slorc will amend the laws to extend Suu Kyi's detention  and that she will not be released until a new Constitution is  drafted and promulgated, with many provisions that will restrict  her political role in Burmese politics.    The Slorc's appointed National Convention resumed its  meeting  on Jan 18 after a four-month break to discuss the three  sensitive issues of the state presidency, the state and its  structure. It is clear from the detailed and lengthy opening  speech of Chief Justice U Aung Toe, also chairman of the  National Convention's work committee, that all the guidelines  and qualifications for a new charter have already been devised  to bar Suu Kyi, a mother of two sons whose husband is a British  professor at Oxford University, from running in the presidential  elections.    Although Aung Toe urged the 668 delegates to exchange views  on the three issues, it was obvious from his speech they were  being warned not to stray from "basic principles" which had  already been laid down.    Among other qualifications, the presidential candidate is  required to be rich in political, administrative, economic and  military experience and must have resided continuously in the  country for at least 20 years. Moreover, the candidate, his  parents, spouse, children and their spouses are not to owe  allegiance to a foreign power, must not be subjects or citizens  of a foreign power, and must not be entitled to the rights and  privileges of a subject or citizen of a foreign power.    Attorney General U Tha Tun, also a member of the  convention's  working committee, said two previous constitutions in 1947 and  1974 also stipulated that the state president should not owe  allegiance to a foreign power.</p>

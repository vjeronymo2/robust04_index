This is an old dream of this  eastern region. Several tests have been conducted, and the  specialists say that, except for the town of Buey Arriba, the  signal reaches every municipality in the province strongly.  Certain antennas have been rotated and others installed, making  it possible to broadcast the signal from the center of Bayamo.  Efforts to have a television station in Granma Province, though  optimistic, have not yet borne fruit, since most of the  equipment, which comes from abroad, is lacking.    Those of you who have seen this signal on your television  set  may find it interesting to know that it was broadcast using this  Television Serrana cassette player or the videotape recorder  from the office of the NTV correspondent.    Work is under way with a view to organizing a first, weekly,  30-minute program, which will of course be broadcast employing  the minimal equipment we mentioned.    Also, the effort made by the Communications Ministry makes  it  possible for Granma Province to receive the signal from  Holguin's (Tele Cristal) with top quality.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivana Anojcic: "Who Proclaims a State of </F> Emergency?"]    [Text] One of the most frequent topics in recent days has  been whether a state of emergency will be declared in Serbia or  not. There is talk about the arguments for and against, but  least frequently of all about whether and how it is possible to  accomplish it legally. That is why we talked about this with  Aleksandar Simic, a member of the Republic Electoral Commission  (in its expanded form).    He believes that a state of emergency will not be declared  because he thinks that there is a sufficient amount of reason  and also that a state of emergency is not the way out. That  would be tragic as the finale of the effort to pursue the  Serbian nationality question at the global international level,  he explains, adding that the principal political figures in  Serbia have displayed a great deal of arbitrariness in  decisionmaking, so that even this possibility must be reckoned  with; in his opinion, it would be done through the federal state.    Simic also explains all the obstacles to instituting a state  of emergency because the federal and republic constitutions are  not in harmony. The model for the 1990 Serbian Constitution was  the Constitution of the Fifth Republic in France, which was  tailored to suit De Gaulle and afford strong presidential power.  That was also what was desired here after the crisis in Kosovo.    The president's greatest two powers are contained in Article  83: to proclaim an immediate danger of war and to declare a  state of war and state of emergency. The first two possibilities  are an option if the Assembly does not meet, but the president  of the republic may declare a state of emergency without the  Assembly, but on the recommendation of the government. Under the  Constitution, a state of emergency may be instituted for only a  portion of the territory, and when it is declared, the president  may also issue the relevant enactments. Simic emphasizes that  the state of emergency is always associated with a portion of  the territory.  <H5>  Jurisdictional Conflicts </H5>   The state of emergency should actually be regulated by the  federal Constitution, which requires that the highest legal  enactment of the republic be brought into conformity with it.  However, the federal Constitution was adopted in April 1992 and  was modeled on Germany's Constitution, with strong powers for  the government. Article 99 provides that when the Federal  Assembly is unable to meet, the federal government, after it has  heard the opinion of the president of the republic and the  presidents of the chambers of the Assembly, proclaims the  immediate danger of war, a state of war, or a state of emergency.    "That is the situation at the moment," Simic says, "because  since the Serbian Assembly was dissolved, there is no Chamber of  Republics in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Assembly.  The greatest paradox is that the federal Constitution allows the  mandate of deputies in the Chamber of Republics to be regulated  not by the federal Constitution and law, but rather leaves this  to the member republics of the federation."    Simic goes on to say that the federal Law on Defense was  passed in both chambers of the Assembly, but in different  versions. The Chamber of Republics accepted the amendments of  the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro, whereby the  opinion of the member republic is obtained for institution of a  state of emergency, and if the Assembly is unable to meet, the  opinion of the republic government is obtained. The day before  the Citizens Chamber was to decide on that law, the federal  government rejected those amendments. Pavle Bulatovic, defense  minister, presented the reasons for that rejection, and Ratko  Markovic said that if the Federal Assembly consulted the  republic assemblies or governments about proclamation of an  immediate danger of war, state of war, or state of emergency,  that would amount to instilling a confederal element in federal  law. Because the law was not passed in the same version in the  two chambers, a commission was formed to reconcile the versions,  and it did not complete its work before 22 October because the  Serbian Assembly was dissolved. Under the federal Constitution,  the decision in the Citizens Chamber is then applied, which  means that there are no consultations with republic assemblies,  according to the interpretation of our informant.  <H5>  Differing Approaches </H5>   Article 4 of the law spells it out: When it finds that a  danger exists or the sovereignty, territory, independence,  constitutional order, or security of the country are threatened,  depending on the volume and degree of the danger that is  imminent or has presented itself, the Federal Assembly shall  proclaim an immediate danger of war, a state of war, or state of  emergency. It elaborates even further concerning the state of  emergency: Should there be internal unrest of sizable  proportions, so that the country's constitutional order is  threatened with violence, or when natural or other disasters  occur and threaten the lives of citizens, their property and  material goods on a large scale, a state of emergency may be  instituted.    Simic believes that on the basis of that article the federal  government could institute a state of emergency, also citing  Article 135 of the republic Constitution, which states that  Serbia will not respect the SFRY Constitution if it violates  Serbia's equality or threatens its interests in any other way.  Because the constitutions have not been brought into conformity,  this provision might also apply to the present federal  Constitution.</p>

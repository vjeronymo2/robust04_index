			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Beijing counts the seconds until it regains Hong Kong Tiananmen square in central Beijing has witnessed more than its share of momentous events, but yesterday's unveiling of a clock marking the days and seconds until Britain's handover of Hong Kong must rank as one of the more curious. When the clock, attached to the columns guarding the entrance to the Museum of Revolutionary History, was unveiled by municipal officials it showed there were 925 days and 79.92m seconds to go before the July 1 1997 deadline. The ceremony also coincided with the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-British joint declaration on the Question of Hong Kong that took place in happier circumstances than those prevailing between Beijing and London. Among onlookers who gathered in lightly falling snow to witness the unveiling, the mood was nationalistic. 'With such a clock the idea of Hong Kong returning to the motherland will enter people's hearts gradually,' said a woman student. The idea for the clock came from editors associated with the popular magazine Top Brands published by the official Xinhua newsagency. Mr Li Weimin, editor-chief of the magazine, said yesterday the clock was the 'most appropriate' way to draw attention to the resumption of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong. 'Tiananmen square is the focal point of the nation, and that is why we suggested that a clock be placed on the square so that it can best represent people's patriotism and elevate national spirit,' Mr Li said. China's press, in its coverage of the joint declaration's anniversary, highlighted remarks by Mr Qian Qichen, the foreign minister, and Mr Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, in which they hailed the document as a 'great achievement'. 'Implementing the principle of 'one country, two systems' toward Hong Kong after 1997 is neither an expedient measure nor a matter of being swayed by our emotions. . . this is China's long-term state policy,' Mr Lu said. 'It is regrettable that, in recent years, the British government has departed from the spirit of the joint declaration, changed its policy toward the issue of Hong Kong and adopted the way of confrontation,' Mr Lu added. Chinese officials clearly hope the clock on Tiananmen square will reinforce popular sentiment about the importance of re-establishing Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, but a risk is that such propaganda exercises will further sharpen antagonism with Britain. Recent discussions between Chinese and British officials over such issues as guaranteeing the continuity of an independent judiciary after 1997 have revealed continuing sharp differences. These lingering arguments do not augur well for a smooth handover.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy sale of Forte RECENT activity in Forte shares accelerated to extraordinary proportions yesterday as the stock recorded its biggest ever daily trade with 29m shares changing hands. This included a line of 13.9m as one institutional investor decided to reduce its holding and dealers reported that another single institution had picked up the full amount. Cazenove was said to have done the business, buying the stock at around 206 3/4 p and selling it on for a penny more. The sale dented the share price, which was further undermined as Mr Mark Finnie at NatWest Securities returned from a meeting with the company to reaffirm his sell advice on the stock. 'The share price continues to overestimate the rate at which earnings will recover,' he said. The negative NatWest stance followed a muted response from other brokers after recent meetings with the company. The share price has fallen, accordingly, from a high of 229p just over a week ago. Yesterday it lost a further 5 to close at 214p. However, Forte loyalists, who believe the company is well placed for recovery, were quick to point out that a near 2 per cent stake in the stock had found a single ready buyer and that the price had held up well. The debate in the stock market over Forte's recovery potential has been a feature of the leisure sector in recent weeks, prompting hefty two-way business in the shares.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The United States Forces  in Korea (USFK) Thursday [19 May] launched a three-day defense  readiness drill involving USFK dependents and American civilians  residing in the country, a spokesman for the Korea-U.S. Combined  Forces Command (CFC) said.    The semi-annual drill called Non-combatant Evacuation  Operation (NEO) will include the checking of manpower, paperwork  and the operation to evacuate non-combatants in the event of war  on the Korean peninsula, the spokesman said.    The spokesman added, "the drill is just part of the routine  semiannual program having nothing to do with the current  situation in which tension has escalated due to the standoff  involving Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program."</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Business invited to join the club Football diplomacy in the cause of economic regeneration is the new weapon of Newcastle United Football Club, the Premiership leaders. Sir John Hall, United chairman and a champion of his native north-east, has decided to turn his team's success into a platform for local companies seeking new business overseas. When Newcastle play Bilbao in Spain in a fortnight, 20 north-east businessmen will be at the game, cheering on the Magpies before meetings the next day aimed at building on the team's expected victory. Football diplomacy has already scored a success for Sir John, who recently invited executives from Samsung, the Korean group then seeking a European site, to St James' Park where they saw Newcastle beat Royal Antwerp 5-2. This week Samsung announced its new Pounds 450m electronics complex was to be located at Wynyard Park, Cleveland, on land owned by Sir John's family business Cameron Hall Developments. If, as Sir John and manager Kevin Keegan intend, United's winning streak continues into future legs of the Uefa cup, more business people will accompany the team on its European trips, with the promise of support at marketing functions from Sir John, Kevin Keegan and the players to reinforce the image of success. The 20 business people for the Bilbao trip will have to pay travel costs of about Pounds 400 each. They are being sought by Mr Ron Seymour, trade missions manager for the Northern Development Company, the economic regeneration body for north east England and Cumbria. Those going along need not be United supporters. 'Business is business,' says Mr Seymour, who operates from the NDC's Middlesbrough office. Evidently Kevin Keegan sees success as a two-way process. Sir John recalled after concluding the Wynyard Park deal: 'He rang me up and said: 'Congratulations boss. When you get your money can I have two players?'.'</p>

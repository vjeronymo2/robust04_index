			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Slipping market For the European Commission and EU governments, lack of progress in making the single market work is becoming a severe embarrassment. Yesterday the Commission published a list showing that France, Germany, Greece and Ireland have the worst records in placing single market legislation in national statute books. EU countries have transposed nearly 90 per cent of laws to free passage of goods and services. However, only 50 per cent of single market measures have become legally binding in all 12 countries. Governments have been particularly slow to open up public procurement, accounting for 15 per cent of EU economic activity. Even where liberalisation measures have become law, there are problems in enforcing them. Many countries appear to be maintaining import barriers through over-restrictive procedures on technical standards, thus flouting agreements on mutual recognition. This poor record - along with the recession - helps explain why, according to opinion polls, the single market has generated little enthusiasm among companies and consumers. In January 1993, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the commissioner responsible for the internal market, unhelpfully suggested lenient treatment for governments which failed to implement the rules. His subsequent statements have been scarcely more convincing. At the end of last year, for example, he promised 'decisive action' to improve implementation. This week he pledged this would receive 'urgent priority'. So far, however, he has come up with nothing more muscular than a plan for national civil servants to report on other governments that do not stick to the rules. Implementing single market rules does test the EU's doctrine of subsidiarity. If decision-making is to be carried out 'closest to the people', enforcement should ideally be left to governments. Experience suggests, however, that a strong push from Brussels is essential for achieving compliance. The Commission should not shrink from recommending fines for proven infringement. Equally, there should be a bare minimum of centrally agreed Euro-laws laying down harmonised norms to ensure products can pass through national frontiers. Where countries persistently misuse national standards, extra legislation may be needed. In general, however, the Commission is right to emphasise the quality rather than the quantity of legislation needed to maintain the momentum of the market. Setbacks in making the single market operational underline how far the EU must travel simply to consolidate measures agreed under the 1987 Single European Act. If the internal market is to be a lasting success, it will need a decisive champion in Brussels. At present, that person does not exist. A priority for the successor of Mr Jacques Delors will be to ensure that a barrier-free Europe for business becomes reality.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 4 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata on Wednesday [5 May] expressed Japan's strong  desire to join permanent members of the UN Security Council  [UNSC], saying the country is playing a role worthy of becoming  a permanent member state.    "It is necessary to increase the number of the council's  permanent members. Japan is playing a role fitting to a  permanent member state in all fields including politics and the  economy. If (Japan) becomes a permanent member, it will fulfill  as many duties as it can," said Hata, newly elected as prime  minister April 25. He made the remarks to French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur at a banquet hosted by Balladur.    On Japan's bid for the permanent membership, Hata went one  step ahead from the stand of the government of Morihiro  Hosokawa, his immediate predecessor, which said Japan would  discharge as many obligations as it can under a restructured  United Nations. Along with Japan, Germany is also expressing  hopes of acquiring a permanent east on the Security Council,  which currently numbers five nations -- Britain, China, France,  Russia and the United States. A UN working group is discussing  how to reform the world body and aims to submit an interim  report to the general assembly's regular session beginning in  the third week of September.    In the meeting with Balladur that lasted for about two  hours,  Hata asked Balladur to visit Japan and the French premier  expressed his wish to travel to Japan. Hata also said Japan  will dispatch personnel to a mission of the conference on  security and cooperation in Europe to Macedonia, a republic of  the war-ravaged former Yugoslavia. The Japanese premier also  told Balladur that Japan will consider offering 20 million  dollars in loans to Albania, bordering Macedonia.    Hata arrived in Paris shortly before noon Wednesday from  Rome  for talks with French leaders on bilateral and international  relations and on the July 8-10 summit of the group of seven  economic powers in Naples, Italy. He left Japan on Monday on a  six-day journey to Europe for official visits to Italy, France,  Germany and Belgium.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A Rule Recently Adopted by the Federal Financial Agencies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29482) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision (the Agencies), after publishing a proposed rule for public comment, amended their respective parts of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations regarding the appraisal of real property pursuant to FIRREA. These amendments increase from $100,000 to $250,000 the minimum threshold for residential real estate appraisals as provided by that statute and also broaden existing exemptions from various other appraisal requirements. In addition, the amendments revise existing provisions with respect to appraisal content and appraiser independence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing this final rule, HUD took the Agencies' amendments into consideration. However, we do not believe it would be appropriate for the Department to adopt a threshold mortgage amount that triggers the need for an appraisal. HUD is charged with a specific Congressional mandate under section 202(e) of the NHA to assure the quality of each appraisal used in determining the value of the security for an FHA insured mortgage. The Secretary's accountability in this regard is more immediate and direct than that of the Agencies in establishing a system of state accreditation under FIRREA. Moreover, protection of the FHA insurance funds is a duty of the greatest importance to HUD. We do not believe that we could fulfill these responsibilities by accepting as security for FHA insured mortgages properties that have not been thoroughly appraised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department will therefore require appraisals for single family and multifamily programs as set forth in &sect;267.1, without exception. Various considerations that underlie the Agencies' other amendments with respect to appraisal standards, appraiser independence and miscellaneous related matters are, we believe, comprehensively addressed in this rule. Therefore, specific changes to the Agencies' regulations need not be discussed or included in this rulemaking which alone governs requirements for FHA mortgage insurance transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file which is available for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The eligibility and performance requirements contained in this rule are consistent with requirements already established by other government agencies for lender eligibility. Accordingly, the economic impact of this rule would be minimal, and would affect small and large entities equally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD's Semiannual Agenda.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was listed under Office of Housing as sequence number 1589 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20448) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Executive Order 12612, Federalism.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federalism,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> has determined that the policies contained in this rule do not have federalism implications and thus are not subject to review under the Order. The rule is limited to imposing additional eligibility and performance requirements on private lenders. The only point of policy contained in part 267 with even an indirect implication for federal-state relationships is the decision that a HUD appraiser should be subject to the certification requirements of any one state, but not necessarily other states in which he or she is assigned to perform appraisals. As explained previously, the standards of various jurisdictions developed pursuant to FIRREA should result in a reasonably uniform level of competence, and qualifying HUD employees in every jurisdiction would involve many dollars and staff hours spent on a largely duplicative effort. For purposes of section 142 of the Reform Act, certification by any one state should therefore be sufficient. In reaching this conclusion, HUD parallels OMB's decision with regard to FIRREA that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Federal employees who choose to become state-licensed or certified real estate appraisers need only be licensed or certified in one state or territory to perform real estate appraisal duties as Federal employees in all states and territories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  OMB Bulletin 92&hyph;06, March 16, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is working toward assuring that its employees who perform appraisals or consultations on multifamily projects become qualified as certified general appraisers as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Executive Order 12606, the Family.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Family, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that this rule does not have a potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being, and, thus is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs, as those policies relate to family concerns, will result from promulgation of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paperwork Reduction Act Statement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520).

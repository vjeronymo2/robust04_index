			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: HSBC off the top Top-of-the-range preliminary profits and a higher than expected dividend total from HSBC Holdings drove the bank's shares sharply higher during the morning before a rethink by analysts saw the stock drop back to close only marginally ahead on balance. Marketmakers acknowledged the excellent results - 'you could not really have asked for much more, especially on the 23 per cent hike in the dividend,' said one - but added that the market had been reluctant to push the shares up any further. They said international institutions had been big buyers of HSBC over the past 18 months and would need some convincing reasons for increasing weightings any further. Bank specialists were also said to have been slightly disappointed with HSBC's Hang Seng Bank results and worried by margin erosion. 'There is a feeling that HSBC shares have outperformed enough in the short term,' said one analyst. HSBC touched 971p shortly after the figures were announced, but retreated thereafter to close only 7 up on balance at 945p after turnover of 5.8m. Switching out of HSBC and Standard Chartered - the latter fell 12 to 1215p as fund managers fretted about margin erosion in Far Eastern markets - helped the other UK banks make strong progress after last week's sell-off. Barclays was chased higher, adding 17 at 558p, while Lloyds put on 14 at 603p and National Westminster Bank the equivalent of 16 at 501p ex-dividend. TSB were aggressively bought, rising 9 to 246p, while Abbey National, reporting this morning and where the market will focus its interest on the dividend, gained 6 at 505p. Life assurance stocks underperformed the market ahead of a television programme highlighting the pension transfer story. General Accident, reporting today, jumped 18 to 647p. Sun Alliance closed 8 higher at 357p, with analysts tending to discount the latest speculation surrounding a possible bid move by TransAtlantic Holdings. A deal to merge the retailing operations of Our Price and Virgin group helped WH Smith 'A' surge 13 to 519p. Stores analysts were supportive of the move, which they said would bolster Our Price market share through better management and the more aggressive use of the Virgin name. Further down the line, there was speculation that the division would be floated off, an old rumour but given added impetus by yesterday's move. Kingfisher climbed 15 to 602p, aided by a buy recommendation from Lehman Brothers. The broker believes that the quality of the group management deserves a premium to its current market rating and also forecasts a hefty 40 per cent leap in profits at French subsidiary Darty. Weekend press comment and Friday's management changes helped Burton gain 3 1/2 to 55 1/2 p in another day's big turnover of 30m. Both classes of BT stock, the 'old' and the 'new' partly-paid shares, made rapid progress as institutions searched for good value in the market. BT 'old' settled 7 higher at 434 1/2 p after turnover of 5.8m, while the 'new' rose 8 1/2 to 316 1/2 p on 6.2m. Racal Electronics rose 9 to 229p, albeit in rather thin turnover of 648,000 shares, as two Sunday newspapers revived the long-running story that the company may attract a takeover bid from Cray Electronics. The latter moved forward 3 1/2 to 193p, although volume was also low. Vodafone shares easily outpaced the rest of the telecoms sector, climbing 20 1/2 p to 601 1/2 p in the wake of what was thought to be good US support and in spite of short term caution being put forward by some UK broking houses. NatWest Securities took Vodafone off its short term buy list, citing the launch of Hutchison MicroTel's PCN product in the coming weeks as likely to rekindle investors' fears over competition and pricing in mobile phones. But NatWest emphasised its long term support for Vodafone shares. Several engineering and aerospace stocks were part of a buy programme said to have been carried out by Nomura. The list is believed to have included Rolls-Royce, 3 firmer at 171p in high volume of 8.2m, Smiths Industries, 9 better at 488p, Glynwed International, which gained 11 at 371p, and Lex Service, up 12 at 554p. Tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries languished for most of the session on fears that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may apply drug regulations to nicotine in cigarettes. The strong market trend and a feeling that the earlier retreat had been overdone helped the shares recover to end a net 3 ahead at 481p. International trading group Lonrho advanced 10 to 163 1/2 p following Friday's court ruling in Ghana which clears the way for the flotation later this month of Ashanti Goldfield, in which Lonrho has a 45 per cent stake.</p>

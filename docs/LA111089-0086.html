			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELPING KIDS HANDLE 'DAY-CARE DILEMMA'  </P> <P> Your article "Day Care Dilemma" (by Beverly Beyette, Nov. 1) was well  researched and written but failed to appreciate the effect upon children of  ever-changing care-givers. These are the nannies, housekeepers, baby-sitters  and child care center workers who often do establish an excellent relationship  with the child.  </P> <P> However, for various reasons, these care-givers come and go.  </P> <P> When they leave, children (particularly infants and toddlers) suffer a serious  sense of loss and may frequently feel abandoned. The child may worry that the  parents will also disappear.  </P> <P> Evening and weekend "quality time" with working parents cannot compensate for  the distress caused by these unpredictable separations. When these separations  from changing care-givers occur repeatedly, the infant and toddler can become  emotionally scarred. These children may find it difficult to ever learn to  trust any adult.  </P> <P> There is a simple, although unpopular, remedy: Parents should raise their own  children -- particularly in the infant and preschool years. They will provide  the continual and consistent attachment figure that is so important.  </P> <P> Yes, I know this proposal sounds economically impractical in this era of  consumerism and high mortgage payments.  </P> <P> But it is during these formative years that the child's secure emotional base  is established. To the child, such security in the early years is far more  important than building equity in a multibedroom home.  </P> <P> Our federal government should allow parents liberal tax credits or economic  assistance to stay home and care for their own children.  </P> <P> I certainly agree with your article that the quality of child care should be  improved. But the best child care usually is that provided by the parent who  stays home, creating a continual and a secure base.  </P> <P> ISABELLE FOX, Western Psychological Center  </P></p>

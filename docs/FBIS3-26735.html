According to the figures provided by  relevant state departments, the urban and rural labor  supply-demand contradiction was alleviated, the labor structure  saw change, the speed of labor flow accelerated, and the labor  market achieved an initial scale.  <H3>  The Urban and Rural Labor Supply-Demand Contradiction Was  Alleviated </H3>   In 1993, the number of persons who newly entered the labor  force throughout the country (that is, the population reaching  16 years of age) fell by 1 million as compared with the previous  year, while the population reaching the retirement age (55 years  for women and 60 years for men) saw a slight increase over the  previous year. Thus, seen from the labor supply situation,  there was a slight reduction in the growth of labor resources.  In 1993, the national labor resources totaled 731.78 million  people.    Seen from the labor demand situation, the number of people  who were placed in employment was still quite large. According  to estimates, in 1993, throughout the country 605.9 million were  employed, an increase of 11.58 million as compared to the  previous year. Of these, the number of staff and workers in  urban areas was 150.4 million, an increase of 2.48 million. The  number of people engaged in private and individual operations  was 9.5 million, an increase of 1.12 million. In the rural  areas, the laborers in the small towns and villages totaled 446  million, an increase of 7.98 million. At the same time, there  was a slight increase in the urban unemployment rate. In 1993,  about 4 million people in urban areas were unemployed, an  increase of close to 400,000. The unemployment rate was 2.6  percent, a growth of 0.3 percentage points. According to some  local surveys, of those currently unemployed in the urban areas,  about 50 percent are not anxious to be allocated work posts.  They wish to seek their own work and, in this way, they will  likely achieve incomes which are no lower than those of the  general urban staff and workers.  <H5>  There Were Changes in the Employment Structure </H5>   Analyzing things in terms of the industrial structure, the  proportion of primary industry employment has declined and the  proportions of secondary and tertiary industry employment have  increased. At the end of 1993, the number of people employed in  primary industry was 348.39 million, an increase of 700,000 over  the previous year. This was 57.5 percent of the total, a  decline of 1 percent as compared with the same period in the  previous year. The number of people employed in secondary  industry was 132.69 million, an increase of 3.48 million over  the previous year. They constituted 21.9 percent of the total,  a growth of 0.2 percent. People employed in tertiary industry  totaled 124.82 million, an increase of 7.4 million as compared  to the end of the previous year. The proportion they constituted  was 20.6 percent, a growth of 0.8 percent.    In respect of the people employed in urban areas, the speed  of growth of those employed in the nonstate-owned economy was  faster than the speed of growth of those employed in the  state-owned economy. The people employed in state-owned units  totaled 110.94 million, an increase of 2.05 million people or  1.88 percent. The number of people employed in nonstate-owned  units (including those employed in urban collective operations,  urban private operations, and individual operations) was 48.96  million, a growth of 3.27 percent, 1.39 percentage points higher  than the figure for state-owned units. Of these, the people  employed in joint operations and foreign-funded operation units  totaled 3.43 million, a growth of 21.63 percent, 19.75  percentage points faster than the growth of employment in  state-owned units. The number of people employed in urban  private operations and individual operations was 9.5 million, a  growth of 13.37 percent, 11.49 percentage points faster than the  growth of those employed in state-owned units.    Within state-owned units, the proportion of permanent staff  and workers declined, while the proportion of contract staff and  workers increased. At the end of 1993, the permanent staff and  workers in state-owned units numbered 74.33 million, a reduction  of 1.28 million people. They comprised 67 percent of the total,  a decrease of 2 percent. The contract staff and workers  numbered 23.3 million people, an increase of 2.71 million. This  constituted a proportion of 21 percent, up 2 percent. According  to Ministry of Labor reports, the reform whereby within the  labor system, the labor contract system for employees  constitutes the main part, has now developed from the partial  experimental stage to a stage where this is being implemented on  a regional basis in over 70 cities throughout the country. This  year, this reform will be implemented in an overall way  throughout the country.  <H3>  The Renewed Increase in the Number of Staff and Workers Has  Slowed </H3>   Since the beginning of 1993, a prominent characteristic of  the changes in the number of staff and workers is that the  renewed increase in the number of staff and workers has slowed.  In July and August last year, the number of workers had again  reached the figure at the end of the previous year. However, by  September 1993, the figure had dropped back to below the figure  at the end of the previous year, a phenomenon which had not been  seen for many years. According to an analysis, there are two  main reasons for the slowing of the increase: The first is that  there has been a strengthening of the labor-use restraint  mechanism and, as a result, there has been a reduction in the  use of labor. In 1993, all regions actively implemented reform  of the employment and the labor assignment systems and, as a  result, there has been a continued strengthening of the  labor-use restraint mechanism in enterprises. Many enterprises,  taking consideration of labor cost benefits, have done  everything they can not to increase, or only slightly increase,  their workforce, made efforts to tap latent potential within the  enterprise, and dismissed a large number of temporary workers  and workers outside the plan. Second there has been a change in  employment concepts and the consciousness of the market has  strengthened. In 1993, close to 1.5 million staff members and  workers voluntarily left their jobs, retired, or terminated or  abrogated their employment contracts. This was an increase of  about 50 percent compared with the previous year.  <H5>  The Rate of Labor Flow Has Increased </H5>   In 1993, the number of rural laborers who went to other  regions to seek employment increased, with about 50 million  people seeking work in other areas. Of these, about 13 million  people entered various types of units or individual trades in  urban areas. This large-scale flow of labor has also begun to  move from a disordered to an ordered flow. For example, in  1993, Guangdong Province established labor cooperative links  with eight provinces including Sichuan, Hunan, and Jiangxi.  Those rural laborers who intend going to work in Guangdong need  to consult their local labor department first before proceeding  to Guangdong. To a certain degree, this prevents the blind flow  of rural labor.    Because of the change in employment concepts and an increase  in market consciousness, some staff members and workers are no  longer satisfied spending all their life in the work post to  which they were originally assigned. Instead, they are seeking  posts in which the income is higher or in which they can better  use their special skills. A sample survey has shown that about  30 percent of staff and workers are unsatisfied in their present  work and hope to shift jobs. According to estimates, in 1993,  about 4.5 million people were transferred between units, an  increase of close to 500,000 compared with the previous year.  This figure represented about 3 percent of the total number of  staff and workers. Of these, close to 400,000 transferred to  other provinces.  <H5>  An Initial Scale Has Been Achieved in the Labor Market </H5>   In 1993, all areas further strengthened the building of  labor  markets at various levels and all sorts of labor agents and  human resources interflow meetings emerged to meet the needs.  Now, 30 provinces, cities, and regions, as well as 15  ministries and commissions under the State Council, have already  established human resources interflow organs, while the  prefectural and county interflow organs number over 2,000 and  nongovernment employment agencies number close to 200. They  have thus formed a basic national human resources interflow  network. In addition, throughout the country, 500 fixed human  resources markets have been established and 10,000 human  resources interflow meetings have been organized. The initial  establishment of the various levels of labor market has promoted  the rational flow of human resources. This has allowed our  country's human resources interflow work to shift from the  traditional system of unified arrangements and unified  allocation to a new system where personnel choose their own  employment and units choose their own employees.</p>

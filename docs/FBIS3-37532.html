Butrus-Ghali. Their appeal reminds the  international community and all well-disposed people of the need  to expedite the withdrawal of Armenian troops from inhabited  localities they seized earlier to a point beyond the sovereign  state's borders. This step, in their opinion, could halt the  six-year bloody conflict, save thousands of lives, and  facilitate the start of peace talks.    The immediate reason for sending the message is the upcoming  second anniversary of the Khodzhaly tragedy, a tragedy in which  hundreds of peaceful inhabitants -- the children, women, and old  men of this Azerbaijani village in Nagorno-Karabakh -- became  victims of a barbaric act.    Subsequently, again outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh,  another seven Azerbaijani rayons which are not disputed by the  two sides were seized. Consequently, over one million people  have become refugees on their own land. Their situation during  these snowy winter days has deteriorated even further: Many are  seeking shelter in cities of tents where cold and hunger are  taking their toll. Their cry for help, the authors of the  message to the UN secretary general believe, should also be  heeded by world public opinion.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Vestey arm agrees refinancing with banks UNION INTERNATIONAL, the financially troubled trading arm of the Vestey Group and one of the UK's largest private companies, has agreed a Pounds 300m refinancing package with its steering committee of nine banks. The arrangement, which was also approved by an annual and extraordinary shareholders meeting on Tuesday, has been sent for approval to the group's other 70 banks from 25 countries. They have been told that the fall in the value of Union's property and the rationalisation of the Dewhurst butchers chain is likely to result in a net write-down of the company's Pounds 176.7m net assets to less than Pounds 42m in accounts for 1991, which are due to be published in October. Under the terms of the refinancing package, the bankers will continue to provide lending facilities to Union, which was in breach of its net banking covenants, until the end of 1994. Union has also told its bankers that it will reduce its Pounds 300m debt, which has already fallen from a peak of Pounds 420m, through a series of disposals and possible flotations of subsidiaries in the emerging stock markets in South America. In the document circulated to shareholders, the refinancing agreements 'include the provision by the Vestey family and related companies . . . of a financial package worth up to Pounds 35m to the Union Group and its bankers'. Union's articles of association have been changed to allow the company to extend its borrowing limit because of a fall in reserves. Mr Terry Robinson, who was recruited from Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, earlier this year as chief executive, said: 'The group is evolving into a food processing and distribution company. However, there are no crown jewels and we will consider offers for most of our businesses.' The Dewhurst butchers chain, which is being slimmed down from 1,000 retail outlets to 600, will only become a candidate for sale if the debt reduction programme takes longer than expected. The company hopes to have the agreement of all its bankers by the end of October. However, it is required to publish its accounts by October 10 which could be qualified if the bankers' agreement remains outstanding.</p>

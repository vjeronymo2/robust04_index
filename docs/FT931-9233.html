			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Greece shifts on Macedonia name Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, has opened the way for a compromise in Greece's dispute with Macedonia over the former Yugoslav republic's choice of name, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. Mr Mitsotakis told regional officials of his New Democracy party at the weekend that Greek interests would not be damaged if its neighbour kept the name Macedonia in a form that differentiated it from the northern Greek province of Macedonia. Greece has blocked international recognition for Macedonia for the past year, claiming that the name implied a territorial claim on Greek Macedonia. Until now, Mr Mitsotakis has rejected proposals for a composite name, such as 'north Macedonia,' put forward by EC mediators.</p>

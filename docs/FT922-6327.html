			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Economics Notebook: Not the time to gloat over Japan's shocks ONE little-remarked casualty of Japan's stock market collapse has been the excuse many western firms offered for their inability to compete with Japanese rivals: that Japanese businesses faced an unfairly low cost of capital. The slide in the stock market, and the rise in interest rates which helped cause it, have between them brought about a sharp rise in the cost of capital in Japan. Throughout the 1980s, the low price that Japanese businesses paid to raise capital was cited as an important advantage that had helped them to become ever more fearsome international competitors. Since complaints about Japan's cost of capital surfaced in the early 1980s, the issue has followed a switchback: at first, as the equity boom lowered Japan's cost of capital to absurdly low levels, the debate assumed ever-greater public prominence. A survey article published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1991 lists 24 learned articles on the topic, which had by now moved out of the realm of academic debate and into the arena of public controversy. Just as that article was published, the problem was solving itself: as the stock market plunged, Japan's cost of capital rose sharply. It has taken economists a while to catch up with this development - a study just published by JP Morgan's Mr Richard Mattione* appears to be the first thorough analysis of the effect of the stock market slide on Japan's cost of capital - but Japanese companies have reacted much faster. A debate has erupted in Japan about exactly how best to respond in the medium term to the new era of costly capital; but in the short term investment plans have been sharply cut back and businesses in which companies had no major advantage apart from a low cost of capital are coming under scrutiny. A company's cost of capital - how much it pays in interest to its banks and bond-holders, and by way of dividends to the holders of its equity - lies at the heart of its decision-making. As the Federal Reserve points out, a company faced with a 4 per cent cost of capital might rationally be prepared to wait 46 years for a project to break even; one paying 12 per cent only six years. A higher cost of capital drastically shortens a company's (and a shareholder's) time horizon. The traditional explanation of the cost of capital advantage for Japanese companies, as summed up by Morgan's Mr Mattione, had three parts: 'Japanese firms have an advantage over their competitors because they use more debt (the lower-cost funding vehicle), because they pay less for debt, and because they also pay less for equity.' Though Japanese companies were undoubtedly much more highly indebted than their rivals for much of the post-war period, it is not clear whether they were paying less for this debt during the economy's high-growth period, the 1950s and 1960s. Japanese economists say interest rates were consistently very high during this period: critics of Japan's trading practices argue that priority industries received preferential treatment, and that the whole savings market was distorted to provide cheap funds for industrial investment. The issue only became a heated one in the 1980s, just as Japan's cost of debt was rising towards international levels: its cost of equity was about to plunge; and the capital structure of its corporations became much closer to that of competitors. The remarkable rise of the Tokyo stock market offered a wide range of opportunities to raise cheap capital - and Japanese companies filled their boots. Of the 2,000 listed Japanese companies, more than 1,100 raised funds through share offerings or equity-linked bonds during the three years ending in 1989. In 1989 alone, Japanese companies raised Y27,000bn (Pounds 115bn) of equity-related finance, more than four times the amount issued in 1986, and more than all that issued in the years 1980-1986 added together. This capital was raised very cheaply, as the price-earnings ratio of the 225 issues in the Nikkei index was consistently above 60 during the latter part of the 1980s. At the time, big US companies were trading at p/e ratios of under 20. Even if you adjust the Japanese p/e ratio to reflect the higher growth prospects of Japanese companies, the large number of cross-shareholdings in the Japanese market, and so on, Japanese p/e ratios were double those of the US. Allowing for those factors, that gap 'should have made Japanese firms willing to accept operating returns on capital as much as 8 percenage points below those acceptable to US firms', according to Mr Mattione. They grasped that opportunity with both hands, as the Japanese capital spending boom of the late 1980s reflects. Now, with the Nikkei at half its end-1990 level, adjusted price/earnings ratios for Japanese companies are below those of their US rivals. US companies can now raise equity capital 1 percentage point more cheaply than their Japanese rivals, according to Mattione. The issue will be brought all the more forcibly home to Japanese companies over the next few years because they must redeem many of the equity-linked bonds which once looked so cheap. Because the stock market has performed so poorly, these bonds will not now be converted into equity as their issuers once confidently expected, but must be paid back. To do that, many Japanese companies will have to raise capital at the new, higher rates. It is not surprising that Japanese companies are placing a new emphasis on profitability. Western competitors should restrain themselves from rejoicing too loudly at their rivals' misfortune, however. Japanese companies have shown an extraordinary ability to cope with unexpected shocks in the past. *A Capital Cost Disadvantage for Japan? By Richard Mattione, JP Morgan, Tokyo.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The chief Azerbaijani negotiator on Thursday refused  to sign in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, a protocol appealing to the  parties in the conflict over Azerbaijan's disputed enclave of  Nagorno-Karabakh to stop fire.    The protocol, based on an accord signed by the Armenian,  Azerbaijani and Russian defense ministers in Moscow on March 18,  has been discussed by parliamentary representatives from  Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh at a two-day meeting in  Bishkek mediated by a mission of the Interparliamentary Assembly  of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The document,  calling for ceasefire as of midnight on May 8, has been signed  by all other negotiators, Armenian Parliamentary Chairman Babken  Ararktsian, Nagorno-Karabakh Parliamentary Chairman Karen  Baburian, and the mediators, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the  Interparliamentary Assembly and head of the upper house of the  Russian parliament, Medetkan Medetkulov, head of Kyrgyzstan's  parliament and leader of the Interparliamentary Assembly peace  group for Nagorno-Karabakh, and Vladimir Kazimirov, special  envoy of the Russian president.    The protocol also urged the warring sides to sign as early  as  possible an agreement to rule out any more hostilities and  provide a mechanism to withdraw troops from occupied  territories, restore communications, enable refugees to return  home and provide a basis for further talks.    Azerbaijan's head negotiator, Deputy Parliamentary Chairman  Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, told a news briefing following the talks  that his country disagreed with some points in the protocol,  namely the fact that it does not mention Armenia's occupation of  Azerbaijani lands and the proposal to deploy a CIS peacekeeping  force in the conflict zone. He also said Azerbaijan's proposal  that a representative of Nagorno-Karabakh's Azeri community be  added to the signatories had been rejected. "The Azerbaijani  side is not pursuing any political ambitions but is trying to  make proposals reflecting the real situation in the conflict  zone," he said.    Shumeyko said at the briefing that it would be impossible to  settle the conflict without recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh as a  party to it. Azerbaijan's refusal to do so is "the main  stumbling block," he said. No ceasefire agreement reached  without Nagorno-Karabakh's participation would provide any  guarantees, he said.    Shumeyko expressed support for the proposal to send a CIS  peacekeeping force to the conflict zone, the embattled enclave  being part of the Commonwealth, but said he could see no logic  behind the idea of involving international forces in CIS to  conflicts.    Armenian negotiator Ararktsian said it was "difficult to  imagine" that the problem could be solved without the use of  peacekeepers.</p>

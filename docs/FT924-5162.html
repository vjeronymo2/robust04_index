			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / AAH hits Pounds 18m on back of buoyant healthcare market A BUOYANT healthcare market and the withdrawal of a competitor helped pre-tax profits of AAH Holdings, the diversified distribution company, advance 11 per cent to Pounds 17.5m in the half year ended September 30. The result was struck on turnover 12 per cent ahead at Pounds 679.7m. Mr Bill Pybus, chairman, said the results reflected 'solid progress' in healthcare, with a substantial advance in the group's pharmaceuticals distribution business. Healthcare profits rose by Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 13.9m on sales 11 per cent up at Pounds 564.2m. About half of that division's increase was due to the acquisition of turnover from the withdrawal of rival Medicopharma last November. The other half was due to an underlying growth in the sector. Mr Bill Revell, managing director, said the UK pharmaceuticals market had benefited from the combination of an ageing population and more expensive drugs. In the early part of the summer - known as hay fever season - the overall market had been growing at about 12 per cent. However, when the wet weather hit Britain in July and August underlying growth fell back to about six per cent. The environmental division - rubbish collectors and road cleaners - benefited from a small acquisition and increasing contracts from local authorities. Profits advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds 3m. The difficult economy was blamed for the Pounds 200,000 decline to Pounds 1.5m in building supplies and the Pounds 100,000 loss (Pounds 500,000 profit) in consumer products. Mr Pybus said the consumer division was expected to incur a similar loss in the second half. Distribution increased from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 1.4m due to the acquisition of ECE in April. The purchase had refocused AAH on to higher margin and more reliable contract distribution services, particularly for the food sector. During the half year, AAH spent Pounds 28.2m in cash and shares on acquisitions. The company currently has 182 retail pharmacies. The interim dividend was raised 7 per cent to 5.8p. COMMENT A stock with defensive as well as cyclical qualities might not offer the spectacular returns some would hope for. However, to enhance the defensive position by holding a leading role in the growing pharmaceuticals market certainly adds a bit of spice. AAH Holdings yesterday showed that it had not skimped on spice with results showing that growth in healthcare had outstripped that of the sector. Rationalisation of Medicopharma business - initially delayed by a Monopolies and Mergers inquiry - and the acquisition of Ireland's Cahill May Roberts group promise even greater growth in the future. On the cyclical side, those betting on economic recovery should eventually see a good upturn in the building and consumer divisions. Forecasts are for about Pounds 37.5m in the current year, leaving the shares on a prospective p/e of about 16 times. While the medium-term prospects look tantalising, the market appears to have factored in the good news for the moment.</p>

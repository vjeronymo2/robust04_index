			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Leading Article: India's rupee dilemma India is caught in what has become a familiar dilemma for liberalising developing countries. An unexpected inflow of foreign capital is making it difficult to hold down the exchange rate. The choice in the short term lies between resurgent inflation and curtailment of fragile export success. So far, the government has, in effect, chosen to risk the inflation. It must find a better solution. In the financial year ending March 1994, India received some Dollars 4bn in portfolio capital, along with Dollars 600m in foreign direct investment. It also registered a small current account surplus, partly because the value of exports rose 21 per cent in US dollars and partly because imports stagnated. The inflow helped produce an increase of Dollars 8.7bn in foreign exchange reserves, as the authorities struggled to keep the rupee at 31 to the US dollar. For a country that recently stood on the brink of default, increased foreign exchange reserves are welcome, but not in excess. Monetary growth has risen from a recent low of 5 per cent in the year to May 1993, to 18 per cent in the year to January 1994. This has helped raise inflation to the unpopular rate of 11 per cent. Holding down the exchange rate through foreign exchange intervention can only be a temporary expedient. Unless the monetary effects are sterilised, the real exchange rate will appreciate through inflation, rather than through upward adjustment of the nominal value of the rupee. There can be no enduring advantage in that, particularly given the damage done by inflation in India. Imports increase The dilemma might vanish spontaneously. But provided reforms continue, this is unlikely to result from rapid dwindling of the capital inflow itself. Much more desirable would be a substantial increase in imports, as economic growth accelerates. Faster growth of industrial output was already observable by late-1993. This should continue. Nevertheless, the ministry of finance expects the current account deficit this financial year to be only US Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn, insufficient to offset a capital inflow like last year's. Efforts could be made to lower the attractiveness of the capital inflows. One possibility is to reduce the return on deposits by non-residents; another is to restrict the access of Indian companies to foreign capital; yet another would be to restrict inflows of foreign portfolio capital. All such measures would be undesirable. India's potential as a destination for foreign capital has, after all, barely been scratched. Vast and poor, India needs to find ways of using such capital. This is particularly true of foreign direct investment, actively encouraged by the prime minister himself earlier this week. Faster reduction If the inflows were neither to cease spontaneously nor be stopped, attempts could be made to curb their effects. One option, currently being tried, is to curb monetary expansion through changes in cash reserve requirements. Another is to try to sterilise the inflow through open market operations by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank. Best of all, however, would be to see the inflow as both reward and opportunity. A faster reduction in the fiscal deficit than that planned by the finance minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, could help offset the inflationary effects. Above all, accelerated import liberalisation would directly absorb foreign exchange. The central government faces a dilemma here, because customs duties contribute 40 per cent of its revenues. The solution is a reform designed to increase imports, along with changes to the fiscal system, to reduce dependence on customs duties. It would be a massive policy failure for India to be unable to absorb a few billion dollars, without letting exports be crowded out or suffering from needless inflation. These resources must be absorbed in a non-inflationary way, instead. The outside world has become increasingly concerned about the will of the Indian government to sustain stabilisation and press on with radical reform. Mr Singh has recently restated both commitments. How the government copes with the opportunity presented by the present glut of foreign exchange will help show whether it is to be taken seriously.</p>

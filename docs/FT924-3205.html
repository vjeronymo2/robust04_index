			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Arts: An epic evening with Nielsen's 'Saul and David' - Concert and semi-staged opera performances at the Barbican and Queen Elizabeth Hall Nielsen's first opera Saul og David has stayed outside the repertory in Britain. It has been staged here just once - in a semi-professional production in 1977 - though a new Danish recording was released last year. As part of 'Tender is the North' at the Barbican on Monday the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus undertook a concert performance: a vivid, impassioned account conducted by Andrew Davis, sung in Danish with a mix of British and Danish soloists. The dramatic tenacity of the score in the concert hall squashed all suspicions that this Biblical epic is really oratorio passed off as opera. The choruses may be striking inspirations and integral to the dramatic structure, but the work hinges genuinely upon its juxtaposition of the central characters - Saul and David, Saul's children Jonathan and Mikal and the prophet Samuel - and the ways in which their psychologies are probed and analysed. That Nielsen works much of this out in terms of inherited operatic stereotypes rather than through freshly minted invention never threatens the work's integrity, just fails to clinch its originality; what is memorable is the sustained effect of Saul and David, rather than any of its specific details. By the time he came to write the opera at the turn of the century Nielsen had learnt his craft well. Musorgsky's Boris Godunov is commonly cited as Saul and David's precursor; that source is especially evident in Saul's monologues and the set-piece choruses, and Nielsen was after all a nationalist composer of his own devising, one derived at several removes from Musorgsky's example. But there is a good deal of Wagner in the writing too (hints of Gotterdammerung in Samuel's grave pronouncements) and even of the 19th-century Italian tradition in the lyric duet for David and Mikal that ends the first act. If the opera never quite takes off or becomes more than the sum of these identifiable parts it is plotted with great economy and directness, carved out in massive tonal arches. As Andrew Davis recognised, the music always knows where it wants to go and generates the momentum it needs to get there. Ideally the vocal writing requires more weight than mustered in the Barbican cast, singers with Wagnerian powers of declamation - one of the early interpreters of the role of Mikal was Kirsten Flagstad, while the recent recording cast Aage Haugland as Saul. But here with Ulrik Cold as a flexible Saul, Kurt Westi a persuasive David and Christian Christiansen a sepulchral Samuel the performances were consistently involved; Eva Johansson joined well with Westi in Mikal's duets, and John Mark Ainsley added a finely drawn Jonathan to his own increasing operatic gallery. On Sunday Colin Davis and the London Symphony Orchestra had added a further instalment to their cycle of the Sibelius symphonies, which is proving to be the glorious centrepiece of this Scandinavian celebration. Davis's powers as a Sibelius interpreter have grown steadily over two decades; but until this concert he had never tackled Kullervo, the symphony for voices and orchestra based upon an episode from the Finnish Kalevala which preceded the numbered symphonies and furnished so much of Sibelius's later music. In Finland Kullervo has tremendous nationalist significance and in Britain performances have been increasingly frequent over recent years. Davis's account though surpassed any I had heard in its purposeful power and its refusal to be ambushed by any of the work's longueurs. Even the long central movement 'Kullervo and his Sister' remained on course and culminated in wonderful declamatory solos from the baritone Jorma Hynninen and the soprano Soile Isokoski. The choir was the Helsinki University Chorus, which has made Kullervo its own speciality; the LSO, enjoying a vintage period at the moment, never failed in its attention to detail.

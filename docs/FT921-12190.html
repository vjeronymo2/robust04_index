			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / BT in talks to set up global telecoms net BRITISH Telecom and the German and Japanese telecommunications organisations, Deutsche Telekom and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), are continuing negotiations aimed at establishing a global business communications network. The talks seemed to be foundering late last year when Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, failed to seal an alliance with his German and Japanese counterparts during an international telecommunications trade fair in Geneva. Now BT hopes that a deal can be concluded soon involving Telekom and NTT in taking shares in Syncordia, a BT venture in Atlanta, Georgia, established last year to manage voice, data and video links for multinational companies. BT hopes to exploit the trend towards 'outsourcing' among large international companies - passing over management of their telecommunications and data communications networks to a third party on a fee basis. BT said yesterday that the negotiations were 'warm', but that no date for concluding the deal had been fixed. It agreed that its potential partners were Telekom and NTT but could not confirm that BT would expect to retain 48 per cent of the equity in Syncordia while Telekom and NTT would take 26 per cent each. Each partner's shareholding was still under discussion. The chief threat to the success of BT's plans to develop Syncordia through a relationship with the Germans and Japanese is from its international rivals  -France Telecom, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and MCI of the US - which, through their own attempts to attract Telekom and NTT, were instrumental in preventing BT from concluding a deal in Geneva. The overall plan is fairly small in BT's terms, with an initial investment of less than Pounds 100m. Technology, Page 11; Editorial comment, Page 16</p>

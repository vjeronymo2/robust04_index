			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEXT PHILIPPINE COUP ATTEMPT? PICK A DAY, ANY DAY;  </P> <P> THE MEDIA: RUMORS ABOUND IN A COUNTRY THAT LOVES THEM. BUT PEOPLE ARE GENUINELY  ON EDGE.  </P> <P> "President Warns Against Blood Bath," a recent headline in the Evening Star  declared.  </P> <P> "Aquino Voices Fears of New Coup Attempt" -- Philippines Newsday.  </P> <P> "Valentine Coup Shaping Up" -- People's Journal Tonight.  </P> <P> "Coup Plotters Sowing Confusion, Intrigue" -- Manila Times.  </P> <P> Such has been the daily fare of rumor and speculation since last month's  abortive effort by rebel soldiers to overthrow President Corazon Aquino. In the  weeks since, government officials, rebel leaders and senior diplomats have  warned repeatedly of new and bloodier uprisings to come.  </P> <P> But the much-predicted Christmas coup failed to materialize. Despite forecasts  to the contrary, New Year's Eve was also quiet, unless you count the nine  killed and 1,600 wounded by revelers' customary gunfire and fireworks.  </P> <P> New dates for a coup are floated regularly, from next week to Valentine's Day  to May Day.  </P> <P> "It's coup fever," Lt. Col. Pol Lacerna said wearily. "It's a product of  imagination and disinformation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rumor Alert Center  </P> <P> Lacerna should know. He helps run the Rumor Alert Center at Camp Aguinaldo,  headquarters of the Department of Defense. Despite the title, the center is not  always alert: Ringing phones are often ignored, and its telephone numbers seem  to change constantly.  </P> <P> People who manage to get through on the telephone range from the curious to the  hysterical. A woman frantically reported heavy fighting at Ft. Bonifacio. What  she had heard were youngsters' firecrackers. An elderly man saw an armored  personnel carrier filled with rebel soldiers, which turned out to be a pickup  truck carrying two soldiers.  </P> <P> Another caller told of civilians fleeing shelling at Camp Aguinaldo, apparently  forgetting that she was calling Camp Aguinaldo.  </P> <P> "We just laughed," Lacerna said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, people are on edge. On a recent Sunday night, an American  television network alerted its crews when someone reported barricades going up  outside Aquino's residence. The barricades, as it turned out, were for a  religious parade two miles away.  </P> <P> A reporter spent five hours Wednesday night checking a tip that 500 mutinous  troops were marching toward Cagayan province in the north to rescue Gov.  Rodolfo Aguinaldo, a rebel supporter who has refused to leave his office  despite a 60-day suspension.  </P> <P> "Nothing is happening here," Aguinaldo said when he was finally reached by  phone. "I haven't even heard the rumor."  </P> <P> Part of the problem is that the term "rumor control" is an oxymoron in the  Philippines. Gossip -- tsismis in Tagalog -- is standard fare in the coffee  shops and at business lunches, even in government announcements. In most  newspapers, rumor is routinely reported as fact until proved otherwise.  Usually, rumors are reported and then forgotten.  </P> <P> Death That Wasn't  </P> <P> For example, former President Ferdinand E. Marcos was repeatedly reported dead  long before his death last Sept. 28 in Hawaii. One newspaper reported his death  in April, 1988, then recovered with a story headlined, "Marcos Denies Death  Rumors."  </P> <P> Every new round of coup rumors sends the peso lower, the black market higher  and jitters into Manila's two stock exchanges, where prices are off 18% since  the coup.  </P> <P> "Some investors take these things seriously," broker Irving I. Ackerman  fretted. "People get scared."  </P> <P> There is reason, of course. In interviews and letters, rebel leaders have  warned that Aquino's recent Cabinet shake-up and her appointment of a  presidential investigating commission will not remedy the corruption and  ineptitude they say is endemic. They demand that she resign and that the United  States abandon immediately the six military facilities it has in the  Philippines.  </P> <P> Last week, the best-known coup plotter, cashiered army Lt. Col. Gregorio  (Gringo) Honasan, wrote an open letter to newspapers attacking the "thieves and  highwaymen" in Aquino's government and blaming her "yellow army" for the  casualties -- 113 deaths and more than 500 wounded -- in the December coup  attempt.  </P> <P> Honasan said he has "no choice except to launch . . . Phase 2, otherwise known  as 'Peaceful, Constitutional and Democratic Rescue' of the republic." In other  words, another coup.  </P> <P> After the December uprising, fewer than half of the estimated 3,000 soldiers  who took part returned to barracks or surrendered. All but majors and above  have been sent back to their units. A fugitive rebel leader, in between  meetings with reporters, is said to have sent home for his golf clubs and a  maid to do his laundry.  </P> <P> Since the coup, the National Bureau of Investigation has recommended filing  charges against more than 50 businessmen, former military officers, former  government aides and others who are believed to have supported the coup. None  have been arrested.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos insists that he is determined to punish the  rebels, despite a public perception that nothing of the sort is being done.  </P> <P> "I rebut widespread impressions that officers and soldiers have been getting  off with light penalties in connection with failed coup attempts, such as  push-ups," Ramos told reporters. "The push-ups were punishments inflicted upon  ourselves."  </P> <P> In a speech Tuesday to Manila police, Aquino warned that another coup is likely  and could well succeed. The nation lives "under a shadow of fear," she said.  </P> <P> A senior Western diplomat agreed. "We still think it's a dangerous period," he  said Thursday. "These guys are still on the loose. They are still regrouping. .  . . Frankly, I'm not optimistic."  </P> <P> Neither is a Philippine air force general who fought for Aquino in the December  coup attempt. Although his troops remained loyal, he polled 100 officers and  enlisted men after the fighting and found that two-thirds either support  another coup or would remain neutral if there should be one.  </P> <P> "That's very disturbing," he said. "Most of the men are sitting on the fence.  There's a feeling among middle- and lower-level commanders that the country is  not being run properly."  </P> <P> Most analysts give the coup plotters about six months to make their move. After  that, they say, attention will focus on the 1992 presidential election. Aquino  has already said she will not run.  </P> <P> On April 1, the military faces an overhaul. More than a score of generals will  retire or step down, including the commanders of the army, marines, navy and  air force, and four of the six regional commanders. Who replaces them may be  key.  </P> <P> When will the next coup come? Lt. Col. Lacerna of the Rumor Alert Center  advised: "Pick all the dates of the calendar. One of them could be right."  </P></p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Slippery steps away from inflation: Angus Foster finds Brazil's finance minister planning amid growth but under a cloud THREE MONTHS after launching yet another plan to tackle Brazil's budget deficit and rising inflation, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, and his advisers are trying to calm fears that shock tactics are on the way. Driven by rising industrial production and exports, the economy shifted gear in the final quarter of last year, after disappointing growth since 1986. It could grow by 4 to 5 per cent this year, but it is being hindered by political problems and annual inflation heading for 2,000 per cent. Car production is at record levels and the country is running a trade surplus of more than Dollars 1bn a month. There are also encouraging signs of improved productivity in the private sector, following cuts in both costs and labour, in reaction to Brazil's market liberalisation policies since 1990. But all this good news pales is overshadowed by the cloud of inflation. The September rate is likely to be nearly 40 per cent, only 10 percentage points below the level many economists call hyperinflation. Six months ago, it was less than 20 per cent. The steady rise in inflation has ignited fears that the government will come under political pressure from Congress and other groups to launch another shock plan, such as those which were tried, and which failed, under the two previous presidents, Mr Sarney and Mr Collor. These aimed to squeeze inflation out of the system by freezing prices or wages. They failed, partly because they did not tackle the bigger problem of inflationary budget deficits. Brazil's chronic inflation is inspired by politics as much as economics, institutionalised by successive years of lax spending controls, government deficits and indexation. According to one observer, 'the political leadership in Congress is not scared of inflation; they don't believe the numbers the government shows them and they don't have the will to make these difficult decisions.' Part of the problem stems from the 1988 constitution, which transferred tax-raising powers from the federal government to states and municipalities, without transferring all the spending responsibilities. So, the federal government loses nearly 70 per cent of its revenues in transfers to the states and in wage bills. Of the rest, a further 17 per cent went in interest payments last year. This gives the federal government little room to cut spending. Indeed, simply to pay for essential services in 1994, an operational deficit of about 4 per cent of forecast GDP is expected. However, in the last three months, the government's new team has signed debt accords with more than half Brazil's 26 states, clamped down on tax avoidance to lift tax revenues, separated the accounts of the Central Bank and Treasury to give greater clarity to their respective spending, and maintained the momentum of the privatisation programme, although critics argue that this remains too slow. A serious setback came last week when the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a new tax on all financial transactions before next year, which the government hoped would raise the equivalent of Dollars 300m-400m a month this year. It is likely that the next step will be the announcement, probably in the first week of next month, of new rules on privatisation designed to widen the scope and scale of the programme and signal a symbolic redefinition of the state's role in Brazil. For example, some sectors closed to the private sector, such as electricity generation, could be gradually opened. Second, probably in the next couple of months, the government plans to launch a big package of fiscal reforms. These have to be finalised but could focus on freeing some of the resources the federal government is now obliged to give to states and municipalities. There would also have to be large spending cuts designed to acheive a balanced budget. As a parallel development, such longer-term reforms as the reconstitution of the burdensome social security system would be affected through the constitutional review. The final stage of the programme, not to begin until the government has an operationally balanced budget and a favourable political situation, would be a de-indexation programme to tackle 'inertial' inflation caused by price and wage indexing. This neat and tidy timetable, however, could be derailed by the interest groups which scuppered previous plans. Mr Cardoso's calls for a political consensus to implement reform and control spending appear optimistic before next year's presidential election, the proximity of which tends to inhibit a will to cut public spending. Mr Cardoso may be his own worst enemy. He denies he will run for president next year, but is assumed by his opponents to have just that intention. The argument between President Itamar Franco and the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), which last week threatened to withdraw support from the president, may reflect PMDB worries that Mr Cardoso's plans will succeed, leaving him as a strong candidate for next year.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Arts: Truly grandiose theme The Paris Opera Ballet marked the tenth anniversary of Balanchine's death in May. Now the company has continued its tribute - for Balanchine was ballet-master at the Palais Garnier in 1947 - with the acquisition of Theme and Variations. This grandiose display piece suits the Opera dancers wonderfully well. The troupe's elegance of manner, its gleaming prowess, reflect both the stage light and the inner radiance of Balanchine's inventions, making the ballet glitter. Most important, the Opera can field principal dancers to rejoice in the demands Balanchine sets them. I count myself fortunate to have seen Alicia Alonso and Igor Youskevich, for whom Theme was made. There have been other notable interpreters. None, though, have seemed so impeccably, nobly right in the roles as Elisabeth Platel and Manuel Legris, who led Tuesday night's performance. Both are in the high summer of their gifts. Platel is unmatched in the West in those qualities of serene authority, technical purity, that are the emblems of the true classic ballerina. She has the polished virtuosity and the integrity to serve the choreography rather than her own temperament. Balanchine intended this ballet to evoke the golden age of Imperial Petersburg's ballerinas, and in Platel's dancing we see how she accepts every demand like a jewel which she wears with loveliest assurance. The role was a homage by Balanchine to the ballerina as divinity. Platel reveals its splendours with unfailing grace. From Manuel Legris dancing no less satisfying. His technique is beautifully rounded - the bravura passages without strain, the dance full and rich in tone - but it is the aristocracy of his manner that reminds us that here, too, is a tribute to those princely figures who strode through Balanchine's youthful years. Legris is rightly their heir. From the rest of the cast, lustrous dancing, and fine playing of the Tchaikovsky suite from the Opera's orchestra under Jonathan Darlington. The programme is completed by two Jerome Robbins ballets. Moves is that experiment in dance without music which Robbins made for his own Ballets: USA in 1959. I am not sure how well it wears its years, for it looks somehow portentous, and dated in its physical attitudes. It was given dedicated, rather solemn performance; the real reward came with the presence of Emmanuel Thibault, the Opera's wunderkind. In Moves he offers a passage of beaten steps with the speed of a humming-bird's wings. Robbins' The Concert ends the evening on a note of happiest comedy. The cast is good and the jokes still fresh, still funny. On Monday the Opera Ballet presented new choreographies by members of the troupe. No one expects genius, but ideas can be explored, and talent will be seen. So will miss-hits, and theorisings that were better in the creator's head than on the dancers' feet. Of the five pieces, two struck me as worth the time and energy given to their staging. Florence Lambert's Demoiselles d'Avignon owes little to Picasso, but a lot to the way women see men watching women. It was an ingenious deconstruction of masculine attitudes to women and women's response to them - satiric, angry, dismissive. It was set to part of the Goldberg variations, improbably played on piano and accordion and improbably worth listening to, and it gained vastly from performances by Aurelie Dupont, Agnes Letestu, Nathalie Ziegler and Beatrice Martel. Pierre Darde's Carnival of the Animals offers four dancers - Clairemarie Osta, Beatrice Martel, Nicolas le Riche and Darde himself - who impersonate the menagerie in dances that are off-beat, and often pertinent about beasts. They are also funny - but Darde's ideas have something more than jokiness to them, and he uses the great stage well. The piece was admirably danced, with Nicolas le Riche showing again that he is one of the brightest hopes in the tremendous ranks of the Opera's young dancers.</p>

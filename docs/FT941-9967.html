			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Amstrad declines to Pounds 1.75m - Sugar warns of possible deficit for full-year Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Amstrad, warned shareholders yesterday that the consumer electronics group might report a full-year loss and said the level of final dividend would be 'considered in the light of the second-half trading results.' The profits warning - the second in three months - came as the group reported an unexpected first-half operating loss and sharply lower pre-tax profits, reflecting fierce pressure on margins and a 31 per cent decline in turnover. 'Margins in the consumer electronics industry continue to be under pressure, due to an oversupply of product, price cutting and depressed demand,' said the chairman. 'Retailers are striving for higher margins on lower retail prices to compensate for excessive competitiveness in the market.' Pre-tax profits in the six months to December 31 fell from Pounds 5.61m to Pounds 1.75m. Despite this the interim dividend is maintained at 0.2p. The shares closed 4 1/4 p lower at 40 3/4 p. Turnover, including Pounds 7.03m from its Dancall mobile telephone acquisition, fell to Pounds 139.9m (Pounds 202.2m). Mr Sugar said the fall was due partly to the decision 'to reduce activity in product categories with little or no margin.' These included low margin personal computers which accounted for Pounds 23m of the sales decline, and video-recorders. Nevertheless, even after a Pounds 455,000 three-month contribution from Dancall, the group incurred a Pounds 1.89m operating loss, compared with a Pounds 9.1m profit. Although Mr Sugar said the UK market, traditionally Amstrad's largest, had suffered the most, the group has also wound down its Spanish subsidiary and rationalised Australian operations. The group was also forced to make Pounds 2.5m provisions to cover losses and bad debts reflecting difficult market conditions in Italy. Despite the operating loss, Amstrad was able to report the modest pre-tax profit because of Pounds 3.64m (Pounds 3.75m) of net interest earned on its substantial cash balances. By the end of the period cash balances had grown from Pounds 112m to Pounds 143m. However, although Amstrad is continuing to look at possible acquisitions, particularly in the telecommunications area, Mr Sugar said the group 'would not be rushed or intimidated into making any bad choices to try to bolster the results of the company.' The group's 'best expectations' for the full year would be to try and maintain a break-even position. However, he cautioned: 'As the second half is traditionally lower in sales volume, the target we have set will be difficult to achieve, particularly if the much heralded upturn in the UK economy does not translate into consumer confidence.'

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ECONOMIC INDICATORS RISE IN APRIL TO CALM FEARS OF RECESSION  </P> <P> The government's chief economic forecasting gauge shot up 0.8% in April as it  reversed course after posting declines in the previous two months, the Commerce  Department said today.  </P> <P> The upward turn in the index of leading economic indicators allowed the index  to steer clear of the traditional signal of a forthcoming recession -- three  declines in a row.  </P> <P> The index, designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into the  future, had dropped a revised 0.6% in March and 0.3% in February.  </P> <P> Analysts said April's upturn, which had been widely anticipated, was consistent  with the view that while the economy is slowing, there still is enough strength  left to power the record peacetime expansion through its seventh year.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a good bet, it isn't a good bet and it's not going to be a good bet  in the fall that a recession is about to occur," economist James Annable of  First National Bank of Chicago said in anticipation of today's report.  </P> <P> Last month's increase in the index was the biggest rise since a similar 0.8%  jump in January.  </P> <P> Using the three-month rule of thumb for predicting recessions, the index has  correctly forecast all eight economic downturns that have occurred since 1948,  but it also has flashed false recession signals on five other occasions.  </P> <P> Most recently, the index declined five times in a row in the months surrounding  the October, 1987, stock market crash, from which the economy emerged  unscathed.  </P> <P> In April, eight of the 11 forward-looking business statistics that make up the  composite index pointed upward, led by an increase in manufacturers' orders for  consumer goods.  </P> <P> Other indicators making positive contributions were rising building permits; a  longer average workweek; higher stock prices; a decrease in initial claims for  jobless benefits; slower vendor deliveries, signaling stronger demand; a gain  in orders for new plants and equipment, and an increase in manufacturers'  unfilled orders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3 Indicators Drop  </P> <P> Three indicators pointed downward: a drop in an index measuring consumer  confidence; a contraction in the money supply, and falling prices for sensitive  materials, indicating slower demand.  </P> <P> The various changes left the index at 145.7% of its 1982 base of 100. The index  has advanced 1.3% over the last six months, contrasted with a 1.7% increase  over the previous six-month period.  </P> <P> Annable said recent reports on the economy's performance indicate that growth  will slow to a more sustainable level and "suggest this economy is in better  shape for growth than even we optimists thought."  </P> <P> Pessimists are also rethinking their views.  </P> <P> Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, has been  forecasting a mild recession by year's end but now concedes, "The odds are by  no means convincing, even to me.  </P> <P> "The evidence is coming on the side of a soft landing -- continued but subdued  growth."  </P> <P> That is just what the Federal Reserve has been trying to produce by nudging up  interest rates.  </P> <P> Dederick said an upturn in the index "doesn't mean that we should be looking  for the economy to go roaring off, but it does weaken the case that the  slowdown is going to develop into recession proportions."  </P></p>

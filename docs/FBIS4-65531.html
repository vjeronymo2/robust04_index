			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye by </F> Beatrice Bazil; place and date not given: "Jean-Claude Paye:  Toward an Organization With a Variable Geometry"]    [Excerpts] Facing competition from three other candidates  (from Canada, Great Britain, and Germany), Jean-Claude Paye,  OECD secretary general since 1984, is now a candidate for his  own succession, supported by the French Government, to serve out  his third consecutive term in office. His strong points include  having demonstrated his capacity for managing the changing  mission of the OECD in the light of the new balance of world  forces and being in the best position to bring the shift that is  currently under way to its conclusion. His handicap is being a  European.    [Bazil] By supporting the candidacy of a Canadian, the  United  States would appear to be seeking to bring the OECD back under  its wing, or at least contest its eurocentric character and  European leadership since 1961. What do you think of this?    [Paye] In my eyes, the important thing is that at a time of  uncertainty and change throughout the world, the OECD is able to  remain an objective, peaceful forum for consultations between  countries. This presupposes that the necessary agreements can  be reached within it.    If the impression is given that the OECD is being used as a  means of exerting pressure at the service of one country or  another or a group of countries, then the machine will become  blocked.    [Bazil] In saying that, are you having a go at the United  States?    [Paye] Not at all! You are the one saying that the United  States wants to get rid of a European secretary general so as to  use the Organization for their own benefit. If that is the  calculation they are making, then they have gotten their sums  wrong. I hope they are not reasoning along such lines and that  it is simply out of principle that they would like to see the  OECD change its leader after a certain period of time, which in  my book is not a compelling argument in itself.    What is more, why should the United States seek to "regain"  its influence over the OECD? It has always exerted such  influence. Quite frequently in recent years it is the United  States which has pushed for the exploration of new areas. When  the secretariat believed that these proposals were justified and  were pointing in the same direction as general interests, it  helped the United States to convince other countries of this  fact.    [Bazil] Today, some candidates are arguing that the OECD has  greater prominence and is playing a more political role...    [Paye] It is the governments that must choose. Personally, I  believe that it would be wrong to politicize the OECD. The  constant danger in an organization for dialogue such as the  OECD, is of provoking a public confrontation between countries.  It is not by being antagonistic and beating on this drum that  the secretary general will manage to play a useful role. In my  opinion, the quest for a more political profile of the OECD does  not appear to be a way of making it more efficient. [passage  omitted]    [Bazil] What is your view of the future for the OECD? Does  the OECD not risk losing its identity by opening up to countries  with a very different culture and past history than our own,  like Mexico or South Korea?    [Paye] The OECD is currently faced with a dilemma. Today,  virtually all the countries of the world are counting on the  market economy as a means of economic growth and social  development. Many of them are rapidly nearing the averages set  by the OECD. The OECD must open up to these countries under  pain of going into decline. Intergovernmental cooperation that  was limited to certain countries and ignored the new major  players in the world arena would lose its pertinence.    On the other hand, the modus operandi of the OECD  presupposes  a certain homogeneity between the member countries, a similar  approach to problems, and a willingness to reach consensus.  This "culture" must be enriched, but also maintained. So I  believe we must be selective when choosing new members as well  as cautious with regard to the pace at which we open up the  organization. The countries applying to join the organization  can start off by participating in certain activities,  familiarizing themselves with it, and gradually approximating  their policies and institutions to the tone expected of them  after their accession. Mexico, which has just become a member,  underwent this process and South Korea, like several Central  European countries, is currently undergoing it too. The OECD,  however, is not only interested in countries that might join  within the near future. In fact, it is developing its relations  with a large number of countries around the world in various  ways.    [Bazil] Does that mean we will soon see a multispeed OECD?    [Paye] Let us imagine the world 15 years from now and  imagine  that a market economy has been established everywhere. To  remain useful, the OECD will have to include the principal  economic powers, whether large countries or sufficiently  well-integrated regional groupings. Working methods will have  progressed: The European Union will undoubtedly speak on behalf  of its member states; less well-integrated groupings will be  represented by their leading countries or, in each committee, by  the countries most closely involved, or maybe there will even be  rotating representation. By means of a kind of variable  geometry, the OECD will manage to remain an official forum for  effective dialogue between the most prominent economies in the  world at that time.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Court reviewing the grain dust standard also deferred to OSHA's reasonable view that the Agency was not subject to the feasibility mandate of section 6(b)(5) in regulating explosive quantities of grain dust ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Grain &amp; Feed Association <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OSHA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (NGFA II), 866 F.2d 717, 733 (5th Cir. 1989)). It therefore applied the criteria of section 3(8), requiring the Agency to establish that the standard is ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' to protect employee safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in Section III, Basis for Agency Action, and Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Standard, and Section VI, Summary of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, of this preamble, OSHA has determined that logging operations pose significant risks to employees (158 fatalities, 6,798 lost workday injuries, and 3,770 nonlost workday injuries each year). The Agency estimates that compliance with the logging operations standard will cost $12.8 million annually and will reduce the risk of the hazards encountered during logging operations (i.e., 111 fatalities, 4,759 lost workday injuries, and 2,639 nonlost workday injuries). This constitutes a substantial reduction of significant risk of material harm to the 72,100 logging industry employees affected. The Agency believes that compliance is technologically feasible because the rulemaking record indicates that the hazard control measures required by the standard have already been implemented, to some extent, for all the logging operations covered by the standard. Additionally, OSHA believes that compliance is economically feasible, because, as documented by the Regulatory Impact Analysis, all regulated sectors can readily absorb or pass on compliance costs and economic benefits will exceed compliance costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As detailed in Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Standard, and in Section VI, Summary of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, the standard's costs, benefits, and compliance requirements are reasonable and consistent with those of other OSHA safety standards, such as PPE ($52.4 million annual cost of compliance and will prevent 4 fatalities and 102,000 injuries annually) and Grain Handling ($5.9 to 33.4 million annual cost of compliance and will prevent 18 fatalities and 394 injuries annually) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cf. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 59 FR 16359, April 6, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA assessed employee risk by evaluating exposure to hazards in the logging industry. The Regulatory Flexibility Assessment, Section VI above, presents OSHA's estimate of the costs and benefits of the revised logging standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has considered and responded to all substantive comments regarding the proposed logging standard on their merits in Section IV, Major Issues, and Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Standard, earlier in this preamble. In particular, OSHA evaluated all suggested changes to the proposed rule in terms of their impact on worker safety, their feasibility, their cost effectiveness, and their consonance with the OSH Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX.

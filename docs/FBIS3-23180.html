			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Part three of a three-part interview with Abdullah Ocalan, </F> leader of Kurdish Workers Party, PKK, by Huseyin Gul; place and  date not given; for part two, see item NC2222110 in previous  Terrorism Report]    [Excerpts] Botan/KURD-A -- [passage omitted] [Gul] Do you  mean to say that there will be an intensification in operations  in Turkey?    [Ocalan] As an important tactical objective, it is possible  to move the guerrillas into Turkey's rural areas. This could  lead to important results. Also, operations in Turkey's urban  areas could be developed enormously. Operations carried out  specifically against tourism and economic targets in cities will  further erode the economy. In particular, by rendering tourism  wholly inoperative, the financial resources of the special war  could be totally dried up. If its financial source is  eradicated in this manner, then it will be highly difficult to  support the army. [passage omitted]    Looking at our history, we can genuinely see that we have  reached a stage where we have been getting the best results and  asserting our military strength. The military method, which has  exhausted itself for the state, has potential for us. Not only  could they not inflict military defeat, elimination, breaking of  hands, legs, and heads, we are actually living through a process  whereby we are able to firmly stand on our feet and make our  body and backbone unbreakable.    [Gul] Could we speak of the possibility of a cease-fire, or  are there any signs of a political solution on the horizon?    [Ocalan] It is our existing policy to seek a political  solution. The false political solution plan on which they have  been working has come to light. It was published in the press  too. They have fallen into the pitiable situation of expecting  help from the village guards, burned-out Kurdish  collaborationists, and some of our critics. [passage omitted]</p>

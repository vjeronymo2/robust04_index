			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Big jump in profits at Capital Cities/ABC Capital Cities/ABC, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a big jump in first-quarter profits to Dollars 116m, with earnings led by another strong performance from its ABC television network. A year ago, the group recorded profits of Dollars 70.5m. The comparison with last year's first quarter, however, is complicated by three factors. The latest period included six more days than the first three months of 1993; earnings from ABC's broadcast of the Academy Awards were included in the latest quarter, but a year ago they were included in the second quarter; and in the first quarter of 1993, Cap Cities took a Dollars 12.1m extraordinary charge to cover early debt redemptions. Even with those three qualifications, the group put in an impressive performance during the first three months of this year, due primarily to a 54 per cent increase in operating income from its broadcasting business. Earnings from the ABC network and affiliated local television stations rose sharply, helped by strong growth in advertising sales. Cable and international operation earnings were also buoyant, especially at the all-sports network, ESPN. Other group segments that reported earnings growth included the radio and publishing divisions, where the newspaper operations posted a significantly stronger performance than a year ago. Cap Cities' results pleased investors, and its shares rose Dollars 14 7/8 to Dollars 712 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Washington Post said newspaper division revenue fell 2 per cent in the first quarter from the comparable period last year, Reuter reports from Washington. The division suffered from lower advertising revenues at The Washington Post, while Newsweek felt the impact of a soft market for national advertising.</p>

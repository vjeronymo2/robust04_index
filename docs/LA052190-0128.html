			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> '91 GRAMMYS: AND THE WINNER IS NEW YORK;  </P> <P> RECORDING: LOS ANGELES WAS THE LOSER IN THE TWO-WAY BATTLE FOR THE PRESTIGIOUS  AWARD SHOW.  </P> <P> New York City is the winner of the 1991 Grammys, leaving Los Angeles as the  loser.  </P> <P> The National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences announced today that the  music industry's most prestigious awards will be handed out in New York's Radio  City Music Hall in late February. All but four of the Grammys' 32 awards shows  have been in Los Angeles, including the two most recent, held at the Shrine  Auditorium in Los Angeles. New York hosted the Grammys in 1988, 1981, 1974 and  1972.  </P> <P> The announcement was made at a New York press conference featuring appearances  by academy President Michael Greene and New York Mayor David N. Dinkins, who  touted the decision as "a vote of confidence in our city and for our city's  future" and promised "the biggest and best celebration in the history of the  Grammys."  </P> <P> This is a triumph for New York, which has lobbied heavily for the Grammys to  alternate between the two cities, if not move permanently to the Big Apple. For  Los Angeles, which has campaigned just as concertedly to be the sole host, it  represents a significant blow.  </P> <P> "We are obviously disappointed by the decision," said Bill Chandler,  spokesperson for Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who is on a trade mission in  Korea and Japan. "But it is clear that Los Angeles, home of the Oscar ceremony  and a number of other awards proceedings, is the true entertainment capital of  the world."  </P> <P> Chandler also expressed confidence that the Grammys would return to Los Angeles  soon, noting that the academy is based here and continues to work with the city  on various educational and industry development projects.  </P> <P> Shell Ausman, chairman of Mayor Bradley's Grammy host committee, said he wasn't  surprised by the announcement.  </P> <P> "We were all suspicious that NARAS might have to succumb to the pressure of its  New York members," he said, citing tourism dollars as the biggest loss. "The  Grammys attracts a lot of people for that week."  </P> <P> Ausman predicted that New York's harsher winter weather will continue to give  Los Angeles an advantage in the competition between the cities for the awards  show.  </P></p>

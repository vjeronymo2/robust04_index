			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / US asks UN to lift ban on Bosnia arms The US last night introduced a UN Security Council resolution calling for a lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia in six months unless the Bosnian Serbs accept an international peace plan. The resolution also seeks the 'orderly and safe redeployment' of UN personnel in the Balkans if the embargo is lifted. The resolution is virtually certain to be defeated because its does not have the nine votes needed for passage in the 15-member council. Even if it did, Russia could use its veto. President Clinton has promised Congress that he will seek a multilateral decision to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian government and will consider lifting it unilaterally if that effort fails. But Mr Clinton recently said it would be a mistake for Washington to lift the arms ban unilaterally. In Bosnia Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Serb leader, yesterday pledged to launch a massive counter-attack to recover ground lost in a lightning offensive by the Moslem Bosnian army. Government forces were consolidating their grip on 80 square miles of territory in northern Bosnia seized over the past three days. Referring to this operation, a US state department spokesman said: 'The Bosnian federation, which represents the principal victims of Serb aggression, has understandably decided to exercise its right to defend itself by force of arms.' Mr David Johnson expressed 'regret that fighting has become necessary, and that there will be more casualties in an area that has already seen more than its share of conflict and suffering.' But he stressed that Washington viewed the Bosnian Serbs as aggressors who had rejected an international peace plan. According to UN officials, the Bosnian Serbs - isolated from Belgrade and facing a growing shortage of fuel - were caught unawares by the latest onslaught and abandoned armour and equipment as they fled. Mr Karadzic pledged last night that his forces would 'mount a drive to encircle, destroy and expel Moslem forces from the territories of Serb municipalities, using all permitted means.' In other potentially ominous developments for the Bosnian Serbs, government forces mounted an assault near the stronghold of Kupres, west of Sarajevo, and the UN and Nato agreed on new procedures for air strikes. The new rules allow for air strikes without warning and give greater discretion - though by no means a free hand - to Nato in the selection of targets. The Moslem successes reflect a gradual shift in the balance of military power inside Bosnia, thanks to clandestine supplies of light arms and the 'over-stretched' condition of the Bosnian-Serb army as it struggles to hold on to 70 per cent of the republic's territory. The flare-up in Bosnian fighting coincides with a breakthrough in international efforts to achieve a broad reconciliation between Serbs and Croats. Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the mediators on former Yugoslavia, announced that Zagreb and Belgrade would start regular consultations at foreign minister level on normalising their relations. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has been told by western countries and Russia that he should recognize Croatia as a precondition for further easing of UN sanctions against his country. On the face of things, both the Bosnian fighting and the peace moves in Croatia are part of a single process: the decision by Mr Milosevic to seek international favour and sever or at least loosen ties with his former proteges in both neighbouring republics. Under one scenario, a Belgrade-Zagreb reconciliation would deepen the Bosnian Serbs' isolation and make them more willing to sue for peace on acceptable terms. But few observers see any prospect of the Bosnian partition plan devised by four western nations and Russia being accepted in its current form.</p>

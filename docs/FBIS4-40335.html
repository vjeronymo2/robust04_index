			<p>BFN     [Text] Prices for oil products have doubled in our Republic  lately. The price of electricity has increased 2.8 times,  heating supplies 3.3 times, and natural gas 3.6 times. Prices  for railway cargo transportation has increased five times.  Prices for sugar and alcohol have increased two to 2.5 times.  Consumer goods from state- owned shops very quickly find their  way to the hands of profiteers, and flea market prices have also  skyrocketed.    At a republic meeting of the Congress of Entrepreneurs and  Union of Industrialists held recently, Prime Minister  Tereshchenko said that the price for electricity would be  approximately double soon. Salaries and wages are worth nothing  now.    Our people are very tolerant, but in many places people have  begun to show their dissatisfaction openly. Of late, there have  been street protests in the Aynabulak housing development of  Almaty because the price for natural gas had been increased  sharply.</p>

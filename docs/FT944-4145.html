			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone at Pounds 2.6m in difficult trading Lower interest costs underpinned a six-fold increase in pre-tax profits at Hartstone, the hosiery and leathergoods group, in the six months to September 30. However the company, which launched a Pounds 30m rescue rights issue this year, experienced 'difficult' trading conditions in its leathergoods markets in the US and the UK. Group sales fell to Pounds 111m (Pounds 185.1m) as turnover from continuing operations declined by 8 per cent. Operating profit were lower at Pounds 5.65m (Pounds 5.82m). However the pre-tax figure rose to Pounds 2.65m (Pounds 428,000), after interest costs fell from Pounds 5.39m to Pounds 3m. Mr Shaun Dowling, chairman, said: 'Customers are leaving purchasing decisions fairly late in the year, while retailers are pretty conscious about margins and are also ordering stock late.' The rights issue helped to reduce gearing from 298 to 39 per cent at the end of November, as net borrowings fell from Pounds 127.3m to Pounds 39m. The company hopes to be ungeared within 18 months. The core US leathergoods business, Etienne Aigner, reported operating profits down 38 per cent to Pounds 4m (Pounds 6.5m), as unsold stock was sold at discount prices. The company intends to expand its chain of factory outlet stores from 54 to more than 60. Operating profits at Michael Stevens, the handbags supplier, fell to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.6m) as it withdrew from vinyl goods at the bottom end of the market. The UK leathergoods business reported operating losses of Pounds 1.9m. Hartstone now plans to contract out its UK distribution and cut staff from 199 to less than 60 next year. The hosiery division reported a 20 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1m), including a contribution from Cogetex which was sold to Courtaulds Textiles for Pounds 45m this year. Earnings per share rose to 1.1p (0.3p). There is no interim dividend, but the board hopes to recommend a final of 0.32p.</p>

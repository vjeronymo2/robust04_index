			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: US bonds When the US bond market sneezed last Friday, many of the world's financial markets looked in danger of catching cold. It is thus natural that yesterday's US producer price figures should have a soothing impact further afield than Wall Street. Price rises in energy and building materials were expected, but in other respects output prices remain reassuringly weak. Especially weak areas such as car prices feed directly into retail prices - albeit in a more diluted form - so the chances of a nasty shock from today's data must also have receded. If a sustained retreat in US bonds now looks unlikely, so does another bout of bullishness. The latest batch of figures cast little light on whether the recent spurt of economic activity can be sustained into next year. Job creation holds the key. A recovery led by productivity gains threatens little by way of inflation, but holds the promise of few new jobs. Financial markets will have to wait for the next set of employment figures for further evidence in that regard. In the meantime, US bonds look caught between a lingering fear of inflation around the next corner and hard evidence that it was not lurking around the last. The final few weeks of the year could be choppy, and not just in US treasuries.</p>

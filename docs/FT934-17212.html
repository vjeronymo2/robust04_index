			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (2): Need to raise business birth rate  -Regeneration of the economy, in an area still important in manufacturing, depends on new, high-quality companies - but the start-up rate so far is low MR Terry Currie, director of business development at the Lanarkshire Development Agency (LDA), is candid. 'This has not been a great area for enterprise,' he says. 'Scotland has a relatively low rate of new company formation by UK standards. Here it's been even lower.' The low company start-up rate is one of the main problems being addressed by the LDA, by the county's five enterprise trusts and by other bodies such as BS(I) - British Steel (Industry), the economic development arm of the steel company. But it should not detract from the fact that Lanarkshire, even with much of the steel industry gone, is still an important manufacturing centre, with no less than 28 per cent of its working population engaged in manufacturing compared with the Scottish average of 20 per cent. East Kilbride is the jewel in the crown of manufacturing, with high quality inward investment companies such as Motorola, whose semi-conductor plant is being expanded to employ more than 2,000 people; the printed circuit board assembler Avex; JVC and Fuji Electric, and many others. It also has a Rolls-Royce aero-engine plant. Motherwell, Hamilton and the surrounding urban areas are significant manufacturing centres. The engineering company Motherwell Bridge is based in Motherwell, as is the mining equipment maker Anderson. Honeywell Control Systems is based at Newhouse, while MSA has a plant at Coatbridge. Philips Lighting makes light bulbs at Hamilton. British Steel still employs 600 people at the Dalzell plate mill next to Ravenscraig and 500 people making seamless tubes in Airdrie. Because of its location at the centre of Scotland's communications network, Lanarkshire is a base for distribution and warehousing. Safeway has an enormous depot at Bellshill, employing about 900 people. The Motherwell food park, set up by the Scottish Development Agency to try to diversify the local economy, has attracted food manufacturers, and a cluster of medical companies is growing up on the Strathclyde business park. Most of the companies mentioned are sizeable, long established businesses, often owned outside Scotland. But the LDA's strategy document states: 'Successful regeneration will depend on Lanarkshire's ability to create new quality companies and the expansion of existing home-grown firms.' To raise the business birth rate the LDA is operating its Entrepreneurship programme. 'When we launched it we got 1,000 applications; when we said we'd have to charge Pounds 100 per person we still got 200 people wanting to join,' says Mr Archie Bethel, the LDA's chief executive. The programme consists of part time courses running for six months, aimed at local management and professional people with manufacturing, technical or financial backgrounds. 'The idea is to get them to meet and exchange ideas, while we teach them how to set up a business,' says Mr Currie of the LDA. After two years the programme has already spawned about 10 new companies which employ about 70 people between them. One example is Retronix, which employs 20 people at Coatbridge repairing damaged computer circuit boards, mainly for the multinational electronics companies in Silicon Glen. BS(I), whose role is to help areas affected by steel plant closures, assists the regeneration process by providing serviced accommodation units for startup businesses. It has 29 units in a complex at Coatbridge, is building eight more 'progression units' for growing businesses nearby and is close to completing a set of offices and workshops on the Strathclyde Business Park. The Coatbridge Workshops are serviced by a typist who has a fax machine. 'The units are very popular,' says Mr John Fairley, BS(I)'s Scottish manager. 'The success rate in this sort of environment is better than in the outside world.' BS(I) also co-funds business start-ups, investing about Pounds 1m a year locally and usually putting in between Pounds 40,000 and Pounds 100,000 per project. 'This is the venture capital gap that bigger providers of funds such as 3i cannot fill,' says Mr Fairley. BS(I) provides continuing advice to its investments with a team of semi-retired professionals. BS(I)'s investments include Aperta, a company set up by employees made redundant by Unisys who have developed a system for transferring office documents from paper to computer disk by means of optical scanning. The Coatbridge Workshops are not wholly devoted to manufacturing. Some are occupied by service companies, including Clyde Commissioning Services, which provides checks for new buildings. BS(I) wants to help redress Lanarkshire's bias towards manufacturing - which means that it lacks a broad spread of services and has to buy them in from Glasgow. Despite its origin, BS(I) in Lanarkshire rarely gives direct assistance to former steelworkers. 'We bend over backwards to help steel people,' says Mr Fairley, 'but very few of them see self-employment as the way forward. That's a legacy of the employee culture of a big plant.' One legacy of the closure of a big complex such as Ravenscraig is that a number of companies which grew up supplying British Steel are having to make painful adjustments. 'Many had a comfortable existence with British Steel and became over-dependent on it,' says Mr Fairley. 'They developed a sort of tunnel vision that couldn't envisage the possibility of not being a customer of British Steel.' BS(I), the LDA and Medco, the enterprise trust in Motherwell, began tackling this problem before Ravenscraig closed, introducing companies to new markets such as the offshore supply industry in north east Scotland. But, says Mr Fairley, 'Many companies have had to rein back and shed employees, and some have to close altogether.' Others, such as Scomagg of Motherwell, a maker of control systems and almost totally dependent on British Steel four years ago, now makes systems for the oil, gas, petrochemical and food industries. Mr Currie of the LDA, which runs programmes for managing change, says the closure of the steel complex 'did not cause the holocaust among its suppliers that had been forecast. Fewer companies than my 10 fingers have gone to the wall as a result. The shakeout of the early 1980s left us with fitter, better managed companies.' The small and medium sized engineering companies are the industrial backbone of the area. But Mr John Burn, chairman of George Taylor, a foundry company, says: 'We are seeing the gradual demise of engineering companies in the west of Scotland, in the face of recession and imports from eastern European and Chinese companies that use first world technology. 'Most engineering companies here are just hanging on, hoping for things to improve. It's hard to persuade myself that I will get a return on any investment I make.' The LDA, whose business development budget this year is a remarkable Pounds 9.5m, assists companies with entering new markets and with developing new products. 'The problem is finding companies with products to develop,' says Mr Bethel. 'It is a bit concerning but we are working on it.' Mr Currie says companies attribute the lack of new product ideas to recession, 'but I suspect there was little product development in good times. It's a national problem and until there is a national commitment to manufacturing I don't see it being satisfactorily addressed.'</p>

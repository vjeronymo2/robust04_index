			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tahir al-Masri, speaker of the Jordanian </F> House of Representatives, by Radio Monte Carlo correspondent  Randah Habib in Amman, date not given; from the weekly "The  Event" program]    [Text] [Habib] Jordan's resumption of its role in the peace  process hinges on tackling the problem of the embargo clamped on  al-'Aqabah Port. Why is there this connection, and do you  believe this is justified?    [Al-Masri] Certainly, the Jordanian measure is justified,  and  maybe it should have been adopted before this time. This is  because the losses inflicted on Jordan and the Jordanian economy  are intolerable. Imposing such an embargo on al-'Aqabah is also  unjustified. We do not believe such harassment at the Tiran  Straits and the Port of al-'Aqabah is related only to the  implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions against  Iraq. We believe such an issue has other dimensions that might  be related to the entire peace process. For some time now,  since right after the end of the Gulf war, we have tried to  reach an understanding with the U.S. Administration, and other  concerned governments, about this issue. Jordan was very  patient, but nothing was achieved. A certain measure had to be  taken. This measure was the safest, the best, and the most  logical, namely, to link our resumption of the peace  negotiations with a solution to this issue.    [Habib] Does this mean that if Washington does not respond  positively to this Jordanian condition, Jordan will withdraw  completely from the peace talks, as the House of Representatives  requested?    [Al-Masri] Jordan's policy toward peace is still a strategic  one. I believe the al-'Aqabah issue will be resolved. I  believe there is now a clear understanding of Jordan's position  and the reasons behind Jordan's complaints. There are clear and  strong signs, not only from Washington, but also from several  Western capitals and from the UN Security Council, indicating  that such an issue will be resolved soon. Resolving this issue  will reflect positively on Jordan's stand toward the peace  process. The peace process is a comprehensive process that is  related to the entire region, not only to Jordan. I believe all  the parties, the Arab and the international parties, understand  the meaning and importance of peace, and the importance of the  success of the peace talks, and consequently, of resolving the  problems of the region and Jordan.    [Habib] At the outset of talk about the siege on al-'Aqabah,  you spoke about pressure. Do you believe that through this, the  United States seeks to drag Jordan into signing a peace treaty  with Israel?    [Al-Masri] It is no secret that the United States, and  Israel  as well, wish Arab states would sign treaties or separate  agreements. It is also not a secret that they would like Jordan  to be one of the first states to make such a separate step.  Over the past few weeks, the world listened to His Majesty King  Husayn's statements in which he clarified Jordan's stand and  said Jordan cannot conclude a separate deal, and that it does  not agree to do so. Neither can it accept partial solutions,  because this will neither be a just nor a comprehensive  solution. Such ideas were put forth by some U.S. Administration  officials. However, Jordan's stand is clear. I think it will  not change.    [Habib] In your opinion, what are the alternatives which  guarantee the implementation of the international embargo  clamped on Iraq, without making Jordan pay for this embargo?    [Al-Masri] We, as Jordan, are not concerned about finding  alternatives to the UN Security Council's, the international  community's, or to any other side's embargo on Iraq. We are  only concerned about the implementation of what is related to  us. Regarding other things, let others find alternatives and  solutions to them. At any rate, we comply with this embargo  satisfactorily. However, the harassments of al-'Aqabah-bound  ships do not just affect goods for Iraq, although they are  legitimate goods and get the approval of the Sanctions Committee  in advance, but also affect Jordanian commodities. There is  proof and there are statistics that explain that the volume of  Jordan's imports has not changed a great deal, particularly  concerning banned imports to Iraq. Jordan's imports have not  changed, the figures have not changed from what they were before  the Gulf war. Consequently, it is clear that Jordan's trade  with Iraq is not as big as those who impose the embargo on  Jordan claim.    [Habib] What is the volume of the losses as a result of the  embargo?    [Al-Masri] Hundreds of millions. I believe these losses  reached some $2 billion that were primarily sustained by the  Jordanian consumer.    [Habib] King Husayn has said, on behalf of Jordan, that none  of the parties involved has proved it is up to the  responsibility of facing the challenges of peace. Amman is  also interested in this peace operation. To what extent can  Jordan be held responsible for delaying the attainment of  definitive agreements with Israel?    [Al-Masri] Jordan is one of the parties involved in the  Arab-  Israeli conflict. It is true that Jordan has a unique position  and special leverage regarding the issue and the operation of  settling the conflict. But, Jordan is only one of the parties  involved. Therefore, every party should assume its  responsibilities. As I have said, we believe in a just peace.  We want to attain peace that recognizes rights, that safeguards  Palestinian rights, and that will settle all the disagreements  and the issues between the Arabs and Israel. When such  disagreements and issues are settled, then Jordan and the other  Arab parties will become ready to achieve the aspired objective  of peace. However, it is impermissible to blame Jordan for  obstructing this. If we want to achieve a just peace, it should  be a comprehensive peace. Approaching one of the parties and  bringing pressure to bear on it to attain a separate peace will  not achieve the aspired goal and will not realize the strategy  of peace, a peace that should be stable, just, and lasting.    [Habib] The 13 April deadline has passed and the Israeli  Army  remains in Gaza and Jericho. Palestinian-Israeli negotiations  foundered. What does Jordan have to say about this?    [Al-Masri] Regrettably, the agreements that are being  reached  do not hold. Such agreements should be reached after more  serious and careful study. The Arab-Israeli conflict and the  settlement of the Palestinian cause on the Palestinian track  cannot take place through general agreements and on large  talking points. The agreement should proceed from the base  upward. This means that understandings in advance should be  reached on all the issues and disagreements, so the two parties  will ultimately reach an agreement they will publicize. The  opposite took place. Agreement was reached on major talking  points and the agreement on details was left for later. The  agreement foundered and we reached the present state of affairs.  I believe that agreements should be respected, and the question  of the 13 April deadline should have been met. Any delay,  uncalled for obstacle, or procrastination will affect, and has  actually affected, the credibility of peace and the possibility  of moving further toward the other fronts and toward settling  broader problems.    [Habib] Then is this what Jordan avoids by refusing to sign  a peace treaty with Israel, that is, not to be in the same  situation?    [Al-Masri] Yes, we said that we should agree on all points  of  disagreements in accordance with all issues and talking points  so that we will eventually reach a general agreement that all  parties speak about.    [Habib] What is your position on the violence and  counterviolence that swept the occupied territories and Israel?  What do these actions mean? What is their influence on the  peace process?    [Al-Masri] What is taking place in the occupied territories  is not unexpected. It is impossible to assume that security  and political settlements will coexist inside and around Arab  population centers on usurped Arab territories -- not just  occupied, but usurped and confiscated. We cannot expect the  situation to continue normally, especially since the citizens  there see that there are negotiations that do not lead to a  substantial result. The presence of settlers inside and around  Arab population centers will surely lead to violence from both  sides, because the settlers are ideological settlers who believe  that the land on which they build settlements is theirs, that it  is the land of greater Israel, which they want to maintain. On  the other hand, the Palestinians and the Arabs do not accept  this logic, and they have to reject it. If a citizen has the  means to defend--whether it is a peaceful or armed means--he  will use it. This is what is going on in the occupied  territories. I think this will not stop with the Hebron  massacre or the bombs and booby-trapped cars. It will continue  until this situation is corrected, and until there is an  Israeli recognition that the occupied territories are really  occupied, without the presence of Israeli enclaves or disguised  Israeli sovereignty there. Until then, I think violence will  continue from both parties.    As for the influence of this situation on the peace process,  it has an impact and may obstruct the peace process and place it  in trouble. It may prolong the process and prolong the pain  before reaching any understanding--if we can say that the whole  process will lead to an agreement and understanding.    [Habib] What are the alternatives to the peace process?    [Al-Masri] The alternatives are frightening and dangerous.  The only alternative is the escalation of violence, pain, and  instability in this region at a time when the world and all its  regions are moving toward, and are concentrating on boosting,  economic development, and entrenching security and social  stability. In this case, this region, and probably Africa, will  be the only explosive regions in this world.    [Habib] U.S. assistance to Israel and Egypt remain as they  are, but the Jordanian share is being reduced. It was announced  in Washington that only $7 million will be given to Amman. How  do you interpret the U.S. position?    [Al-Masri] I don't think that the subject of  assistance--whether economic, technical, or even military--is  important to me or to Jordan. Probably, U.S. assistance in the  past had some importance, but now I don't think it has any  importance. Therefore, $7 million, or more, or less, will not  affect the political line and will not give any lesson or sign.  Even if this assistance is canceled altogether, it will  probably be better.    [Habib] Don't you say that this meager assistance is one of  the U.S. ways to pressure Jordan?    [Al-Masri] Seven million, even if you double it several  times, will not affect the Jordanian economy or the course of  Jordanian policy. Therefore, I don't want to consider this  measure to be of importance to Jordan. I want to fully ignore  it.</p>

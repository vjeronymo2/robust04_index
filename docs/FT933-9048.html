			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Insurers attacked over profits rise THE Consumers' Association yesterday accused insurance companies of making profits at the expense of customers. The criticism came after two of the biggest companies reported strong increases in profits, following sharp increases in premiums in the past two years. Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the association, said consumers were footing the bill for the companies past mistakes. The country's biggest composite insurance company, Commercial Union, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 65.5m for the half year, while General Accident posted profits of Pounds 126.2m on Tuesday. A third company, Royal Insurance, is expected to report profits today, while two others - Sun Alliance and Guardian Royal Exchange - will follow suit in the next four weeks. All were in the red at the same stage last year. Profits have been achieved because of a decline in weather-related and mortgage indemnity claims, cuts in costs, and increases in premiums, especially those paid by homeowners and motorists. Rates have increased by about 20 per cent a year on average. Ms Eaglesham said insurers had lost money not because past premiums had been too low but because they had 'misread the housing market' and made ill-judged expansion. CU results, Page 15</p>

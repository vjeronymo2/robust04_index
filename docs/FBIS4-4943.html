			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 6 (YONHAP) -- The government reaffirmed  Tuesday [5 April] the initial Seoul-Washington position that no  further high-level talks between North Korea and the United  States will be held unless Pyongyang allows additional  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and  exchanges special envoys with the South.    Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang chaired a strategic cabinet  meeting attended by Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu and the director of the Agency for  National Security Planning, Kim Tok, and reiterated the South  Korean-U.S. stance after being briefed on Han's visits to  Washington and Tokyo.    Han played up the significance of a statement by the United  Nations Security Council in the name of its President  Jean-Bernard Merimee, adopted unanimously last week, urging  North Korea to permit full nuclear inspections.    Concerned countries are working closely to ensure that North  Korea allows additional nuclear checks before the deadline,  reportedly fixed for early May, Han reported at the meeting.    The foreign minister said he had discussed dropping the  inter-Korean exchange of envoys as a condition for high-level  North Korea-U.S. talks with his American counterpart Warren  Christopher and other senior officials, but decided against it  in light of South Koreans' sentiments.</p>

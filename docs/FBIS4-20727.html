			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Basim Rashad and Abu-Khanjar 'Abd al-Hamid: </F> "Problems of Small Industries"]    [Text] Despite all the government's efforts to encourage a  climate of investment and production, many large and small  factories still complain of bureaucratic routine, complications  by minor officials, and a shortage of trained skilled workers  and production requisites and services in industrial cities.    When MAYU went to factory owners and managers, they stated  that these problems were pulling them back and not pushing them  ahead, hampering production and leading to marketing  difficulties and increased prices.    In 10th of Ramadan City, Mustafa Fahmi, owner of the  Egypt-Italy Business Machines Factory, said: "We have many  bureaucratic problems in the administrative system of 10th of  Ramadan City. For example, the administration asked for 14,000  pounds as surety for the building, although the license is sound  and the buildings conform to specifications. This cripples the  investor at a time when he is paying taxes and insurance  payments."    He added: "We suffer from the lack of a transportation  network inside and outside the industrial city. This makes it  very difficult to transport workers and market the product. It  creates burdens that lead to increased prices."    He indicated that the shortage of trained hands forces him  to  turn to Italian expertise to hold continuous courses to train  workers in modern equipment and advanced technology.  <H5>  Bureaucracy </H5>   Engineer Majid al-Sa'dani, director of the TCL industrial  cleanser factory in 10th of Ramadan City, said that the city  administration treats people in a disturbingly bureaucratic  manner. It asks factory owners to do things that are  unreasonable from the point of view of market mechanisms.    He added: "I suffer from a shortage of skilled workers, but  I  am trying to overcome it by training trade school certificate  holders for at least two years so that one can rely on them."    He indicated that industrial surveillance was hindering  investment and creating obstacles. For example, it was asking  for the scientific names of imported raw materials in Arabic,  when all the raw materials used in industrial cleansers were  imported and were difficult to write in Arabic.    It was demanding an official photograph and fingerprints  from  the factory owner and the warehouse manager and a specification  of the area of the warehouse, even though a license and tax card  had already been obtained. This had a negative effect on  investment operations.    He said that the company had been forced to turn to freight  companies to handle the completion of customs procedures because  of complications by minor officials.  <H5>  Problems, Production Requisites </H5>   Sayyid Muharram, chief of accounts at the Modern Textiles  Manufacturing Company (Montex), said: "We have many problems  because of high duties on the already expensive imported raw  materials that constitute more than 90 percent of production  requisites. This prevents us from competing with the foreign  product."    He said that the shortage of skilled labor was leading to a  struggle between different factories to attract skilled workers.  Workers therefore did not settle down, which in turn affected  production.    Sayyid Muharram demanded protection for the Egyptian  producer  and consumer and the provision of favorable conditions for the  Egyptian producer, as takes place overseas.    He indicated that the obstacles to domestic production must  be overcome in order to attract more capital to invest in Egypt  and participate in solving the unemployment problem.  <H5>  Housing, Transportation </H5>   'Umar al-Faruq 'Abd-al-'Aziz, a member of the authorized  board of directors at the Dana Ready-Made Clothing Factory,  agreed with this view. He stated that the most important problem  facing 10th of Ramadan City was the lack of workers residing in  the city. The factory has 140 workers, only four of whom live in  the city; the rest live outside the city. The factory pays large  amounts of money to transport them to and from the factory. This  is because housing located in the city is expensive. The down  payment on a medium-sized apartment is 5,000 pounds, while the  monthly installment is 196 pounds over 20 years.    He called for extending the Cairo-Suez railroad line to 10th  of Ramadan City and suggested that factory owners contribute to  this to solve the work force problem.    He indicated that duties must be lowered on accessories for  ready-made clothing, as these were requirements needed to enable  competition with the foreign product.    The chemist Mustafa al-Hinnawi, owner of Gold Star Leather  Company, declared that production in large factories was  threatened with stoppage because of small factories that were  proliferating haphazardly in small rooms and were manufacturing  certain chemicals without conforming to standard specifications.  Indeed, they were mixing the chemicals with other substances and  affixing trademarks to them, thereby causing the domestic  consumer to prefer the local product [original text language;  writer probably meant "imported product"] to them, thus  threatening national industry.  <H5>  Combatting Commercial Fraud </H5>   Mustafa al-Hinnawi called for deterrent punishments to  combat  commercial fraud and imitation. Such firms should be shut down  and confiscated. Their licenses, if they had any, should be  rescinded, as is done in European countries.    He stressed that importers of production requisites should  be  exempted from duties, so that national industry could compete  with imports. A sales tax should be added to the flat-rate tax,  to help lower costs.    Mahmud Ghunaym, owner of a textiles factory at al-Qanatir  al-Khayriyah, said that small factories suffered from lack of  funding and therefore could not carry out replacement and  modernization operations due to the high cost of loans--24  percent of the loan's value. Factory owners therefore are  inhibited from replacing their old equipment with new modern  equipment that would help increase production, improve quality,  and lower the price over the long term.    Hajj Kamal 'Abd-al-Basit, owner of a factory in  al-Sharabiyah, asserted that 12 different kinds of taxes are  levied on textile factories. The product is therefore encumbered  with burdens that lead to high prices and difficulty in  marketing at home and abroad.    He noted that in the last 10 years thread prices had risen  250 percent over 1980 prices. In addition, the business sector  had abandoned the policy of operating private weaving plants at  its own expense by the method of providing the plants with  thread and taking delivery of the cloth at a fixed rate--not to  mention the irregular deliveries of many varieties of high  quality thread to private factories. All these things affected  work and the overseas contracts of these factories.    'Abd-al-Fattah Salim, owner of a textiles factory in Shubra  al-Khaymah, said: "The main problem is a shortage of trained  technical workers. The big factories attract these workers with  high salaries that we cannot pay."    He asked that trade schools train their students in the  technical principles of textile manufacturing by practical,  rather than theoretical, training in the factories next to the  schools.    Muhsin 'Abd-al-Jawad, owner of a factory in Shubra  al-Khaymah, indicated that the high price of production  requisites, electricity, taxes, and duties had led to high  prices on products. It was thus impossible to market the  product, especially in view of the intense competition with  large factories that can market their product.    He urged the state to concern itself with opening outlets to  market the production of small factories.    Fadil Mustafa Abu-Sinnah, director of a tannery, spoke about  how problems arose from their not being allowed to import goat  and cattle skins unobtainable in the country.    He said that if these varieties were imported, excellently  made shoes and genuine leather goods would be available at low  prices.    He added: "We are suffering from lack of chemical factories  that specialize in dyes, even though some engineers specialized  in this field are working in this industry in overseas  factories."</p>

We wish you a happy new year, Governor.  We want to ask you -- indeed, this is the purpose of our call  -- a question: Do you know whether all of the U.S. Marines have  arrived at Bahia Malaga, and when will they begin the community  projects that the U.S. Embassy says the Marines will carry out?    [Holguin] First, allow me to restate my best wishes for 1994  to you and all the Caracol journalists and contributors, and  particularly to your large audience. I hope this year is  beautiful and good, and I hope the best for everyone this year.    Referring to the U.S. troops' presence in Bahia Malaga,  Juanchaco and Ladrilleros, I understand only the so-called  advance platoon has arrived -- some 13 men. I believe this is  the correct number. They will... [pauses] they are currently  involved in preparing the camp that will house the remaining 130  men, who, if I am not mistaken, should arrive on 4 or 5 January.    [Arizmendi] Do you not receive information on the U.S.  troops' mobilization?    [Holguin] [Bahia Malaga Naval Base Commander] Rear Admiral  [Jose Ignacio] Rozo was kind enough to inform me. He kept me  informed about their arrival, but we have had no further contact  over the weekend.    [Arizmendi] Governor, do you really believe they will engage  in community work, or are they coming with ulterior motives --  of a police nature, perhaps?    [Holguin] That is what the document signed between the  national government and the U.S. Government states. One cannot  mistrust... [pauses] if one cannot trust the word, much less can  we mistrust an official document signed by the government.  [sentence as heard] There is something else: They are  restricted to operating exclusively in the zone of Juanchaco and  Ladrilleros, which is an isolated and solitary area which cannot  be reached except by sea. Access is difficult, and there have  never been drug trafficking operations there, nor do we know  about the existence of laboratories and crops. Furthermore, the  climate is not appropriate for this type of activity. Well,  this makes it easy to see that they are coming only and  exclusively for what the document or agreement between the two  governments states.    [Arizmendi] Mr. Governor, does this mean the violent  criticism issued by certain Valle del Cauca and national groups  concerning the U.S. troops' presence is groundless?    [Holguin] I believe this was given too much prominence. I  said since the beginning that someone tried to make a mountain  out of a molehill. I understand this perfectly well, and I said  so. I added that I considered the troops' arrival untimely  because it coincided with statements made by the U.S. ambassador  following Pablo Escobar's death. He said things would continue  against Cali; that a war should be unleashed here, etc., etc.  This, well... [pauses] obviously, this not only alerted the  people, but it also coincided with the troops' arrival. It was  natural and logical for the people to react the way they did.    Nevertheless, I reassert what I have already said: The  document outlines what they have come to do. We also are  remaining alert to make sure they are restricted to the zone, as  the document also states; do not carry weapons; and carry out  their work. Among other things, they have a very short time to  carry out their work, because they are scheduled to leave the  country on 28 February.    [Arizmendi] Excuse me, Governor. Nevertheless, criticism  from all of the political groups has continued because of the  presence of these U.S. soldiers and engineers. For example, the  M-19 [19 April Movement/Democratic Alliance] filed  administrative and procedural charges against President Cesar  Gaviria with the Attorney General's Office because, it claims,  he violated the Constitution when he failed to consult Congress  or the State Council about the troops' presence in our country.    [Holguin] Well, I cannot... [pauses] I have no authority to  pass judgment on the requisites and precepts that the  Constitution and law establish for the national government to  abide by in this type of operation. I understand these  operations have been carried out based on treaties signed by the  country many years ago. Moreover, they have been carried out  every so often, on a regular basis, in different parts of  national territory.    I have personally attended the so-called Unitas Operation on  several occasions. This is a joint operation between the U.S.  Navy, the Ecuadoran Navy, and the Colombian Navy. I believe it  is held every year or every two years in Colombian territorial  waters and in the Pacific Ocean. I think they are -- how can I  say it? -- operations foreseen in international treaties that  have been duly signed, ratified, and approved by Congress.  Nevertheless, that does not fall within my purview, and I do  not have enough information or data on this. I suppose the  national government has obviously abided by all the precepts of  the Constitution and the law.</p>

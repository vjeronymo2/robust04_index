In an interview with Interfax Thursday, he said that the so-  called "Tajik government in exile" does not present any threat  to the republic's legitimate authorities. However, it will  trouble the country and destabilize the social and political  situation.    Zukhurov said that the Dushanbe authorities are prepared for  talks with both the armed and political opposition. "It is up to  them to have their say," he said.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> DUTY'S CALL STRAINS FAMILY TIES;  </P> <P> THOUSANDS OF PARENTS OF CHILDREN -- MANY SINGLE -- ARE AMONG SERVICEMEN AND  WOMEN ORDERED TO SAUDI ARABIA. A GENERATION AGO, SUCH HOUSEHOLD UPHEAVALS WERE  VIRTUALLY UNDREAMED OF.  </P> <P> After 11 years in the military, Staff Sgt. Brenda Brown thought she would never  get the call. Then, with little advance warning, she found herself sending her  3-year-old son to her sister in North Carolina and struggling to explain why.  </P> <P> "I just told him that me and his father have to go away for a while and it was  part of our jobs," Brown said as she and her husband, also a sergeant, prepared  to leave for Saudi Arabia from Ft. Stewart's Hunter Army Airfield. "I didn't  want him to feel we were sending him away for no reason. It's hard to explain  to a 3-year-old when you're packing his bags."  </P> <P> It is harder yet to explain the deeper fear that she will never see her son  again.  </P> <P> "I'm scared," Brown admits. "I'm afraid of dying."  </P> <P> This kind of sudden confrontation with reality is hitting thousands of military  personnel and reservists this month -- not just in households like the Browns',  where both husband and wife are in the military, but in others where soldiers  double as single mothers or fathers.  </P> <P> Although American women have been involved in military conflicts since the  Revolutionary War, the U.S. response to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's  invasion of Kuwait is taking a toll on families in ways that were virtually  unknown only a generation ago.  </P> <P> For some, such as those who have infants or have been recently divorced, the  timing has presented special hardships. Others, like the Browns, must worry  about the survival of both spouses and the welfare of the children they left  behind.  </P> <P> For many, the sorrow of separation has simply proved more traumatic than they  ever imagined.  </P> <P> Such is the case of Tina Mercer, 20, a single parent and an Army logistics  specialist stationed at Ft. Bragg, N.C., who gave birth to a baby girl July 10,  according to her aunt, Vicky Littleton of Garden Grove. Mercer was still on her  six-week maternity leave when her unit was called to the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "She had to turn to her mother to care for her new baby," Littleton said. But  that wasn't simple. Her mother, Michelle Mercer, 41, is an active-duty Air  Force sergeant stationed at Rhien-Main Air Base near Frankfurt, West Germany.  "My sister (Tina Mercer's mother) flew from Germany to the States to pick up  the child to take it with her back to Germany."  </P> <P> Wednesday, Tina Mercer was deployed to Saudia Arabia to join her unit. Her  aircraft stopped for two hours to refuel in West Germany. "Michelle knew she  was going to be there so she had the baby there. They got to visit for two  hours."  </P> <P> "Now," Littleton said, "If my sister gets called to the Middle East than I  would be next in line for the baby. Sure I would take it. Sure there would be  some sleepless nights, but I am the only one left."  </P> <P> Tina Mercer has been told to be prepared to be away for as long as a year,  according to her aunt.  </P> <P> "She cried a lot at first. She was afraid the baby would not know who she was  and thoughts of not spending Christmas with the baby made her sad," Littleton  said.  </P> <P> The growing number of women in the work force -- and the emergence of more  single-parent families in the United States -- over the past two decades has  had a sizable impact on the armed services.  </P> <P> Women now make up 224,272, or 11%, of America's 2 million active-duty troops --  a four-fold increase since 1973 -- as pilots, mechanics, intelligence  specialists, communication experts, supply supervisors and truck drivers. There  also are 55,103 single parents in uniform.  </P> <P> Although by law women currently are excluded from direct combat, experts say  such distinctions would make little difference during actual combat, where  staging areas are just as vulnerable to attack as the front lines.  </P> <P> To be sure, some would argue that none of this should have come as a surprise.  Each parent in uniform is a volunteer and knew when enlisting or joining the  reserves that he or she might well be sent overseas.  </P> <P> Indeed, some, such as Judith Boehm, a clerk-typist for the city of Ontario,  Calif., whose naval reserve unit was called up last month, even welcome the  chance to test their skills. "It will be a challenge," she said shortly before  departing. "It will intensify my training."  </P> <P> And the armed services have amassed an impressive array of support services for  spouses and offspring who remain behind -- including legal and financial aid,  housing assistance, counseling and parenting classes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Family Care Plan'  </P> <P> Military authorities also have for some time required that active duty  personnel as well as reservists file a "family care plan" with their unit,  transferring responsibility for their children to a relative or friend if they  are deployed.  </P> <P> Still, Milt Wofford, chief of the family support division at Ft. Bragg in North  Carolina, acknowledges that there always are a few cases where the best-laid  plans seem to go awry.  </P> <P> In one such case, Staff Sgt. Faagalo Savaiki, who was called up on Aug. 29 with  his Ft. Campbell, Ky., unit, has been charged with leaving his three children  without food.  </P> <P> The youths, ages 13, 12, and 9, were found dirty and hungry with a note on the  wall telling them how to use Savaiki's automatic teller card to withdraw money  from a bank.  </P> <P> Savaiki, whose wife returned to Hawaii after their recent divorce, has pleaded  not guilty to three child-abuse charges in Clarksville, Tenn.  </P> <P> Officials at various military Family Assistance Centers, which provide  around-the-clock help for soldiers and their families, said last week that they  had encountered no problems as serious as the Ft. Campbell case.  </P> <P> But here at Ft. Stewart -- amid patriotic trappings such as banners proclaiming  "God Bless Our Troops" and T-shirts emblazoned with "Somebody 's Me in Saudi"  -- they have been swamped with inquiries and requests for help.  </P> <P> Counselors at Ft. Stewart's main base in Hinesville, Ga., southwest of  Savannah, handle about 500 calls and 150 to 200 walk-ins each day, says Jane  MacDonald, an Army community service chief.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Serious Complications  </P> <P> Although the majority of contacts involve such routine matters as obtaining a  copy of a military pay stub, or helping a soldier's spouse get out of a lease,  some complications have been more serious.  </P> <P> "A couple of wives decided their husbands were going to Saudi Arabia, and they  didn't want to take care of the kids, so they just ran off," says Maj. William  Broome, Ft. Stewart's family life chaplain. "They were either immature or they  had bad marriages to begin with."  </P> <P> Search for Child Care  </P> <P> In both cases, the men's departure was postponed indefinitely or delayed until  they could find child care. "The Army does a lot better with child care than a  lot of civilian employers," Broome asserts.  </P> <P> Linda Grant De Pauw, a history professor at George Washington University and  founder of the Minerva Center in Arlington, Va., which studies the role of  women in the military, agrees that in some respects, the armed forces appear to  be ahead of the private sector.  </P> <P> "The reason a lot of single parents are in the military is because the military  is an equal opportunity employer," De Pauw says. "You do a good job, you're  secure, you get health care, you get promoted. If there is sexual harassment,  there is at least a chain of command to report it. Many women trying to do the  best they can for their children will have joined."  </P> <P> The tens of thousands of husbands left behind with kids have found themselves  with a newly defined mission as well. They also serve who stand and bake -- or  clean and comfort.  </P> <P> "For every one, there's not enough hours in the day," says Jeannette Ruffing,  director of the Family Support Center at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland,  which operates programs for spouses and children of those deployed in addition  to its ongoing single-parent support groups.  </P> <P> Reade Hamilton, a Fayetteville, N.C., policeman whose wife left Ft. Bragg with  her military intelligence company on Aug. 26, knows all about making every  minute count. Hamilton, 49, makes breakfast for his 6-year-old son before  racing off to work at 6:40 a.m. each day.  </P> <P> He gets back at 3:30 p.m. to check Benjamin's homework, join him on a bicycle  ride, cook dinner and put him to bed before collapsing himself. On weekends, he  shops, does laundry and cleans house. "I listen to him more now," Hamilton  says. "There's no 'Go see your mom.' "  </P> <P> Fellow policemen have dubbed him Mr. Mom. "I'm doing it all," he says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mother's Touch  </P> <P> But even for families that have found ways to cope with the contemporary  role-reversal, there are inevitably those times when a mother's touch is sorely  missed.  </P> <P> William Lensing's wife, Susan, a nurse and lieutenant commander at Bethesda  Naval Hospital in Maryland, left Aug. 13 on the 1,000-bed hospital ship  Comfort. Lensing, 49, also a registered nurse, says he and his daughter, 20,  and son, 16, are holding up well.  </P> <P> But when Brad Lensing's high school football team was routed in his first game  as starting quarterback, he returned to their Chevy Chase, Md., home, retired  to the den and re-read his mother's five letters. "I could tell he really  wanted her there," Lensing says.  </P> <P> Wofford, Ft. Bragg's family support chief, says he is already anticipating a  traumatic Christmas for children whose parents may still be gone. For some of  those parents, it will mark the second such experience in a row. Many were in  Panama last Dec. 25.  </P> <P> "We're beginning to look at that," Wofford says. "I'm sure that as time goes on  -- if they stay an extended period of time -- there will be different problems  arising."  </P> <P> Times staff writer George Frank in Orange County contributed to this report.  </P></p>

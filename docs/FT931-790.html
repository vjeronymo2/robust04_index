			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Sport: Cambridge fight to turn the Dark Blue tide - Boat Race ONLY a brave person would predict victory for Cambridge in today's varsity boat race on the Thames for the Beefeater Trophy. Oxford have won the past six and have lost only once since 1976. It seems that no matter what the Light Blues do, they cannot break their losing sequence. Last year, for example, should have been Cambridge's year. Oxford's training had been affected by the death of John Hebbes, a squad member, and the crew looked vulnerable. But they excelled, held Cambridge on the outside of the long Surrey bend and won by 4 1/4 lengths. This year, Oxford have suffered some pre-race wobbles. A week beforehand they dropped Gordon Buxton, the cox, and replaced him with Samantha Bentham. Dropping the pilot this close to the big event smacks of panic. But the coaching team, led by Steve Royle, said Buxton had found the pressure hard to handle and was no longer bringing the best out of the crew. Buxton disagreed and claimed he had been made the scapegoat for one or two poor performances by the Oxford eight. Not too much should be read into the late change. Oxford have one of their strongest crews. It includes two gold medallists at the Barcelona Olympics - Matthew Pinsent, who won the coxless pair with Steve Redgrave, and Bruce Robertson, who rowed in the Canadian eight - and a host of other international oarsmen. The Dark Blues also have a strong coaching team. Royle has been part of it for every race but one since 1976, and has been director of Oxford rowing since 1987. The other coaches include Mike Spracklen, who coached the Canadian men's eight in Barcelona; Pat Sweeney, who coxed and coached Redgrave and Andy Holmes to Olympic gold in Seoul; and Jurgen Grobler, the former East German national coach now in charge of the British team. Cambridge also have their Olympians. Malcolm Baker and Richard Phelps rowed in the Barcelona eights final; Baker for the US, Phelps for Britain. The rest of the crew are all world championship or Henley medal-winners. The Light Blue coaching team centres on John Wilson, a former Oxford coach, and Sean Bowden (both based at Nottingham, an area noted for the strength of its lightweight rowing); and Vladimar Bachev. Cambridge are using a Harry Mahon, a New Zealander who is Swiss national coach, as finishing coach - someone who takes over for the last two weeks to bring crews to their peak. The phlegmatic Spracklen is Oxford's finishing coach. He is considered the best men's eights coach in the world and takes control of the US national squad next month. He has a reputation for adding missing ingredients and has smoothed out the often rough but powerful Oxford crews. In the past week, he has improved Oxford's timing. On Thursday, when both boats practised their starts, Oxford were quicker. This is important, because the lighter Cambridge crew need to steal an edge before the Oxford engine room develops momentum. Mahon has monitored Cambridge closely through the winter and, unlike Spracklen, did not come cold to his task. His first act was to break with tradition and take Cambridge away from the Thames tideway to train in Nottingham for the penultimate week. This was seen by some as running from the enemy. On the other hand, it shielded Cambridge from the media (which Cambridge suspect is biased towards Oxford) and from exposure to the Oxford camp, which has sometimes unnerved Cambridge. Both crews have raced well recently. Cambridge defeated a strong Molesey crew by 28 seconds over the boat race course to Harrods at the end of February. On the same day Oxford won the Reading University head race, beating last year's winner, Imperial College. On Monday, Oxford defeated Isis, their reserve eight, in two three-minute races with Bentham stealing half a length with some aggressive steering. The pressure will be on her today as the coxes fight for the best water over the first mile. The shape of the oars will add spice to the race. Cambridge are dedicated to the new hatchet-shaped blades and will use them whatever the conditions. Some oarsmen say these blades are rowing's holy grail, making boats move considerably faster. Others have discarded them. Oxford have been training with the traditional macon blades but have tried the hatchet in the past couple of days and will wait to see conditions today before deciding - critics say the blades are poor in rough weather. Bowden says the hatchets can make crews faster if used consistently in training, but adds: 'If Oxford think they can just use hatchets on the day, they are making a big mistake.'</p>

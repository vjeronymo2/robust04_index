			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Share plunge fails to stir Tokyo action The Japanese government maintained a cool stance yesterday, after share prices fell to the lowest level for a year because of gloom over the coalition's reluctance to offer an economic growth initiative. The Nikkei 225 index fell by 1,000 points at one stage, recovering slightly to end at 16,078.71, down 647.66 points or 3.9 per cent. That left the index 24 per cent below its mid-September high for the year. Yen bonds rose to a six-year high as investors sought an alternative haven for cash. This morning there was a slightly firmer tone to early trading, with the index up more than 100 points after an hour. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, said yesterday the government was planning no measures to support share prices, in contrast to the previous Liberal Democratic party government, which poured public cash into the market early this year in a temporarily successful attempt to lift prices. 'Supply and demand are up to the market, so we will continue to monitor it,' he said. Senior finance ministry and central bank officials admitted they were worried about the fall in share prices but planned no direct action. 'We will use all means at our disposal, political, fiscal and tax, to help the economy,' said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary. 'The level of stock prices is not something the government should act on directly.' Last week's string of poor banking results and mounting bad debts were factors in the share price fall. There was also growing disappointment that the government has not yet specified a date or amount for an income tax cut, widely believed to be the only way to stimulate depressed consumer spending. The coal-ition is divided on how to fund an income tax cut. 'This is one of those very rare times, once every 50 or 70 years, when monetary policy is not working,' said Mr Richard Koo, senior economist at Nomura Research Institute, referring to Japan's record low interest rates. 'Now it is time for fiscal policy to act.' On average, companies reported a 23 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the six months to September and expect profits to fall by 22 per cent in the full year to next March, the Wako Research Institute of Economics said. Half of manufacturers cut overtime, hired fewer people or reallocated staff in the three months to September, up from 40 per cent the previous quarter, said the Labour Ministry.</p>

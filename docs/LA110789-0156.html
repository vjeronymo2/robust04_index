			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FED SPURS HOPE; DOW RALLIES FOR 14.96 GAIN  </P> <P> Stock prices rallied from a weak opening amid renewed investor optimism that  the Federal Reserve might move to lower interest rates. Wall Street analysts  said the Fed's addition of reserves to the banking system through customer  repurchase agreements sparked an increase in the bond market that helped boost  stock prices.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.96 points to 2,597.13.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 to 7 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 811 issues up, 633 down and 506 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 163.00 million shares, against 135.48 million in  Monday's session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index rose 0.97 to 185.74.  </P> <P> At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index ended at 368.51, down  0.17.  </P> <P> Investors interpreted the Fed activity as an indication that the next move  might involve a cut in the discount rate, the rate the central bank charges its  member banks, traders said.  </P> <P> The yield on long-term Treasury bonds fell sharply after the Fed's move. The  federal funds rate, the interest commercial banks charge each other for  overnight loans, also declined.  </P> <P> Stock prices opened weak then waffled through the morning session.  </P> <P> "It appears that the Fed might be doing a little easing, and that's why the  market has rallied," said Ralph Bloch, chief market analyst with the investment  firm Raymond, James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.  </P> <P> On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 47.34 points on what analysts  said was a response to unexpectedly weak third-quarter earnings reports. The  bleak outlook for fourth-quarter corporate profits and interest rates worries  had also helped depress prices, analysts said.  </P> <P> Last week's better-than-expected unemployment report rekindled worries that the  Fed would not ease credit soon. Investors hope for a decline in short-term  interest rates to revive corporate profitability, analysts said.  </P> <P> Analysts also attributed the day's gains to bargain hunting and technical  factors after Monday's steep declines.  </P> <P> "We were oversold after yesterday," said said L. Crandall Hays, analyst with  Robert W. Baird &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Bond prices were slightly higher in early trading today.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond gained 3/16 point, or $1.87 for  every $1,000 in face value, by around midday. Its yield, which falls when  prices rise, edged down to 7.94% from 7.95% late Monday.  </P> <P> Bond prices got a "little kick" today from talk in the market that Japanese  investors plan to be active buyers of government securities in future U.S.  Treasury auctions, said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith  Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term  government issues rose 1/16 point to 1/8 point, intermediate maturities  increased 1/8 point to 5/32 point and long-term issues were up 1/16 point to  7/32 point.  </P></p>

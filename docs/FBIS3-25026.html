			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Lusaka peace talks may be under way, but the  Marxist, Leninist, and communist Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] government in Luanda  continues to prefer killing civilians. At about 0800 [0700 GMT]  this morning, three MPLA-PT air force combat fighters flew in  from Catumbela air base and destroyed a number of residential  areas in the much martyred city of Huambo. A number of  children, women, and old people were killed.    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] A parachute  system was used to guide the fragmentation and (?precision)  bombs dropped over the city. Those bombs made countless  civilians victims and destroyed the homes of peaceful citizens.  That barbarous operation comes in the wake of the problems in  Bie [Cuito], where on 5 February the MPLA-PT forces broke the  unilateral cease-fire declared by the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. The MPLA-PT air force's  attack on Huambo began at precisely 0815 this morning, shortly  after International Committee of the Red Cross and Caritas  aircraft had left this city's airport. Though there has been no  pronouncement [words indistinct] it is known that such  violations, including air raids, can have a harmful effect on  the humanitarian aid process, which is trying to save the lives  of people in this area.

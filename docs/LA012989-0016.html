			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BACKSTAGE AT 'JEOPARDY!';  </P> <P> TUNE IN FOR THE NERVOUS HOPEFULS, THE HARD-WORKING RESEARCHERS, THE  WELL-DRESSED HOST AND THE AMAZING WINNERS ON THE SMART SET'S FAVORITE GAME  SHOW.  </P> <P> IT IS MID-MORNING on a tape day, and the atmosphere in the "Jeopardy!"  contestant room at Hollywood Center Studios is dawn-before-battle tense.  </P> <P> Susanne Thurber, the show's contestant coordinator, skillfully begins talking  her 14 charges off the ledge. In soothing, maternal tones, she invites the  prospective players, most of them middle-aged men in business suits, to have a  muffin or a bagel. The would-be players make nervous jokes. "I hereby promise  to name my first child Merv," one says with mock solemnity, alluding to  "Jeopardy!" creator Merv Griffin, who developed the quiz in which players  provide the questions, not the answers.  </P> <P> The edgy chatter stops and the candidates are as still as jacklighted deer  while Thurber advises them on how to behave if they are picked to appear on one  of the five shows -- a week's worth -- that will be taped today.  </P> <P> "No swearing if you can help it. We had a lovely lady the other day who kept  saying 'Dammit.' We can bloop it out, but people are usually very good  lip-readers."  </P> <P> Thurber warns the contestants not to think of the dollar amounts they will  accumulate during the game as money in the bank. "They're really points. They  call them dollars, but the only person who is going to go home with any money  is the person who wins."  </P> <P> Most of the people in the contestant room are locals. But a few have come from  as far away as Atlanta and Baltimore. The out-of-towners have invested their  own money to fly here (though on rare occasions a local TV station foots the  bill), and they will pay for their own motel rooms tonight if they are asked to  return tomorrow. "Jeopardy!" offers would-be contestants no material  inducements beyond the odd bagel and, of course, the chance to win money. As  five-time winner Sandra Gore says: "I went on 'Jeopardy!' because I wanted to  win cash. I didn't want to go home with a ceramic Dalmatian and parting gifts."  </P> <P> Thurber guides the players-to-be through a stack of paper work that has evolved  in response to the quiz-show scandals of the '50s and the litigiousness of the  '80s. Candidates swear, among other things, that they are not related to or  conspiring with anyone connected with the show. If they are members of the  Screen Actors Guild or other acting guilds, they declare in writing that they  aren't making more than $5,200 a year at it. They promise not to run for public  office until after their shows, if any, have aired. They promise not to sue.  </P> <P> Most of the people in this room will lose on "Jeopardy!" They don't realize  that yet, but Thurber does. Part Mom, part psychiatric nurse, she gives their  egos a preliminary boost. "We see 15,000 potential contestants a year, and only  400 get to sit in this room. It's something you should all be proud of.  </P> <P> "It's a game," Thurber says, trying once again to reduce the palpable anxiety  in the room. "You should play it like a game and not as if it were a  life-threatening thing.  </P> <P> "Have a good time," she says as she leads her charges downstairs to the studio.  </P> <P> IF GAME SHOWS were universities, "Jeopardy!" would be Harvard. As a video  commodity, it is the second-most popu lar syndicated series in the country,  trailing, but gaining on, Griffin's other wildly successful game show, "Wheel  of Fortune." An estimated 25 million viewers tune in nightly, their numbers  peaking during the show's annual two-week Teen Tournament, which will air in  Los Angeles starting tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. on Channel 13. The annual Tournament  of Champions, during which the year's top money winners compete for $100,000,  and the Seniors Tournament, for players over 50, also draw big audiences.  </P> <P> As a cultural phenomenon, "Jeopardy!" stands alone. Since the demise of  "General Electric College Bowl" in 1970, it is the only game show that a person  with a Phi Beta Kappa key can appear on without a detailed explanation to his  or her friends. In a nation that mistrusts its grinds and eggheads, it is the  sole public forum for Americans who can do the intellectual equivalent of a  slam-dunk.  </P> <P> "Jeopardy!" draws a diverse set of fans. Billy Crystal, Laker forward James  Worthy, Frank Sinatra and Madonna tune in, along with virtually everyone who  ever bragged about his or her SAT scores. The original "Jeopardy!" -- hosted by  Art Fleming, aided by the mellifluous Don Pardo -- ran from 1963 to 1975 and  was briefly revived in 1978-79. The new "Jeopardy!" premiered in 1984 with  debonair French-Canadian Alex Trebek as host.  </P> <P> In the current game, three contestants vie to win cash by answering questions  on subjects ranging from World Geography to Famous Fish. In the first round,  called Jeopardy, the players are presented with 30 clues in six categories.  Each clue is worth $100 to $500. The players press high-tech buzzers to  indicate that they are ready to respond to clues revealed on an enormous  electronic game board. The first person to buzz may answer, framing his or her  response in the form of a question. A sample clue and response, in the category  Four-Letter Words: You can do it to a curfew or a ballerina / What is lift?  Correct responses add dollars to the player's total, wrong responses reduce it.  </P> <P> In the second round, Double Jeopardy, the 30 clues are somewhat harder and are  worth more, $200 to $1,000. Both rounds include hidden Daily Doubles, which  afford players the opportunity to increase their winnings by betting some or  all of their money on the likelihood that they will answer one clue correctly.  To win, contestants must wager shrewdly as well as recall facts. "That's why  it's called 'Jeopardy!' not 'Questions &amp; Answers,' " says David Shear, a  three-time winner.  </P> <P> Finally, the players face Final Jeopardy. They are told the last category, The  Civil War, say, or Fruits and Vegetables. They then wager all, part or none of  their winnings on their ability to get the last question right. Occasionally, a  contestant who is out in front will bungle his or her bet and lose by a single  miscalculated dollar, giving new meaning to the phrase the agony of defeat. The  player who ends up with the most money wins -- an average of $10,000 a game --  and may appear as often as five times if undefeated. The others go home with  "parting gifts" and the knowledge that they have lost in front of millions of  people, including Madonna and Mom. Worst of all, the shows are rerun from time  to time. As Shear says, "It gets on my nerves. I keep losing."  </P> <P> AT A "Jeopardy!" contestant search in Hollywood, 90 hopefuls showed up on a  recent Tuesday morning. Three obstacles stood between them and an appearance on  "Jeopardy!": a written quiz, a practice game and a personal interview. The  written test consists of 50 questions and is revised every three months. Each  question is shown on a television monitor while Alex Trebek's voice is heard  reading it aloud. What building, applicants might be asked, appears on the back  of an American $20 bill? What's the name of the small blue creatures that star  on a Saturday morning TV program? They have 10 seconds to respond, and answers  don't have to be phrased in the form of questions. According to a "Jeopardy!"  press kit, 70% -- or 35 right -- is a passing grade. A show spokesman says the  test knocks out 80% of all comers. Today, 14 are left standing.  </P> <P> After the unsuccessful test-takers leave, the survivors play a mock "Jeopardy!"  game in the empty studio, hitting hotel desk bells instead of buzzers.  Suddenly, the name of the game has changed from Being Smart to Being Fast,  Personable and Smart.  </P> <P> "Our show is not the one where you have to dress like ducks or chickens, or  spin a wheel like some show we know, but we are looking for people with high  energy," counsels staffer Glenn Kagan, who stands in for Trebek during the  practice games. "This is no time to be quiet, shy and retiring," Thurber urges.  "Play as if you were going to get the big bucks today." As they play the game,  several of the plainer prospects blossom in the simulated spotlight, beating  their opponents to the bell and answering authoritatively in question form. A  few others seem to have trouble ringing and thinking at the same time.  </P> <P> At the end of the practice games, half of those who passed the written test are  dismissed. Thurber is especially gentle with this group, who have had their  expectations raised, then dashed. "Come back and try again after three months,"  she says.  </P> <P> The seven victors in the gamesmanship phase of the competition are asked to  stand and give short speeches about themselves. Attorneys, teachers, actors and  other people who speak regularly in public are at a distinct advantage. New  Yorker Bob Verini, a 37-year-old actor /director who won the 1987 Tournament of  Champions, recalls: "I was able to play the kind of person I thought they were  looking for. I tried to be upbeat, articulate but not stuffy, pleasant and kind  of jokey but not a wise guy."  </P> <P> Less than two hours after they arrived, the seven finalists leave the studio  with vague assurances that "Jeopardy!" may call them in the future. They are  all smiling.  </P> <P> AT 48, ALEX Trebek, the salt-and-pepper-haired host of "Jeopardy!" could be an  unusually handsome professor of, say, philosophy, which was his major at the  University of Ottawa. Elegantly dressed by Mr. Guy of Beverly Hills, Trebek  adds a well-read-man-in-his-library presence to the throbbing electronic  "Jeopardy!" set. And Trebek is more than just another pretty suit. He once took  a version of the show's written test and scored a respectable 43 -- 86%.  </P> <P> Trebek has been a quizmaster in the United States since 1973, when friend and  fellow Canadian Alan Thicke recommended him as host for the short-lived "The  Wizard of Odds." Trebek had spent the previous 12 years with the Canadian  Broadcasting Corp., doing news and special events in both English and French  (his Canadian shows included a series devoted to figure-skating). As host of  both "Jeopardy!" and "Classic Concentration," which he also produces, Trebek is  said to make almost $1 million a year.  </P> <P> Every day that programs are taped -- there are 46 such sessions a season --  Trebek studies all the questions and answers that might appear on the five  shows to be produced that day. He reads the material for accuracy and nuance  and verifies pronunciations -- occasionally, he needs to perfect the spin on a  word like ichthyophagous.  </P> <P> During breaks in the taping, he fields questions from the "Jeopardy!" studio  audience. Women want to know his marital status. No, he is not married now. A  six-year previous marriage produced no children, although he has an adult  stepdaughter named Nicky who works as a runner on the show. He lives, with his  mother, in a house in the Hollywood Hills that he helped design and build. And,  no, he does not alphabetize his herbs and spices, as one magazine reported,  although he does hang his light-colored clothes on light hangers and his dark  clothes on dark ones.  </P> <P> Trebek is easy with his audience. "At birth," he tells a recent group,  "Canadian babies are taught to say eh at the end of every sentence." But when  the cameras roll, he is all business ("Let's go to work," he urges players),  except for the occasional, often self-deprecating quip.  </P> <P> It has to be that way, Trebek says. "On 'Classic Concentration,' you can kid  around and use up 5 or 10 or 15 seconds, and you are not materially impeding  the progress of a player toward the solution of a puzzle. Whereas, on  'Jeopardy!' we're trying to cover 61 clues, and we've got to move it. And there  are three contestants. If one has $2,000, another one has $2,000 and the third  one has $100, and I decide I'm going to waste 15 seconds by telling a joke, the  one who has $100 is gonna say, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute. Butt out, Trebek.  I want to earn some money to catch up with these others.' So I can't do that.  You've got to be serious, and you've got be very fair."  </P> <P> Trebek is modest about his role. "The stars of the show are the players -- not  the host -- and the material.  </P> <P> "JEOPARDY!"gobbles up information. With 61 questions and answers per show,  hundreds of fresh facts are needed each week to test the mettle of the players  in the studio and millions who play along at home. The man who feeds the fact  monster is the show's editorial associate producer, Harry Eisenberg.  </P> <P> Eisenberg, a soft-spoken native of Brooklyn who says he sometimes writes  "Jeopardy!" clues in his dreams, supervises a research staff of 13. Five days a  week, staff members are expected to produce a daily quota of three categories  with six clues and answers (five will appear on the show, one is a backup).  Although any staffer can create a category, the work tends to be divided, with  five developing most of the categories and the others doing the requisite  research and proofreading.  </P> <P> "They are free to write anything they want, but they've got to keep the bases  covered," Eisenberg says of his staff. The bases, he explains, are five broad  areas: academic subjects, life style (including religion, fashion and food),  pop culture, wordplay and people.  </P> <P> Although the staff denies playing favorites and keeps no-no lists of well-worn  categories, many observers are convinced that there are certain pet subjects  that frequently pop up on "Jeopardy!" "They love royalty!" says veteran player  Shear, a 40-year-old former journalist from West Los Angeles, who won $24,402  on the show in 1986. "Whenever you see Royalty, you know it's bad news. You  know you're going to put the wrong number after the king or queen. They love  the Nobel Prize! They love the Caspian Sea! They love Leadville, Colo., 'the  highest city in the United States!' "  </P> <P> Other former contestants add landlocked nations and Alexander the Great to the  catalogue of recurring motifs.  </P> <P> Eisenberg, who has been with the show almost five years, has a practiced sense  of what makes for good "Jeopardy!" material. He once taught American history at  a community college in Maryland (he also sold photocopiers), and he says  preparing material for the show is similar to making up a good test. A clue is  never used on "Jeopardy!" with the hope that no one will get the answer, he  says. But, he adds, "you want to reach the point where you can separate the men  from the boys, the women from the girls. Ideally, only one contestant out of  three knows the answer."  </P> <P> Questions are pretested, "round-tabled," by a group of at least five staff  members. The staff tries to make sure that each question is "pinned," its term  for a clue that elicits a single, unambiguous response. Material is also tested  for obscurity. Eisenberg doesn't mind hard, but he doesn't like esoteric. "If  nobody knows an answer except the writer, we throw the question out."  </P> <P> Although "Jeopardy!" categories are summed up in a word or two and the  "answers" posed to the players are never longer than seven short lines, they  are a major factor in the pleasurable buzz that fans get from the show. Like  successful sonneteers and good headline writers, "Jeopardy!" staffers exercise  their creativity within the constraints of an odd little form. Eisenberg  affectionately cites such classic categories as Kings Named Ed and Famous Pigs.  </P> <P> Each of the show's researchers has areas of special interest and expertise, as  well as a basic enthusiasm for pop culture. Kathy Easterling comes up with much  of the material dealing with Shakespeare, royalty, actors and their roles,  dance and celebrity weddings. Perhaps her finest hour was Those Darn Etruscans,  a category she created for the third "Jeopardy!" Tournament of Champions in  1986.  </P> <P> One of her questions had the distinction of tripping up the legendary Charles  (Chuck) Forrest, generally acknowledged to be the Alexander the Great of  "Jeopardy!" players. Forrest, then a baby-faced law student of 25, won five  daily games in 1986. He took his $72,800 and moved on to the tournament. During  that competition, he handily beat his opponents to the buzzer to respond to the  Easterling clue: " 'Fufluns' was the Etruscan counterpart of this Greco-Roman  god of grape-guzzling." "Who," responded Forrest, "was Dionysius?" Later, even  his mother said Chuck should have known better -- the name was Dionysus.  (Forrest won the tournament anyway, adding $100,000 -- the tournament limit --  to his winnings.)  </P> <P> Easterling says she, and most of her colleagues, are fact junkies. "I'm always  tearing pages out of magazines or marking them up with red pen." She keeps a  notebook near her TV at home to record after-hours inspirations. Occasionally,  what looks great in the notebook misses the mark on the screen. Easterling once  fashioned a category, Heads, around the macabre fact that Sir Walter Raleigh's  widow carried the decapitated knight's head around in a velvet bag.  Easterling's clue was: "It's said this man's wife would pull his head out of a  bag and ask, 'Have you met Sir Walter?' " When the clue appeared on the show,  the contestants were silent. "All they had to come up with was his last name,  but they were so stunned they couldn't answer," she says.  </P> <P> Accuracy is a point of honor with the "Jeopardy!" staff. Proofreading of clues  goes on even during taping, when the research staff keeps a close eye on the  game board. Although one show featured the category Oops, acknowledging and  correcting errors that had slipped onto the show, mistakes are rare. "When we  do make mistakes, usually our sources are wrong," Eisenberg says. Such was the  case when the staff identified the University of Mexico as the oldest  university in the Western Hemisphere. Viewers were quick to point out that the  University of Santo Domingo, founded in 1538, is more than a decade older. "We  now have questions double-sourced," Eisenberg says.  </P> <P> The best way to check the accuracy of "Jeopardy!" material is to go right to  the source. Staffer Steve Dorfman once called Buffalo Bob to learn if it was  true that Howdy Doody had 48 freckles, one for each of the 48 states then in  the union; it was. Another staffer, Suzanne Stone, asked the wife of Albert  Sabin to confirm that he had tested his oral polio vaccine on himself and his  family before general testing was done. That, too, was true.  </P> <P> Just as "Jeopardy!" material is vetted for fairness and accuracy, it is also  expected to be in good taste. Easterling recalls that a category was once  changed from Hell to the less offensive Heaven and Hell. On rare occasions,  material is deemed tasteless and nixed. Researcher Frederik Pohl IV recalls an  instance involving the answer: "Rocky Mountain goat, sheep, oyster -- the one  that comes from the other two." Producer George Vosburgh ruled "No way."  </P> <P> ANYBODY WHO ever sat in his recliner shouting answers at the video image of  Alex Trebek thinks he was born to win on "Jeopardy!" Once the couch cognoscenti  make it onto a show, however, the vast majority discover the simple truth of  former contestant Shear's observation: "It's a lot easier to play the game at  home than in the studio."  </P> <P> There's the buzzer, for one thing. Operating the real thing on the set is  something contestants get to do for the first time during a brief tape-day  rehearsal. Learning how to work it is a major stumbling block for some.  Contestants are not supposed to buzz in, signaling their readiness to answer,  until Trebek finishes reading the last syllable of the question. At that  moment, a neon tube that runs around the game board lights up, letting  contestants know they are free to buzz. If they press before the light goes on,  their buzzers are automatically incapacitated for two-tenths of a second. As  Susanne Thurber tells contestants-to-be, "That's not long, but it's long enough  for someone else to ring in or for your entire life to flash before you." (The  pens with which the contestants write their answers in Final Jeopardy also shut  off automatically after the 30-second time limit.)  </P> <P> Chuck Forrest's finesse with the buzzer, said to have been honed on video  games, awed even the "Jeopardy!" staff. A contestant who lost big and wrote  about it later described just how crucial getting the right rhythm can be: "The  beeper! The dreaded beeper! Of the first eight or 10 questions that flashed  before my eyes, I knew about five or six answers. But not once, not once, was I  able to buzz at the right time. It was like intellectual drag-racing, but not  knowing when to gun the engine."  </P> <P> Many of the players who have entered the pantheon of big winners say they spent  weeks, even months, preparing for their shot. In 1988, Sandra Gore was the  first woman to make the finals of a Tournament of Champions (women have  traditionally done better in the Seniors Tournament). Gore, a 36-year-old New  Yorker, began training for the tournament after she won $53,507 on five shows  and retired undefeated. Some players stop drinking or start running before  tournaments. Gore worked on building her stamina. She knew she might play five  games in one day, a real test of how well a player can budget his or her  energy. So she taped "Jeopardy!" shows from her TV each evening, then played  along, five games at a time. "I watched it standing up," she says. She  practiced buzzing in by pressing on a container of dental floss.  </P> <P> Contestants have gone on the show with talismans ranging from a good-luck  fingernail paring to a can of sardines. In case luck was what she needed, Gore  tucked a crystal charm into her purse. She also wore comfortable, flat shoes as  part of her strategy, and finished third in the tournament, adding $13,000 to  her previous winnings.  </P> <P> Mark Lowenthal, the 40-year-old State Department official who won the 1988  tournament, crammed for his appearances. As a safeguard against cheating,  neither "Jeopardy!" players nor staff know what categories are going to come up  -- they are chosen the morning of taping by staff of the Department of  Broadcast Standards at ABC, which provides the service to the syndicated show.  So Lowenthal took a shotgun approach. He filled a little notebook with facts  and bought reference books and underlined them. He learned everything he could  about the presidents, the 50 states, world geography, the Academy Awards,  sports (the category he dreaded), classical music, popular music and TV  (another of his scholarly weaknesses). For good measure, he memorized the  periodic table of elements, the bones of the human body and the site of every  Olympics since 1896.  </P> <P> He also taped shows and played along, not standing up like Gore but often lying  in bed. He practiced with a makeshift buzzer not so much to improve his rhythm  as to teach himself not to ring in unless he knew an answer or could  confidently guess cor rectly. Home players constantly guess impulsively, but,  as Lowenthal notes, "wrong answers are not cost-free on the show."  </P> <P> In the weeks before the tournament, he was visited in the flesh by Forrest, who  had graduated from the University of Michigan after his "Jeopardy!" triumph and  joined the State Department. A mutual friend there arranged a meeting between  the two. Forrest, who recently went to the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia as a  political officer, told Lowenthal that he had studied the show and calculated  that sports turned up only 5% of the time. Lowenthal sighed gratefully.  </P> <P> Lowenthal, who has a Ph.D. in history from Harvard, says he believes that his  six weeks or so of preparation were well worth it. "What all the studying did  was to give me a greater sense of confidence. It struck me as a worthwhile  investment of time, given the potential payoff." Lowenthal won a total of  $149,901 on the show.  </P> <P> Most people who win on "Jeopardy!" are happy, for a time. It's fun to win money  on TV, in front of viewer Frank Sinatra, for an activity that does not require  heavy lifting. Still, while big winners are embarrassed to say so, many feel  that $20,000 or $50,000 or $100,000 is nice, but, as one put it, "it's not  winning the lottery." They are not fixed for life. They might put a "Jeopardy!"  windfall down on a house (one winner called his Casa "Jeopardy!"). It can pay  some of a child's college bills or allow a winner to treat himself to things he  might not otherwise buy. Lowenthal says the only thing he's bought so far is a  rather expensive kaleidoscope that he found at a craft fair. "That's about as  frivolous as I get," he says. "I'm not a high frivol."  </P> <P> Bob Verini, who works part time at a Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Center in  New York City, took the $46,802 he won as an undefeated "Jeopardy!" champion in  1987 and founded the Manticore Theater, a theater company that produces new  plays and neglected classics. "The money allowed me to take my destiny in my  hands," he says. Carlo Panno's life was also changed by "Jeopardy!" Panno was  on the resurrected Art Fleming version of "Jeopardy!" in 1978, winning $6,850  in one show, which was briefly a record. More important, he met Deborah Dean in  the contestant pool. They are married, and Panno now works for "Jeopardy!" as a  researcher.  </P> <P> Strangers come up and tell "Jeopardy!" winners how smart they are. Lowenthal  was recognized recently by another passenger on a small boat during a vacation  in the Coral Sea.  </P> <P> The losers are left with little but their "Jeopardy!" home games and other  consolation prizes. Sometimes they cry; they always remember what they got  wrong. Gore still finds it hard to believe that she couldn't recall Jimmy  Carter when asked in the final Final Jeopardy the names of three of the four  20th-Century presidents who ran for the office and lost (the others were Taft,  Hoover and Ford). Losing on "Jeopardy!" probably isn't as bad as satirist  "Weird Al" Yankovic depicts it in a song that features the voice of Don Pardo  intoning: "That's right, Al, you lost. . . . But that's not all. You also made  yourself look like a jerk in front of millions of people and brought shame and  disgrace on your family name for generations to come."  </P> <P> Thurber treats the losers compassionately, always making it a point to thank  contestants who have lost before they slip out of the studio. In David Shear's  view, "A psychologist could make a fortune counseling game-show contestants who  have lost."  </P> <P> "You have to keep it in perspective," Lowenthal says, unwittingly quoting  Thurber and the "Jeopardy!" credo.  </P> <P> "It's only a game."  </P> <P> BACK IN THE studio on tape day, the games are about to begin. The contestants  have played their practice games and are as ready as they will ever be. The  lights on the game board flash, and the familiar music begins to swell. Thurber  has chosen the players who will go on first. John Lauderdale, "Jeopardy!" stage  manager, shows the three contestants -- one returning champion and two  challengers -- where to wait off-camera for their cues. Lauderdale has put a  wooden booster box behind the podium of the shortest player. In the wings, Alex  Trebek smoothes his gray suit jacket and adjusts his maroon tie. Suddenly  Johnny Gilbert cries, "This is 'JEOPARDY!'. . . "  </P></p>

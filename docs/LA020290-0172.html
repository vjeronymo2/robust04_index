			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACKAGED TO SAVE THE PLANET  </P> <P> Sebastian International did more than sing the praises of its latest cuts and  colors early this week at the Hairdressers' Guild show in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Executives of the Woodland Hills hair-care and cosmetics company put employees  in issue-oriented T-shirts ("Protect the Planet, Protect the Species"),  introduced biodegradable packaging and sealed its commitment to the Rainforest  Foundation with a $50,000 check and a promise of $200,000 more by the end of  the year.  </P> <P> While Sebastian's environmental statement was the most ambitious and  elaborately staged, it wasn't the only one issued during the two-day trade  show.  </P> <P> Aveda Corp., Minneapolis-based makers of beauty products from flower and plant  essences, announced (on recycled paper) that it was a member of the Coalition  for Environmentally Responsible Economies and a sponsor of Earth Day 1990.  </P> <P> Steve Stefano, president of Joico, a Los-Angeles company specializing in  products for damaged hair, reiterated his commitment "to a cleaner, more  healthful environment" and let it be known that his firm had eliminated all  aerosol cans -- at a cost of $60,000 and a potentially significant revenue loss  -- because of dissatisfied customers.  </P> <P> After a demonstration of 1990 hair trends Sunday night at the New Otani Hotel,  Stefano urged his 180 international distributors "to recycle everything you  can" and presented a fashion show of clothing made from newspapers by Canadian  designer Liza Deyrmenjian.  </P> <P> Sebastian's mainstream approach to statement clothing -- two Protect the Planet  T-shirts -- will be sold in affiliated salons across the country. A portion of  each sale goes to the Rainforest Foundation, and a similar program applies to  select Sebastian products in brown paper bags printed with such information as:  "Tropical deforestation is comparable to nuclear war. . . . The continued  destruction of the rain forests . . . at a rate of 60 acres per minute will  lead to flooding, erosion . . . and . . . climate changes world-wide. . . ."  </P> <P> Along with its Rainforest Foundation program, which includes videos, posters  and brochures, Sebastian is making packaging and formula changes that will turn  everything the company sells "earth friendly," according to company president  John Sebastian.  </P> <P> Introducing biodegradable bottles, made from cornstarch and high-density  polypropylene, Sebastian said they were chosen as "the first step forward to  something positive," despite controversy. (The environmentally involved,  including a spokesperson for the California Integrated Waste Management Board,  have expressed doubts that anything, including cornstarch and polypropylene  packaging, can degrade in most landfill conditions.)  </P> <P> In addition, two of the company's most popular products, Hi-Energy Hold and  Hair Gloss, will no longer be manufactured because their formulas couldn't be  made "environmentally friendly."  </P> <P> "The key to the future is being able to form a healthy alliance with a company  like Sebastian" said Jean-Pierre Dutilleux, founder of the Rain Forest  Foundation, noting this was the first alliance between his organization and an  American firm. "I hope this could be the start of a grass-roots movement."  </P></p>

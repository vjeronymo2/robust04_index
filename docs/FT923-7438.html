			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Most CIS alumina plants 'to become uncompetitive' MOST ALUMINA plants in the Commonwealth of Independent States will become highly uncompetitive as the former Soviet Union allows its energy prices to rise to world levels, some western analysts suggest. Only two of the CIS's ten alumina plants - Niklaev in the Ukraine and Pavlodar in Kazachstan - will have any chance of competing with western producers if they have to pay the full cost of energy. Each of these has the capacity to produce 1m tonnes a year of alumina, the raw material smelted to produce aluminium. Total alumina capacity in the CIS is about 5.35m tonnes. Western production last year was 35.2m tonnes. Industry analysts point out that the CIS is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to lift its energy costs as part of the economic reform programme on which further IMF financial aid depends. They calculate that, with full-priced energy, the cost of producing alumina in the CIS smelters ranges from Dollars 220 a tonne to Dollars 400 a tonne. This compares with an average cost of Dollars 120 a tonne in Australia and between Dollars 180 and Dollars 200 in other western countries. Analysts say not one of Russia's alumina plants will be competitive. They are at Pikalevo (300,000 tonnes a year capacity); Volkhov (50,000 tonnes); Tikvin Plant, Boksitogorsk (350,000 tonnes); Bogoslovsk (900,000 tonnes); Kamensk (300,000 tonnes) and Acinsk (1m tonnes). Nor would Ukraine's smaller plant at Saporoshye (250,000 tonnes) or the Kirovabad unit in Azerbaijan (200,000) be economic. Observers point out that the former Soviet Union's aluminium industry was mainly established to satisfy the country's military needs, no matter what the cost. About 75 per cent of aluminium was used for defence or aerospace equipment or related applications. The CIS would also face difficulties if it wanted to import low-cost alumina from western producers to substitute for its own production. Not only is there not enough equipment at the ports or rail cars to handle a big increase in alumina imports, but the material would have to be transported about 5,000 km (3,000 miles) from port to the CIS's most-efficient aluminium smelters in Siberia. This is roughly equivalent to a journey from one side of the US to the other and analysts suggest it would add about Dollars 150 a tonne to the cost of alumina by the time it reached the smelters.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Arts: Tales from the Vienna Woods Enthusiasts for the plays of Odon von Horvath have a rare chance to catch Tales from the Vienna Woods (1931) at the Courtyard, an attractive little cabaret venue near King's Cross, London. Be warned that the performers, from the Court Theatre Training Company, are students, who both overdo and underdo things throughout. But the locale is ingeniously deployed, and a few of the actors (notably those playing Marianne and her father) let you forget that you are seeing student actors. And Horvath's play, which takes all the romance of Vienna and punctures it point by point, is a vintage piece of modernist theatre. 'The Comedians' Lyric Hammersmith, London, until July 24. 'Tales from the Vienna Woods' The Courtyard, London N1, until July 9</p>

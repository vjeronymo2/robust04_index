The proposed amendments are consistent with these objectives in that they ensure that the restrictions contained in Rule 104.13 are appropriately applied to accounts that benefit the persons subject to its provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> B.

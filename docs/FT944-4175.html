			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Micro-budget The chancellor's chosen method to compensate for the income lost through abandoning additional VAT on fuel was almost the least damaging available. The worst option would have been to take the money from contingency reserves; cutting next year's public expenditure was probably politically unviable, given the tightness of the spending negotiations; and increasing business taxes risked damaging the corporate sector's recovery. Instead, raising duties on tobacco, alcohol and petrol has proved politically and economically seductive - politically, because it punishes the Conservative rebels for blocking VAT on fuel; economically, because the additional duty is inflation friendly: the duties will increase the retail price index by only 0.26 per cent compared with the 0.43 per cent the higher VAT on fuel would have produced. The chancellor, however, did not select the best option economically. He could have raised the money without any inflationary impact if he had increased direct taxes, for example by not indexing allowances. This would have significantly boosted his chances of achieving the challenging target of keeping underlying inflation below 2.5 per cent during the second half of the parliament. Perhaps he is betting that brewers, tobacco groups and petrol companies will be forced by the acute competition in retailing to absorb the increases rather than pass them on to consumers.</p>

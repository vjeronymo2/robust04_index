			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Books: Caught in the critical act SIGNS OF THE TIMES: DECONSTRUCTION AND THE FALL OF MAN by David Lehman Andre Deutsch Pounds 19.99, 318 pages SIGNS OF the Times is the title of an essay by Thomas Carlyle which David Lehman has appropriated for his attack on Deconstruction in general and Paul de Man in particular. One of the 'Signs of the Times' which worried Carlyle was the rise of what he called 'theory' and the decline of 'wonder'. For 'theory' substitute 'Deconstruction' which means, literally, what it says, ie the critical act of taking apart or dismantling a text or cultural phenomenon - what we used to call 'analysis'. Why then is Deconstruction so admired by some and feared by others? Because the assumptions underlying this kind of analysis are totally different from those of the critics we admired in the past - for example, IA Richards, FR Leavis, Cleanth Brooks and Lionel Trilling. They believed that a literary text had meaning in relation to life as we know it and that one piece of literature could be more valuable than another. Deconstructionists believe no such thing. Though it has become so fashionable in the US, Deconstruction is a French phenomenon. Its fundamental iconoclasm goes back to the literary revolution of 'Ubu Roi' and 'Dada'. Existentialism was part of this same general movement, the last manifestation of which was the upheaval of the 1960s when French students manned the barricades and French thinkers drew on the linguistic theories of Saussure and the anthropological studies of Levi-Strauss to formulate the doctrine of Structuralism. Roland Barthes and others maintained that the ideas within a particular text or 'structure' - sometimes called 'pictures' or 'signifiers' - had relevance only to other signifiers. Reference to a 'meaning' outside the text or to someone laughingly called 'the author' was old-fashioned and 'humanistic'. Post-structuralism and its latest manifestation 'Deconstruction' took these ideas a stage further. For the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and the philosopher Jacques Derrida the reading of a text was a purely subjective, rhetorical act. Allowing the 'free play' of signifiers implied that the critic could assert that a piece of literature meant anything he liked - a heady prospect indeed. In Britain, Deconstruction has not yet got the hold it has in America, except for the example of Christopher Norris who, as Frank Kermode pointed out, has never shown the slightest interest in literature unless it could be fitted in to a philosophical or political argument. Kermode should know. He used to hold a special seminar on the new French ideas at University College, London, in the 1960s and when he was Regius Professor ar Cambridge bravely defended McCabe against the Fogies. But he eventually became disenchanted, as his current writings show. Geoffrey Hartman, Deconstruction's most influential proselytiser at Yale, scathingly refers to Kermode as a 'public critic', whereas he sees himself as a 'learned specialist'. Just so. Hartman, J. Hillis Miller and, until 1983, Paul de Man, have been kings of the castle at Yale, sending shock waves through other universities, and pouring out reams of jargon-filled prose which graduate students in search of jobs struggle to understand. Imagine the consternation, therefore, when in 1987, four years after de Man's death, a Belgian researcher discovered in the archives of Le Soir 180 articles written for the paper when it was under German direction during the Second World War. And who, pray, you may ask, was Paul de Man that he should cause such a furore? De Man was a young Belgian intellectual who emigrated to the US after the war. While a teacher at Bard College he married (bigamously) one of his students. The extraordinary ability shown in his writing got him a place in the Society of Fellows at Harvard and he ended up as Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale. In his day he was far more influential than Hartman, for he had not only a powerful intellect but also something of the elegance of Derrida. David Lehman is right to sound the alarm, but it would have been more helpful to play down the caddishness and perfidy of de Man and concentrate on the main issue. The fact is that a number of influential academics in America have propounded theories which are being used by activists to further the cause of 'political correctness'. But there is worse. Indifferent to literary values themselves, there are many who maintain that any old piece of rubbish is as valid as great art because a lot of people prefer the rubbish. In the past dedicated teachers tried to open the eyes of those who had little or no awareness of the nobility of literature. They believed, with William Faulkner, that at its best literature helped man endure by reminding him of 'the courage and honour and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past'. Tocqueville warned us not to let democracy debase cultural standards and Julien Benda spoke of la trahison des clercs. Neither could have had any idea of the seriousness of the problem we are now facing.</p>

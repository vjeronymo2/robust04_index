We now welcome Dr. Ben Ngubane of  the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and a minister in the kwaZulu  Government. Good evening to you, sir, and welcome.    [Ngubane] Good evening.    [Mashokwe] Dr. Ngubane, is this an effective unilateral  declaration of independence by the Zulus or not?    [Ngubane] Well, if His Majesty wanted to do that, he could  have called us into the Legislative Assembly, sat on his throne,  and declared us independent. What he was talking about, and it  is very clear even in the shots that you played just now, that  he was reaffirming the right of the Zulu nation to its kingdom,  to its monarchy, to its territory. And this is what he was  saying, that we will continue to fight for this. We will not  give up. We will not accept the present constitution because it  destroys the very essence.    [Mashokwe] But then is there intent on the part of the king  to finally declare UDI?    [Ngubane] Well, if there was there would be nothing wrong  with that either.    [Mashokwe] But is there?    [Ngubane] Well, I cannot speak for His Majesty. He speaks  for the nation, but the Zulu people value their sovereignty,  they value what is God-given to them, in terms of territory,  political structures, and institutions. They do not want to  see...[pauses] We do not want to see that swept away and being  made, the future of the Zulu nation being made to be dependent  on the decisions of a provincial legislature that is still to be  elected.    [Mashokwe] Who is supposed to decide? South Africans sat  together in the World Trade Center, sorted out how many regions  we are going have, spent hours talking about the new South  Africa. This demand, though belated, seemed to pose a threat in  that if the Zulu people don't get it, according to His Majesty,  then they must be prepared to fight for it.    [Ngubane] Well, Leslie you will remember that we had to move  out of the World Trade Center on the 2 July because when we put  the argument for the form of state to be decided as a  preliminary matter we were refused the chance to debate this  issue. That debate would have clarified all these issues that  are coming to the fore now. We were refused and steamrolled  because people did not want to accept that there are realities  that will have to be taken into account when we write a new  constitution.    [Mashokwe] I'm trying to understand exactly where we are now  in South Africa. The Zulu monarch almost declares UDI, or his  intention to do so if he does not respect the new dispensation  -- then where are we headed for?    [Ngubane] Well, now is crunch time. Now we are facing the  real truths, the reality of this country, not the euphoria  created by the press around the World Trade Center happenings,  not the attempted universalization of the population of this  country. We are facing the truth that we are composed of  different nations, different groupings, and all their  aspirations and wants must be taken into account when we write a  new constitution.    [Mashokwe] Where are we headed for now?    [Ngubane] Well, there is still mediation going on. We are  still carrying on with mediation which will actually restructure  and help establish proper negotiations. There is still time to  resolve these issues amicably. His Majesty made it very clear  that he wishes for a peaceful and negotiated restoration of the  Zulu kingdom.    [Mashokwe] Is that the cardinal point? If you don't get that  restoration then the Zulus must not take part in the elections  as he says?    [Ngubane] Well, Leslie, let's put it this way. If you do not  eat, you die. There is no choice in that. If we do not get our  sovereignty and a proper place within southern Africa, our  nation will die. I mean, there is no choice in that matter. We  have to face the issue squarely and....    [Mashokwe, interrupting] It's almost like you saying either  give it to us or we are not part and parcel of the new  dispensation. Then what about the consequences that may follow  from that kind of thing?    [Ngubane] Leslie, we are saying -- we are not even asking  for  it to be given to us. We are saying -- we are a nation, we have  a monarchy. Take us as we are and then let us decide how all  these things will be accommodated in the new South Africa.    [Mashokwe] You are almost dictating terms in a situation  where people are supposed to be negotiating about the future.  Is that being reasonable?    [Ngubane] We tried to negotiate at the World Trade Center;  we were refused that opportunity.    [Mashokwe] No, you walked out there....    [Ngubane, interrupting] Well, because we were not being  given  a chance. We were going to be steam-rollered and overwhelmed.  At the end we would be held responsible as spoilers, and so on.  We refused that. Now we are saying, South Africa, face up to  the reality of the situation. Mediation is offered, let  everyone accept that mediation, and let's find a solution.    [Mashokwe] Are you still aware of the fact that there is a  division within the Zulu peoples themselves? At yesterday's  meeting, for instance, one of the chiefs there said things like,  they are not going to obey the king. Is the king not meddling  in political matters?    [Ngubane] His Majesty put it very clearly in his speech on  Friday. He wants a democratic kwaZulu/Natal region, a  democratic kingdom where there will be pluralism in politics, in  economics, and in social life. He has never indicated that he  will not tolerate different party-political formations within  the kingdom. We shall be a kingdom like Britain is, or like  Belgium is.    [Mashokwe] But that's not on offer, Dr. Ngubane. At the  moment we're talking of a dispensation that says the king will  have a role to play in the new dispensation, and not necessarily  a monarchy. [Constitutional Development Minister] Roelf Meyer  made this very clear yesterday.    [Ngubane] We don't need Roelf Meyer to offer us our  sovereignty or our nationhood. All we are saying is that they  must accommodate this reality. Let's sit around the table and  see how we'll all work together.    [Mashokwe] But not all the people in the Natal area or  kwaZulu area are in agreement with this. Even the Zulus  themselves are divided on this issue. Is the king not dividing  his people here?    [Ngubane] No. Listen, we are talking here of a state  structure, of a state formation that existed before conquest by  the British and annexation to Natal. This is not dependent on  the wishes of individuals. It is the state structure of the  Zulu nation, so some Zulus may differ and have different  political opinions or belong to different parties. This is not  the issue. The issue is that we have a king, we have got  political institutions and structures that characterize the  kingdom and the monarchy, and those are the things that we stand  firm on -- their being sovereign, their right to....    [Mashokwe, interrupting] That does not answer the question  on  the fact that the Zulu people are divided. There was one very  senior person from the monarchy who said they are going to defy  the king. Is the king not meddling in politics, Mr. Ngubane?    [Ngubane] Leslie, you surprise me. Look, in any nation there  will be different political parties, and people will be free to  choose which party they support. This is not relevant to this  issue under discussion.    [Mashokwe] It is, absolutely, in the sense that, Dr.  Ngubane,  you are dealing with Zulu-speaking people in that territory who  are expressing a view different from what the king is holding --  which is said to be Inkatha-inclined, by the way.    [Ngubane] By the way, do you mean to tell me that if I form  a  party--XYZ party--I have a right then to say the monarchy must  be abolished? I could never have such a right. I would be  crazy, unless I was an insurrectionist wanting to wage  revolution and so on. There's no way I can demand that an  institution like the monarchy....[pauses] No one has the right  to do that. It is God-given, it was created by history.    [Mashokwe] You have not yet addressed yourself to the  question I asked you, about the divisions in the Zulu people.    [Ngubane] There is a division, because they belong to  different political parties.    [Mashokwe] Dr. Ngubane, President de Klerk's offer to the  IFP  and the kwaZulu government -- could it not be tested to make  sure that it at least affords you an opportunity to come into  the fold, as it were?    [Ngubane] Well, I'm not sure whether you are aware what the  details of that offer were, because....    [Mashokwe] Tell me about it, if you want to.    [Ngubane] Well, I'm not entitled to do that, but if you  looked at the details of that offer it would mean that the IFP  was becoming inconsistent. The reason we are not taking part in  this election is that we have been opposed, ever since  negotiations, to a two-phase transition process. We've been  opposed to allowing a constituent assembly in which the majority  party determines what the future constitution of the country is  going to be. This has not changed. Despite the amendments that  were effected early this year, it has not changed that central  issue that we'll be going to the polls to elect a majority party  to write its own constitution.    [Mashokwe] Is there still hope, Dr. Ngubane, of the IFP  coming into the elections?    [Ngubane] Well, there's no time for that. It would mean  substantive changes to the constitution, amendments, and making  the constitution properly decentralizing in its nature. There  is no time for that.    [Mashokwe] The IFP will not take part in the election?    [Ngubane] It cannot take part, because there is no chance  for  us to do that.    [Mashokwe] What about allowing other people, then, freedom  of  political activities in your areas? We've had cases -- last  week Saturday, for instance, this morning in the Durban area as  well -- where your people effectively barred the ANC people from  making use of a stadium.    [Ngubane] Well, when you say, your people, I'm not sure  whether you are talking....    [Mashokwe, interrupting] IFP people.    [Ngubane] No, those were Zulu people. They could have been  any number of Zulu people, not necessarily a political party.    [Mashokwe] You're not disowning them, are you?    [Ngubane] I'm not disowning them. They are my fellow men, my  fellow nationals. Sure, they are royalists, they were demanding  that the king's demands must be respected. Now this is a local  thing. I mean, you cannot blame my party for that, the IFP for  that. If people feel strongly about things, they do things.  Certainly, we would like to avoid anything that disrupts peace  and free political activity. It has never been our policy to  bar parties from operating freely.    [Mashokwe] But you're barring them from holding their  meetings in the Durban area. Local or national, the fact of the  matter is it has happened, Dr. Ngubane.    [Ngubane] Leslie, I've just told you. That was not a Central  Committee decision. It was not a party decision. If people in  the Durban area feel so strongly about an issue -- and we don't  even know, I mean, the details of it yet. We still need....    [Mashokwe] You're copping out, Dr. Ngubane. Can we just face  the fact. All reports have indicated that those people were IFP  people, and you're saying to me now that I should believe that  those people were not your people?    [Ngubane] Well, Leslie, you know, in this country there have  been numerous examples where people at the local level have  taken initiatives. One or two probably may don the uniform or  an insignia of a party. That does not mean that the party is to  be held responsible. I mean, we've seen this with ANC members  getting involved in violence, with other parties getting  involved in violence. You cannot then go and blame the party.    [Mashokwe] OK. Talk to me about the De Klerk offer. There  is a suggestion that you were of heart to join the national list  of the NP [National Party].    [Ngubane] Well, what De Klerk offered was something to our  president and to our party, and we rejected that because....    [Mashokwe, interrupting] What did he offer?    [Ngubane] Well, I cannot discuss this. I am not mandated to  discuss it.    [Mashokwe] But could it not have helped you to jump in?    [Ngubane] No, it would not have helped. It would have been  absolutely negative, because we would have been contradicting  our own principles.    [Mashokwe] Does it not in any way suggest to you that the  king's position would be looked into after the April elections?    [Ngubane] But that's not good enough. I mean, how do you  establish a government and then say, we are offering you a  chance, when already it's a fait accompli? The king told  President de Klerk that he hoped that his demands and his  aspirations will be attended to before elections, so that when  the elections happen or the final settlement happens everyone is  at home with what has been agreed. This has not happened.    [Mashokwe] You're not saying to me that even with the  international mediation the IFP will still not see its way clear  to join the election at a later stage, for that matter?    [Ngubane] I cannot see how you can now have results that can  allow such a process when it is so late in the day. We asked  for mediation way back, as far back as December. It was never  taken up. It's only taken up very recently, and even then  there's been a lot of dilly-dallying. We have not even  assembled the mediation team. That's still going to have to be  finalized and wrangled over. So there's just no chance. I  mean, our president stated very clearly that if the things that  we proposed in our document of 19 December, the substantive  changes to the constitution, were accommodated, that would open  the way to elections. But the whole process has not allowed  that to happen.    [Mashokwe] Talk to me about the third force. You're once  again in another Inkatha-gate scandal, having been said to have  received guns from these majors and generals. Would Inkatha  care to say, yes, we did it?    [Ngubane] Well, I've never heard, even on a single occasion  in the Central Committee, such a plan being discussed. If, as  happens in this violent country, people resort to their own ways  of surviving, we cannot be held responsible for that. But as a  party....    [Mashokwe, interrupting] You're not condoning it, are you?    [Ngubane] I'm not condoning it, but I'm talking of a  reality--that there's violence all over the place. We hear  horrendous stories about Transkei handling shipments of arms  from Angola, and supplying them to MK [Spear of the Nation; ANC  military wing] cadres, training APLA [Azanian People's  Liberation Army] and other agencies. We hear of all these  things. There's so much going on, we'll need everything to be  properly investigated.    [Mashokwe] OK, but then already De Klerk has decided to  suspend the generals because of the seriousness of this matter.  Here we see a leader of the IFP in Transvaal, Mr. Themba Khoza,  being implicated. What steps could we expect from you to show  your concern about this whole matter?    [Ngubane] But surely this thing, we expect it to be  investigated, that evidence will be led, the truth will come  out, then we'll decide what to do -- I mean, if he is found  guilty. But you cannot say...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] You can't actually suspend him, Dr.  Ngubane?    [Ngubane] Now? Suspend him on a mere rumor?    [Mashokwe] Goldstone investigated this matter. And on the  basis of the initial submissions, President De Klerk has seen it  fit to suspend these generals -- an act of statesmanship.    [Ngubane] Listen, I'm not saying that the judge should not  investigate these things. He should investigate all the causes  of public violence. That is his mandate. What I'm saying is,  I'm not going to jump on the throat of a colleague because he is  accused -- which may be false, which may be true -- until I have  the evidence that it is true. What would our followers say that  we jump on our colleagues and we say nothing to Goldstone about  him investigating Transkei, General Holomisa, for instance, and  all these shenanigans? Why are those things not being  investigated? After all, Ciskei is going to be a participant in  the elections. Let Goldstone also investigate those people, let  us see the whole picture, the holistic picture, then we can all  trust that fairness is being done. At the moment we are not  confident that fairness is being done. We think that our party  is being singled out for smearing, our party is being castigated  all over the world. This has happened before, and we see it as  just another follow-up in that typical pattern.    [Mashokwe] Rumors of an alleged assassination plot against  ANC President Nelson Mandela shelved a historic meeting between  himself and King Goodwill Zwelithini at Ulundi on Friday. The  turn of events also interrupted proceedings in the kwaZulu  Legislative Assembly, which began its annual sitting on Friday.  Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi slammed the rumor of the alleged  assassination plot as an attempt to destabilize kwaZulu. He  also criticized the government for what he called subversive  strategy to turn kwaZulu into another Bophuthatswana.    To get clarity on this matter, I have on the line from  Durban  Mr. Jacob Zuma from the ANC, and still with ne in the studio is  Dr. Ben Ngubane from the IFP. Good evening to Mr. Zuma, and  welcome. Could I get your reaction to the discussion we've had  before, mostly on the issue of free political activity in your  area?    [Zuma] Leslie, we have had a lot of discussions in relation  to the issue of free political activity at all levels. We have  been engaged with the peace structures. We have been engaged  with the IFP bilaterally. We have discussed with the monitors  who are down here. However, we are quite concerned with the  recent developments around Durban here, because it does seem  that that principle is going to be undermined, judging from the  conduct of the supporters of the IFP in the recent....    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Why do you call them supporters of  the IFP, Mr. Zuma?    [Zuma] I have been told they are IFP, and supporters of the  IFP as well.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Ngubane, you wouldn't agree with the fact  that  the IFP is engaged in a set-up of disrupting ANC meetings in  that area, would you?    [Ngubane] Well, that would be contrary to our positions. We  are engaged with the ANC in very delicate negotiations, even on  the question of mediation. We would be the last ones to order  such a thing, I mean. But as I say, it is a problem. It's  symptomatic of the problem that we are having in this country,  where a lot of emotions are intensifying and, you know, people  are taking law and action to themselves without referring to  their party hierarchy. That I cannot rule out, but I am saying,  as far as I know, it is certainly not an IFP intention to do  this.    [Mashokwe] But if the IFP people are doing it, does that  then mean it is not an IFP thing?    [Ngubane] No, no. If we were given names -- I mean, you  know, given names either through the dispute resolution  committees and such other mechanisms, then there is something to  work on.    [Mashokwe] OK. Mr. Zuma?    [Zuma] I would like to clarify this question, in particular  the incident that took place at Umlazi. Clearly the IFP was  involved in that one. They were the ones who said they were  going to occupy the stadium to prevent the ANC supporters and  ANC members to gather at the stadium in a rally. After that  incident I happened to have a chat with an IFP member, who  actually gave me the reasons why they decided to do so. That  one I cannot doubt, because it was indicated to me quite  clearly. The incident currently taking place at kwaMashu, it  was reported to me, these were IFP members. But when I had a  telephone conversation last night with [IFP National Chairman]  Dr. Frank Mdlalose, he then informed me it was the people of the  community, although there would be Inkatha members, but they  were there as a community. That's why I advisedly at the  beginning said the supporters and the IFP members. But there  was this very specific information in regard to the Umlazi  incident.    [Mashokwe] What do you do, Dr. Ngubane, if presented with  these facts?    [Ngubane] Well, certainly it will be discussed in the  Central  Committee, because it will be a fairly serious state of affairs  and a serious allegation. We will look at the individuals  involved. We will talk to their regional committees or their  branches where they come from. I mean, there are all sorts of  processes that will be set in place.    [Mashokwe] OK. Mr. Zuma, was Mr. Mandela's safety  guaranteed, his venue, on Friday when he was supposed to be with  the king?    [Zuma] Certainly, as you'd know, Leslie, we had worked very  hard for this meeting because we believe it is important that a  meeting between the president of the ANC, Nelson Mandela, and  his majesty the king is critical in the circumstances, and we  made all the agreements and arrangements. As we were preparing  to proceed to Ulundi, we first heard the announcement that there  was an invitation to a lot of people to come and join the  meeting.    [Mashokwe] Was that not part of the prearrangement?    [Zuma] No, that was not arranged. There was, of course -- I  must indicate this -- there was an indication which could have  meant this one, which was in the letter written by the chief  minister when we were finalizing the arrangement, the letter  that said the meeting that was to take place on Friday was no  longer like the old arrangement kind of meeting that was  supposed to take place between the president of the ANC and His  Majesty the king. It would now...[pauses] Because of the issues  that had been raised publicly by the president of the ANC, an  interest had been generated among the royal family members, the  amaKhosi, and other subjects of the king. There was that  indication in the letter. There were no details as to the  extent of the meeting. My own impression then was that perhaps,  instead of a meeting with two small delegations, you would have  a bigger delegation from his majesty the king's side. That's how  I understood it.    [Mashokwe] OK, Mr. Zuma, hold it right there. Dr. Ngubane,  those AK-wielding people who came to the meeting surely do not  pose any form of safety for Mandela's visit in Ulundi?    [Ngubane] Well, I didn't see them except on the screen. The  police were there, so, you know, really, it's a matter beyond  me, beyound, you know, a member of government. Obviously  anything that may lead to public violence has got to be curbed  and dealt with. I regret, and President Dr. Buthelezi has  regretted, the fact that President Mandela couldn't come to  Ulundi, because it would have been a very important step in the  further evolution of a negotiated settlement.    [Mashokwe] OK, but if you say you didn't see them, Mr.  Ngubane, then it does give weight to the fact that they could  even have shot without you having seen them. If you didn't see  the AKs that everybody saw, what safety could then be guaranteed  for a Mandela visit in Ulundi?    [Ngubane] What I'm getting at is, we have seen occasions  here, gatherings, be they ANC, be they IFP, where people have  brought in dangerous weapons. It is the duty of the security  forces to deal with this. I do not think it was impossible for  the security forces to handle that situation.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, the SAP [South African Police], kwaZulu  Police, SADF [South African Defense Force] were invited. Was  that not enough security then?    [Zuma] Yes, there was an indication when we raised the issue  with the IFP leader, Dr Frank Mdlalose, the national chairperson  of the IFP, there was an indication that preparations had been  worked out to ensure that security was handled appropriately.  But of course there were a number of reports that came to our  head office from different points and corners, pointing to the  danger which made our head office feel that it was not advisable  for the president of the ANC to proceed to the meeting. We then  proceeded to request a postponement or a change of venue.    [Ngubane] Well, you know, a visit by Dr. Mandela to Ulundi  is  a historic and momentous event. It is impossible to expect  people not to take an interest in coming to this. Obviously the  type of meeting we had has been held before -- in discussions  with the state president in Pretoria, even in Durban, where  people go to accompany His Majesty. At the end of the  discussions His Majesty comes out and addresses them about the  conclusions reached. This has happened on several occasions, so  there was nothing strange about that. It is just unfortunate --  and I must repeat, we regret very much that the meeting could  not take place. As for the future, I cannot see how you can  prescribe to His Majesty that he should tell the Zulu people,  don't accompany me when I'm going to meet a prominent statesman  of this country; stay at home. I cannot see that situation.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, the ANC must be smiling to the bank now  that revelations have been made of the third force. The IFP is  implicated, of course. What can you tell us?    [Zuma] Well, Leslie, you know that for a long time now the  ANC has made a claim that this violence in this country had a  third force operating and manipulating it. We have said the  reason that agreements that are forged at the political level,  the reason that they are not implementable is because there are  forces behind the scenes that manipulate the violence.  Everybody has said to us: You are making false claims. Of  course, we have said this because we knew and because we had  information. But, of course, as long as our information was not  investigated or verified by a respectable judge, it was easy for  people to dismiss what we were saying. Even when there were  cases like the Trustfeed case, where police were in fact  investigated, charged, and convicted--still people undermined  this particular area. I think it is clear now that what the ANC  has been saying is actually the truth.    [Mashokwe] Right. Let me get Dr. Ngubane to react again to  this issue, and ask my production team to play in the insert  which shows that IFP people, Zulu people, were carrying these  AK-47s, which, we have reason to believe, might have come from  the very generals.    [Ngubane] Well, Leslie, I must object very strenuously to  your blanket statement that the IFP is involved. Individuals  may be involved, but not my party.    [Mashokwe] OK, IFP members then.    [Ngubane] Well, we don't know about that. We must still find  out about it. But I want to come back to what Mr. Zuma has just  said. Who has killed more than 400 IFP office bearers? Surely  someone has killed them, and I'm not sure whether I can just say  it's the third force and leave it at that. Who started SDU  [self-defense units] and armed them in the townships? It was  Msholozi's organization that did that. Who brought the culture  of violence and people's war?    [Mashokwe] Let me get the team to play the insert, Dr.  Ngubane, while you talk.    [Ngubane] No, but I am saying, you know, this is very  simplistic to then suddenly apportion blame to us as being  responsible for violence in this country.    [Mashokwe] Let's watch that tape. OK, while we wait for the  tape to roll, we have to go back to you. Mr. Zuma, your people,  your organization cannot claim to be angels.    [Zuma] I haven't said the ANC claims to be angels. I think  it is a well known fact that there's been a conflict in this  country, and one of these areas has been the conflict between  the IFP members and ANC members. Nobody denies that fact. What  we have persistently said is that there is a third force that  manipulates, that controls and directs violence, that ensures  that weapons are supplied, are bought, are circulated. This is  the point we are making. My statement does not necessarily say  ANC people have not been involved in violence.    [Mashokwe] But have they received these arms from the  police,  as Inkatha is said to have received them?    [Zuma] The ANC members have not received weapons from the  police. The police have always seen the ANC as the enemy.    [Ngubane] I don't even know how true [it is] that our  members  have received weapons. We still need proof of this. But  nevertheless I am saying, let us not be simplistic. Let's look  at the violence for what it is, a monster that it is, and deal  with it not in a way that gains oneupmanship for one party  against the other. To deal with the matter in this manner makes  cooperation in stemming the violence impossible. Let is look at  what it is. If there are people who are guilty of wrongdoing,  let the law take its course.    [Mashokwe] OK. I must mention that we had invited the  generals together with General Johan van der Merwe of the SAP,  and the generals who are implicated in this whole third force  issue, and they have failed to turn up. We have not even heard  from the minister of police, who was invited to be part and  parcel of this discussion. Let's continue, gentlemen. The IFP  is implicated, obviously; Themba Khoza is a leader of the  Transvaal IFP. Is IFP....    [Ngubane, interrupting] But I am refusing to accept this  type  of judgmental statement. It has been alleged. It's not proven  yet, you know, and really we believe that a man is not guilty  until proven. Now why are you judging the IFP so harshly?    [Mashokwe] I'm not judging it. All I'm saying is in a  question form: The Goldstone Commission has identified a Mr.  Khoza as being one of the recipients of these things.    [Ngubane] Well, you know, again I must say, until proven I  cannot go by that statement. Nevertheless, how many other  people are receiving weapons in this country?    [Mashokwe] Two wrongs do not make a right.    [Ngubane] I agree, but I'm saying until we address the whole  thing from a holistic perspective we are going to be fiddling on  the sides of the problem, at the periphery of the problem.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, your situation down there -- free  political activity and these guns that we see around. Would you  be able to be campaigning in that area?    [Zuma] Leslie, it is clear that we are faced with a serious  situation here in Natal, and I think decisions that have been  taken at the multiparty negotiating forum need to be implemented  here. I don't think we can delay those decisions any longer. I  think the events of the past two weekends are an indication of  this fact. You must know that people here in Natal are  determined to participate in the election. They want to do so  free and fair, without intimidation, and I think....    [Mashokwe] Right, let me get back to Dr. Ngubane. I am left  with one second. Dr. Ngubane, people want to participate. Are  you going to stop them?    [Ngubane] No, we are not going to stop them. We will tell  them why we are not participating in this poll.    [Mashokwe] On that note, Dr. Ngubane, Mr. Zuma, thanks for  talking to us and giving us your time.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Sharp fall reported in hotel management pay AVERAGE SALARIES for managers in the hotel and catering industry have fallen sharply in the last year as companies fighting the recession have replaced older management staff, Michael Smith, Labour Correspondent, writes. A survey by the British Hotels Restaurants and Caterers Association and Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, found that average salaries for hotel, restaurant and catering managers fell 7 per cent from Pounds 14,191 in 1990 to Pounds 13,144 last year. The association said the findings indicated that senior management jobs were going to junior managers with lower remuneration expectations. The survey showed that, below management grades, pay levels already considered poor in comparison with other industries had risen relatively little on average. Live-out staff on weekly wages in hotels and restaurants won on average a 3.7 per cent increase from Pounds 142.83 in 1990 to Pounds 148.14 last year. This compares with average rises in manufacturing towards the end of last year of 5.5 per cent, according to the Confederation of British Industry, and much higher increases at the start of the year. Live-in staff in hotels and restaurants won rises last year of 10.2 per cent, taking the average to Pounds 139.66. Wages and Salaries Survey, BHRCA, 40 Duke Street, London W1M 6HR. Pounds 13 BHRCA members and Pounds 30 non-members.</p>

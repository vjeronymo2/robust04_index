			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Substantially the Same Shareholders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the interim rule, the requirement that shareholders of the bank acquire ``substantially the same share interest'' in the newly formed bank holding company would be met by proposals in which the shareholder or shareholders who lawfully control at least 80 percent of the shares of the bank at the time the notice is filed would acquire, immediately after the reorganization, at least 80 percent of the shares of the holding company in substantially the same proportion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By the terms of Section 319, allowance is made for changes in shareholders' interests resulting from the exercise of dissenting shareholders' rights under State or Federal law. Accordingly, under the interim rule, a shareholder of the bank will be considered to have substantially the same proportional interest in the holding company (notwithstanding a change in the percentage of shares controlled by the shareholder) if the shareholder interest increases, on a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  basis, as a result of either the redemption by the bank or bank holding company of shares from dissenting shareholders, or as a result of the acquisition of shares of dissenting shareholders by the remaining shareholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, this notice procedure would not be available in cases in which any shareholder or group of shareholders acting in concert would, following the reorganization, own or control 10 percent or more of any class of voting shares of the bank holding company unless that shareholder or group of shareholders was authorized, after review under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)) by the appropriate Federal banking agency for the bank, to own or control 10 percent or more of any class of voting shares of the bank. Similarly, this procedure is not available in cases in which the exercise of dissenting shareholders' rights would cause a company that is not a bank holding company (other than the company in formation) to be required to register as a bank holding company. This procedure also is not available for the formation of a bank holding company organized in mutual form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board seeks comment on other alternative formulations consistent with the statutory mandate that the reorganization involve substantially the same shareholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Financial Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 319 also establishes certain financial thresholds that must be satisfied to qualify for the abbreviated notice procedure. In particular, the bank to be reorganized must, at the time the notice is filed, be ``adequately capitalized,'' as this term is defined in section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1831o. In addition, Section 319 requires that the bank holding company resulting from the reorganization meet any ``capital and other financial standards'' established by the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the interim rule, the Board has established three requirements designed to identify reorganization proposals that do not raise financial or supervisory concerns that would benefit from review and explanation through an application process rather than an abbreviated notice procedure. Under the interim rule, a proposal to form a new one-bank holding company would qualify for the abbreviated notice procedures established in Section 319 if: (1) The bank has received at least a composite ``satisfactory'' rating at its most recent examination, in the event that the bank has been subject to examination; (2) the amount of debt that the bank holding company would assume at the time of the reorganization, and the proposed means of retiring this debt, would not place undue burden on the holding company or its subsidiary on a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  basis; <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  and (3) at the time of the reorganization, neither the bank nor any of its officers, directors or shareholders is involved in any unresolved supervisory or enforcement matters with any appropriate Federal banking agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a banking organization with consolidated assets, on a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  basis, of less than $150 million (other than a banking organization that would control a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> de novo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  bank), this requirement would be satisfied if the proposal would comply with the Board's policy statement on small one-bank holding company formations (12 CFR part 225, appendix C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 319 provides that this abbreviated notice procedure is only available to a bank holding company that would not acquire any additional banks or any nonbanking interests as part of the reorganization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

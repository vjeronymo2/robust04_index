			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: TIME FOR A 'HEALTHY SUMMER' PLAN  </P> <P> Vacation time spells freedom from work, and this casual, carefree attitude may  stretch into our diets as well. In today's "What, me worry?" atmosphere,  caution and concern about health are sacrificed on the altar of the great god  of leisure.  </P> <P> "I work so hard the rest of the year," goes the thinking, "that I deserve to  gratify my every wish for these few weeks. Besides, what harm can it do?"  </P> <P> No harm at all -- if you don't mind letting your health slide and your  waistline spread. But don't expect us to take the killjoy role and warn you  against breaking the rules. Au contraire: If you're determined to enjoy  absolute freedom from sound nutrition during a vacation, here are some  suggestions to help you get the job done right.  </P> <P> Forget regular meals. Who needs the hassle of planning and cooking? Encourage  your family to eat on the run. Stock the refrigerator with cold cuts, snack  foods and soft drinks. You'll never have to sit down together at a regular  meal; you can all gobble at different times. Try to eat out a lot, too,  grabbing frankfurters, colas and ice cream at the ballpark or beach.  </P> <P> If you must cook, make it a thick, juicy steak or a grilled hamburger layered  in cheese, rather than chicken, which requires somewhat more time to prepare.  </P> <P> Fresh vegetables abound in summer, which is way too much work on vacation. Even  frozen vegetables take time to heat up, so don't bother. If the family screams  for a side dish, pass a bowl of potato chips. And why serve fresh fruit for  dessert when store-bought cookies are so much easier?  </P> <P> If you're taking a trip with loved ones, stop as often as possible at fast-food  eateries. You'll be able to eat your fill of fat, sugar and sodium-laden foods  such as fried chicken and fried clams, hamburgers slathered in catsup and  pickles and thick shakes. There's nothing like a load of calories consumed at  high speed to bring a family together.  </P> <P> And speaking of traveling with kids, one way to keep them quiet in the car is  to fill their little mouths with sticky sweets and candies. This practice is a  great money-saver too, because if you stuff them enough they'll be too bloated  to eat anything when you sit down at a restaurant.  </P> <P> Restaurants, by the way, are a great place for throwing nutritional rules out  the window. Don't forget to eat all the bread and butter they provide, and  order twice as much food as usual because, hey, it's your vacation and you're  supposed to be having fun, not worrying about little things like your heart or  your weight.  </P> <P> But let's not confine ourselves to eating. Those hot summer days are the  perfect time to drink up. It's true that low-fat milk and icy fruit or  vegetable drinks are just as refreshing and more nutritious than soda, but who  wants to play safe? Any old stick-in-the-mud can have low-calorie iced tea,  coffee with skim milk, or plain or sparkling water with a twist. But a real bon  vivant can guzzle down two or three gin and tonics or four or more cans of soda  in the course of an afternoon.  </P> <P> At that high-calorie rate, you must be having fun, right? And you can double  the thrill by eating nuts or chips hand-over-fist along with drinks.  </P> <P> Now let's not forget one of the most important guidelines of all: relaxing.  Vacation means rest, so don't even think about exercising. If any misguided  friends suggest taking a bicycle trip, playing tennis or swimming laps, tell  them to take a hike -- without you. Make yourself comfy, lie back on the couch  or hammock and drift into never-never land. On your sacred vacation, walking to  the refrigerator is all the physical labor you need.  </P> <P> On the other hand, maybe relaxing really isn't your style. If you're cut from  more energetic cloth, our advice is just the opposite: Don't relax. Ever. And  don't let your family relax, either. Drag them on a sightseeing trip and make  sure you see everything, even if it means hustling. Night flights are nice, and  they put everyone in a good mood. Long car trips are great too, especially if  children are small.  </P> <P> Whatever you do, make sure the pace never slackens, because why did you come  all this way if you weren't going to get the most for your time and money? And  no whining, please. This is your vacation.  </P> <P> What? None of the above sounds appealing? Then forget it all and follow a more  sensible path. Because rest assured, you can have a happy holiday without  putting health on hold and paying a price later.  </P> <P> Question: A friend insists that her chronic fatigue results from a yeast  infection. In response, she follows a somewhat odd diet and avoids refined  sugar and alcohol. Can you tell me about this?  </P> <P> Answer: Called by at least three names -- "yeast connection," "candidiasis  hypersensitivity" and "the missing diagnosis" -- this concept gained popularity  as an explanation for chronic fatigue in two popular books of the early 1980s.  </P> <P> Besides chronic fatigue, the "syndrome" includes a laundry list of symptoms  from headache and lethargy to skin rashes, muscle aches, tearing eyes and  bloating. It's also used to account for a variety of genito-urinary symptoms,  among them vaginal burning and itching, prostatitis and even impotence. The  long-term use of antibiotics is often singled out as the root cause.  </P> <P> Many scientifically indefensible "treatments" have been offered at clinics  specializing in treatment of the alleged problem. These include various dietary  manipulations and, predictably, dietary supplements.  </P> <P> In a recent study of 100 individuals with chronic fatigue, conducted by  investigators at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, eight  believed their problem to be related to a "yeast connection." Their physical  symptoms and laboratory profiles did not differ from the 92 others who came  with a complaint of "chronic fatigue." Three of the eight thought they had an  active candida infection. But in all cases, tests for the presence of the  fungus were negative.  </P> <P> The upshot? Yeast infections do occur, but evidence that chronic fatigue is  related to Candida albicans is lacking. Alleviation of the problem, along with  uncomfortable symptoms popularly ascribed to a yeast connection, is best left  in the hands of a competent physician.  </P> <P> Q: Can you straighten me out about which fruits and vegetables need to be  blanched before they are frozen?  </P> <P> A: In general, vegetables are blanched and fruits are not. Peppers and tomatoes  are exceptions to the vegetable rule and can go into the freezer as is.  </P> <P> The purpose of blanching is to inactivate enzymes and prevent other chemical  reactions that impair flavor, texture and color even at very low temperatures.  Blanching also helps remove air from tissues, making it possible to pack a  greater amount of vegetable into a small space. But with fruits, the adverse  effect on flavor and texture make blanching impractical. However, using sugar  syrup with ascorbic acid added to it helps prevent browning.  </P> <P> Blanching is usually accomplished by pouring boiling water over the vegetables  and letting them sit for a short period, and then quickly reducing the  temperature by immersing vegetables in cold water to stop the cooking process.  Blanching time varies from one vegetable to another. To ensure top quality,  follow directions carefully.

Did that idea ever pan out?  </P> <P> A: The idea hasn't been disproved, but it has been modified. It's now 15 years  since Norwegian researchers first reported that after taking cigarette smoking  into account, the rate of lung cancer was one-third less among men whose  Vitamin A intake was estimated to be above average compared with those with  below-average intake. In that study, effects of preformed Vitamin A were not  considered separately from those of carotenoids found in dark green vegetables  and in yellow fruits and vegetables, which the body can convert to Vitamin A.  </P> <P> Carotenes do more than function as precursors of Vitamin A. They can also act  to prevent undesirable reactions in the body. Several years later, the first  follow-up study among the Norwegians confirmed that the protective effect  against lung cancer was linked to carrots and other vegetables, with an added  contribution from milk, which contains both carotenes and preformed Vitamin A.  Since then, other research has shown similar links.  </P> <P> A different type of investigation, so-called case-controlled studies, have  compared dietary intakes of individuals with and without the disease. Again,  the generally consistent observation is that carotenoids -- but not preformed  Vitamin A -- exert a protective influence.  </P> <P> Using yet another approach, levels of beta carotene in blood samples that had  been collected for other purposes were estimated. Levels in individuals who  later developed lung cancer were lower than in those who didn't develop it. But  whether the beneficial link is with carotenoids themselves or with some other  factor associated with carotenoids is uncertain. Some controlled studies in  which some subjects are given beta carotene and others are given a placebo are  currently under way. Results of these studies should shed light on the  relationship.  </P> <P> It appears that the link is to something in fruits and vegetables, especially  those rich in carotenoids. A good case can be made for eating them in generous  amounts. But remember that any protective effect pales compared to what you get  by avoiding smoking.  </P></p>

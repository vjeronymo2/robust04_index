			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Danes split evenly over Maastricht treaty LESS THAN a fortnight before Denmark holds a binding referendum to approve or reject the Maastricht treaty on European union, the most recent opinion poll has indicated that 41 per cent of voters are against the treaty. According to a Gallup Poll published yesterday, only 39 per cent of Danes are firmly in favour of the treaty while the remainder are not likely to vote or are still undecided. The Gallup Institute points out that the gap between those against the treaty and those in favour is so narrow that statistically the difference is not significant. This is the third Gallup Poll this month and all three have shown a small majority in favour of rejecting the treaty. Denmark will be the first of the EC countries to approve or reject Maastricht, and only one other country, Ireland, will be holding a referendum.</p>

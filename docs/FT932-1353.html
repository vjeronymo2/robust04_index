			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Plan to shift News at Ten under attack A MAJORITY of the 15 regional ITV companies are to be asked by the Independent Television Commission to explain why they are proposing to move News at Ten to an early evening slot. Mr David Glencross, chief executive of the ITC, wrote yesterday to a number of companies asking why they have backed such a decision in spite of proposing in their bids for new franchises that the flagship news programme retain its traditional place. The ITV Network Centre - the ITV programme commissioning organisation - confirmed yesterday that at the ITV broadcasting strategy conference in Sutton Coldfield this week there was a unanimous decision to move News at Ten. A recommendation will go before the next ITV council meeting on July 5 with 6.30pm the preferred option. At least eight companies backed the status quo in their bid documents, some with qualifications. They are: Carlton, London Weekend, Anglia, Meridian, Tyne Tees (now part of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees), Scottish, Westcountry and Channel. Carlton, one of the main supporters of a News at Ten at 6.30pm, suggested in its application document that News at Ten should stay in place this year and implied this would remain sensible in the medium term. In the long term it reserved the right to change the schedule in the light of changing circumstances. BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the BBC, is expected to announce record profits next week. It is believed that pre-tax profits for the financial year to April have doubled to about Pounds 10m. More importantly for the corporation, BBC Enterprises has been able to invest about Pounds 60m in programme-making. This is an increase of nearly a third on the previous year. Under the overall control of Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general, all commercial activities of the BBC are being co-ordinated on a worldwide basis to maximise profits. Profits from the Enterprises offshoot, the businesses of which range from programme sales abroad to publishing magazines such as the Radio Times, go towards BBC programmes. Its successes include Michael Palin's Pole to Pole series, with more than 500,000 hardback books and about 100,000 double videos sold.</p>

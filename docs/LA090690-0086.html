			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTBALL '90;  </P> <P> GET SMART: PLAYER OF '90S MUST MAKE THE GRADES;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: AS ACADEMIC STANDARDS INCREASE, POTENTIAL RECRUITS' CLASSROOM  PERFORMANCE WILL BE AS IMPORTANT AS THEIR PLAY ON THE FIELD.  </P> <P> It's a foregone conclusion that the prep football player of the 1990s will be  bigger, faster and stronger, but the biggest difference of all, according to  coaches, is that he will have to be a lot smarter if he wants to move on to the  big-time college level.  </P> <P> No one knows for certain what the collegiate academic minimum will be for  incoming football players in 1999, but the guess is that it will be well above  the current 700 minimum Scholastic Aptitude Test score and 2.0 grade-point  average.  </P> <P> Douglas S. Hobbs, a political science professor at UCLA and chairman of the  NCAA's Academic Requirements Committee, said increasing standards are a sign of  the times.  </P> <P> "But let's not get anybody worried," Hobbs said. "Any change would allow for  plenty of lead time."  </P> <P> Lead time or not, USC football Coach Larry Smith said that increased academic  standards are already having a pronounced effect.  </P> <P> He said he is no longer able to recruit borderline student-athletes, and there  is growing pressure from his peers to recruit players with higher grade-point  averages and SAT scores.  </P> <P> "Because of all the Prop. 48 casualties in California, I've been forced to do a  lot of my recruiting out of state," Smith said. "With all the talent here, I  should never have to do that."  </P> <P> Not all the concern comes from college coaches as the focus shifts from an  athlete-student to a student-athlete.  </P> <P> "I monitor how all of my players perform in the classroom," said Harry Welch,  the coach at Canyon High. "If there's a problem, I make them come into my  classroom for tutoring before school and on their lunch breaks. As a teacher,  you have to be concerned about their progress. And as a coach, it's a  necessity."  </P> <P> Welch learned the hard way. In 1982, his first year at Canyon, nearly half of  his starters were declared ineligible before a playoff game. The Cowboys went  on to lose.  </P> <P> The situation infuriated Welch and he decided to take an active role in  players' academic affairs. He hasn't had an eligibility problem since.  </P> <P> Even at traditionally strong academic private schools, such as Loyola and  Crespi, athletes are increasingly taking advantage of counselors and tutors who  help them balance sports and college preparatory courses.  </P> <P> Although most school districts have long followed eligibility standards that  require athletes to achieve a C average, it was the NCAA's adoption of  Proposition 48 in 1986 that helped increase academic awareness among high  school athletes. Under Proposition 48, incoming student-athletes must score at  least 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, 18  </P> <P> points on the American College Test and maintain a 2.0 GPA in 11 core courses  to be eligible.  </P> <P> In the past, athletes who didn't meet those standards could receive a  scholarship as freshmen, but they lost a year of eligibility. That rule changed  last month with the adoption of bylaw 14.3, which does away with partial  qualifiers. Now, unless a student-athlete meets Proposition 48 requirements, he  or she won't be able to receive an athletic scholarship.  </P> <P> Although GPAs, SAT and ACT scores haven't improved for incoming college  freshman since Proposition 48 took effect, athletes appear to be more  academically aware. They're fulfilling their core requirements in English,  math, natural science and social science and taking the college entrance exams  earlier and more often, according to high school coaches.  </P> <P> "I think the day of the 'dumb jock' stereotype is over," said Fred Strock,  associate athletic director of academics and social services at UCLA. "It's  becoming harder and harder to be a dumb jock and maintain eligibility.  </P> <P> "Parents have become much more involved in the whole process. Parents want to  make sure their kids get into college, and I see them taking a much more active  role in their child's education."  </P> <P> Local recruiting specialist Dick Lascola said academics is one of the first  criteria he evaluates when judging potential recruits.  </P> <P> "There's legislation this year in the NCAA to cut the amount of football  scholarships," Lascola said. "With increasing competition for scholarships,  grades become even more important to the college coach. Grades have always been  a criteria, but now it's more important for a larger majority of the schools."  </P> <P> While academics might be the chief difference in the player of the '90s,  increased size, speed and a broader knowledge of the game will also be  trademarks.  </P> <P> Size is a noticeable difference. When Lascola started evaluating football  recruits in 1976, he said he would look at linemen that were 6-feet-2 and  bigger. Now he rarely bothers unless they're at least 6-4. Two of the top  linemen prospects in Southern California this season are Montclair Prep's  Donovan Roy, who is 6-6, 280 pounds, and Temple City's Matt Gilmour, who is  6-5, 220.  </P> <P> Other positions have been affected, too. El Toro's Rob Johnson is generally  regarded as the top quarterback this season, and he is 6-4, 210.  </P> <P> The trend toward "bigger is better" is expected to continue as coaches  emphasize weight training. Weightlifting took off in the 1980s, and there is  hardly a football program around that doesn't have all of its players on a  rigorous training schedule.  </P> <P> Fontana Coach Dick Bruich has his players in the weight room year-round, and if  they don't lift, they don't play. Loyola Coach Steve Grady puts his best  players in a special weightlifting club, which meets at 6 a.m. three days a  week in the summer. Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle used to drive his players to a  gym in Long Beach to lift weights in the 1950s, but now the school has one of  the biggest weight rooms in the area and a strength coach to monitor the  program.  </P> <P> "When you're stronger you can do more things," Vollnogle said. "You have less  injuries and you can use more force. Weightlifting really changed a lot of  elements of the game. We'll continue to look for new lifting techniques to keep  getting stronger."  </P> <P> Getting bigger does not mean that players are getting slower, however. Coaches  have been careful to mix speed workouts with weight-training sessions. Lascola  said a defensive lineman who is 6-7, 250, won't get many scholarship offers if  he runs a 40-yard dash in 5.6 seconds. This year's top defensive line recruit,  Pat Riley of Marrero Shaw High in Louisiana, runs the 40 in 4.4. Most of the  top prospects run under 5.0.  </P> <P> Southern California's top running back, Napolean Kaufman of Lompoc, is the  defending state champion in the 100 and 200-meter dashes and runs the 40 in  4.4. He long jumps 24 feet and has great hands. Although he is only 5-9, he can  dunk a basketball. Kaufman also returns punts and kickoffs and plays defensive  back.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes knows athletes like Kaufman are the difference  between a mediocre team and a contender. That is why Los Alamitos' players  spend plenty of time working on agility drills. A program consisting of  long-distance runs, sprints and jumping drills is religiously followed. It is  not uncommon to see Los Alamitos' players running backwards up a hill near the  school.  </P> <P> "If a kid comes to Los Alamitos as a freshman and he's 5-11, 165, he'll be  5-11, 190, as a senior if he sticks with football the whole time," Barnes said.  "He'll leave here a much better all-around athlete."  </P> <P> Barnes also happens to have one of the most wide-open offenses in the area,  utilizing a sophisticated passing attack. He built it around former quarterback  Todd Gragnano, who graduated last year after a banner career. Barnes said his  players learned the system quickly and he expects them to handle even more  knowledge in the future as the game becomes more complex.  </P> <P> "The game is getting better because the coaching is getting better," Barnes  said. "We also can do more things because the staffs are bigger and the players  are smarter. They're watching more football on television than they used to, so  they've seen more things done. By the time we get them, they're better prepared  than they used to be."  </P> <P> Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson has some of the most talented players in  Southern California. Since many of the school's students come from affluent  families, they often are able to afford first-class training.  </P> <P> Mater Dei freshman quarterback Justin Vedder is no physical giant at 5-6, 140,  but after three years of intense training at the Performance Institute in  Anaheim, Vedder is receiving a lot of attention from the coaching staff. He  will start on the freshmen team this season and Rollinson said he has a chance  to make the varsity next year.  </P> <P> "He's got a bullet for an arm," Rollinson said. "He's also very mature for his  age."  </P> <P> At the Performance Institute, Vedder was put on a special training schedule  catered to his physical abilities and desires.  </P> <P> The Institute is owned and operated by Marv Marinovich, the father of USC  quarterback Todd Marinovich. Todd often has been referred to as "Robo QB"  because his athletic career has been so well planned by his father.  </P> <P> Vedder, 15, did not lift weights and run up mountains at the Institute, but  instead worked on things like developing peripheral vision, flexibility, muscle  balance and nutrition.  </P> <P> "What we are is a school that teaches people how to do things like eat, run and  coordinate their busy schedules," Marinovich said. "We also do psychological  testing. Our center is not for the everyday average guy who wants to  participate. We're geared toward the serious athlete who wants to be tops in  all areas."  </P> <P> Increased competition is forcing the player of the '90s to take advantage of  new training techniques, such as the one Marinovich uses. Although the  Performance Institute is the only one of its type in Southern California,  Marinovich said he expects several more to open in the area in the next few  years.  </P> <P> Players already are spending more time practicing and preparing for games.  Major programs demand that players train year-round, taking advantage of  intense conditioning programs, spring drills and summer passing leagues. Many  top players limit their athletic participation only to football. The demands  probably will increase with time.  </P> <P> "It's a sign of the times that to excel past the high school level, you have to  spend 12 months training for a sport," USC's Smith said. "The competition is  fierce."  </P></p>

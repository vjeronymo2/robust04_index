			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (20): Mobile office still awaited - In-car communications EFFECTIVE management is all about marshalling facts quickly, easily and accurately and about using them to make strong and reasoned decisions. Over the past few years, most large organisations have constructed computer-based information systems which ensure that managers get these facts delivered to their desks. But what happens when they are away from the office? The answer for the most part today is that they do not receive the same level of support. And for managers who spend a lot of time out and about this can be a severe handicap. Comet, the electrical retailing group, is one of the first companies to address the issue. It recently signed a deal with computer maker Zenith for high-performance 386 notebook personal computers each equipped with an internal modem. The object of the exercise is to equip the company's field managers with the means to find out key performance information about the branches for which they are responsible from wherever they may be. 'We never had any problems with the management information available to us in the office, but that information was not getting to managers in the field,' explains Mr Tim Walker, manager of Comet's information centre. 'The laptops give our managers direct access to our mainframe computer. They can check stocking levels, sales performance, budget targets, credit turnover, etc. They can then use the information to either tell a store they are visiting that day to buck up and do better or to congratulate them on their success.' The first phase of the project still uses ordinary fixed telephones as the communications medium. 'Our managers can usually find a handy telephone socket,' says Mr Walker. 'We wanted to get something in as quickly as possible and we decided that the ordinary telephone network was more stable.' The cost premium of mobile telephones was also considered too much. 'What we have now does 90 per cent of what we are looking for, and at quite a reasonable cost. If we wanted to add mobile communications it would have multiplied the costs,' says Mr Walker. Despite the undoubted success of the cellular telephone, one area of mobile communications which has consistently been a disappointment has been that of data transmission. The mobile office, where the car is equipped not only with a mobile telephone but also a fax machine and a networked personal computer, despite many promises, has never materialised. Not long after the launch of cellular telephones in the UK, representatives from both network operators, Cellnet and Vodafone, were predicting that data would soon account for a significant part of their traffic. It was suggested that as many as 5 per cent of cellular users would use their mobile telephones to send and receive data. In the US, too, expectations of cellular as a medium for data communications were high. But in both countries the actual results have been disappointing. In the US, fewer than 100,000 of the country's 8m mobile telephone users transmit data via their cellular lines. In Britain, the number of cellular telephone owners using the mobile telephone systems for data is even lower. 'The problem with today's data communications via cellular networks is the time it takes to set up a link,' explains Mr David Proctor, British Telecom's general manager responsible for cellular radio. Cellular radio networks are organised for voice communications, where a conversation can last minutes or even tens of minutes. In many common data communications applications, all the communicating is done in seconds, sometimes just fractions of a second, says Mr Proctor. 'It can take 15 seconds to set up a link and just a few thousandths of a second to transmit and receive the information: that just doesn't make sense,' he says. Few doubt, however, that there is a demand for mobile data solutions. For field service people, it could provide a valuable link into the office's extensive technical resources, improving productivity. For sales, it could provide a significant boost to competitiveness. And for many managers and professionals, it could allow them to work where before they would have been forced to be idle. In recognition of this as-yet largely unsatisfied demand, and conventional cellular's shortcomings, a number of dedicated radio networks are being planned or built which will be capable of supporting data communications. In Britain, Dowty and Hutchison have launched mobile data services and Ram is planning to do so. Dowty's Cognito service was launched last August and now claims some 1,000 users. Ram also has a similar number of users including British Airways on a trial basis but is not expecting to launch its system officially until the end of this year. Hutchison officially launched its system last month. Even cellular looks like it may be given a new lease of life as a wireless data communications medium. In May, computer giant IBM joined nine of the leading US cellular network operators to develop a data communications service which exploits the idle moments of airtime between voice conversations. The group believes data rates of up to 19,200 bits of information a second can be achieved; on a par with the best fixed network dial-up modems. The new pan-European mobile telephone system, GSM, also promises to improve significantly mobile data facilities via cellular because of its shorter call set-up times, high data transmission rates and digital format. Terminals especially designed to take advantage of mobile data communications are now becoming available. Last year, US computer manufacturers IBM and NCR and Japanese electronics giant Canon all introduced laptop computers with built-in radio data communications facilities, for example. With so many of the previous promises of the mobile office coming to nothing, however, it is understandable if users have become more sceptical about any new claims made by the industry. It may even be in the industry's interest to allow users to sort out their applications first, then start looking for technologies which will allow them to best implement those applications. 'Mobile data has always been treated as a product sale when it should be seen as an applications-driven sale,' says Mr Proctor. 'There are lots of opportunities (for industry) but I think we've got to start with the application and work backwards.' Mr Walker agrees. 'Right now we want to concentrate on things like the breadth of information available and the variety of people using it. Then we may start to look at making the system fully mobile. But that won't be for some time yet,' he says.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Observer: Retirement cure-all For a privately-owned company with an annual turnover of Pounds 16m, Efamol, maker of evening primrose oil, seems to have no difficulty adding big names to its letterhead. A few years back Sir James Black, the Nobel prize-winning scientist who discovered two of the world's best-selling drugs, joined the board. Now it has recruited Sir James McKinnon, Britain's gas regulator. It is not every day that Britain's regulators take up non-executive directorships and if they do, one would normally expect to have heard of the company they are joining. However, Sir James, who is two years from retirement, says that he first heard of Efamol - short for Essential Fatty Acid Molecules - through its chairman Sir Ian Morrow. Like himself, Morrow is a former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. Sir James is not some healthy medicine freak. Nevertheless, he is clearly excited by the potential of some of the drugs under development. It seems that Britain's scientists are leading the race to find natural cures for diseases. He hopes he has something to add on the commercial side. Who knows, he may even have an eye on taking on the chairmanship when the 70-year-old Sir Ian eventually decides to stand down.</p>

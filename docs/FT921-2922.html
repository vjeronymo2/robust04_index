			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Dnestr leaders crack down on opposition The leaders of Moldova's breakaway Dnestr republic cracked down on opposition yesterday, threatening to expel dissidents, Reuter reports from Moscow. A state of emergency means anyone helping the Moldovan authorities will be expelled from the Dnestr region, Itar-Tass news agency said. Moldova refuses to recognise the self-styled republic, which borders Ukraine on the east bank of the Dnestr river. The ethnic Russian minority in the east of Moldova declared the breakaway Dnestr republic in September 1990 over fears that Moldovan efforts to unite with neighbouring Romania would make them second-class citizens.</p>

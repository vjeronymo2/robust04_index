			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila </F> Yermakova]    [Text] Moscow 6 May TASS -- "We should proceed immediately  to forming CIS peacekeeping forces," chairman of the  Commonwealth Inter-parliamentary Assembly Vladimir Shumeyko said  today.    He told a press conference in the Federation Council that  some 15 thousand Russian servicemen are now engaged in  peacekeeping actions. This is a heavy burden for Russia, but  some politicians accuse the country of imperial ambitions,  Shumeyko said.    According to him, it is necessary to build peacekeeping  forces which comprise representatives of all Commonwealth  countries. This view is shared by parliamentarians of a number  of the Commonwealth states. Shumeyko said this would reduce  wrong ideas concerning Russian troops in public mentality and  dispel allegations about Russia's intervention in the internal  affairs of the Commonwealth member-states.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. JURIES DON'T MIRROR POPULACE, OFFICIAL SAYS  </P> <P> The official in charge of assembling jurors for Los Angeles courts said juries  here do not adequately reflect community diversity.  </P> <P> "We are doing well in terms of (reflecting diversity) in race, gender and  ethnicity," said Raymond F. Arce, senior director of special operations for the  Superior Court, "but not well with respect to age and economic status."  </P> <P> Arce said the system is drawing more and more heavily from the ranks of the  middle-aged and from the ranks of government, public utility and large  manufacturing firms. He said it is drawing less heavily from the young and old,  and from those who work in trades, as unskilled laborers, or for small firms.  </P> <P> In Orange County, however, Jury Commissioner Alan Slater said juries in the  county do reflect the community, which tends to be on the older side.  </P> <P> "There may be times when one panel of jurors does not meet the cross section of  the whole community. But that does not mean the whole selection process is  flawed. We have been extremely fair," Slater said.  </P> <P> But in Los Angeles, the trend, the official said, is "a little bit frightening"  in light of the long-standing public policy that jurors should reflect as many  different points of view in the community as possible.  </P> <P> It is most evident in the longest trials, lasting half a year or more, where  panels tend to be dominated by government employees -- particularly, for  reasons that are not clear, postal workers. In the Night Stalker case, for  example, Arce said 24 jurors and alternates were selected and of them eight  worked for the Postal Service, seven worked for other government agencies and  four worked for utilities.  </P> <P> Arce said he fears that the trend toward loss of different perspectives could  spread to more routine cases as the number of small employers who do not pay  their employees for jury service grows.  </P> <P> The reason for the skewing in the longest trials is that government agencies  and some of the largest firms pay employees their salaries for as long as a  trial lasts. Most private firms won't pay at all, however, and those that do  typically pay for only up to 10 days -- the traditional minimum length of jury  service. Prospective jurors who say they cannot afford to serve on the $5 a day  the county pays are routinely excused.  </P> <P> As a result, Arce said, "if it weren't for the fact that . . . government,  aerospace, insurance companies (and large manufacturers) . . . were . . .  subsidizing the system, there would be a serious breakdown."  </P> <P> Arce said he fears that workers for these employers could also wind up  dominating shorter, more routine trials as the percentage of the work force  employed by large firms declines. The average trial in Los Angeles Municipal  and Superior Courts lasts eight days.  </P> <P> Arce pointed to a survey completed this year for United Way, which found that  smaller businesses -- defined as those with less than 50 employees -- now  account for 95% of all businesses in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "As a rule," Arce said, "businesses with less than 50 employees do not provide  employees with (paid) jury service leave."  </P> <P> In addition, Arce said that paid jury service benefits "disappeared long ago  from many collective bargaining agreements," resulting in financial harships  for prospective jurors drawn from ranks of organized labor.  </P> <P> He said these benefits were generally eliminated in return for wage hikes, and  that because courts have been widely viewed as "insensitive" in making good use  of juror time, there has been no rush to try to win them back.  </P> <P> People with menial jobs -- such as washing cars or busing tables -- rarely show  up, he said.  </P> <P> Arce said that "unless we devise some sort of plan for making sure that all  areas participate . . . it's going to be an exclusive group that is serving."  </P> <P> He said possible solutions include legislation that would require employers to  pay workers while they serve on juries, or creation of a public fund to pay  them.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lily Eng in Orange County contributed to this article.  </P></p>

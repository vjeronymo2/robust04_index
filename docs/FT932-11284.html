			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: A Greek tragedy in the making  -Worldwide water / Supplies in Athens may dry up VASSILEIOS Grivas, deputy director of the Athens water company, points to a precipitous dip on a chart showing reservoir levels in central Greece. He says: 'The decline in rainfall is so pronounced over the past six years that we're outside all the statistical patterns. We have to assume the worst.' The prospect that the city's water supply might dry up completely before the end of 1993 is focusing Greek minds on water conservation in an unexpectedly dramatic way. From the early 1980s, the Mornos reservoir, 190km from Athens, covered almost all the capital's water requirements, estimated at about 1m cu metres daily. But a run of dry winters, together with rising consumption in suburban districts and losses from an ageing distribution network, has shrunk reserves to an all-time low. Grivas says: 'It didn't help that people got wasteful, turning on the hose to wash the terrace. Water prices stayed low and there was an illusion that the Mornos was a boundless resource.' At around 80 litres daily, per capita water use in Athens was still low by comparison with northern European cities. However, since the water company sounded the alarm in January, announcing sharp price hikes for large domestic users, consumption has dropped by almost 30 per cent. After another dry winter, Athens now survives on water from a drilling programme that draws up to 400,000 cu metres daily from subterranean aquifers. However, water quality has suffered, while there are fears that pumping from aquifers, some underlying densely inhabited areas where groundwater contains pollutants, could lead to contamination of drinking water. Contractors working on a Dr50bn (Pounds 149m) dam project to divert water from the Evinos river, in central Greece, into the Mornos artificial lake have been offered a bonus to complete the job ahead of time, but there is little likelihood that it can be finished before 1996. Tenders are already out for shipping water in tankers to Athens from southern Greece later this year, using springs that are taxed in summer to augment water supplies to islands overrun by tourists. While the water crisis in Athens makes headlines, policymakers have ignored the drain on resources from steadily increasing demand by farmers for irrigation. Yet agriculture accounts for more than 70 per cent of water consumption in Greece, compared with about 12 per cent for domestic use. High EC support prices for crops needing irrigation, such as cotton and maize, encouraged Greek growers to switch from traditional products. Moreover, with politicians unwilling to risk losing votes by charging farmers for water, irrigation costs were kept artificially low. The result has been a steady drop in ground water levels, leading to increasing salinisation in intensively cultivated areas such as the Thessaly plain in eastern Greece. 'The situation is made worse because there's no co-ordinated policy on water resources in the countryside. Each municipality is responsible for its own drillings, so you may find several tapping independently into the same aquifer, with potentially disastrous results,' says Vassilis Katsoupas of the Worldwide Fund for Nature's Greece branch. The official solution for Thessaly is a controversial project to divert up to 30 per cent of the Acheloos river water flow from western to eastern Greece. However, opponents of the Dr83bn project, which also calls for the construction of two dams and four hydro-electric power stations on Acheloos, say the diversion will dry out wetlands around Messolonghi on the western coast, a breeding ground for rare birds and a fish-farming centre. 'The issue is not to increase the water supply for agriculture, but to encourage farmers to use less wasteful irrigation methods. With powerful sprinklers, a high percentage of water is lost through evaporation,' Katsoupas says. If managing water resources is an emerging problem for mainland Greece, it has long been recognised on the islands. Chronic water shortages are seen as the leading constraint on raising the quality of tourist facilities. With the population of smaller islands liable to quadruple at the height of the tourist season, the choice for local authorities lies between investing in a desalinisation plant, often a noisy eyesore in a small-scale environment, or paying high prices to secure an adequate tanker supply. Per capita water demand rises sharply from around 100 litres daily at a moderate hotel to more than 600 litres daily at a luxury resort. Large hotels are required to install treatment facilities for waste water, which should create additional supplies for garden maintenance and other uses. Yet hotels on the Greek islands often flout the regulations because it still costs less to pay a high water bill than to keep treatment plants in regular operation. Beb Jeftic, chief marine scientist at the UN Environment Programme's Mediterranean Action Plan co-ordinating unit, says: 'Even on islands, where tourism has replaced farming, aquifers are often depleted and sea water encroaches. The most important way of husbanding resources is to ensure that every drop of waste water is treated by hotels and re-used.'</p>

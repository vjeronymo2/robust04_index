			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK utilities The kerfuffle over whether Ofgas was or was not trying to curb British Gas's international expansion must have sent a shiver through the company's boardroom. Despite hopes that a new chairman and director general might strike up a better working relationship, it has raised the spectre that tensions between the two sides may remain. Such conflict in the gas industry contrasts with other utilities and raises concerns about consistent regulation. Companies often complain that regulators' decisions are not explained and vary between industries. Under the circumstances, calls for a 'super-regulator' to oversee the system are understandable. Yet that would add to bureaucracy and increase the risk of industry regulators being undermined by companies appealing over their heads. More palatable is the idea that both regulator and company should be required to disclose more information. The fairness of each case could then be more easily determined. True, the company might be more likely to ask judicial review of decisions, but to do so it would have to publicly disclose its case - including presumably any commercially sensitive infor-mation. Another way to alleviate tension might be a kind of 'small claims court' to resolve local disputes at a level below that of a full Monopolies and Mergers Commission enquiry. The Office of Fair Trading might act as honest broker and prevent the kind of nuclear warfare which broke out between British Gas and Sir James McKinnon.</p>

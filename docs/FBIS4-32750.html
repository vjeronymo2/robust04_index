			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 28 June (MTI) -- The founding session of  Hungary's new Parliament was opened today by President Arpad  Goncz. After the National Anthem, the President gave a short  address.    "I greet you on the occasion of your gathering as the second  freely and democratically elected National Assembly of the  Republic of Hungary. I must note with pride that the 1994  general elections went smoothly and faultlessly, showing the  strength and maturity of our democracy. High electoral turnout  shows that Hungarian people care for their own future and are  consciously ready to express their political opinion and will."    Goncz thanked all those who helped organize the elections.    ``The Parliament is Hungary's supreme public-law body, with  responsibility for the future of the country.    "Its accomplishments determine our life day by day. The  National Assembly is based on the past, tried by the present,  and judged by the future," Goncz said.    "How Hungary's citizens see our democracy work depends on  you. And Hungarians all over the world, who are bound to Hungary  not by legal ties but a common past, language, culture, fate,  and vital interests, will also watch your moves carefully,"  Goncz continued.    ``I beg you -- never forget that legislative work and duties  do not put Parliament above society, but oblige it to serve  society.    ``It is not my place to sum up or even touch on the four  years' work of the previous Parliament. Nor will I answer the  frequently recurring question whether the nation has voted for  or against something. But I believe I can firmly state that  people voted in hope that their expectations will be fulfilled  in the future, and they would like to see life secure and  predictable -- and peaceful.    "People want to follow a route that advances the country in  time instead of taking it back to some earlier stage, allowing  as much of the past to be built on as needed to stabilise the  future."</p>

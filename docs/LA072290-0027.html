			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLMOS AS CROCE  </P> <P> In reference to your July 1 Outtakes item on actor Edward James Olmos playing  the late inger Jim Croce: Will this start a new Hollywood fad? If so, why not  Eddie Murphy as Abraham Lincoln? John Lone as Jack Kennedy? Or Cheech and Chong  as the Wright Brothers? Since Olmos isn't required to sing, why not save Rob  Lowe from obscurity and cast him, with a little heavy makeup, as Sammy Davis  Jr.?  </P> <P> I guess Hollywood figured casting an Italian-American actor to play an  Italian-American like Croce might give them the idea they could play roles  other than Mafia dons, pimply juveniles and oversexed buffoons.  </P> <P> Certainly, this would not gain Hollywood the same brownie points for its  assumed liberalism as would choosing Mexican-American Olmos.  </P> <P> JOHN PRIMAVERA  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

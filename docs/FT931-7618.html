			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (3): Likeable firefighter - Bernard Simon meets the provincial premier MENTION the name Bob Rae to almost anyone in Ontario, from taxi drivers to business leaders, and the response is unlikely to be flattering. The taxi driver will probably give a snort of disgust. The business leader will wonder aloud how such a likeable, intelligent man could preside over such a mess. Mr Rae readily acknowledges that times have been tough since he took over as provincial premier after the New Democratic Party's surprise election win in Sept 1990. But he also insists that criticism of his social-democratic government is exaggerated. In dealing with the province's business community, Mr Rae says: 'I find a dramatic contrast between the rhetoric levels that I see in the newspapers and hear in public speeches, and what people say to me in person.' He ticks off several initiatives taken by his government which have benefited business. Corporate income tax rates have gone down. Donations to universities for research and development are now tax deductible. The government is shaking up the provincial ministry of trade and industry to provide better service for both local and foreign investors. In particular, Mr Rae cites his government's strenuous efforts to contain the health-care budget, which makes up almost a third of total government spending. The health ministry's outlays for the year to March 31 1993 are expected to be about CDollars 152m less than the CDollars 17bn projected in last April's budget. Bob Rae's background hardly fits the picture of a left-wing ideologue painted by his political opponents and by many in the province's business community. A boyish-looking 44 years old, his father was a senior Canadian diplomat, and he was educated at private schools in Ottawa, Washington and Geneva before winning a Rhodes scholarship to Balliol College at Oxford. Many outsiders consider him among the more pragmatic members of the NDP government. But whether through inexperience or commitment to the party's backbone of trade unions and social activists, the premier has found himself in one firefight after another with business. The most bruising battle has been over a new labour law, which among other things, forbids companies from hiring replacement workers during a strike. The government has also clashed with business over plans to reform the motor-vehicle insurance system, the travails of Ontario Hydro, environmental policy and the North American free trade agreement. Ms Susan Murray, a lobbyist for several business groups, says that Mr Rae and his NDP colleagues have been chastened by these battles. 'We're finding them very different to deal with now than a year ago,' Ms Murray says. 'They're now not only looking for solutions on the economic side, but also looking for investment.' She says that the government is increasingly seeking advice from business leaders. Ms Lyn Macleod, leader of the opposition Liberal party, is less charitable. Ms Macleod still detects 'a profound distrust' of the private sector in government circles. While she acknowledges Mr Rae's efforts in containing health-care costs, she notes that spending is increasingly being directed towards the non-profit sector and away from business interests, such as privately-run medical laboratories, retirement homes and child-care centres. Mr Rae emphasises the importance of 'partnerships' between business and government in such fields as worker training. Asked whether tax increases are likely to feature in the forthcoming provincial budget, he says that 'I don't want to see anything done in the budget which is going to create competitive difficulties for Canadian business.' But Bob Rae will be judged by deeds rather than words. Despite some signs of thaw in government-business relations, Ontario's captains of commerce and industry have to be convinced that the NDP is out to help rather than hinder.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / War in Angola barely affects oil industry The war which has left most of Angola's economy in ruins has barely affected the oil industry, which this year has hit new production highs, reports Robert Corzine. A new deep-water field off the coast of the Cabinda enclave is about to begin production, taking Angola's daily output up to about 600,000 barrels a day of generally high quality oil, well up on the 1993 average of 512,000 b/d. The consistent rise in output has been achieved in spite of fighting earlier this year which destroyed some oil storage and loading facilities around the coastal town of Soyo, just south of Cabinda. Part of the reason why the oil industry has proved so resilient is the fact that much of the production is from offshore fields beyond the range of land-based artillery. The growing use of offshore processing and tanker loading facilities means oil no longer needs to be piped ashore before being exported, mainly to the US. Although the war has not disrupted the industry, a political settlement would probably encourage a faster pace of development. Many companies, for example, are keen to explore further in the onshore areas of Cabinda. But the threat of attacks from a Cabindan separatist group has prevented them from carrying out seismic studies and other exploration activities. A good deal of exploration is taking place offshore, however. Earlier this week the Angolan news agency Angop reported that Elf Aquitaine, of France had discovered an oil field 130km off the coast. Other companies, including Chevron of the US, are optimistic that the deep water areas now being licensed will prove as prolific as those in shallower waters.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Bosnia peace plan 'may be enforced' RUSSIA yesterday suggested for the first time that the implementation of the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia could begin even without the agreement of Bosnian Serbs, who were set to reject it in a weekend referendum. But Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic defiantly declared the UN-backed peace plan dead and his army's general threatened bomb attacks in London and Washington if the west tried to intervene to force them to accept it. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, stressed that the plan, supported by the presidents of Serbia, Montenegro and the rump Yugoslavia, was the international community's agreed position on the fighting in Bosnia. The Russian foreign minister was speaking to reporters after talks in Moscow with Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators. Though he gave no details on how the plan could be implemented in the teeth of Bosnian Serb opposition, Mr Kozyrev said the UN Security Council might approve a new resolution on the subject this week. Like Britain and France, Russia has expressed strong reservations about US calls for air strikes and, particularly, for arming Bosnian Moslems. Bosnian Serbs turned out in large numbers yesterday to vote in the referendum. They were expected to ignore the advice of the leaders of Serbia and Montenegro by voting massively against the Vance-Owen plan. In reply to a second question, they were also expected to vote in favour of an independent Bosnian Serb state, with the right to unite with other peoples and states. The result is expected on Wednesday. After the voting, Mr Karadzic said the world was 'wasting its time' if it tried to forge a single state in Bosnia. 'The Vance-Owen plan cannot be implemented as it is far away from reality,' he said and called for work to start on a new one. General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb army commander, warned the west not to intervene with air strikes to try to force the plan on the Serbs. 'If they bomb me, I'll bomb London,' He told Reuters newsagency. 'There are Serbs in London, there are Serbs in Washington.' He said any western troops which intervened on the ground would 'leave their bones' in Bosnia. Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb forces pressed on with their assault on Moslem and Croat forces around the north-eastern town of Brcko, where they are trying to widen the corridor linking Belgrade with Serb-held territories in Bosnia and Croatia. Bosnian Croat forces also launched a fierce attack on Moslem positions in Mostar, the south-western Bosnian city, after a week of clashes between the former allies. Reuter adds: Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic yesterday signed a ceasefire agreement with Bosnian Croat military chief General Milivoj Petkovic covering the whole of Bosnia. The agreement, due to come into force at noon tomorrow, was signed at a meeting at Sarajevo airport attended by the commander of UN troops in Bosnia, General Philippe Morillon.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Singapore caning for HK youth A Singapore judge who last month ordered six strokes of the cane for an American teenager for car vandalism, yesterday sentenced an Asian youth to 12 strokes and eight months in jail in the same case, Reuter reports from Singapore. Judge FG Remedios found 17-year-old Shiu Chi Ho of Hong Kong, who has a British passport, guilty of four charges of spray-painting cars in the company of American Michael Fay and others last September. Shiu was also fined SDollars 1,500 (Pounds 685) for three traffic offences. He was released on bail of SDollars 75,000. His lawyer said he would appeal. Fay, whose case has drawn the attention of President Bill Clinton, is currently in a Singapore prison waiting the outcome of a last appeal to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (2): The last unconquered frontier - Whether the Cup leaves most Americans ignorant about football will depend on television and the success of the home team / A look at the nation where baseball is king - US Soccer Disregard what the cynics of international football say. When the new world champions of the game are crowned in Los Angeles on July 17, the World Cup will have been a big success. While it is true that many Americans know little about professional football  -or soccer, as they call it - they know plenty about putting on a good show. The 1994 World Cup will be promoted with typical American flair. The organisation of the tournament will be smooth, the media facilities second-to-none. The stadiums will be mostly large and modern, and in some cases spectacular. Most important of all, the big games will be played before enthusiastic and peaceful crowds. Yet, if the developed football world of south America and Europe judges the tournament a triumph, will it matter if the heart of the undeveloped football world - the host nation itself - finds the event a less than overwhelming experience? Will it matter if, after a month of Brazilians and Bolivians, Irish and Italians, Colombians and Cameroonians, ordinary Americans shrug their shoulders and turn their attention to the more familiar rhythms of major league baseball, of the Dodgers and Giants, Yankees and Red Sox? The conventional wisdom is that the World Cup will matter a great deal, at least to the development of the professional game in the US. The Federation of International Football Associations (Fifa), the sport's governing body, selected the US as host for 1994 because it believed the World Cup would spur the establishment of a new professional league in the US, the last great unconquered territory for the world game'. - Fifa remembers only too well how the only previous attempt to colonise the US ended, when superstars like Pele and Beckenbauer failed to prevent the high-flying North American Soccer League (NASL) from crashing to the ground in 1985, burdened by financial losses and public indifference. This time, it is putting its faith in the restorative powers of the World Cup. Yet, if the tournament is to capture the imagination of Americans, it will have to be done through television. This will be a difficult task, because football has a poor reputation as a spectator sport among armchair fans in the US, who are used to being fed a diet of action-packed, high-scoring games presented on television in short bursts, regularly punctuated by commercials. Watching football, however, requires concentration and patience, and if viewers are to be turned on by the games, they will have to feature plenty of electrifying plays and spectacular goals. - Unfortunately, international football has become less exciting in recent years, with defence-minded teams scoring fewer goals. At the last World Cup, the US media made great play of the negative team tactics and low scores. The image presented to the US public then - of a boring, often incom-prehensible game  -lingers today, and it will require a fundamental change in the approach of the players and coaches for that image to be reversed. While it is crucial that the World Cup presents exciting football, Fifa and the US organisers know that it is almost as important that the home team performs well, or at least well enough to sustain the domestic public's interest throughout much of the month-long tournament. As Alan Rothenberg, head of the US World Cup organising committee, said recently: I don't like to put pressure on our team, but a lot rides on how the US does.' Although the host country has progressed through to the second round in previous World Cups, this summer the US will be one of the weakest of the 24 teams playing, and is in a tough group. For the hosts, surviving the first round of group games will be a considerable achievement. Ultimately, the World Cup is not only expected to present a great spectacle, but also generate enough lasting interest in the game to ensure that football in the US grows beyond its mainly amateur roots into an important professional sport. The football authorities, ready to cash-in on the World Cup, are already planning a new league for 1995. Yet, those who have been closely involved in US football for many years contend that the World Cup will not decide the fate of their game. Clive Toye, head of the New York host committee and a former president of the New York Cosmos of the old NASL, believes football will grow as a sport in the US with or without the World Cup. He says there is no need for the home team to do well, or for the World Cup to win over fans from basketball or baseball fans. In the long run, it doesn't matter a damn whether the US team goes out in the first round or wins the World Cup, because the game is progressing up through the generations in a very handy way .. Soccer is now the second most popular game for participants in this country. Those are the fans of the future.' Football is certainly popular with many Americans of both sexes. Today, an estimated 15m people play football in the US, more than any team sport except basketball, and at universities there are more soccer' teams than American football teams. At the professional level, the country has a well-established if minor league of 72 teams. Some observers of the US sports scene, however, are not convinced that a fully-fledged professional football league will succeed in the US just because millions of people play the game for fun. John Jeansonne, a journalist who covers international sports for New York Newsday, says: Soccer in the US is a tremendous participation sport .. but it's just not something that Americans tend to follow as spectators. I don't believe the World Cup will change that, any more than a very successful Los Angeles Olympics changed our passion for athletics, which continues to disappear from the landscape of spectator sports in the US.' Yet, to those like Toye, who have helped nurture the sport in the a over the years, the millions of Americans who play football represent the roots of the game, roots which will one day bear fruit. If the World Cup acts as a temporary fertiliser, so much the better, but Toye says the football community in the US is not relying on the tournament to determine its future.</p>

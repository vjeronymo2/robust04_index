			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE PASSION AND THE INTELLECT  </P> <P> Meet the new boss, not quite the same as the old boss.  </P> <P> The rock pinata is stuffed nowadays with bands struggling to evoke the Beatles  or trying to be the new Stones, but hardly anyone seems interested in being the  new Who, with all the passion, bravado, bluster and sheer intellect that would  entail.  </P> <P> Filling those estimable shoes quite nicely -- and without really trying -- is  Midnight Oil, the world-class rock 'n' roll band from Australia that headlined  the first of two nights Tuesday at the Universal Amphitheatre with a  near-faultless show exceeded in its tugging sense of commitment only by its  viscerally overwhelming, finely detailed musical drive.  </P> <P> At last, the answer to who's next.  </P> <P> "It's good to be among friends," announced singer Peter Garrett -- not your  average giant, bald, left-wing Christian environmentalist, hard-rock former  political candidate -- between edgy encore renditions of John Lennon's "Instant  Karma" and Nick Lowe's "Peace, Love and Understanding."  </P> <P> He explained, in the same earnest tones used to pitch the whale-saving and  anti-apartheid tables in the lobby, "We have a common understanding . . .  mistrust of Milli Vanilli."  </P> <P> He then bent over the pit area, inviting fans to wipe his shaved pate:  "Life-size sweat on stage! See, you can touch this, it's real!"  </P> <P> Memorex poster boys Milli Vanilli may make an easy target. So might Exxon, in  front of whose New York headquarters the protest-oriented Midnight Oil recently  performed a free concert. But there's nothing overly easy about the lyric depth  with which Midnight Oil has plumbed its themes of justice, repatriation and  conservation, to the extent of making many of its anthem-like choruses so  provincial in reference that they couldn't possibly mean as much to Americans  as Australians.  </P> <P> Among the quite rousing songs played Tuesday: "Stars of Warburton,"  "Warakurna," "Kosciusko." Among the themes addressed: aboriginal rights and  outback strip mining. Clearly, this is not a band obsessed with Stateside  stardom.  </P> <P> The relentless punch with which Oil put across its songs in the late '70s and  early '80s -- when the band was playing the Hollywood Palladium and  slam-dancing audiences were the norm -- made the Clash the closest point of  reference. These days, though, they relent now and again, and few of the songs  from the group's two latest albums -- which accounted for 14 of the 17 original  selections Tuesday -- mandate a slam response.  </P> <P> The Who comparison is much more apt now, and not just because Garrett did a  fleeting windmill motion while miming during a guitar solo. The pace is more  moderate on most of their newer songs, and nuances of melody and timekeeping  have become far more important. The three-piece horn section used on a few  choice numbers -- borrowed from the opening act, fellow Aussies Hunters &amp;  Collectors -- recalled the heights of the Who's "Quadrophenia" era.  </P> <P> Power chords appeared at the proper moments, but Martin Rotsey and Jim Moginie  -- the most unassuming, out-of-the-way guitar heroes you're ever likely to find  -- forced untold varieties of sounds from their instruments, subtle sounds you  probably wouldn't register unless you were listening for them. Drummer Rob  Hirst (the group's most active songwriter) has an absolute Keith Moon ferocity  to his playing, though there was enough literally offbeat ethnic influence to  his pounding fills that it's more like Moon after a long anthropological  excursion.  </P> <P> Garrett, of course, is no Roger Daltrey: He calmly and wittily plugs  environmental causes during the breaks (not to mention some SDI- and  Bush-bashing), then erupts in a fury of rigid motion during the songs, like a  cross between Joe Cocker and Robocop.  </P> <P> He's both smoothly articulate and unpredictably galvanized; his band is precise  and musically refined but positively rips. It's rock in an advanced  evolutionary state that indeed made the Milli Vanillis of the world seem like  crustaceans.  </P> <P> Midnight Oil also plays tonight at San Diego's Open Air Theatre and Friday at  Irvine Meadows.  </P></p>

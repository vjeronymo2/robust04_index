			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The sports facilities subcommittee also examined access to pools. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  There are many different types of pools such as competition pools, lap pools, leisure or family pools, and wading or children's pools. Pools are found in a variety of settings from hotels and other places of transient lodging to public parks and community centers. The sports facilities subcommittee identified three means for providing access into the water: ramps, lifts, and transfer tiers. As discussed at pages 16&hyph;18 of the committee's report, each of these means accommodates varying capabilities of individuals with disabilities with no single means best for all users. For example, ramps can facilitate independence. However, ramps require transfer to an additional chair and raise concerns regarding buoyance and water resistance for individuals ascending and descending the ramp. Lift operation may require individuals with disabilities to seek assistance; and transfer tiers pose a higher level of physical challenge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The places of amusements subcommittee and outdoor developed areas subcommittee also examined access to pools. See pages 85&hyph;88 and 188&hyph;189 of the committee's report for those subcommittees' recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The sports facilities subcommittee recommended that one accessible means of entry into the water should be required and that a range of alternatives (ramps, lifts, or transfer tiers) should be allowed. The subcommittee further recommended that where pools exceed a certain size, two accessible means of entry into the water should be required. (The subcommittee did not recommend a specific size.) The subcommittee emphasized that any means of entry into the water should allow for individuals with disabilities to use pools independently and with dignity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the different types of pools and various means that individuals with disabilities use for entering the water, should a range of alternatives (ramps, lifts, or transfer tiers) be allowed for providing access into the water? If not, should specific means be required and others not permitted for certain types of pools? Should requirements be related to the size of the pools, with larger pools required to provide more than one means of entry into the water? If so, what size or other criteria should trigger the additional requirement? If specific means for entering the water are required, should technical specifications be developed for those means?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Places of Amusement (Pages 63&hyph;88)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Amusement Rides (Pages 74&hyph;85)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The places of amusement subcommittee examined access to amusement rides. As defined by the subcommittee, amusement ride systems consist of amusement devices which carry or move a person or persons on, around, over or through a fixed or restricted course or within a defined area for purpose of amusement or entertainment and includes related elements, facilities and systems. For new construction, the subcommittee recommended that, to the greatest extent possible, at least one wheelchair space be provided within the amusement ride system where the amusement device can accommodate a person seated in a wheelchair without changing the nature of the amusement ride system or experience. When an amusement device cannot accommodate a person seated in a wheelchair, the subcommittee recommended that, to the greatest extent possible, a means of transfer onto the amusement device be provided without changing the nature of the amusement ride system or device. The subcommittee drafted detailed recommended guidelines for accomplishing a transfer from a wheelchair to the amusement device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The places of amusement subcommittee recommended that decisions regarding the type of access provided (roll-on or transfer) be made by designers on a ride-by-ride basis after considering a variety of factors, including seating space and configuration, ride speed, forces and accelerations during normal and emergency operation, riding posture and center of gravity, restraining systems, and safety of others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should a percentage of rides in newly constructed places of amusement provide either roll-on or transfer access for individuals who use wheelchairs and other mobility aids? It is acceptable to permit some rides not to provide roll-on or transfer access and, if so, what should be the criteria for not providing access? In new construction, is it acceptable that the type of access provided (roll-on or transfer) be determined on a ride-by-ride basis? The Access Board is interested in any studies or other data that provide information on the dynamic effects of forces experienced on certain rides on individuals with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Carnivals and Fairs (Pages 73&hyph;74)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The places of amusement subcommittee also examined access to amusement rides used in temporary places of amusement such as carnivals and fairs. These amusement rides are transported on trucks and trailers, and are set up and leveled at different sites for temporary events. Depending on the terrain, the distance from the ground to ride may vary from four to six feet. The subcommittee recommended that these amusement rides comply with the same requirements as amusement rides at permanent sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 4:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should amusement rides used in temporary places of amusement be addressed in the same manner as rides at permanent sites? The Access Board is interested in receiving information on ways to provide access to these amusement rides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carnivals and fairs may be held on partially improved or unimproved sites such as city parks, athletic fields, or agricultural fields that are not specifically designed for the event and that do not provide stable, firm and slip resistant surfaces required for an accessible route. The places of amusement subcommittee recommended that where, due to the temporary nature of the event, changes to topography or surface conditions would be inconsistent with the primary purpose of the site, temporary, removable surfaces be used to provide an accessible path to rides and other attractions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 5:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should temporary places of amusement be required to meet all the provisions for an accessible route when held on partially improved or unimproved sites? If not, what provisions should be modified (e.g., stable, firm and slip resistant surface; slope; cross slope; width; accessible elements connected)? How should protruding objects such as tent stakes and lines be addressed?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Play Settings (Pages 89&hyph;102)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Accessible Route (Pages 91&hyph;93)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The play settings subcommittee examined issues related to providing access to play areas and equipment. Play settings vary greatly in size and may be found in schools, day care centers, fast food restaurants, amusement parks, and public parks. Play is an important social experience that occurs in many ways within a play area. Play settings often include play equipment such as slides, swings, ladders, sand play areas, and open areas for play. Children without disabilities have the opportunity to maneuver throughout play areas and to access their choice of play equipment. Designers have a unique challenge in providing children with disabilities the same access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designers usually provide resilient surfaces meeting the ASTM F1292 performance standard within the use zone of play equipment as a safety measure. (This is also called ``the fall zone.'') Some resilient surfaces such as sand and wood chips are not stable, firm and slip resistant and, thus, would not meet the requirements for an accessible route. The play settings subcommittee considered cost and maintenance issues related to various types of surfaces and recommended that an expanded accessible route which is a minimum of 60 inches wide connect accessible activities within the play area in order to promote social interaction and use of the play components. This accessible route would be stable, firm, slip resistant, safe to crawl on, and where within the use zone of equipment, resilient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 6:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Does the play subcommittee's recommendation for an expanded accessible route adequately address the need for access within play settings? Persons responding to this question should review pages 91&hyph;93 of the committee's report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Elevated Play Equipment (Pages 93&hyph;96)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The play setting subcommittee identified ramps and transfer systems (transfer platforms, decked platforms, and berms or natural hills) as means for providing access to elevated play equipment. For larger composite play structures having 12 or more elevated play components (or 12 or more elevated play components at one site serving the same age group), the subcommittee recommended that both ramps and transfer systems should be required, and that each means access at least one-half of the elevated play components on the play structure. The subcommittee further recommended that one-half of the play components which are accessed by ramps should be required to be like or similar to those elevated play components that are not accessed by ramps. For smaller composite play structures having less than 12 elevated play components, the subcommittee recommended that transfer systems should be required to access at least one-half of the elevated play components, and that one-half of those play components be like or similar to the elevated play components that are not accessible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 7:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should a requirement for ramp access, in addition to transfer systems, be based on the number of play components? If so, what number of play components should trigger a ramp requirement, in addition to transfer systems?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Soft Contained Play Systems (Page 99)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Soft contained play systems are relatively new and are comprised of fully enclosed, resilient play components that are designed so that children climb through and within the structure. Most incorporate play activities on several different levels. Some cover 3,000 square feet and are over 20 feet high. These play structures are found in amusement parks, connected with fast food restaurants, or as stand-alone facilities. The play settings subcommittee recommended that these play structures be accessible and provide integration, and noted that the ASTM F1536 committee is currently developing standards for them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

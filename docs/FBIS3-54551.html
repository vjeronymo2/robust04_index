At a  news conference in New York, United Nations Representative  Jamshed Marker said Pakistan's distinct success at the UN last  year was that it was able to bring the Kashmir issue before the  international community. Marker referred to President Clinton's  address at the UN in September last year, in which he made a  special reference to the Kashmir issue. He said India agreed to  begin talks with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue due to  international presssure and this pressure continues. Marker  said despite India's attempts to conceal the atrocities of its  troops, the international community has come to know more about  Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir.</p>

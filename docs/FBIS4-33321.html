			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jose Quintero] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany said that if the  United States decides to invade Haiti to remove General Raoul  Cedras and his men from power, he will not support it, but if it  takes place he would not condemn it either.    Questioned by numerous journalists at the Yellow Room of the  Presidential Palace after signing the Chapultepec Declaration,  Endara said he believes the invasion of Panama in December 1989  did not take place because of a right or a duty.    "We did not ask for the invasion... it took place...  historic  situations, which will be up to analysts to study."    According to the Panamanian president, between Haiti and  Panama, there are distant but similar conditions, which he  discussed with U.S. Vice President Al Gore during a recent  dinner in Tegucigalpa.    He noted that on that occasion Gore said Haitian President  Jean Bertrand Aristide won his country's elections with 70  percent of the votes, a similar percentage with which he  (Endara) won the 1989 elections from his opponent, Carlos Duque  from the National Liberation Coalition.    "I am not calling for an invasion of Haiti, but I do not  exclude it either," the president said. When asked again if he  would support an invasion, he said no, but that if the United  States invades the island, he will not condemn it.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Surprise falls in output indicate slower UK recovery Surprise falls in UK industrial production and manufacturing output in August appeared yesterday to confirm indications that economic growth might be slowing in the second half of 1994. However, the Treasury pointed to special factors, such as the fire at the Milford Haven oil refinery in July, as being mainly responsible for the downturn in output and said the trend was still buoyant. Financial markets welcomed news of the fall, on the grounds that it made an imminent increase in base rates less likely. The FT-SE 100 index climbed 28.1 points to 2,984.4, while gilts rose half a point. The Central Statistical Office said that manufacturing output fell by 0.3 per cent between July and August, while industrial production dropped 0.1 per cent. Analysts were expecting both measures to rise by 0.4 per cent. Around two-thirds of the fall in manufacturing output was caused by a fall in the oil refining sector. Output in this sector dropped sharply in July in the aftermath of the Milford Haven fire, a production drop at BP's Grangemouth refinery and maintenance at other plants. But the decline was not confined to oil refining. The engineering industry recorded a fall in production in August, with declines particularly noticeable in metal machine tools and in basic electrical equipment. Other industries to record a fall in August included textiles, leather and clothing. Mr Nick Parsons, chief European economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said: 'Frankly I think the Treasury's excuse is a complete red herring. These are not straws in the wind but building blocks for an argument that the UK economy is slowing down.' There have been other indications that the UK economy, which grew at its fastest rate for six years in the second quarter, might be starting to decelerate. In September, a survey from the Confederation of British Industry showed a fall in the proportion of companies expecting output to rise over the next four months, while the Purchasing Managers Index fell for the second consecutive month. Yesterday, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders indicated that the pace of new car sales growth was slowing. Earlier this week, Ford introduced short-time working at its Dagenham and Halewood plants. However, quarterly and annual figures for production and output indicate that the recovery is still very healthy. Over the past year, the strongest growth has been in North Sea oil and gas production, which has been one of the main motors of recovery. Manufacturing output remains below the levels reached in 1990. Lex, Page 20 Bonds, Page 27 Currencies, Page 29 London stocks, Page 38</p>

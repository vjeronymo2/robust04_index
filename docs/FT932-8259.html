			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Bosnia plan championed by Kozyrev MR Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, yesterday met Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian leaders in an attempt to promote Moscow's proposal for a step-by-step implementation of the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina. In an apparent reference to US criticism and Washington's refusal to attend a proposed UN Security Council session, Mr Kozyrev went out of his way to defend the plan to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines. 'A better alternative to the Vance-Owen plan simply doesn't exist. . . it would be a continuation of bloodshed,' he said. On arriving in Belgrade for talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and his Yugoslav and Montenegrin counterparts, Mr Kozyrev described their support for the plan as more important than its rejection by Bosnian Serbs in their weekend referendum. The foreign minister tried to play down a rift with the US over the plan, saying that he and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, were in close contact and that it was no more than 'a difference in timing' over when the Security Council should meet to discuss the latest Russian proposals. Earlier yesterday Mr Kozyrev met Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia, and Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president, in Split on the Adriatic coast. Talks centred on ways to broker a lasting ceasefire between the Croats and Moslems, formerly allies, in Mostar, south-western Bosnia. The Russian delegation said it had gained the approval of Mr Tudjman for the deployment of international monitors along the frontier between Croatia and Bosnia. Mr Kozyrev said he was unsure when Mr Milosevic would decide on deployment of monitors on the Serbian-Bosnian border. The Serbian president had previously insisted that this depended on deployment on Croatia's borders with Bosnia. Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, also held talks with the Croatian and Bosnian presidents in Split in an attempt to win their commitment to a lasting ceasefire between Bosnian Croats and Moslems and a reaffirmation of their endorsement of the peace plan. As the rival presidents traded accusations about who was responsible for the fighting, Lord Owen said: 'I am sick and tired of agreements being signed like confetti.' He said the former Yugoslav republic could become a Lebanon in Europe and that fighting would spread beyond its frontiers if Bosnia crumbled into separate ethnic state-lets. 'If Croats and Moslems cannot live together, side by side, there will not be a Bosnia-Hercegovina. There are enough obstacles from the Serb side already,' Lord Owen said. 'There is no way I can imagine the Moslem population will allow the partition of the country. They will fight. It will be like Lebanon. 'They will go on fighting and fighting and fighting and that contagion will spread to Serbia and Croatia.'</p>

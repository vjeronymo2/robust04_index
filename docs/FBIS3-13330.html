The implications and inferences of this one-time waiver of the  Pressler Amendment are many. The waiver, reported to be urged  by some sections of the Clinton Administration, and this  demonstration of sympathy for Pakistan is fraught with  far-reaching implications for the stability and security of the  Indian subcontinent.    According to one estimate, a waiver now would result in  Pakistan acquiring modern weapons and surveillance platforms  almost immediately. The more notable include the F-16 fighter  aircraft and the P-3C Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft.  The Pakistani Air Force already has about 35 F-16's in its  inventory, and if the Pressler Amendment was to be waived, the  strength of the F-16's would go up three-fold. In like fashion,  the induction of the versatile Orion, which is Harpoon-capable,  will be extremely destabilizing from India's perspective. In  short, Pakistan will be able to receive modern lethal weapons  for all its three armed forces by a way of high-tech helicopter  gunships, fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, and guided  missile frigates.    The impact such an induction would have on Indian defense  policy and plans needs little reiteration, more so when the  recent Indian budget revealed that this year's defense  allocation has actually declined by about 10 crore rupees in  real term since last year. But more than the conventional  weaponry and hardware, what could be rather disturbing if the  waiver is pushed through is the interference and impact on the  nuclear question and the sponsorship of terrorism. The United  States would in effect be endorsing Pakistan's clandestine  nuclear weapon program, and India apart, the impact in the rest  of the region -- including Iran and Central Asia -- would be  significant. Secondly, the United States either deliberately or  unwittingly may be turning a blind eye to Pakistan's active role  in state-sponsored terrorism -- a fact that was clearly brought  to the attention of the global community in the recent  deliberations in Geneva. The last but far from the least  important inference would be the nature of the U.S.-Pakistan  relationship in the post-Cold War period.    In according this one-time waiver, which Senator Larry  Pressler had been constrained to unequivocally caution against,  the Clinton Administration may be signalling a specific  military-security role for Pakistan in the larger U.S. gameplan.  Such a development, were it to fructify, would indeed have an  impact on the political-military contours of the entire region.</p>

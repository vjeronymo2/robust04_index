			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Accounting body hits Pounds 2m target THE FINANCIAL Reporting Council, the UK's accounting standards umbrella body, has achieved its target of Pounds 2m to cover legal challenges to the rulings of its offshoots, its annual report and accounts revealed yesterday. It said that would reduce its funding requirements for this year from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 1.8m. The accounts also showed that costs incurred by the investigations of the Financial Reporting Review Panel, its watchdog and enforcement arm, were Pounds 50,000 in the year to March 31. The panel investigates deviations from accounting standards. It tries to persuade any companies that breach standards to amend their accounts voluntarily, but it has powers to take them to court if its rulings are challenged. Alongside the review panel, the council funds the Accounting Standards Board, the Urgent Issues Task Force and the Public Sector Liaison Committee. The accounts show an increase in contributions from sponsors to Pounds 2.67m, compared with Pounds 2.53m in the previous year. Operating charges were up from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 1.89m, and there was a surplus of Pounds 32,000 (Pounds 302,000 last year). Funding for the council came from the Department of Trade and Industry, the professional accountancy bodies, the London Stock Exchange, the Association of British Insurers, the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development, the National Audit Office and eight London and Scottish clearing banks.</p>

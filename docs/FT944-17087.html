			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (8): Victories in war against fraud - Some tips on how to deal with bribery and extortion when abroad The police officer was adamant. About a mile from Benito Juarez airport in Mexico City my taxi had run through a red light. The cab driver shrugged his shoulders and suggested I pay la mordida - the bite - a Dollars 25 fine for an offence he had not committed. In Mexico and other developing countries business travellers are easy prey for police, who impose such fines to augment salaries, which rarely keep pace with inflation. Six months and several thousand miles later, it was the same story at Sheremetyevov Two, Moscow's international airport. Here it is not la mordida but spekulyatsia - profiteering of the crudest variety. The first bribe was paid within 10 yards of the terminal: a backhander to the policeman guarding the taxi rank where my chauffeur - a medic seeking hard currency - was touting for business from those passengers unwilling to pay the official taxi rate of up to Dollars 60. The Guild of Business Travel Agents, whose 40 members handle the travel arrangements for 86 of the companies in the FTSE-100, advises passengers to avoid such problems by arranging transfers before departure. 'The best safeguard is to book through reputable agencies based outside countries where corruption is prevalent,' says Mr David Reynolds, chief executive of the London-based industry body. However, Mr Reynolds warns that in many cases the corruption takes place before the traveller even reaches his destination. 'One of the biggest problems is airline fraud in which stolen tickets are purchased innocently but turn out to be invalid.' His claim is backed by the International Air Transport Association. Revenue lost through ticket fraud totalled Dollars 189m last year, while Iata estimates that a further Dollars 200m in bogus sales goes unreported. The most common fraud is perpetrated through the so-called 'bust out', in which a seemingly reputable travel agency is established, often with counterfeit bank references, and begins offering business travellers heavily discounted fares. In typical cases, the backers disappear with the ticket stock - essentially thousands of blank cheques to be filled out and sold on to unsuspecting travellers, mainly through unlicensed bucket shops. Although ticket barcoding has reduced the ease with which fraudsters can operate, Iata warns that increasingly sophisticated computer crime is presenting a fresh challenge to the industry. Determined to counter that threat, large carriers such as British Airways have set up their own fraud protection units and constantly update on-line blacklists of stolen tickets. That is small consolation for the business traveller whose company, anxious to curb costs, opted for a cheap ticket not worth the paper it is printed on. 'If the fare seem the bargain of a lifetime, it's likely the purchaser is the last in line of a fraud,' says Iata, which advises companies to use agents approved under its accreditation programme. Aware that recession has forced businesses to review travel budgets, the Guild of Business Travel Agents has set up its own low fare unit designed to protect its clients against corrupt ticket sales. In some parts of the world, however, a valid ticket home is the least of their problems - a fact recognised by law enforcement officials in Hong Kong, the world's eighth largest trading economy. The colony's Independent Commission Against Corruption received 2,252 corruption reports in the first eight months of this year, a 14 per cent increase on the same period in 1993. The rise followed an opinion poll showing that 55.7 per cent of respondents regarded business sector corruption as 'very prevalent', compared with 41.1 per cent in the previous year. In a bid to solve the problem, Hong Kong's six main chambers of commerce have joined forces with more than 1,000 companies to draw up a new code of business ethics. The ICAC also hopes to ease executives' fears by drawing up new guidelines on corruption, which are expected to be published next year. Even so, many travel managers believe corruption will increase as cross-border trade with China gathers pace. The dilemma for executives travelling to destinations with poor corruption records is whether to believe the advice of major agencies which have an obvious self-interest in recommending pre-booked and pre-paid arrangements. In general, such agencies flourish not on the back of corruption fears but by offering more efficient and secure services. Those unwilling to make advance bookings could rely alternatively on local business contacts to make their travel arrangements for them, especially in countries where tickets can only be purchased with hard currency. Local company representatives are less obvious targets for fraud and can bypass many of the hurdles in negotiating rates for services such as office equipment rental or car hire. A number of travel agents are also expanding their range of services in some developing countries. For example, Thomas Cook, whose international business travel agency operations were acquired recently by American Express, has launched Moscow's first travel management centre which offers advice on access to business facilities among other services. The common message from such agencies is that travellers should register at their embassy or local consulates during prolonged stays; carry copies of passports and travel documents; carry local currency in only small denominations; and, where possible, rely on an approved guide or local company official to smooth the way through business negotiations. It is impossible to be immunised against corruption, and no amount of forward planning can avoid it altogether. But in curbing the spread of this financial disease, booking through reputable travel organisations can certainly reduce the risks. 'Corruption oils the wheels in many developing countries,' warns one travel industry executive. 'We have not won the war against fraud, but at least we have scored some victories in our campaign.'</p>

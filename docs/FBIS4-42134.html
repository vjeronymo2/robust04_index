			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris (AA) -- Sitki Uluc reports -- Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin who is in Paris for the European Stability  Pact Conference has concluded his bilateral contacts.    This morning, Cetin met with Aremnian Deputy Foreign  Minister  Gerard Libaridyan [as received]. After the meeting, Cetin told  the press: "I had the impression that the Armenians have  realized the importance of peace."    During the meeting, Libaridyan briefed Cetin on the latest  developments and said that with Azerbaijan they "have arrived to  a point that is very close to peace."    Cetin said to him: "You are waging a meaningless war. At  this day and age nobody will allow the occupation of a country's  land. You must reach a solution peacefully. The war hurts both  sides extensively. We will extend every kind of support for  peace. Do not seek solutions outside the CSCE framework.    Cetin and Libaridyan agreed that seeking solutions to the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict in too many ways and through  various channels makes the solution even more difficult to  reach. They also agreed that "Russia's support is essential for  a solution."    Cetin gave Libaridyan the message that "the relations  between  Turkey and Armenia cannot be normalized as long as Azeri  territory is under occupation."    Discussing his bilateral meeting with French Foreign  Minister  Alain Juppe, Cetin said: "I thanked France for showing  understanding and supporting our struggle against terrorism."    Juppe discussed the consternation being caused by the  failure  to reach a solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina and stated that closer  cooperation is necessary with Turkey in this respect.    Cetin pointed out that France can pressure Armenia so that  peace can be established in the Caucasus, adding: "The solution  must be within the CSCE framework. This war can end with the  concrete support of the Western countries."    Discussing Turkey's problems in connection with the Iraqi  pipeline, Cetin asked for Paris' support to rescue the pipeline  in which Turkey invested considerably. Cetin pointed out that  Turkey does not intend to violate UN resolutions, but that there  is no need for a new UN Security Council resolution in  connection with this matter which is technical in nature.    Cetin pointed out that France will be the term president of  the European Union when Turkey joins the customs union, adding:  "we will expect your concrete support."    Cetin also briefed Juppe on the latest developments  regarding  Cyprus.    At his meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Peter  Tarnoff [title as received], Cetin criticized the decision to  link aid to Turkey to certain conditions and to reduce it. He  termed this as "a negative development."    Cetin stressed that "Turkey is being subjected to unjust  criticism as a result of wrong and insufficient information."  He added that everyone must refrain from harming Turkish-U.S.  relations.    Cetin pointed out that the United States can be more  effective in the Caucasus. He also raised the issue of the  Iraqi pipeline and discussed Turkey's problems and demands in  connection with that issue.    Tarnoff stressed that the U.S. President attaches great  importance to relations with Turkey, and that efforts will be  made to prevent the relations from being harmed and to explain  the facts.    Cetin criticized Belgium for allowing DEP [Democracy Party]  to open a "solidarity bureau" there. He said: "Nobody should  support terrorism. This is what international agreements and  responsibilities say. Terrorism should not be tolerated. This  is a very sensitive issue. Turkey's issues and problems are  resolved in Turkey. Seeking solutions outside will not help.  Such steps cannot be of any use."    Cetin returns to Turkey today.</p>

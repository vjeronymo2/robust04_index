			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VAQUERO CLASSIC;  </P> <P> BIG LEAD NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR CANYONS  </P> <P> A dynamite first half was overshadowed by a markedly less explosive second half  for College of the Canyons on Saturday night against Los Angeles City.  </P> <P> Canyons led by as many as 19 points before intermission but lost, 74-69, in the  championship game of the Vaquero Classic at Glendale College.  </P> <P> One Canyons player stayed hot throughout the game. Shooting guard Dan Murphy  made all 12 of his shots, hitting 10 field goals and two free throws for a  team-high 22 points.  </P> <P> Murphy scored 10 of his team's first 16 points, and Canyons led, 31-12, after  L. A. City went scoreless for more than five minutes. Canyons (5-6) held a  37-25 advantage at the break.  </P> <P> "Our guys didn't wake up," L. A. City Coach Reggie Morris said. "I had to chew  them out at halftime to get some spirit."  </P> <P> L. A. City (10-2) began to ease its scoring drought with some rain-making  three-point baskets at the beginning of the second half.  </P> <P> Develle Walker hit a couple, and soon thereafter Carlo Davis made back-to-back  three-point shots to give L. A. City its first lead, 44-43.  </P> <P> As L. A. City turned up the defensive pressure, Canyons' hopes for an upset  began to ebb.  </P> <P> "We knew they were going to come out pressuring us," Canyons Coach Lee Smelser  said. "We just tried to sustain against the pressure."  </P> <P> Canyons took its last lead at 52-51 before L. A. City went on an 11-2 run.  </P> <P> With 1 minute 11 seconds remaining, Canyons' Jeff Dorst hit the front end of a  one-and-one to cut the deficit to 70-69 but Canyons could pull no closer.  </P> <P> Somewhat of a surprise championship-game participant, Canyons has taken  advantage of a changing of the guards to rejuvenate its game.  </P> <P> Entering the tournament, Smelser handed the point position to freshman David  Langley and moved Nick Sanderson, perhaps Canyons' most talented player, to the  bench.  </P> <P> Both flourished Saturday night. Langley scored 15 points, grabbed a  team-leading eight rebounds, had four assists and two steals.  </P> <P> "After the Cuesta tournament, I said, 'David, I'm going to put the ball in your  hands, and we'll go from there,' " Smelser said. "It really lends some great  quickness to us in the backcourt."  </P> <P> Sanderson scored 14 and highlighted a strong floor game with six steals. Reggie  Bell, Canyons' all-tournament representative, had eight assists and nine  points.  </P> <P> In the third-place game:  </P> <P> Cypress 58, Glendale 53 -- Beating Cypress and its 6-foot-10 center Eric Pauley  proved to be too tall an order for a young Glendale team.  </P> <P> Glendale trailed, 49-48, with 3:42 remaining but a pair of costly turnovers  allowed Cypress to pull away.  </P> <P> "We made two critical errors on offense back-to-back and that's the way it's  been happening, back-to-back," Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "Our  inexperience has showed quite a bit in the pressure."  </P> <P> Pauley had game-high honors in scoring and rebounding with 23 points and eight  rebounds. Only four Glendale players scored.  </P> <P> "That has been a surprising problem because we have been equally distributing  minutes," Beauchemin said. "We didn't get much help off the bench tonight."  </P> <P> Enoch Mack and Chris Cooke both scored 19 for Glendale, and all-tournament pick  Kelly Crosby posted 10 and seven rebounds.  </P> <P> Glendale (6-7) fell behind 11-2 early but trailed only 23-22 at halftime.  </P> <P> Glendale led by as many as five points in the second half but lost the lead for  good when Cypress pulled ahead, 43-42.  </P></p>

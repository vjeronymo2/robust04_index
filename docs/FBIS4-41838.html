			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin  has told Interfax that his ministry has submitted a draft law to  the government on forming a special budget fund to finance the  federal anti-crime program.    Dubinin said the fund should be formed in two ways. Firstly,  a special account should be opened for voluntary donations. The  other part of the fund could be formed with the help of an  additional income tax. The suggestion is: incomes under 75,000  rubles a month would be tax-exempt. Between 75,000 and 300,000  rubles the rate would be 0.5 pct, between 300,000 and one  million -- 1 pct, between one and two and a half million -- 2  pct, and over 2.5 million -- 3 pct.    Dubinin believes the tax would help collect 700 billion in  half a year which is the sum necessary for financing the federal  program according to ministry estimates.    "I do not know how pleasant that is politically, but if we  approve a program and intend to carry it out, it should be  financed and we do not have additional sources in the framework  of the approved budget," the acting minister admitted. Thus, an  additional, alternative source has to be found: these could be  special bonds totalling 700 billion or one trillion rubles,  Dubinin said.    Dubinin added that bonds could be distributed among legal  entities and individuals on a voluntary basis. In any case  without defining the source it is impossible to finance the  program, therefore something has to be chosen, Dubinin said.    He added that the ministry does not fear to be sharply  criticized for the proposed tax because it already is a target  of constant attacks. Dubinin said that the proposal is being  made at a time when the ministry intends to reduce the rates of  several other taxes.    "I think this will be understood properly. I am ready to pay  for my personal security. I might not be right, but I think  that the majority of the population will understand", he  concluded.</p>

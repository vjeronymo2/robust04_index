			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Israel and Efta in free trade pact ISRAEL and the seven members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) yesterday reached a free trade agreement after 13 months of negotiations. The agreement will be signed later this year and is expected to come into effect on January 1, 1993. Customs duties and other trade barriers will be abolished for industrial and processed agricultural goods, fish and other marine products. Israel has also negotiated better terms for trade in farm products with individual Efta countries. The deal will end the discrimination against Efta exports to Israel when compared with exports from the European Community and the United States, which already have free trade pacts with Israel. Efta was anxious for a quick agreement to avoid the 'negative effects' on trade of a tariffication scheme introduced by Israel in September 1991.</p>

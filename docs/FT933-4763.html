			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Floods hit harvest hopes in Bangladesh RECENT FLOODS triggered by heavy monsoon rains have resulted in the loss of 1m tonnes of foodgrain in Bangladesh, officials estimate, reports Reuter from Dhakar. They said the floods, which engulfed more than two-thirds of the country between June and August, destroyed 600,000 acres of crops. The government estimated the cost at Tk7bn (Dollars 175m). 'It is certainly a setback at this moment, when the country has just started exporting grains,' one official said. Bangladesh recently exported 20,000 tonnes of rice to the US and offered to sell 50,000 tonnes to Sri Lanka. The country produced nearly 20m tonnes of rice and wheat in 1992-93 (July-June). Bangladesh, which receives more than Dollars 150m in international food aid annually, still imports more than 1m tonnes of grains, mainly wheat. The wheat is used to implement development projects under the country's Food-for-Work programme. The officials said the government would try to make up the crop losses by increasing winter cultivation, which starts in November. Bangladesh had 1m tonnes of grains in stock, they added.</p>

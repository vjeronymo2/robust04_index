			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Berisford recruits takeover specialist MR DENIS MULHALL is leaving Tomkins, the conglomerate, to join Berisford International, the property and agriculture group, as finance director. He is expected to take up the appointment in the summer. Mr Mulhall's most recent job within Tomkins was at Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling, baking and grocery products company which Tomkins acquired at the end of last year. Mr Mulhall's role at Tomkins was as one of the team which integrated the guns-to-lawnmowers group's acquisitions. He had been working in the US integrating Philips Industries, bought in 1990 for Dollars 550m, before returning to the UK five months ago to work at RHM. His experience is likely to be of benefit at Berisford which is expected to be an acquisitive company. It is currently proposing a Pounds 184m bid for C&amp;J Clark, the private shoe company. Mr Mulhall said that he was leaving Tomkins with 'great sadness' but would have a broader role at Berisford. He was not a main board director at Tomkins. He said the performance of RHM was 'in no way a reason for leaving'. The move to Berisford was 'a wonderful opportunity', he said. He had not known Mr Alan Bowkett, Berisford's chief executive, before and was originally approached by headhunters acting for Berisford. Berisford's proposals will be put to Clark's shareholders at a special meeting on Friday, May 7. Berisford is expected today to make a final appeal to Clark's shareholders to vote in favour of the deal. Mr Mulhall said the move to buy Clark was very exciting. 'Clark has a tremendous brand name which has been under-utilised.'</p>

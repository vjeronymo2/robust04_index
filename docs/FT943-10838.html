			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / CBI rejects Portillo's call to cut business aid The Confederation of British Industry yesterday came down firmly against sweeping cuts in state support for business as the fierce debate over the government's public spending plans gathered momentum at Westminster. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said the organisation supported the government's 'existing tight programme totals' including the maintenance of spending by the Department of Trade and Industry. In yesterday's statement Mr Davies focused particularly on support for British exports, saying it would be 'a great mistake' to cut government backing for overseas trade. He said there was 'solid research' showing that the benefit derived from government support for exports - particularly those of smaller companies in new markets - far outweighed the cost. Many DTI programmes were 'in effect an investment in individual success'. But he said public spending should not be allowed to 'overrun', while the government's Pounds 5bn contingency reserve should be 'used to reduce borrowing, not allocated to programmes'. Mr Davies's intervention followed a call by Mr Michael Portillo, the new employment secretary, for the DTI to accept drastic cuts in a large number of its programmes. The call, which came in a leaked letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, was widely interpreted as an early sign of tensions in the cabinet that could arise as the government struggles to stick to its tough spending targets in this year's Budget. It threatened to shake the uneasy truce between the left and right wings of the Conservative party less than two weeks after Mr John Major's cabinet reshuffle. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday responded to the signs of increased ministerial tension by trying to drive a wedge between Mr Portillo and Mr Jonathan Aitken, his successor as chief Treasury secretary. Mr Cook wrote to Mr Aitken pointing out that his Thanet constituency had recently benefited from regional assistance and asking whether he shared Mr Portillo's view that it should be scrapped. 'I am sure your constituents would also be interested to know whether you share his conclusion that there is no strong case for retaining development areas and that they should move out of the area to find work,' Mr Cook said. Rightwing Tory MPs have voiced confidence that Mr Aitken will take as hard a line on spending as his predecessor.</p>

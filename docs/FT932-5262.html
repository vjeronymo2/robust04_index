			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Launch of a guarded defence - The Pounds 59m bid by Rentokil THE FIRST hostile bid by Rentokil, the fast growing environmental and property services company, has so far been anything but. The Pounds 59.2m cash offer for Securiguard, the guarding and cleaning company, was launched last month at a low-key press conference where Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, said he hoped Securiguard's board would recommend the 270p a share offer. The invitation was repeated in Rentokil's formal offer document, described by one analyst as 'the least hostile in history'. Securiguard's board declined, politely, to do so. There has been no further contact between the two sides. However, there are signs that the phoney war may soon be over. Securiguard yesterday published its defence document, which dismissed Rentokil's offer as derisory. 'Rentokil is hoping to secure a bargain at your expense,' the document said. Mr Alan Baldwin, Securiguard's chairman, may feel he can afford to appear dismissive. His company's shares have traded comfortably above the offer price and closed yesterday at 298p. 'If there's a fair price on the table, then obviously we would talk,' he said in an interview last week. Securiguard is an unsurprising takeover target. After growing rapidly in the late 1980s, chiefly through expensive acquisitions in the UK and US, the company's shares collapsed in 1990 when it released a profits warning amid mounting borrowings. Although borrowings have been reduced by nearly half to Pounds 9.6m, and pre-tax profits increased slightly last year from Pounds 5.03m to Pounds 5.74m, the shares badly lagged the recovery. Rentokil was not the first to spot this buying opportunity. Some of Securiguard's institutional shareholders bought into the company from 1991. The three largest shareholders, holding nearly 30 per cent of the shares, are sitting on potential profits of 50 per cent or more if they accept Rentokil's offer. Given Securiguard's share price, they are instead expected to wait for a higher offer. 'If Rentokil offers 310-320p it may get it. But if the institutions get too greedy, Rentokil may walk away,' one analyst said. Rentokil made its bid mainly because it wants to develop a guarding service. As with previous, successful, forays into areas like tropical plants, the company believes it can earn higher margins than competitors by offering a premium service. It also hopes to offer clients bundles of services, like guarding or building management, to cement customer loyalty. Securiguard's cleaning business would fit with Rentokil's office cleaning and medical services operations. Mr Thompson seemed less interested in Securiguard's courier businesses and its lossmaking personnel division. The security services business includes guarding and man rather than systems management. All hardware and systems work is sub-contracted. Its largest contracts are at London Docklands, where about 120 guards are employed, and at New York's JFK International airport. The guarding industry in the UK includes about 2,000 companies, according to some estimates, although many are very small. It is a low wage and low margin business which has a poor reputation for quality. Mr Baldwin said low margins stemmed from price competition and questioned whether margins of more than 10 per cent were possible, compared with 5 to 6 per cent at present. 'It would need us to persuade clients, who already believe they are getting a good service, to double their prices,' he said. Securiguard's cleaning operations are also low margin and largely rely on price sensitive local and central government contracts. Government contracts account for about 60 per cent of turnover, if the company's hospital contracts subsidiary Mediguard is included. Rentokil has built up a loyal following in the City, which has been impressed by the management's ability to lift margins in businesses as diverse as pest control and building management. In the last 10 years, pre-tax profits have increased from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 122.4m, helped by acquisitions and internal growth. Supporters also see the bid's logic of buying security services customers to grow a new division, and adding volume in cleaning. What worries some observers, however, is a suspicion that Rentokil is putting its determination to maintain earnings growth ahead of business sense. They suspect that Rentokil, faced with slowing organic growth in the UK especially, needed an undervalued takeover to enhance earnings. If so, Mr Thompson faces a painstaking task deciding whether and by how far to raise his bid once the first closing date of June 11 is reached. Meanwhile, Securiguard's defence document took great care not to criticise its predator. Mr Baldwin and his board must realise that if Rentokil walked away, Securiguard's shares would be in danger of reverting to their pre-bid level. 'One has to assume that a slightly higher bid would go through recommended,' an analyst said.</p>

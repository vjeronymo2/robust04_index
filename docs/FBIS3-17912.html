In  his words, both the elections and the poll actually recorded the  existing situation. The deputy prime minister also stressed that  Crimea had no intention of breaking away from Ukraine if a  sensible economic policy is implemented and if the work of the  Crimean leadership is not disrupted. However, it was clear that  this was unrealistic in the near future, Saburov said.    Therefore, Crimea is going to raise the question of special  relations, first and foremost in the economic sphere, and it  will go as far as concluding international treaties.</p>

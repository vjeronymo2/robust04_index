			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy Prime  Minister Nguyen Khanh held a meeting yesterday morning with the  secretary of the party committee and chairman of the people's  committee of Ha Giang Province, together with representatives of  government ministries and sectors at the central level. The  meeting reviewed results of the one-year pilot project in which  Ha Giang was picked by the government as a socioeconomic  development model for the mountain region.    After listening to the reports of Ha Giang leaders on the  implementation of socioeconomic programs in the past year, Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Khanh, and  representatives of government ministries and sectors discussed  socioeconomic programs for Ha Giang in 1994. They suggested  concrete measures for these programs stressing the need to  deploy local resources in the effective use of central  government-subsidized capital. On a per capita basis, this  province receives among the highest subsidy for provinces.    The delegates also discussed the responsibility of  government  ministries and sectors in helping the locality achieve its  socioeconomic targets in accordance with government directives.  Prime Minister stressed that last year's achievements attested  to the great efforts of the party organization and the  multi-ethnic people to overcome all the difficulties a newly  formed province faces in using government assistance  effectively, and in coordinating with central ministries and  sectors.    From the Ha Giang experiment, other mountain provinces can  learn leadership and management at every level, the division of  responsibilities, and coordination between localities and  ministries and sectors at the central level.    On orientations for future economic activities, the prime  minister suggested that Ha Giang Province move from a  self-sufficient and self-reliant economy, and develop  manufacturing in 1994 as a solid base for further progress. The  province should establish areas that specialize in high-value  and high-yield plants, trees, or livestock. It should also set  a dateline to complete the settled-home and settled-farming  campaign for some 500 households, which are still living and  practising nomadic lives and farming, and for over 2,300  households who have now settled down, but are still practicing  nomadic farming. Slash-and-burn farming should be prevented,  reforestation on empty land and bare hills and mountains should  be sped up, and about 2,000 hectares of poor forest need to be  replanted. Small and medium-scale industries should be  developed, especially manufacturing and processing. The prime  minister also reminded the province to develop small  hydroelectricity projects to exploit local energy sources for  industry and daily use.    On social and cultural aspects, the prime minister has urged  Ha Giang to quickly develop the people-initiated education  model, especially in the building of schools. This is so that  in the next two or three years, all local schools would be  properly built structures with tile-roofing and would be able to  take in 60 percent of the children of school-going age who are  not in school at present. In each particular ethnic group,  there should be an appropriate model to promote hygienic living  and eating habits, and family planning. Party cadres and  members and youth federation members should be models. These  criteria should be used in cadre and party member assessment.  The province should also also strive to solve the water  shortage affecting nearly 100,000 people, especially for those  living in mountainous areas.    Cultural activities should be brought to the grassroots  level. The indigenous, cultural characteristics should be  maintained, while obsolete and superstitious practices that  cause losses and wastage should be done away with.    On direction and management, the prime minister has  requested  the relevant ministries and sectors at central level to work out  separate programs for Ha Giang Province in their respective  areas. They should form a specialized team for each specific  area and learn from their experiences.    Various agencies in Ha Giang should work closely with cadres  at district and village levels. Each cadre of the party  committee should be assigned to be responsible for one hamlet or  tribal village. The most capable cadres should be assigned to  be responsible for the most difficult tasks. There should  training be and advanced programs for ethnic cadres selected  from mass movements, especially in remote and inaccessible areas.</p>

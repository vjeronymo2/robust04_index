			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 16 (AFP) -- A draft European Union  plan to fight unemployment through investments and business  deregulation ran into strong opposition from Britain and Germany  here on Monday [16 May].    European Commission president Jacques Delors urged foreign  ministers to push the plan forward over the heads of finance  ministers who were meeting separately and are balking at finding  money for massive capital investments.    Delors also objected to a German proposal that all EU  legislation be reviewed by a panel of independent experts with a  view to identifying and scrapping laws which hinder business  activity and the creation of new jobs.    Delors, the EU's chief executive, said he was in "total  disagreement" with the proposal from German Economics Minister  Guenther Rexrodt because it would give outsiders power over EU  decision-making.    But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke,  weighing in with the Germans, told journalists that Delors was  the perfect illustration "of how a bureaucracy will not reform  its own procedures."    Germany and Britain remain in the forefront of countries  which insist that the EU rely largely on the private sector to  finance a 120 billion ECU (135 billion dollar) investment plan  launched by EU leaders last December.    They want to build an infrastructure of transportation,  energy and telecommunication networks spanning Europe, in order  to support business and put more people to work.    German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Ursula Seiler-  Albring said that Bonn would not accept that the EU raise more  money to finance these projects in addition to the lending  capacity of the EU's European Investment Bank.    Clarke agreed. "There are enormous amounts of private  capital  available across Europe," he said.    But Delors insisted that some proposed projects might not be  attractive to private investors because they were too  environmentally-demanding or too long-term.    The private sector was more interested in 10-year  investments  than projects which might take three decades to complete, he  said.    Earlier this year the commission proposed that the EU raise  a  six-year loan of 48 billion ECU (54 billion dollar) to finance  some of the projects, which include highways, highspeed railways  and a trans-Alpine rail crossing.    In the face of general scepticism on the part of finance  ministers, the EU executive has since dropped all public  reference to the extent of financing needs.    But Delors warned that the growth plan, which is supposed to  be the centrepiece of an EU summit next June, would make little  progress unless the EU showed quickly that it was ready to back  its projects with public loans.    Clarke said the EU was making little headway on the other  major plank of the plan -- to lighten non-wage costs for  European businessmen which include labour regulations and social  charges to support welfare systems.    Supporting the German proposition for an independent study  of  EU law, the British chancellor said: "You cannot make progress  on deregulation if you leave it to your own bureaucracy."    However, French Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery said he  doubted the need for outside checks on the EU's work.</p>

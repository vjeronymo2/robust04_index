			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Latin autocrats MOST LATIN American governments will welcome President Clinton's revival of the idea of a western hemisphere free trade area first proposed by his predecessor, George Bush. Unfortunately, this particular revival will last barely one week if the US House of Representatives votes down the North American Free Trade Agreement on Wednesday. The US Congress is not the only obstacle. The idea assumes the existence of a community of market-oriented democracies in Latin America. But while most governments of the region are now elected, the authoritarianism of past decades has not been buried. The continued attraction of autocratic or charismatic leaders arises not least because of the poor performance by many elected governments. Electorates have been given too many reasons for viewing politics as a stale confrontation between government institutions remote from them. This fatigue with the political system is why Peruvians were willing to back the overturning of constitutional order by President Alberto Fujimori in April 1992, and to support his new constitution (if in rather a lukewarm fashion) in last week's referendum. It is also why Venezuelans did not react more strongly to the threat to democracy posed by two military coup attempts last year, and why a politician - Rafael Caldera - offering more in the way of personalismo than policies is leading the field in next month's elections. Yet the exercise of personal power damages prospects for what Latin America really does need: more representative democratic institutions, fair legal systems and freedom from the uncertainty bred by authoritarianism. Fortunately, the continued allure of the autocrat is not the only thing happening in Latin America. In many countries, Venezuela and Brazil being two, government is being decentralised and people given the right to elect their local political leaders. Elsewhere, politicians are giving thought to legal reform. A legal system subordinate to the executive, along with a corrupt judiciary offers a poor environment for the development of the market economies most Latin American governments now say they want. Contracts become impossible to enforce reliably. Credit becomes hard to get and expensive, because it is difficult for lenders to pursue claims for collateral. Without a proper institutional background, the long-term private investment Latin America desperately needs will, in these days of free global movement of capital, find another home. It has often been argued, from both the left and the right in Latin America, that an authoritarian system is necessary to sustain economic freedom and a market economy. If it were ever true, it looks a dubious proposition today. Markets need rules and they need an effective state to enforce them, but they are endangered by the arbitrary exercise of power.</p>

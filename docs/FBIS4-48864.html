			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Charles Taylor, the leader of the National Patriotic  Front of Liberia [NPFL], says he also has a problem with the  Nigerians who have the biggest contingent in ECOMOG [Economic  Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group].  His NPFL is currently fighting the Liberian Peace Council, LPC,  in the southeast. Tonight, Mr. Taylor called us up from Gbarnga  to complain about ECOMOG and he said the Nigerians were being  less than helpful. On the line, Robin White asked him what the  problem was.    [Begin recording] [Taylor] Well, Robin, the problem is that  the LPC is organized and put together by the Nigerian part of  ECOMOG here. There has been an intensification of the war in  the Rivercess and Sinoe areas and it is traced directly to the  Nigerians. We do not understand why the Nigerians, instead of  making peace in Liberia, are just trying to exacerbate the  situation. We just don't understand this, whether we should  have to fight them now and the LPC or just continue with the LPC.    [White] Are you threatening to fight the Nigerians?    [Taylor] Well, I am saying that I don't know who the enemy  is, and we have to fight the enemy and they appear to be the  enemy.    [White] Well, how can you possibly say that? Surely, the  Nigerians are there to try and bring peace.    [Taylor] Robin, everywhere in the world right now, the  information is clear. We have POW's that testify that arms and  ammunition are being given by the Nigerians. As you very well  know, under the Security Council resolution there is an arms  embargo on Liberia. Where else can a brand new group, external  to the Cotonou [Accord], get sophisticated arms and ammunitions  unless these rascals are selling them arms and ammunition? And,  it is very aggravating. Liberians are dying here daily and the  problem is no longer Liberians themselves. It is those that are  here to keep the peace, and especifically the Nigerian  contingent.    [White] Some people might say that the problem is that you  are losing the war and you are looking for a scapegoat.    [Taylor] Robin, even if we were losing the war, we want to  lose it in a very clear way. We are not losing the war, but the  problem here is if you have people that say that they are  peacekeepers and are just trying to make money by selling arms  and ammunition and shedding the blood of Liberians, the question  is: Will this crisis stop now or is it doomed to expand? And we  are fed up with this particular situation and we may have to go  after LPC wherever we have to go.    [White] How bad are things looking for you, militarily?    [Taylor] Not very bad, but the problem is the peacekeeprs  should not be (?giving) arms and ammunition. Our officials are  being harassed. They are being disrespected. They have no  regard for this government here. I am not sure that these guys  can do the job here, or if they should just pack up, and if I  had a choice I think the Nigerians should think about leaving us  alone because they have gone too far.

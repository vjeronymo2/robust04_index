			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 27 SAPA -- A second assembly point has  been set up for former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation --  ANC military wing; MK] and Azanian Peoples Liberation Army  [APLA] soldiers at Hoedspruit in the Eastern Transvaal.    Members of the armed wings of the African National Congress  and the Pan Africanist Congress would arrive shortly from  Tanzania, said Lt-Col Brian du Toit, media spokesman of the  Joint Operations Centre at Walmanstal.    Walmanstal, north of Pretoria, was the first base activated  to train non-statutory force (NSF) members for eventual  integration into the South African National Defence Force  [SANDF].    An advance party of the Walmanstal non-statutory forces had  been sent to Hoedspruit to assist in preparation of the assembly  point. They would complete their orientation training together  with the new arrivals, Col du Toit said. "Once the process of  documentation and initial training has been completed suitable  candidates will be offered a service contract with the SANDF and  will then proceed with his/her career training."    A joint operations centre consisting of SANDF and NSF  personnel had been established to co-ordinate all queries,  control and disciplinary actions at Hoedspruit, Col du Toit  said. The Hoedspruit base would eventually accommodate 1,500  troops, he added.    Col du Toit told SAPA about 6,400 soldiers were currently  accommodated at Walmanstal and "things were running pretty  smoothly".    The third base earmarked earlier as an assembly point,  Bourke's Luck, would not be activated because it was not  economically viable, he said.</p>

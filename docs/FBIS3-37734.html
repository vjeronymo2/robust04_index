			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to the message of the Ukrainian radio  broadcast on Tuesday evening, in his interview with Radio  Svoboda President Leonid Kravchuk declared about his intention  not to participate in the presidential elections scheduled for  June 26, 1994.    Explaining his move, he said that in his opinion it is  hardly  expedient to hold elections so soon. Kravchuk believes that  presidential elections, to be held immediately after the  parliamentary elections on March 27, will result in the  excessive politicizing of society.    The second reason he gave for his unwillingness to run was  the fact that he now bears a part of the responsibility for the  present social and economic situation in Ukraine as "a man who  is currently working." In his opinion, in the case of his  participation, his contenders would spend their forces not to  develop constructive programs but to prove that the present  president has failed to fulfill his duties.    A commentator of the Ukrainian radio expressed regret due to  the fact that this statement was provided for Radio Svoboda but  not for the state TV and radio company. According to the  commentator, "the presidential explanations do not look  persuasive." "There are more questions than answers in the  president's statement," said the commentator who preferred to  stay anonymous.</p>

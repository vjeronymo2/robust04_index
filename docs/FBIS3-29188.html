			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic  planner Monday [14 February] welcomed the government's budget  for fiscal 1994, starting April 1, as placing emphasis on  outlays to shore up the flagging economy.    The economy remains broadly sluggish and is expected to  continue to face rough going for a while, said Manae Kubota,  director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). She was  speaking at a press meeting after negotiating on revisions to  the budget, due out Tuesday, with Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii.    Kubota said her agency has requested the government to focus  on the economy, and stressed, "we cannot move freely unless the  economy recovers."    In this sense, she pinned hopes on the government's budget  along with the 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package launched last  week.    Despite tight revenues, the Finance Ministry maintained  growth at the 4 percent level in public works spending in its  budget draft announced Thursday.    The government is to decide on a budget package at a cabinet  meeting Tuesday after ministers negotiate separately throughout  Monday with Fujii in a final bid to revive items that the  Finance Ministry cut.</p>

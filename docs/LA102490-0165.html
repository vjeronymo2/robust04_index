			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DRIFTING DOW MANAGES TO CLOSE 10.15 HIGHER  </P> <P> The stock market drifted in a narrow range today, continuing the indecisive  pattern that has prevailed since the start of the week.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.15 to 2,504.21.  </P> <P> Advancing issues nosed out declines on the New York Stock Exchange, with 758  up, 718 down and 493 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 149.29 million shares, against 146.30 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index inched up .10 to 170.60.  </P> <P> The price of crude oil for December delivery climbed more than $1.50 a barrel,  to the neighborhood of $31 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> Analysts said that helped to put a damper on buying interest in the stock  market, along with persistent worries about the economic outlook.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported that new factory orders for durable goods  dropped 1.7% in September, on top of a downward-revised decline of 0.8% in  August.  </P> <P> The latest decrease stemmed mainly from a drop in transportation orders, which  are often subject to wide short-term fluctuations. But brokers said it still  came as something of an unpleasant surprise to investors.  </P> <P> Government bond prices slumped today as investors fled the market in disgust  over lawmakers' inability to forge a deficit-reduction bill.  </P> <P> The Treasury's key 30-year bond, which fell 1/2 point on Tuesday, was off 3/16  point, or $1.88 per $1,000 in face amount at midday. Its yield, which rises  when the price falls, advanced to 8.81% from 8.79% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Also depressing the market today was a spike upward in oil prices over the  $30-a-barrel level. The move comes after a steep, week-long decline in energy  costs.  </P> <P> Analysts said there was no reaction to a Commerce Department report showing  orders to U.S. factories for "big-ticket" durable goods plunged 1.7% in  September, the third decline in the last four months.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities were  unchanged to 1/32 point lower, intermediate maturities fell by between 1/32  point and 1/8 point and long-term issues fell 5/32 point, the Telerate Inc.  financial information service reported.  </P></p>

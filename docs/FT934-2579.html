			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (5): Liberalisation pays off  -Latin American attracts more investors Many oil companies are taking a renewed interest in Latin America, where the trend is towards liberalisation of oil sectors and encouragement of foreign investment. Mr John Browne, managing director of BP Exploration, confirmed recently that 'investment has come to Latin America because the resource base exists and because the countries of Latin America have established a very receptive fiscal and regulatory climate. If that situation is maintained, there is no obstacle to the fulfilment of Latin America's potential in terms of production and export capacity'. But the transformation of Latin America into a region with a unique blend of foreign private and state involvement is not yet fulfilled. It is not yet clear that the changes effected can be serve as a model for other regions seeking to expand their oil and gas sectors. Its production potential has never been in doubt. US companies in particular have long been involved in exploration and production, along with several European oil majors. The oil shocks of the 1970s and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 served as a reminder to the US of the strategic importance of alternative fuel sources, particularly when they are so much closer geographically. But political risks (in the region which invented oil nationalism) proved unacceptably high for many companies in the 1970s and 1980s. Latin America's turnaround started with the spread of economic orthodoxy which followed the debt shock of the mid-1980s. Governments sought to open up their economies to make them more competitive, reduce spending and control inflation as requirements for the restructuring of foreign debt and to secure much-needed foreign capital investments. Key aims of the oil and gas industries have been to secure foreign capital and technological injections not easily available domestically, and generally to work in partnership with the state company. Mexico and possibly Brazil are opening up some areas to foreign involvement while retaining overall control. Other main regional producers are showing greater flexibility. Partnership represents the most viable path for Latin America and potentially for other developing areas. For example, the Venezuelan Congress recently approved the development with Shell, Exxon and Mitsubishi of offshore gasfields and export of LNG to the US, at an outlay of Dollars 7bn. Agreements have also been reached with Conoco and Total, Ituchi and Marubeni to produce extra heavy crude, with investment outlays of Dollars 3.5bn. Interest in exploration in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia and Argentina is currently high. The Ecuadorean government is shortly to issue exploration licences for 2.2m hectares. So far, 100 foreign oil companies have expressed interest and 50 have bought detailed documents on the Oriente (Amazon) and offshore blocks. Oil and gas pipeline contractors ware seeking to benefit from major construction projects in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. At the other extreme, Argentina in 1993 privatised its state oil company YPF. But this is unlikely to serve as a model for the rest of Latin America. Although YPF is said to be the oldest state oil company in the world, it has never been the kind of nationalist symbol that Pemex was for Mexico. Full privatisation of state oil and gas companies would, if desired, prove nigh-impossible in most countries. For this reason, Mexico insisted on retaining Pemex's privileged status when signing the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The position of Mexican President Carlos Menem is also stronger than that of most of his contemporaries. Success in attracting foreign companies will therefore depend on the terms of the contracts offered and on governments' willingness to stick to them. Latin America petroleum specialist Dr Chris Brogan says that if Latin America is to attract the finance necessary to develop its oil potential, 'it must ensure that contractual terms on offer are as good if not better than those being offered elsewhere in the world'. He adds that investors who their fingers badly burnt in the past must be convinced that contractual terms, once agreed, are not subjected to sudden, unilateral change. The need for Latin America to provide the best contracts possible becomes more acute given difficult operating conditions in many countries. Governments remain over-bureaucratic and occasionally corrupt, while exploration and production sites can be in remote areas with poor communications. There are high security risks in Colombia, where ultra-leftist guerrillas prey on the oil and gas sector, and Peru, where Shining Path guerrillas are not a beaten force. Two failed coups in 1992 in Venezuela did not directly affect the oil and gas sector but destabilised the country. In Venezuela the lead-up to the December 3 elections indicated a popular opposition to neo-liberal solutions which is likely to be echoed elsewhere in Latin America in 1994. It is unlikely that this mood change will result in attempts markedly to change oil and gas policies, though it may limit the extent to which governments such as Colombia can implement plans to make existing and future association contracts more competitive. Furthermore, the extractive industries are under pressure from environmental and indigenous groups. In Ecuador, the allocation of new oil exploration blocks in January is prompting increased controversy over the environmental impact of oil operations, particularly in Amerindian areas. Amerindian representatives began legal proceedings against Texaco in New York on November 3 in a bid to win Dollars 1.5bn-worth of compensation for environmental damage. This has implications for the region as a whole, and companies can help themselves by strict environmental controls and good relations with the grassroots in their areas of operation. In general, nothing succeeds like success. The reawakening of interest in Latin America was guaranteed in 1992 when a British Petroleum-led consortium discovered a big field in eastern Colombia, since identified as one of the Western Hemisphere's largest finds for 20 years. BP hopes to reach production of 150,000 b/d from Cusiana by the end of 1995 (this would represent a third of national production at today's levels), rising to 600,000 b/d thereafter. More such oil and gas finds would have a galvanising effect in the country concerned and sustain interest in Latin America as a whole. Under these circumstances, oil and gas companies will continue to tolerate difficult operating conditions if host governments behave supportively and avoid arbitrary actions.

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / French trawler skipper arrested THE SKIPPER of the French trawler La Calypso, which abducted three Royal Navy officers on Sunday, was under arrest last night. Earlier his vessel had been boarded by officers from the fisheries protection vessel HMS Jersey and escorted into St Peter Port, Guernsey, in the Channel Islands. The vessel was detained for failing to obey lawful commands on Sunday, when three naval officers who had boarded it because of suspicions that it was fishing illegally in British waters were held on board and taken to Cherbourg, France. La Calypso was boarded close to the British six-mile limit, the Ministry of Agriculture said. The French maritime authority in Cherbourg said La Calypso was 'totally at fault' in sailing into British waters. But a spokeswoman for the French fishermen of lower Normandy accused the Royal Navy of 'severe provocation'. France's new conservative government has moved swiftly to try to quell the fishermen's protests. Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, at a meeting in Paris with Mr Douglas Hurd, his British counterpart, yesterday reiterated France's commitment to maintain the existing Franco-British agreement on Channel Islands fishing. Mr Edouard Balladur, the new French prime minister, announced that he would meet fishermen's leaders on Tuesday. Last weekend's clash followed weeks of violent protests from French fishermen who want restraints on fish imports.</p>

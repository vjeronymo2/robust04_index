			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE OPPOSES NEW FSX LIMITS;  </P> <P> BUSH HAS 'GRAVE CONCERNS' ABOUT SENATE AMENDMENT  </P> <P> The White House today voiced "grave concerns" over a Senate amendment placing  new restrictions on the U.S.-Japanese FSX jet fighter project, claiming that it  could erode presidential authority.  </P> <P> Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush told House Republicans  that his Administration will work against the amendment, sponsored by Sen.  Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), when the measure gets to a House-Senate conference.  </P> <P> Bush met with GOP members in the Capitol at mid-morning.  </P> <P> Earlier, the State Department said new restrictions imposed by the Senate on  the plan to co-produce the sophisticated new jet with Japan may force the  renegotiation of parts of the agreement.  </P> <P> Japan said today that it will proceed with plans to develop its next jet  fighter with the United States but that it remains capable of producing the  plane alone. Defense Agency chief Kichiro Tazawa expressed Tokyo's irritation  over the Senate vote during a televised session of a parliamentary budget  committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called Unnecessary  </P> <P> The Senate approved the project on a 52-47 vote Tuesday. But then it adopted,  72 to 27, Byrd's amendment to tighten the conditions under which co-development  and co-production would take place.  </P> <P> Bush "was very pleased by the overall vote. But we do have very grave concerns  about the Byrd amendment," Fitzwater said today. "Generally, it creates a  system of congressional approval over these kinds of projects that we consider  to be erosive of presidential power."  </P> <P> The amendment prohibits the transfer of advanced jet engine technology to the  Japanese, in Byrd's words, "under any circumstances."  </P> <P> Even before Tuesday's vote, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger  made it known that the Administration regarded the new directives as  unnecessary and likely to trigger new and long negotiations.  </P> <P> The votes came after two days of debate in which senators emotionally and  angrily denounced Japan for what they called unfair trade competition and  sounded warnings that the deal could threaten U.S. dominance of the aerospace  industry by transferring vital technology to Japanese industry.  </P> <P> "It would be foolhardy not to be vigilant in protecting our aircraft industry  and the vital technologies associated with it," Byrd said. "This nation needs  to get our economic relationship with Japan on a saner and sounder track."  </P> <P> The amendment was opposed by the Administration, and Senate Republican leader  Bob Dole of Kansas dubbed it a "killer amendment" that would require the  reopening of negotiations with the Japanese government.  </P></p>

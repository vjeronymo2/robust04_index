			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REPORTS ON DROPOUTS MET WITH SKEPTICISM;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: NEW COMPUTERIZED ATTENDANCE RECORD SYSTEM IN CENTINELA VALLEY UNION  HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT SHOWS DRAMATIC DECREASE IN THE DROPOUT RATE.  </P> <P> Figures released by the Centinela Valley Union High School District that show a  significant decrease in the dropout rate over the last two years have caught  three school board members by surprise.  </P> <P> A state report released on Dec. 4 said the overall dropout rate for grades 10,  11 and 12 for the 1986-87 school year was 16% at Hawthorne High School and  11.9% at Leuzinger High School.  </P> <P> Three days later, Centinela administrators released figures that showed the  dropout rate for 1987-88 was 14.6% at Hawthorne and 11.5% at Leuzinger. The  dropout rate took a further dive to 8.9% at Hawthorne and 5.7% at Leuzinger in  1988-89, according to the district.  </P> <P> Supt. McKinley Nash said the decrease can be attributed to a number of factors,  including a new computerized attendance reporting system, which keeps more  accurate dropout figures, as well as several special programs aimed at keeping  students in school.  </P> <P> Three school board members said the new dropout numbers have caught them by  surprise, and two of them questioned the accuracy of the district's figures.  </P> <P> "I don't know anything about a special program that has reduced (the dropout  rate) so dramatically," said board member Jacqueline Carrera, who was elected  in November. "If it's true, we should be marketing this."  </P> <P> Another new board member, Pam Sturgeon, said she is not convinced that the  district's dropout rates could have dropped so much in such a short time.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned I don't feel they're accurate," said Sturgeon, who  said she also suspects that the dropout rates from previous years were too  high.  </P> <P> Board President Ruth Morales said she is also skeptical about the accuracy of  the district's dropout figures and said she would like to study the numbers  further.  </P> <P> "I have problems giving out reports that we have performed miracles" in such a  short time, she said.  </P> <P> The other two board members, Amparo Font and Michael Escalante, could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> James Fulton, educational demographics manager for the state Department of  Education, said he could not comment specifically on the Centinela district,  but it is possible for dropout numbers to change dramatically when a district  switches to a new attendance keeping system.  </P> <P> The dropout rate was a major point of debate during the November school board  elections. During the campaign, Sturgeon, an accounts analyst, and Carrera, an  accountant, both criticized the district dropout rate and said they would like  administrators to study ways to reduce it.  </P> <P> Sturgeon, Carrera and Font, a bilingual teacher, won the three board seats,  replacing incumbents Ann Birdsall, Aleta Collins and Herbert D. Bartelt.  </P> <P> Nash dismissed the skepticism and the questions about accuracy. "The numbers  are there," he said. "Talk to the principals. I don't compile them."  </P> <P> He said the dropout problem is at "epidemic proportions" in schools throughout  the country, but he said Centinela officials have been making an extra effort  to address the problem.  </P> <P> Nash said the new computer system the district introduced this year to keep  attendance records at the two high schools has produced a dropout rate that is  more accurate and lower than previously believed.  </P> <P> The system keeps attendence records and transfer information on computer files  so that school officials can more quickly and more accurately monitor students  who transfer in and out of the district, he said.  </P> <P> School officials said part of the reason it is difficult to keep accurate  dropout figures is because about half of the student population enters or  leaves the district each year.  </P> <P> Ed Gilliam, associate principal at Leuzinger High School, said the dropout rate  has been significantly reduced through several programs created by the Students  at Risk Committee, a group of 14 teachers, administrators, department heads and  clerical workers, which was formed 2 1/2 years ago to tackle the dropout  problem.  </P> <P> The group meets once a month to discuss ways to keep students from leaving  school, he said.  </P> <P> Among the programs designed by the committee is a work-training program that  enrolls students in vocational and technical training courses at the South  Coast Regional Occupational Center in Torrance.  </P> <P> In September, most of the 600 students in that program were absorbed into the  district's Jobs for America Graduates program, a highly touted work-training  and job-placement plan used in 280 other schools in 14 states.  </P> <P> Two years ago the committee also created the Mathematics Video Program, which  lets students check out video tape recordings of teachers explaining  mathematics lessons, Gilliam said. The program is advantageous, he said,  because it allows students with math problems to take as much time as needed to  study math lessons at home.  </P> <P> The committee also established a program requiring truant students to attend  school on Saturday to make up for missed class time, he said. Gilliam said the  truancy program provides a deterrent for students who are regularly truant.  </P> <P> Nancy M. Nuesseler, president of the 200-member Centinela Valley Secondary  Teachers Assn., said she too is skeptical of the dropout figures because she  believes the programs aimed at reducing the dropout rate have not had enough  time to take effect.  </P> <P> "I really don't know what the programs are accomplishing," she said. "We are  not given any feedback from the district."  </P> <P> Sheila Steachowiak, president of the Centinela Valley Council PTA, said she is  happy to hear about the reduced dropout rates but is concerned that the  district is not paying enough attention to college-bound and special education  students.  </P> <P> "There are lots of needs out there for the kids that I feel haven't been met,"  she said. Steachowiak has a son who graduated from Hawthorne High School last  year and now attends El Camino College and another who graduated three years  ago from the district's special education program.  </P> <P> Nash said the district's efforts to reduce the number of dropouts have not been  at the expense of college-bound students. He said the district has many  successful programs aimed at getting students into college and added that he  has been criticized by some teachers for putting too great an emphasis on  college preparation.  </P> <P> Ken Crowe, principal of Hawthorne High School, said he is not surprised by the  lower dropout rates, because he believes the dropout figures the district has  been using in the past were not accurate.  </P> <P> He said the new computer system is providing the district information about  dropouts that is "much more accurate and realistic."  </P> <P> Crowe said he is confident the dropout rate will continue to decrease with the  help of other programs the district has implemented, such as the Truancy  Abatement Program. Under this program, Hawthorne police officers pick up truant  students they encounter during routine patrols and return them to the school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TRACKING HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATES  </P> <P> The Centinela Valley Union High School District released these figures showing  a decrease in the district's dropout rate in the past two school years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HAWTHORNE HIGH SCHOOL

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Economic data upset share prices THE LATEST data on the domestic economy unsettled the London stock market badly yesterday. However, shares rallied well before the close on hopes that the unexpected fall in manufacturing output will limit the scale of any tax increases in next month's budget from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Base rate optimism remained a factor, in spite of the rise in September annualised inflation rate and consequent easing in the pound. The FT-SE Index closed 13.8 down at 3,080.9 but had rallied from the day's low in the 3,071 area to which it had fallen after the announcement of a 0.4 per cent dip in UK manufacturing output in August. The stock market had already reacted badly to news that annualised inflation had risen by 1.8 per cent in September, for the third consecutive monthly increase. These statistics 'must be a clear disappointment to the stock market and the chancellor of the exchequer,' commented one of the market's leading economic commentators. However, the indication that the economic recovery in the UK is still fragile and inflation by no means dead means, according to equity strategists, that the scope of the chancellor to increase taxes in November is now 'very limited indeed'. For the near term view in the stock market, this sounded like relatively good news and the initial setback in shares was soon checked. Helped by a similar rally in bonds and by continuing firmness in short sterling, the stock market reduced its losses and trading volume increased. By the close, Seaq volume had jumped to 659.2m shares from the 537.1m of the previous session. Tuesday's retail trading value of Pounds 1.24bn confirmed the healthy levels of genuine investment activity. Non-Footsie business, at around 56 per cent of the Seaq total, was around daily average levels. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index followed the market trend, shedding 6.6 points to 3,468.3. Retail and consumer issues gave up a few pence on increased trading volume as investors assessed the outlook for interest rate prospects following the statistics on the UK economy. Building and construction shares, additionally unsettled this week by reports that public infrastructure spending may be targeted in next month's budget, suffered further losses. The blue chip international stocks, however, were left on the sidelines as attention focused on the domestic economy. With Wall Street quiet overnight and only about 5 points up in its new session during London hours, there was little lead for the transatlantic issues. Both oil and pharmaceutical stocks were a few pence easier amid signs that the institutions were shuffling portfolios in these heavily-weighted sectors rather than changing their investment stance towards them. Today brings another round of important UK economic data, with the stock market likely to focus on the unemployment figures for last month which will now be scanned with increased attention for evidence of the pace of economic recovery. Forecasts range from around 5,000 either side of the previous month's total. Also due today are the latest earnings and unit wage costs.</p>

He was born in Homel, where he completed his high  school education. He graduated from the Moscow Institute of  International Relations. Sychow has been working at the  Belarusian Foreign Ministry for 15 years. He has gone up all  rungs of the diplomatic ladder, from attache to deputy foreign  minister. He worked at the Belarus Diplomatic Mission to the  United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva.  Alyaksandr Sychow speaks English, French, and Spanish.    [Lakhmanenka] Alyaksandr Mikalayevich, what is the  attitude of the United Nations attitude toward Belarus in  general? I believe that it is not very good. I have drawn this  conclusion, for example, from the fact that the amount of our  financial contribution to the United Nations has been increased  at a time when our economy is being transformed into a market  economy, and our Republic is spending huge amounts of money on  eliminating the aftermath of the Chernobyl catastrophe. Now we  are supposed to contribute more than certain other European  countries, that are in much better shape than we. Why? I have  the impression that you have been sent to New York to ease the  situation. Is that true?    [Sychow] I believe that the world's attitude toward us, and  the way we are treated by international organizations, reflects  the real position of Belarus in the international community. To  say that we are treated by them deliberately unfairly is, to say  the least, unjustified. I must, however, frankly admit that we  have certain grievances against the United Nations.    The news about the increase in our contribution to the UN  budget was received rather bitterly in our Republic. I think  that the UN General Assembly was too formal when it voted on the  increase. The same lot also befell our southern neighbor  Ukraine and other republics of the former Soviet Union. If you  do not mind, I would like to dwell on this issue, particularly  since this has not always been reported or described  objectively, including by the press.    [Lakhmanenka] Excuse me, but I think that our readers  would also like to know your viewpoint. Although much has been  said about this unpleasant surprise, people do not know enough  about all the reasons behind this -- to put it politely --  unpopular UN decision.    [Sychow] There are several aspects to this problem. When  the distribution of the Soviet Union's contributions among the  countries established on the territory of the Union was  discussed, the UN Committee for Contributions dealt with the  issue mechanically. An entire range of procedural and  methodological miscalculations and errors were committed.  Moreover, the committee fulfilled the recommendation of the  so-called "powerful" states which did not want those  contributions to be distributed among other UN member states.    According to procedures, additional contributions by new  members and the amount that is lost when a country leaves the  United Nations should be dealt with and distributed taking into  account the entire amount of the contributions. As a matter of  fact, the amount would have had to be reexamined, and this,  believe me, is very hard work. The committee, of course,  preferred to avoid this task.    Russia's stance played no small role in this. The Russians  wanted to shed the financial responsibilities inherited from the  USSR as quickly as possible.    It was not taken into account that Belarus and Ukraine were  among the founders of the United Nations. Nobody paid attention  to the fact that the UN General Session, which preceded the UN  General Assembly, had earlier defined Belarus' contribution at  0.31 percent of the UN budget.    What did the committee recommend in this situation? It  distributed the Soviet Union's contribution among the former  Soviet republics in the same way as the USSR's foreign debt was  divided among the CIS countries. To avoid additional  contributions, Belarus and Ukraine were included in the list.  This was improper in terms of legality and procedure.    An abnormal situation was thus created. Belarus and Ukraine,  countries that had been among the founders of the United  Nations, were treated like new members.    There is another interesting aspect to this issue, which is  glossed over in silence by media observers. Today, the issue of  Belarus' contribution is being related only to the activities of  the Foreign Ministry, while the most important fact is being  kept concealed: The contributions by a member country are  estimated on the basis of its GNP, its population size, and the  ruble's exchange rate against the dollar for the last ten  years of economic development.    It is 1994 now, and the basis for estimates begins from  1984.  The economic performance of our Republic was different then.  Therefore, the economic situation in Belarus looks generally  better than in Greece, Hungary, and many other countries. As  you know, the economic situation is actually not so rosy in  Belarus.    The reasons behind the overestimated contribution lie in the  Soviet heritage and statistical data that did not reflect the  levels of economic development. Do you think it is easy for the  Foreign Ministry and its officials to defend their position on  the contribution when there are no reliable state statistics?    On the other hand, although the Baltics -- Latvia,  Lithuania,  and Estonia -- believed that their contributions would amount to  0.01 percent, they are, respectively -- 0.13, 0.15, and 0.07  percent. It was the same situation with Kazakhstan, Moldova,  Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and other CIS countries. In those  countries, however, they are not looking for scapegoats, but are  trying to put together appropriate statistics.    The issue of contributions to the UN budget is very complex,  and is connected with the activities of various state  institutions, first of all, the State Committee for Statistics,  the Finance Ministry, the State Committee for Economic Planning,  and the National Bank, which define the above-mentioned figures.    [Lakhmanenka] As they say, what happened, happened.  Has our country really put up with this unfair decision? Is  there nothing left for us to do but wave our arms in a gesture  of helplessness?    [Sychow] Of course, we will not be sitting idly, as certain  politicians and observers are predicting. First of all, the  Republic of Belarus has not recognized this decision, and it is  not going to pay the contribution that was calculated according  to the reexamined scale. Moreover, we have not recently  transferred a single dollar of the additional amounts to the UN  accounts. Our Republic endorses the special position on  financing peacekeeping operations from the UN budget.    Thanks to the efforts of our diplomats at the latest UN  session, recommendations for formulating a new scale of  contributions for 1995-1997 were approved, and the  methodological mistakes that were committed with regard to  Belarus and Ukraine will be taken into account in the future.  This way, perhaps the entire scale of contributions will be  reexamined. However, we see certain obstacles that are  connected with the data on our economic development. Compromise  has almost been reached that the basis for calculations will be  reduced to seven or eight years. This gives good grounds for  reducing our contribution to the UN budget.    [Lakhmanenka] Well, although the problem of  contributions has been more or less clarified, it is still not  clear how we were "routed" in the elections for the UN Security  Council. Belarus, as you have already said, is one of the UN  founders. All Belarusian diplomacy was connected with the  activities of UN international bodies. The Republic's image in  the eyes of the international community is quite good following  its abandonment of nuclear weapons, and suddenly such a failure  occurs. Why?    [Sychow] I would not dramatize what happened in the  elections and say that it was a big failure that Belarus was not  elected a member of the UN Security Council. The defeat of any  state in the elections is not considered by the United Nations  as something extraordinary. For instance, Sweden, which  commands great authority and has been neutral for a long time,  lost in the elections to New Zealand. Nevertheless, Sweden has  not lost its world prestige and influence.    We have analyzed the situation very carefully and have drawn  our own conclusions. I would like to point out that the results  of elections reflect the actual rating of Belarus in the world.  This is a specific evaluation of our country. However, we also  see this as a certain line in relations with CIS countries. For  example, Kazakhstan lost the elections for the UN Economic and  Social Council, and Russia was not elected chairman of the  UNESCO Executive Council.    Regarding these elections, the principle of rotation was  breached in our regional group. There is a UN rule that  candidacies are discussed in regional groups. For example,  along with the West European, African, Latin American, and Asian  groups, there is also the East European one including Belarus.  Earlier, it comprised 10 countries, now it has 20.    Every state has the right to be represented in the Security  Council. We applied for membership in the Security Council in  1987. Prior to that, Belarus had only once been a member of the  council -- from 1974 to 1975. It must be said that we always  respected other countries and made room for them. This time,  however, we decided to put forward our candidacy.    Later, Czechoslovakia also proposed its candidacy. When such  a situation occurs, it should be discussed within a group to  avoid extensive competition. In the first place, we agreed with  Czechoslovakia that it would withdraw its candidacy for our  benefit, since it had already been a member of the Security  Council two times -- most recently from 1978 to 1979. Certain  countries from our group have been members three or four times.    Czechoslovakia, however, was soon divided into the Czech  Republic and Slovakia. The leadership of the Czech Republic  decided to argue over seats in the Security Council. Although  we held numerous consultations with the Czech Foreign Ministry,  we did not reach any compromise.    [Lakhmanenka] These are very interesting details. We  do not know much about the mechanism of UN operations. I think  that the Czech Republic won the elections not only because it  put forward its own candidacy. It also conducted a secret  electoral campaign, as everybody knows.    [Sychow] The situation that existed in the United Nations at  that time did not guarantee us victory. Many subjective and  objective reasons prevented our victory. I would relate the  subjective reasons to the fact that Belarus' contribution to the  improvement of global security and disarmament is not adequately  appreciated in the world. The West's rigid assessments of  Belarus' economic and democratic reforms and statements that we  are following Russia's foreign policy also played an important  role. I do not, however, agree with these opinions.  Unfortunately, all this was taken into account during the vote.    The lack of ability to conduct appropriate work at our  embassies was the real reason why we lost the electoral race to  the Czechs. Wile the Czech Republic has more than 70 embassies,  we have only 14.    We must also not forget the popularity of Czech President  Vaclav Havel as a politician and a person. The activeness of  the Czech side was amazing. On the eve of the vote, the Czech  prime minister toured Latin American countries where he tried to  garner some support. During the last three days before the  elections, the Czech side conducted intensive preparations and  even "worked on" certain politicians. Havel telephoned [former  Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich. The Czech  authorities even sent a special envoy to Stanislav Shushkevich  to influence him.    Our side did not show such activeness. The work was  conducted at the level of prime minister and foreign minister,  and when we asked the Supreme Soviet chairman to send a letter  to the Czech president, he refused to do so.    [Lakhmanenka] In my opinion, you did not mention yet  another important reason behind our hardships in the United  Nations. Belarus was too long hidden under the shadow of the  USSR, and it always played into the latter's hands. This made  people suspect that we would continue to do the same.    [Sychow] I would not be so adamant on this issue.  Naturally, all our activities were coordinated and approved  when we were in the USSR. However, even then our Republic came  forward with many resolutions and initiatives that were later  adopted by the UN General Assembly, including the resolutions on  Nazi criminals, new types of weapons of mass destruction,  disarmament, human rights, scientific progress, etc.    [Lakhmanenka] Perhaps you are right. Nevertheless,  the experience of Belarusian diplomacy was reduced to  participation in international organizations, and it was gained  during the Cold War, a period of confrontation between the two  former camps of capitalism and socialism. Although these camps  no longer exist, the "combat" experience still remains. Does  this not disturb our diplomats?    [Sychow] I do not agree with you. We do not have experience  in bilateral relations. Belarus' achievement is undoubtedly it  participation in multilateral diplomacy. This valuable  experience is very useful for us today. Other countries of the  former Soviet Union, other than Ukraine, do not have such  experience.    As a professional diplomat, I am very concerned by the fact  that we do not have enough cadres. We have a chronic lack of  specialists. At the Foreign Ministry, people work 12-14 hours  per day for a pitiful salary. It is the same situation in our  foreign missions.    Our ministry employs only 125 people, while foreign  ministries of the former Soviet republics employ three or four  times as many, not to mention Russia. How can we work  efficiently if we do not even have one expert for each country,  not to mention the legal and legal treaty work and economic  diplomacy that we should actively develop. We generally rely on  enthusiasm today. I believe that the Supreme Soviet and the  government should pay more attention to Belarusian diplomacy,  because it is impossible to solve the numerous problems facing  our Republic with our scarce resources.

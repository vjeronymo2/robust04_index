			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Arts: Fine singers at the Wigmore - Music in London The Wigmore Hall's International Festival of Song is bringing to London this autumn some of the most exciting young voices around. Last week we heard Dawn Upshaw, Olaf Bar and Barbara Bonney - all fine singers who did not, however, fulfil every expectation. Bonney's recital on Thursday seemed designed to show off her beautiful tone  -at once light and lustrous - but it also revealed the limitations of her instrument. A little variety in the mostly slow, all-Lieder programme might have helped. Her opening group, Ruckert settings by both Robert and Clara Schumann, afforded scope for ravishing singing: Robert's 'Mein schoner Stern' (a wedding present to his wife) was infused with radiance, and Bonney also caught the lilting beauty of Clara's 'Liebst du um Schonheit' - so different from Mahler's version. The American soprano (accompanied by Geoffrey Parsons with dull professionalism) found a freshness in the Schubert songs (like 'Die Forelle') so familiar that they are often overlooked, but some of her Schubert was perhaps too slow and self-conscious. Bonney appeared temperamentally better suited to the Mahler Knaben Wunderhorn selection we heard after interval, even though she did not command enough variety of colour to sustain interest in the long 'Wo die schonen Trompeten blasen'. Berg's Seven Early Songs rounded off the evening effectively, drawing together as they do influences of 19th-century Lieder and providing Bonney with haunting lines to float very appealingly. It was similarly difficult, in Tuesday's recital devoted to the 46 songs of Wolf's Italian Songbook, always to know whether to blame performer or composer for the limited range of expression in Dawn Upshaw's singing. Wolf assigned most of the cycle's lighter songs to the soprano, leaving the more serious ones to the male voice. Upshaw's tone is bright and fresh, and well suited to the innocence of such songs as 'Auch kleine Dinge', but the humorous and vengeful cameos were a little shallow. She was overshadowed by the interpretative powers of her partner, Olaf Bar, who found the dark drama of his songs in performances that sounded almost sculpted. The baritone was totally at ease and it helps to have a native German singing these words. He has reserves of operatic power, but was most impressive in the stillness of 'Sterb ich, so hullt' and the serenity of 'Benedeit die sel'ge Mutter'. Helmut Deutsch was a colourful pianist who brought each one of the miniatures to life with insightful musicianship.</p>

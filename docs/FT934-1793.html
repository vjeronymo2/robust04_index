			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Hosokawa chalks up after-hours gains: Japan PM's growing list of hard-won achievements The nocturnal habits of Morihiro Hosokawa are the talk of Tokyo. Not that Japan's prime minister is entangled in the sort of geisha scandal that embarrassed a predecessor, but his after-hours administration is prone to announcing its most important decisions past midnight. A solemn Mr Hososkawa addressed a sleeping nation at 3.51am on Tuesday when the seven party-coalition agreed that the country's rice market should be opened to imports for the greater international good. The government's decision last month to push ahead with political reform came in the early hours and, on Wednesday night, fatigued legislators endured another long evening of bargaining over an extension of the parliamentary session. With the extension rammed through, Mr Hosokawa faces another 45 days of late-night legislating, as the government intends to use the period to win approval from a divided upper house for political reforms. The prime minister has also extended his own deadline, having once promised to resign if those reforms were not in place by the end of the year. Hours of haggling with the opposition Liberal Democratic party and within the coalition give the impression of indecision, but Mr Hosokawa is accumulating a list of honourable achievements. The rice market is open, the first stage of political reform is close to completion, and the government has already produced one stimulatory package for an ailing economy and is contemplating another. The changes in prime ministerial form are also significant. Apart from the unusual timing of his rice announcement, Mr Hosokawa caused a stir by using a tele-prompter for the speech. Inevitable comparisons were made with the US presidential preference for using such aids, but the point of improving eye contact with the populace was understood. For a coalition apparently ready to buckle at any moment under the weight of philosophical differences among its seven member parties, the Hosokawa administration remains remarkably popular. Since taking office in August, by the reckoning of most media polls, his cabinet has maintained an approval rating of just above 70 per cent. A poll this week suggested it had slipped to 62.8 per cent, but another put it at 71.7 per cent after the decision to open the rice market. If the government's image was harmed by the rice debate, it was because of the public bickering of the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, the largest group within the coalition. Divisions are widening between the SDP's left wing and the party pragmatists who want to hold the coalition together. The left wing argues that political reform will favour the LDP and that membership of the coalition has prompted the SDP to abandon its principles for the sake of a short stay in power. If the SDP withdraws, the coalition government will fall, but a snap election would be inconvenient for all, including the LDP, which has an approval rating of 28 per cent and would prefer that the public becomes disillusioned with Mr Hosokawa before votes are cast again. Having attempted to distinguish himself from past prime ministers by running a clean coalition, Mr Hosokawa's reputation has been damaged most by repeated questions in parliament from LDP legislators about his alleged receipt of Y100m (Pounds 628,900) in loans from Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking company at the centre of a bribery scandal. LDP officials could soon be looking for a new leader, as Mr Yohei Kono, its president, has seen his standing diminished by an inability to control the party's factions and by public disapproval of the time-wasting tactics in parliament. Mr Masaharu Gotoda, 79, the LDP's elder statesman and a former justice minister, thinks Mr Hosokawa 'still has a favourable wind, though the direction of the wind is shifting'. He argues that the LDP must become 'more serious', meaning that he wants fewer late nights in parliament.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> GRANADA HILLS STEAMROLLERS TAFT  </P> <P> A cup of coffee at the Cafe Granada costs a buck even, sales tax included.  </P> <P> During Friday night's City Section 4-A Division quarterfinal, the folks at the  snack bar were doing a brisk business doling out the java, and not merely  because there was a November nip in the air.  </P> <P> More likely, the customers in line needed a jolt of caffeine, for without it  the game might have put most of them to sleep by the second quarter.  </P> <P> Behind the record-setting performance of running back Brett Washington, Granada  Hills hammered Taft, 34-6, at Granada Hills. Granada Hills (10-1) will play  Carson, a 54-0 winner over El Camino Real, in the semifinals next Friday.  </P> <P> On his first carry of the night, Washington scooted 58 yards for a touchdown,  breaking three Highlander records in the process. Washington broke Khalid Ali's  single-season mark for rushing touchdowns (18) and touchdowns in a season (20),  as well as Ali's career rushing mark of 1,370 yards, all set in 1986.  </P> <P> Washington, who finished with 237 yards in just 13 carries and scored three  rushing touchdowns against the Toreadors, now has 21 rushing touchdowns and 23  overall this season, as well as 1,554 rushing yards.  </P> <P> For the fourth time in Washington's three seasons on the Highlander varsity,  Taft Coach Tom Stevenson was left to admire the 6-foot, 225-pound fullback's  handiwork. Stevenson announced after the game that he was not returning as  coach next season.  </P> <P> "I hope I never see you again," Stevenson told Washington with a pat on the  back and a smile moments after the game.  </P> <P> And it all started with Washington's first carry. Granada Hills led, 34-0, by  halftime.  </P> <P> Washington started the landslide with his 58-yard run with 8 minutes 43 seconds  left in the first quarter on the Highlanders' second play. Taft (7-4) then  fumbled the ensuing kickoff, with Kyron Motton recovering at the Toreador 30.  Five plays later, quarterback Bryan Martin (nine of 14 passes for 154 yards and  a touchdown) scored on a two-yard keeper.  </P> <P> Taft made the Highlanders work, relatively speaking, for their next score.  Granada Hills moved 51 yards in seven plays with Washington scoring on a  pitch-out from 14 yards for a 20-0 lead. Yet Washington's Valley forge had only  begun.  </P> <P> After Martin connected with Earl Andrews on a quick-slant pattern for a 74-yard  score and a 27-0 lead, Taft moved to the Highlander 14.  </P> <P> Quarterback Jesse Menchaca, making his first appearance in two months, fumbled  the snap, however, and Highlander linebacker Curt Hulshizer recovered at the  16.  </P> <P> Washington then took a pitch around left end and raced untouched for an 84-yard  touchdown and a 34-0 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Granada Hills amassed 325 yards in the first half and 418 overall.  </P></p>

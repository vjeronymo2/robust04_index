			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. WELCOMES ISRAEL PLEDGE BUT WANTS MORE  </P> <P> The Bush Administration said Monday that Israel's pledge not to make a special  effort to settle Soviet Jewish immigrants in the disputed West Bank and Gaza  Strip is "a hopeful development" but one stopping well short of the steps  required to free $400 million in U.S. support for immigrant housing programs.  </P> <P> More than 24 hours after Ariel Sharon, the hard-line housing minister in Prime  Minister Yitzhak Shamir's new government, delivered the seemingly conciliatory  message, U.S. officials said they had not yet seen the full text and were not  quite sure how to evaluate the promise.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called Sharon's  comments to the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency "a step in the right  direction." She said they do not constitute the assurance that Washington is  demanding -- that U.S. aid not be used for settlement of the West Bank and Gaza  Strip, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle East War.  </P> <P> Congress has approved $400 million in loan guarantees to help finance housing  for the flood of Soviet Jews who began pouring into Israel after Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev eased emigration requirements. However, the  Administration has said that it will not release the money unless Israel  provides guarantees that the funds will not be spent in the occupied  territories.  </P> <P> "The Administration will still seek the assurances that Secretary (of State  James A.) Baker (III) had discussed," Tutwiler said. But she added: "We have  not laid out the specifics of how those assurances will be sought."  </P> <P> Baker told Congress on March 1 that the United States would seek assurance that  Israel would stop all settlement activity beyond the pre-1967 borders. He said  it would not be enough to promise that no U.S. money would be used to build  housing in the occupied territories because that would permit Jerusalem to use  the U.S. aid for houses in Israel proper -- freeing other funds for  construction in the territories.  </P> <P> The U.S. official noted that Baker sought to fuzz that statement the next day  and has avoided being as specific since. He said there is little doubt that the  Administration will accept something short of a total ban on settlements but  that it wants far more than Sharon offered.  </P> <P> Sharon said that the government will not direct Soviet immigrants to the  territories. But he said that Soviet Jews who choose to live there will receive  the same financial aid as other settlers.  </P></p>

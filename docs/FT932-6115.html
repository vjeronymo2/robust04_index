			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Potted palms, possibly; luxury liners, never  -We asked Nicholas Woodsworth, Travel Correspondent, if wealth would change his travel tastes. His answer / part No and part Yes IT IS somewhere between the hour of late afternoon tea and early evening cocktails. Pen in hand, viennoiseries and a cup of Assam summer flush beside me, I sit writing in quiet contemplation in the lounge of Amsterdam's Amstel Inter-Continental Hotel. Like most of the world's truly luxurious establishments, the Amstel's extravagances are discreet. Waiters do not hover here, but appear from nowhere at opportune moments. There is a tinkling piano at the far end of the glass-roofed lounge, but it tinkles very softly. There are polished wooden floors, thick carpets, potted palms, gleaming period furniture and crystal chandeliers. None of it, though, interferes with the room's prime attraction, its magnificent river-side view of the boats, quays and barge traffic on the Amstel River. Upstairs there is more of the same extravagance. Invisible, a butler hangs about night and day waiting for me to ring my bedside buzzer. My room is full of rich fabrics, objets d'art, a private bar of cut-glass decanters, cabinets concealing VCR, CD, fax and sundry other unsightly machines. In the marbled bathroom there are Hermes toiletries, towels of a size I get lost in, huge bathtub fittings of ornate and gleaming complexity. And should I decide to order one of the Amstel's Rolls-Royces or its private launch for a whirl around town, there is a telephone by the toilet. This, I am tempted to say in the luxurious idleness of the moment, is what travel is all about. Why not, if one can afford it, gad about the world surrounded by crystal and polished wood, well-mannered receptionists and skilled waiters? Why bother, money being no object, with services that are anything less than the finest? But even as I peruse the evening's dinner menu, my eye drawn excitedly onwards by scallops in truffled ravioli to a bouillabaise of Brittany lobsters, a calmer, interior voice calls me to order. This is not travel, it says, so much as mobile self-indulgence, a mere pandering to the senses in a place other than home. This kind of travel does not make a vast distinction between one destination and another. What I am doing in Amsterdam I could equally be doing in any luxury hotel anywhere on the globe. Travel is one activity in which the large bank account and the smoking credit card act as great levellers: the more you spend, the higher the standard of international service you will receive - and the more the services in one country will resemble those in another. In its cosmopolitan refinement the Amstel is similar to the Imperial in Vienna, the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong, or the Taj in Bombay. Even the quays and barges of the Amstel River cease to be real quays and barges, but become simply an exotic backdrop to the real business at hand - luxury. If the aim of travel is to enjoy the great variety of life the world has to offer, serious wealth can be a serious obstacle. It tends to cut the traveller off from the world which, in theory, he has set out to explore. I have no fetish for seediness, gave up back-packing years ago, and occasionally enjoy the luxury of a top-class hotel. But whether they are of any interest in themselves or not - and often they are - I find that small, modest, local hotels allow me a much closer and immediate touch with the world around. What applies to hotels applies to other aspects of travel. Ultimately, there is no correlation between the amount of money you spend on a trip and the amount of satisfaction you get out of it. What counts in travel, as in most other endeavours, is not the amount of money you spend, but how you spend it. The best things in life are not always free, but neither are they always the most costly. Often the most expensive restaurants in town are used only by wealthy tourists, while some of the best local meals and atmosphere are to be found in places with plastic tablecloths. Book yourself a holiday in an expensive and isolated beach resort and you may come home tanned and relaxed, but it will not really have mattered which country you were in. More isolating still are luxury cruises. The prospect of sailing into the Caribbean sunset surrounded by high-density wealth and boredom is dismaying. Even roughing it can have its problems. Travel over the Kalahari, up the Amazon or along the Silk Road with a luxury tour company that promises to pamper you with all the comforts of home in the wilds, and you may well find the wines excellent and the company convivial. On the other hand, you might as well have stayed at home. In some cases, conspicuous wealth can be a positive disadvantage. Walk around sporting expensive clothing, watches or optical equipment in the streets of some of the world's poorer countries and you will not only distance yourself from the majority of people; you may also be setting yourself up for a mugging or worse. And as tourist killings in various places have shown, the urban jungles of the developed world are by no means safer. But enough carping about luxury travel. Money is, after all, the stuff that makes travel possible, the only item besides a passport that is essential. Without it you stay firmly grounded in one place. There are endless travel projects that simply cannot be realised without lots of money. Scads and oodles of it. I may not like the idea of sailing the Caribbean in a luxury cruise liner, but I would love to sail it on my own with a few friends. We could try piling into an 8ft inflatable rubber dingy and doing St Lucia, Martinique and Tobago on the cheap, but frankly I would prefer a 36ft ketch. Other of my own travel fantasies that require a certain minimum of costly physical back-up include: the use of a Toyota Landcruiser and the time to slowly demolish it on the back-roads of Namibia and Botswana; the hire of a helicopter and pilot for glacier skiing in the Canadian Rockies; a private expedition to Antarctica so I do not have to join a party of concerned individuals all wearing red parkas and being lectured to death on green issues. Money, though, can also buy travel expertise that is much needed. I would love to wander into the Karakoram and Pamir mountains of central Asia. I would also love to wander out again. At times like these a little moneyfor guides and interpreters might not be amiss. There are also times when I would like to know just why this Etruscan vase or that Buddhist stupa is of such significance. Having a cultural or historical expert's explanation could make all the difference on a trip, say, to Asia minor or Japan, and there are high-quality tours that cater to just that kind of need. And just how am I going to navigate that ketch in the Caribbean? Alpine para-gliding, underwater diving, salt-water kyaking - in any kind of specialist travel activity, technical instruction is essential. There is, in fact, no end to the kinds of ways in which money can improve travel. It can buy privacy and seclusion in a crowded world. No matter how alluring they are, I avoid places if there is no escape from tourist hordes. It can satisfy the interests that travel develops - if I could afford it, I would fill my house with beautiful carpets and ceramics from around the world. And it can buy comfort. I may not be strong on luxury hotels, but travel itself can sometimes be trying. Given a few hundred thousand in my bank account, I would never travel anything but first-class.</p>

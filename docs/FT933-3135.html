			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Alexander Russell up at Pounds 632,000 INCREASED demand for paviors and roof tiles from the concrete products division helped Alexander Russell show interim pre-tax profits ahead at Pounds 632,000, against Pounds 621,000. Turnover in the six months to June 30 for this Glasgow-based company declined 6 per cent to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 18.7m) reflecting the weak market for UK coal and the ending of the US coal business. Earnings per share were 0.75p (0.68p). The interim dividend is halved at 0.5p, but the company said this should not be taken as an indication of the total payment for the full year. Last year the final dividend was passed.</p>

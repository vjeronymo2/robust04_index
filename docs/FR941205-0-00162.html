			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenter 9 referred to the limit of 30,000 units that may be insured under the pilot program through Fiscal Year 1995, stating that it does not believe the program will produce a high level of production. Citing the complicated, staff-intensive, and time-consuming transactions involved in underwriting loans of this type, the commenter is of the opinion that risk-sharing with HFAs can only serve as a modest supplement to existing FHA programs. The commenter recommended that HUD improve the delivery of multifamily mortgage insurance under its regular insurance programs as well as under special programs and initiatives such as this one.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenter 11 expressed somewhat similar views and urged improvement and augmentation of HUD's multifamily housing staff capabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Because the publication of the interim rule and approval of qualified HFAs occurred later than anticipated, the interim rule and draft administrative handbook do not reflect the correct schedule for reallocation of units for the Pilot program. Unit set-asides and allocations were made in March 1994. Unit allocations may not be used by an HFA until a Risk-Sharing Agreement (RSA) is executed. The time required for HFAs to sign RSAs and return them to HUD has been longer than expected. It is likely that some HFAs may not even have an executed RSA until some time in FY 1995. Therefore, rather than reallocating units at the end of FY 1994, HUD will wait until January 1995 to assess usage and reallocate if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the meantime, the Department will use a portion of the 10,000 unit holdback on a ``first come, first served'' basis for increases to HFA set-asides that have been exhausted. In addition, units will be considered used at an earlier stage_when the Firm Approval Letter is issued_not at initial endorsement. Credit subsidy for a project will also be obligated by the firm approval stage which is a change from the language in the interim rule. Credit subsidy will be obligated and allocated in accordance with outstanding Department instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the comment regarding use of the units, the Department anticipates that the 30,000 units allocated to the program will be used for the demonstration. The delivery of multifamily mortgage insurance under HUD's regular programs is not the subject of this interim rule. The Risk-Sharing program is a partnership with State and local HFAs to increase the supply of affordable housing; it is not meant to be a substitute for other HUD insurance programs. However, the Department does anticipate that the pilot will become a model for augmenting mortgage insurance capability. In any event, the Department will carefully study the results of the pilot period and expand the program accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this regard, although not in response to public comment, we note that it is likely that the program will be expanded, perhaps by another 30,000 units for use beyond the end of FY 1995. The regulation and the above comments do not currently assume this extension. Should this occur during the regulation process, further consideration about reopening the window for application submission and methods for reallocation of units will be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 266.15&blank;Risk-Sharing Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Commenter 12 suggested that the requirement in &sect;266.15(b) (5)(viii) for a certification from the HFA that it has errors and omissions insurance should be changed or eliminated to reflect situations where HFA employees are covered by a fidelity bond that covers all state employees. The same commenter stated that the requirement in &sect;266.15(b)(8) for the highest level of appraiser certification is not necessary. The commenter does not employ the use of appraisals for the purpose of establishing completed project value or mortgage amount, but rather to determine the maximum amount of land value (or an existing building's value in the case of rehab) to be recognized in the mortgage calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

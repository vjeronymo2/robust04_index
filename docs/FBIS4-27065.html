			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial party committee standing committee's  core theory study group met on 23 June to study socialist market  economy theories. After listening to a lecture by Wuhan  University Professor Chen Shuxiang, the core theory study group  members -- including Guan Guangfu [secretary of the provincial  party committee], Jia Zhijie [governor], Hui Liangyu, Qian  Yunlu, Ding Fengying, Li Daqiang, Wang Zhongnong, Deng Guozheng,  and Huang Yuanzhi -- glowingly expressed views on Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's market economy theories in light of the province's  realities. They acknowledged the importance and urgency of  studying socialist market economy theories and deemed the  building of a socialist market economy structure, ideological  emancipation, and the continued development of productive forces  as a great and innovative experiment in China, as well as a new  topic in the course of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    The core theory study group maintained that given the fact  that most cadres are still unfamiliar with the new situations  and new tasks, it is all the more necessary to conscientiously  study socialist market economy theories. The socialist market  economy is part and parcel of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In order to  grasp socialist market economy theories, it is imperative to  comprehensively and systematically study the relevant  expositions contained in Volume 3 of Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping; clearly understand the spirit and essence of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions; and make painstaking  efforts to study and comprehend the "Decision of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee" in order to  accurately grasp the guiding ideology, basic principles, and  specific steps of the on-going reform.    The core theory study group stressed that the key to  building  a socialist market economy structure lies in placing resources  under both market regulation and state macroeconomic regulation  and control. In building a socialist market economy, it is  imperative to abide by the law of value, adapt to changes in  supply-demand relations, and provide more efficient sectors with  more resources by virtue of the lever of prices and through a  competition mechanism.    The core theory study group noted: We often are confronted  with the following scenario: Once control is lifted, economic  operation becomes chaotic, and once regulated, economic  operation becomes stifled. This is because there has been no  sound market mechanism in the province. In the process of  economic regulation and control, we have been unable to clearly  define macroeconomic regulation and control, intermediate  economic regulation and control, and microeconomic regulation  and control. This is why we are still unable to employ various  economic regulation and control measures in a coordinated  fashion. In addition, the country has yet to build a unified  big market. Under such circumstances, we should correctly  handle in practice the relations between stronger macroeconomic  regulation and control, on the one hand, and stronger market  mechanism, on the other; make flexible use of economic signals  sent by the market; and waste no time in coordinating production  and consumption.    The core theory study group asserted that in building a  socialist market economy structure, it is necessary to  conscientiously study and boldly draw upon successful market  economy experiences from all countries in the world.  Operationally, a socialist market economy is identical to a  capitalist market economy. Thus we should boldly draw upon and  master successful market economic experiences and measures from  all countries in the world, as long as such experiences and  measures are in conformity with the law of modern production. A  market economy should not be built in total disregard of a  country's basic historical and social conditions. We should try  to digest and transform the successful market economy  experiences of developed countries in order to make them serve  socialism and help create and develop both a new economic  operational mechanism with Chinese characteristics, and a  socialist market economy structure.    The core theory study group stated that in developing a  socialist market economy, we should build two civilizations  simultaneously. This is at once a basic point repeatedly  stressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and a line of demarcation  between socialism and capitalism. With regard to building two  civilizations, party and government leaders at all levels across  the province should strengthen confidence, make unswerving and  persistent efforts, and develop a strong sense of  responsibility. We should take overall interests into account,  concentrate on key aspects of work, realize spiritual  civilization in each and every domain, successfully sum up and  invent new forms of spiritual civilization welcomed by the broad  masses of people, build better systems and promulgate better  rules and regulations for spiritual civilization, and strive to  raise the standard and quality of spiritual civilization.    Before the meeting, the core theory study group members had  already studied the relevant socialist market economy theories  on their own. In accordance with a theory study plan, since the  second quarter of this year the core theory study group members  have started studying by themselves each and every relevant  article carried in Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, as well as the "Decision of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee."</p>

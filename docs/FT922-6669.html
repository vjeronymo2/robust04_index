			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (1): Crossroads of vitality - Eastern European countries are rushing to build links to the prosperous west, so the city is bubbling as the Habsburg Empire's historical bonds are recreated. Immigration does cause concern, but the city desperately needs new blood VIENNA SEEMS on the verge of another golden age. The city, which was once at the centre of a vast empire, is once again finding its place in the sun as eastern European countries rush to build links to the more prosperous west. For most of the postwar period, the former capital of the Holy Roman Empire has ticked over very slowly, condemned to the political sidelines by its treaties with east and west, and with little but its monuments and a growing stream of tourists to remind it of former glory. Today, Vienna bubbles with vitality, a crossroads again between east and west, with the sounds of many tongues echoing in the squares around St Stephen's Cathedral and the noise and bustle of construc- tion from an ambitious urban renewal project, Donau-City, on the edge of the Danube. The imperial triangle that once linked Vienna, Prague and Budapest in commercial prosperity is being rebuilt, helped immensely by the historical bonds implied in the often-heard phrase, 'imperial yellow'. That was the dominant colour on the Habsburg architecture throughout the region, and it symbolises the common heritage. While too many other large cities have cracked under the strains of sudden massive immigration in recent years, Vienna so far has taken it largely in its stride. It remains one of the world's most peaceful and liveable, as well as beautiful, cities - well-managed by a competent city government, well cared for by its environmentally conscious residents and maintaining a relatively modest cost of living. There seems very little on the horizon that could undermine that quality of life or the new sense of direction and excitement in Vienna. Foreign businesses continue to flood in to use the city as a base for their explorations of eastern Europe. Leading Viennese banks are scurrying to capture for themselves their former strong position in finance in the region. Even the scheduled completion later this year, after more than 1,000 years of efforts, of a canal connecting the Danube to the Rhine will boost the city. Its harbour promises to be one of the busiest for transshipments along the 3,000-kilometre waterway from Rotterdam to Ismail on the Black Sea. Wiener Hafen, the company that operates the harbour, is planning to invest Sch250m over the next four years to expand its services. The political life of the city is approaching a milestone, as Mr Helmut Zilk, the popular social democrat mayor, and Mr Hans Mayr, his deputy, are expected to retire at the end of their current term in 1995. Some think they may retire even sooner, but Mr Mayr denies it. 'I am not a prophet, but if everything goes according to plan, we will continue to the end of our term.' In last November's civic election, the Social Democratic party suffered considerable setbacks, ending up with 52 out of 100 seats, the slimmest majority it has had since coming to power in 1918. Mr Christoph Chorherr, the young city councillor representing the Green party, says the culture of politics is changing, but even he admits the city is run well. Virtually the only concern one hears in the city is over public resentment about immigrants. There is no doubt that the high levels of immigration from eastern Europe in recent years have caused strains. In the November elections, the charismatic Mr Jorg Haider, whom some accuse of courting neo-Nazi sentiment, led his Freedom Party (FPOe) to more than double its vote to 23 per cent. The party even displaced the conservative Austrian People's Party (OeVP) in second place at city hall. The result drew comment around the world to the effect that neo-Nazi sentiment was on the rise, and that the Viennese were at least as intolerant of immigrants as residents of some other western European cities. But viewed from close up, that result now looks less disturbing than it did at the time. For one thing, the OeVP had weak leadership and no programme to offer, leaving not only the FPOe, but also the Greens, which entered city hall for the first time, to capitalise on general discontent. 'I do not think it was the Haider factor,' Mr Mayr says. 'The irresponsible discussion of immigrants in the city caused emotions to run high and that hurt the other parties.' The outcome of the first round of elections for the national presidency last month suggests that things have calmed down a bit since last autumn. Mr Mayr and others note that, for the first time in several years, the conservative OeVP fielded a credible candidate, the diplomat Thomas Klestil. And Mr Klestil obtained a respectable share of the vote, 31 per cent, among the Viennese. Mr Haider's candidate, on the other hand, received only 14 per cent. In any event, the most encouraging thing about the immigration debate in Vienna - and this is what differentiates it from similar debates in other large cities - is that the city's political and business leaders from all but the Haider end of the spectrum support immigration. And not just out of a sense of duty or moral obligation. They enthusiastically welcome it. Their view is that, for various reasons, Vienna desperately needs new blood. For some, it is simply a matter of demographics. The city was actually in decline before the iron curtain lifted. Now it is growing again. For others, the energy brought by poor people willing to work hard for low wages is providing a welcome jolt to a somnolent economy. For still others, it is a matter of cultural vitality. 'The quality of culture and science here has never recovered from the loss of the Jewish upper middle class in the late 1930s,' one banker says. Fortunately, the city has been admirably planned to absorb immigrants - at least official immigrants - with a deliberate mix of middle and low-cost housing in most districts. Mr Mayr, who is also responsible for Vienna's finances, believes it can absorb between 15,000 and 20,000 new residents a year, although he acknowledges a problem with several thousand more illegal immigrants crammed into appalling ghetto-like conditions in a couple of city districts. The city government is in the process of doubling its own apartment construction programme from 4,000 to 8,000 units a year, as well as renovating an additional 4,000 units as part of its policy of revitalising the inner city rather than developing satellites. And this year, it has more than trebled its school construction budget to Sch500m. Mr Mayr expects this spending to remain at a high level for about five years, as will budgets for special language training and day care for children of immigrants. All this is being handled with no evidence of strain on the city's finances. The city runs very modest deficits as a rule, last year about Sch2.3bn, which was Sch5bn less than forecast. This year it is budgeting for a deficit of Sch8.2bn on total planned spending of Sch104.4bn, but Mr Mayr will probably manage to compress it as usual. Privatisation is also in the air, with the city planning to reduce its stake in Wiener Holding, a sprawling group with interests in hotels, cinemas, theatres, restaurants, construction, pharmaceuticals, a trade fair and the port of Vienna, by another 25 per cent later this year to 26 per cent. Even the Green party, which won seven of the 100 seats at city hall last November, admits that the city has few serious problems. 'We are a very rich city and we have a population that is very sensitive to the environment. That is a chance for us. We could be a model for the world,' says Mr Chorherr.</p>

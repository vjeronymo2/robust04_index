			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: Publicis warns of downturn PUBLICIS, one of France's largest advertising groups, has warned of a fall in net profits for 1993 following a 7.1 per cent decline in first-half net profits to FFr60m (Dollars 10.5m), compared to the same period of 1992. The group, like other advertising agencies, has been affected by the general slowdown in the French economy. The combination of static consumer spending and reduced industrial investment, together with comparatively high interest rates, has forced many French companies to cut their marketing budgets. These problems have been aggravated by the reform of French media buying regulations implemented by Mr Michel Sapin, the former socialist finance minister. Mr Maurice Levy, chairman of Publicis, had already warned that net profits for 1993 would show a 'slight fall' on the previous year. Publicis yesterday forecast a 16.1 per cent reduction in net profits to FFr125m in 1993 from FFr149m in 1992 and a decline in sales of 4 per cent to FFr19.2bn from FFr19.9bn. Operating profits fell 8.9 per cent to FFr199.9m in the first half of 1993 from FFr219.6m in the same period of 1992, on turnover down 11 per cent to FFr9.33bn. Elf-Aquitaine, the state-controlled French oil group, has appointed Alice as the advertising agency for its forthcoming privatisation. Alice was the agency behind the advertising campaign for this year's 'Balladur bond'.</p>

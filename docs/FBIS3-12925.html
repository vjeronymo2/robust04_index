			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with George Habash, secretary general of the </F> Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, by unidentified  reporter -- place and date not given]    [Text] [NIDA' AL-WATAN] How do you assess what took place  at the Ibrahimi Mosque [in Hebron] and the reactions to the  massacre. What do you expect in this regard?    [Habash] What happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque is an odious  and bloody massacre that severely shocked the national, Arab,  and international levels. It is a massacre that shocked the  human conscience everywhere.    Whoever knows the history, nature, and mentality of the  Zionist entity and the Zionist movement was not been surprised  by this massacre. The Zionist history is rife with massacres.  This bloody massacre has shattered any illusions about the  nature of this fascist, racist, bloody entity. Most explicitly,  I hold the Zionist entity's government and Rabin personally  responsible for what was committed against our innocent and  defenseless people at the Ibrahimi Mosque and the subsequent  premeditated killing of the sons of our people who rose to  express their indignation throughout the occupied homeland. As  Rabin talks about peace, his troops and settlers continue their  cold-blooded killing of innocent worshipers and our defenseless  masses. It is ironic to claim that the perpetrator of the  massacre was an insane settler. In fact, the massacre is the  logical outcome of the policy of settlement and arming the herds  of settlers from head to toe. It is the logical outcome of  having an army addicted to killing and slaughtering.    The United States also bears direct responsibility for this  and other massacres, for it continues to protect the Zionist  entity, cover its crimes, and does its utmost to spare the  Zionist entity any harm, and even condemnation. This is most  visible through its stands at the UN Security Council, where the  U.S. Administration is desperately fighting to circumvent the  horrible massacre and its indications and dimensions. The  settlements spread over our territory are an absolute violation  of all UN resolutions. Why are these resolutions not  implemented immediately? Why doesn't the U.S. Administration  show the same enthusiasm to enforce the will of the  international community, that it shows when imposing its will  and racism against the peoples of Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and  other countries? There is no explanation for that except  acceptance of what the Zionists are committing against our  people to break their will and resistance and to peddle  destructive schemes.    In the same vein, I do not absolve the spineless Palestinian  leadership from responsibility for the tragedies and massacres  of our people. That leadership has abandoned all national  rights and recognized the Zionist entity's right to exist on our  soil and agreed in the Oslo-Cairo accords to keep the  settlements and settlers implanted among the sons of our people.  However, this leadership knows well these settlements' nature  and expansionist and bloody objectives. He who allows the  occupation and its troops and settlers to stay on our national  soil bears direct responsibility for the occupation authorities'  acts of killing, repression, and terrorism against our resisting  people.    The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has strongly and glaringly  exposed the falsehood of all Zionist-U.S.-'Arafatist demagoguery  about the alleged peace. What is being offered is capitulation  that maintains occupation and settlements and approves of the  acts of repression and killing against our people.    The crime is terrible and appalling. Therefore, we should be  extremely vigilant to deny the U.S. and Zionist attempts to  circumvent and contain this massacre through cosmetic measures  any chances of success. 'Arafat and the Oslo team are striking  a deceptive tone to absorb and contain the overwhelming and  decisive popular reactions. The masses are well aware of the  illusions and deceptive campaign that the spineless leadership  has promoted after the signing of the Oslo and Cairo agreement.  The masses are also aware of this leadership's deceptive talk  about peace, security, prosperity, and sovereignty.    Therefore, in view of this massacre, we explicitly state  that  our masses can be protected and their security maintained only  through the departure of the occupation troops, the complete  removal of settlements from our land, and recognition of our  people's right to repatriation and statehood, including  Jerusalem. This means that the humiliating agreements, which  fundamentally contravene our national principles and rights,  should be overturned.    We are demanding an urgent popular and political movement  pressing for the following:    --Overturning the humiliating agreements which contravene  our  national rights.    --Halting negotiations completely.    --Removing the settlements from our land completely.    --Providing international protection for our masses in the  occupied homeland immediately in preparation for the Zionist  army's full withdrawal.    --After the failure of the U.S. course which started in  Madrid and the subsequent agreements, leading up to the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre, we are demanding a return to the international  option and the UN resolutions approving our people's national,  inalienable rights: The rights to repatriation,  self-determination, and statehood, including Jerusalem, the  capital of Palestine. This should be an alternative to the U.S.  course.    We hope that the massacre will constitute a turning point in  the life of our Palestinian masses, the national, democratic,  and Islamic political forces, and on the pan-Arab level to  collectively confront the destructive Zionist-imperialist scheme  and to maintain the option of struggle in order to attain our  national and pan-Arab objectives.</p>

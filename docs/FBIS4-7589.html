			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Simona Popescu article: "The Vacaroiu Government Is </F> Compromised for the Majority of Romanians"]    [Text] The day when President Ion Iliescu signed the  document pardoning his colleagues from the Communist Party, IMAS  [opinion poll institute] published the results of the opinion  poll initiated by the Soros Foundation For an Open Society.  Probably sensing a decline in his popularity, President Iliescu  probably hurried to do what was possible for the former members  of the Political Executive Committee. As could be noted, the  Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] recorded a decline  compared with September 1992; only 24 percent opted for it  while, according to IMAS, the Democratic Convention [CDR] has  recorded a tremendous rise, winning approximately 35 percent of  the population's options.    CDR President Emil Constantinescu is the most favored leader  of the opposition, winning 49 percent support; thus he surpassed  Nicolae Manolescu [president of the Civic Alliance Party] (33  percent), Sergiu Cunescu [president of Social Democratic Party]  (26 percent), and Petre Roman [president of the Democratic  Party] (41 percent). With 55 percent of the options, Adrian  Nastase [executive president of the Social Democracy Party of  Romania and president of the Chamber of Deputies] is a dangerous  opponent for President Ion Iliescu (44 percent). If Ion Iliescu  decides for a new mandate, he is not going to let Adrian Nastase  (who has firmly taken over the leadership of the unrelenting  faction within the PDSR) run in the future elections, and thus a  strong conflict could develop within the ruling party. There  are signs that the president of the Chamber of Deputies is  impatient to get to the top.    The affirmation by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu that the  standard of living has improved is contradicted by the opinion  poll results. If 45 percent affirm that the current incomes of  the family are enough just for what is strictly necessary, while  27 percent think that incomes are not even enough for that much,  only 2 percent are coping with everything they need, without any  savings. The government's activity, its economic policy, its  anti-corruption measures, the level of wages, the standard of  living, and its actions against crime generate massive  dissatisfaction among the population.    The hope that a completely compromised government will be  able in the future to take the country out of the economic  crisis, that it will be able to do something to improve the  standard of living has been shattered.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Japan's new Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata launched his cabinet today to rule with a  minority coalition government, the first of its kind in nearly  four decades.    The inauguration of the Hata administration came after  Social  Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama rejected  Hata's last-minute call for SDP to return to the nine-month-old  coalition.    The largest political force in the alliance led by former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, SDP on Tuesday announced its  withdrawal from the ruling bloc to protest the formation of a  130-strong parliamentary group called Kaishin (Renovation) that  excludes the Social Democrats.    The Hata coalition now has only 182 seats in the decisive  511- member House of Representatives, far short of a majority  of 256.    Earlier today, Emperor Akihito appointed Hata, leader of the  coalition's key party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), as  Japan's 51st premier in a morning ceremony at the Imperial  Palace.    The appointment had been delayed by the political unrest  sparked by Kaishin's establishment on Monday and the subsequent  SDP defection from the coalition.</p>

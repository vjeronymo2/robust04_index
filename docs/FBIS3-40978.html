It is also inexpedient to set up such production processes.  This conclusion was reached by the bureau of the Commission for  Issues of Nuclear Policy under the president of Ukraine, which  examined this issue at a meeting chaired by Academician Viktor  Baryahtar [name as received] of Ukraine's Academy of Sciences.    In the opinion of the meeting's participants Ukraine does  not  have any possibility for extracting highly-enriched uranium and  processing it and this is why they support the decision to  transfer nuclear warheads to Russia in return for fuel for  nuclear power stations. According to experts' calculations, the  construction of new production processes for reprocessing  highly-enriched uranium from nuclear warheads will not  strategically solve the problem because there is not enough of  it. Moreover, in general these production processes are  ecologically dangerous.    The commission's bureau has resolved to support the activity  of the president in up drawing appropriate agreements with  Russia and the United States that would suit the national  interests of the state. [signed] The press service of the  president and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.</p>

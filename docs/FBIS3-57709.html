			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Vladimir Plotnikov; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The generals have developed various options for  Ukraine's territorial defense without leaving their  headquarters. Guns, tanks, and other combat equipment has also  remained at the dpots, first because no orders have been given  and, second, because there are no fuels or lubricants. It was  for this reason that the movement of combat vehicles has been  stopped or reduced to the absolute minimum. To study  instruments on tanks, for example, they are not started up but  simply given an electric charge. In other words, the Ukrainian  army has found itself in the grips of an energy crisis, just  like the whole of the country's national economic complex.  Firing from an ordinary rifle is virtually the only accessible  element of fire training.    Yet over the same period rumors have spread in Ukraine that  large-scale military exercises are being conducted in Crimea.    [Crimean Supreme Council Chairman N. Bagrov] Any exercises  on  Crimean territory are coordinated with the Supreme Council and  the Presidium. I repeat that the reports you mention are  disinformation. No exercises are being conducted on Crimea's  territory.</p>

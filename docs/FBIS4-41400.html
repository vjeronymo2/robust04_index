			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- "There have not been  any profound reforms in Russia. What has happened here is  perestroyka of the purest kind," the leader of the "Yabloko"  group in the State Duma, the well-known economist Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy, claims. For most people in the country "things are  exactly the same as they were before," he writes in an article  published in the latest issue of the weekly MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI.  "The most important elements of the old Soviet way of organizing  socio-economic affairs still exist and operate here. The  monopolies and the former structures of production remain  unchanged. There is no real private ownership or competition.  Land reform is not being carried out. Democratic procedures  for public accountability have not been worked out. A system of  local self-government has not been established. There is no  real separation of powers."    People are now talking about stabilization, but  stabilization  of "such a system is not a blessing," the deputy warns. "This  signifies that Russia continues to be an oligarchical and  super-monopolized state. All that's changed is the `political  superstructure'," Yavlinskiy says. "The CPSU has gone, but it  has been replaced by strong criminal influence on government."    "It is impossible to run such a system by normal democratic  methods," Yavlinskiy warns. "In the Soviet era Politburo  decisions were the most effective instrument of government.  Taken by a small group of people, without public discussion,  without adherence to democratic `conditionality', their  implementation was mandatory. Unfortunately, the latest edicts  issued by the president are very reminiscent of those  decisions." "The main danger is that undemocratic, unlawful and  even unconstitutional methods of administration are being openly  resorted to," he believes.    He says that "the culmination of this deviation from  previously proclaimed principles was the edict on `Urgent  Measures To Protect the Public Against Gangsterism and Other  Manifestations of Organized Crime'. This edict violates  virtually everything that can be violated: human rights, a  number of federal laws, the constitution itself. The whole  country can see that not only the `spirit of the law' but its  actual `letter' is being contravened. Furthermore it is being  contravened by the sole guarantor of the constitution - the  president."</p>

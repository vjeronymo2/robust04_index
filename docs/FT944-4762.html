			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Ford continues to lead new car registrations Ford continues to dominate the list of best-selling cars, with the Escort, Mondeo and Fiesta occupying the top three places, in spite of production cuts at the Dagenham and Ellesmere Port plants. New car registration statistics, published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday, show Ford was market leader last month, with a 21.83 per cent share, slightly up on the same period last year. Its share for the first 11 months of the year has also improved marginally, opening a gap of nearly six percentage points over second-placed Vauxhall, whose share fell nearly one point. Importers' share of registrations fell slightly in November, to 55.16 per cent compared with 55.23 per cent in the previous November. For the first 11 months, however, more than 100,000 extra imports have lifted their share to 57.23 per cent compared with 55.55 per cent a year ago. The top ten best-selling cars in the first 11 months of this year were: 1 Ford Escort, 139,133; 2 Ford Mondeo 122,863; 3 Ford Fiesta 118,380; 4 Vauxhall Cavalier 96,558; 5 Vauxhall Astra 94,685; 6 Rover 200 76,543; 7 Vauxhall Corsa 75,969; 8 Rover Metro 54,462; 9 Renault Clio 47,949; 10 Peugeot 306 47,539.</p>

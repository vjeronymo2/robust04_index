Interior Minister  Abdallah Kallel will officially announce the results at a news  conference this afternoon. As a reminder, the turnout at these  elections was unparalleled with more than 90 percent of voters,  men, and women, taking part in the vote in the 25 electoral  districts. The presidential elections were marked by an  absolute popular plebiscite for President Zine El Abidine Ben  Ali; the percentage of the vote for President Zine El Abidine  Ben Ali exeeded 99 percent and this rate reached 100 percent in  Tataouine.    As for the legislative elections, the lists of the  Democratic  Constitutional Rally won in all districts with an extremely high  percentage of votes, but these results will assuredly lead to  the entry of the other parties into the chamber of deputies for  the first time in the history of Tunisia due to the amendment to  the electoral code, which guarantees the presence of these  parties in parliament.</p>

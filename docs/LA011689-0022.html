			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Exhibition planners in Hartford, Conn., went out on a limb in hanging a  familiar painting by Georgia O'Keeffe upside-down from its usual position, but  a curator says that's what the artist wanted. The Wadsworth Atheneum owns the  1929 painting, "The Lawrence Tree," and hung it with the tree extending from  the lower right-hand corner of the canvas. However, the painting has been part  of a traveling retrospective of O'Keeffe's work organized by the National  Gallery of Art in Washington and until now has been hung with the base of the  tree at the top left corner. A Wadsworth's curator said when O'Keeffe sold the  painting to the atheneum she indicated it could be hung in any direction. The  painting depicts a ponderosa pine O'Keeffe encountered on D. H. Lawrence's  Taos, N.M., ranch. ALEENE MacMINN and STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

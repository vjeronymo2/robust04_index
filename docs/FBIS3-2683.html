Liu Zhongli said: To basically maintain a balance between  total social supply and demand and to alleviate inflationary  pressure, we should still adhere to the principle of tightening  control over expenditures in preparing this year's state budget.  In preparing financial expenditures, we must consider our  financial capability, ensure funds for key projects, and tighten  control over investment in general projects. He stressed: This  year, in addition to continuing to increase investments in  agriculture, education, science and technology, infrastructural  facilities, and other key areas, and in addition to ensuring a  necessary increase in funds for national defense and judicial  and public security departments, we should give priority to  ensuring expenditures for wages and the state's grain storage  expenses. By no means should we allow using workers' living  expenses to launch new projects.    Liu Zhongli said: Localities who are still holding out  workers' wages should decidedly stop or postpone the  construction of projects using funds for other purposes; units  that are still holding out workers' wages are not allowed to buy  sedans or other high-grade consumer products. He stressed that  finance departments at all levels must place great importance on  this issue.    Liu Zhongli also called for strictly controlling the scale  of  fixed asset investment. He said: Except for those projects  that have been approved and of which construction has to be  carried out, no new projects should be launched. The  construction of projects for which funds are not secured and of  which the economic efficiency is not definite should be  decidedly stopped or postponed.    Liu Zhongli pointed out in his report: Currently, wasting  funds is a quite serious problem. Many units demand high  standards for interior decoration and new equipment; the  practice of sightseeing in the name of attending meetings and  using public funds for dining and wining continues despite  repeated banning. In particular, many units lack effective  control over their organizational size; as a result, their  personnel expenses take up a large portion of their development  funds. Therefore, this year, we should focus on reducing  personnel, automobile, and meeting expenses; forcefully promote  the good tradition of working hard and living a frugal life; and  urge the vast numbers of cadres and the masses to combat waste  and excessive spending. At the same time, as the price reform  deepens, we will gradually reduce financial subsidies -- the  total subsidy amount must not exceed the budgeted amount. We  should deepen the reform of institutions' financial management  and should continue to encourage and support them in increasing  income within the bounds of established policies and laws and in  implementing the comprehensive revenue-expenditure planned  management involving all revenues and expenditures. We should  resolutely and thoroughly implement the policy of separating  revenues from expenditures. Income from leasing lands and  selling public houses should be included in the revenues under  budgeted management so that unified budget management can be  exercised.</p>

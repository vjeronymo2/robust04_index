			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / BAe chairman for Taiwan talks TAIWAN Aerospace Corporation yesterday postponed a board meeting scheduled for October 19 in order to hear proposals from Mr John Cahill, chairman of British Aerospace, aimed at reviving stalled talks on a proposed joint venture between the two. The meeting was to discuss the fate of the troubled plan to produce BAe's RJ family of regional passenger jets in Britain and Taiwan. Mr Cahill plans to meet TAC and government officials next week during a visit to Taiwan by Mr Richard Needham, the UK trade minister, and a group of UK industrialists. Collapse of the Avro venture would undermine BAe's plans to improve profits: the RJ regional jets, now made in Woodford, Cheshire, lose money for the company. BAe had hoped to return them to profitability by moving some production to Taiwan. Taiwan wants to create a civil aircraft industry as part of its industrial policy, but in recent months the proposed deal with BAe has been criticised by some bankers and opposition politicians on commercial grounds. BAe said yesterday Mr Cahill would address three issues in Taiwan: to promote the restarting of talks which broke up last month, to seek assurances that the top management at TAC would be 'strengthened', and to support the trade minister. Negotiations last month between TAC and BAe in London fell apart over BAe's refusal to delineate clearly in writing the details of technology transfer for the RJ family and make a written commitment to co-develop with TAC an advanced two-engine 'RJX' regional jet. Since then, the Taiwan government has stressed that the resumption of negotiations was a matter to be decided by the two companies. Mr Chiang Ping-kun, minister of economic affairs with responsibility for trade and industry, said Wednesday that the government, while remaining committed to developing an aerospace industry, would take no direct part in such negotiations between two private companies. TAC said the decision to delay the meeting was made in light of the forthcoming visit to Taipei by Mr Cahill. Mr Yang Shih-chien, vice minister for economic affairs, declined to comment on the possible significance of the TAC decision. He affirmed that the ministry would not take a direct part. 'We're quite clear that the (Taiwan) government has already discussed those issues which it should have discussed,' Mr Yang said.</p>

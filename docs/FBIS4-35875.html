Talking to newsmen in the Parliament House today, she said  Pakistan is watching the situation closely and everything  necessary will be done.    Replying to a question, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, said the  character assassination campaign launched by the opposition  against the government is a conspiracy hatched by capitalists.  She said we are ready for negotiations but blackmail cannot be  allowed. Referring to allegations leveled by the opposition  against the president, the prime minister said this is pure  forgery and the government is considering taking strict action  against those responsible.

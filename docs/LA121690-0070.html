			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCA WAS OUT-NEGOTIATED BY ITS JAPANESE SUITOR  </P> <P> In your articles by Tom Petruno and James Flanigan, "Is MCA Smart to Sell Now .  . . Or Should It Have Held On?" (Nov. 28), Petruno is probably correct that now  is a time to sell if you must. But as Flanigan points out, there was no  apparent compelling economic reason for MCA to sell at this time.  </P> <P> With so much indicated value left on the table, Chairman and Chief Executive  Lew R. Wasserman, et al., were simply ill-prepared and out-negotiated.  Negotiating from a position of overwhelming strength, as MCA did for years,  makes for reputation but does not sharpen bargaining skills.  </P> <P> If Flanigan's figures are correct, the results suggest that the MCA team  neither set concrete limits nor did it make an effort to assess the real value  of the deal to Matsushita.  </P> <P> The buyer's value assessment is critical for determining the bluff-content of  Japanese negotiating tactics, which rely more on harangue and walkouts than on  the quibbling with numbers to which Americans are more accustomed.  </P> <P> Without a definite negotiating plan, it is very difficult to resist the  enormous pressure the Japanese place on their opponents.  </P> <P> Too bad for MCA shareholders; good for Matsushita and Michael Ovitz for the  better-played game.  </P> <P> CARL S. HOKANSON  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

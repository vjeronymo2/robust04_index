			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / CBI sees signs of recovery but output still falls BRITAIN'S economy continued to shrink in the first quarter of this year, but a new industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry suggested last night that recovery may now be under way after the longest recession since the 1940s. The government announced yesterday that UK gross domestic product fell by 0.6 per cent in the first quarter and was 1.5 per cent lower than a year before. According to Central Statistical Office estimates, UK output, excluding oil and natural gas production, fell 0.4 per cent in the three months - the seventh successive quarter of decline since this measure of activity reached a peak after the boom of the late 1980s. However, the CBI, in its May survey of 1,277 industrial companies, reported that many UK manufacturers 'have seen a marked improvement in home and export orders from low levels in the past few weeks' and expect to increase output over the next four months. Mr David Wigglesworth, chairman of the CBI's economic situation committee, said there were 'several welcome signs in the survey to indicate that the economic downturn may be coming to an end'. But he warned that industry's order books remained well below normal and recovery was likely to be slow. This view was endorsed by CBI economists. They revised down their forecast of UK growth to 0.9 per cent this year from 1.7 per cent previously and warned that the recovery would be 'bumpy'. Yesterday's GDP figures mean that UK economic output has contracted by 4.2 per cent since its peak in the second quarter of 1990 but the decline - although long - has been less steep than the 5.5 per cent fall recorded in the 1979-81 recession. Although the CBI predicted that growth would quicken to 2.9 per cent next year, it stressed that its forecast was subject to downside risks. Underlining the muted nature of the anticipated recovery, it said the pre-recession level of economic activity would only be attained by the third quarter of next year. Yesterday's worse-than-expected GDP figures and tentatively upbeat outlook from the CBI came at the end of a week of similarly mixed economic statistics. News early in the week of the first quarterly increase in manufacturing output since the start of the recession was followed by mildly disappointing retail sales figures for April. On Thursday, a Bank of England report that bank and building society lending rose a seasonally adjusted Pounds 5.1bn last month raised hopes. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade spokesman, said yesterday's figures were 'grim'. CBI says economy is on the turn, Page 4 Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Compensation plan for pensions: Industry body backs role of government in supervising funds BRITAIN'S pension fund trade association yesterday called for a compulsory industry-funded compensation scheme for pension funds which would for the first time require government supervision of the industry. Mr Brian McMahon, chairman of the executive council of the National Association of Pension Funds, said: 'It is the NAPF's firm belief that the members of pension schemes must be able to have absolute confidence in the security and integrity of those schemes. 'Council has therefore come to the conclusion that there needs to be a compulsory compensation scheme to cover all members of approved pension schemes.' Mr McMahon said he believed most NAPF members favoured the creation of a compensation scheme, although he acknowledged there were concerns about the expense. The government's Pension Law Review Committee, chaired by Professor Roy Goode, has been charged with examining the feasibility of a compensation scheme, and NAPF will submit its plan to the Goode Committee for consideration. The plan would require the establishment of a government agency to oversee and administer the compensation scheme, and all schemes would be forced to join. It would pay the pensions of those members whose assets had disappeared through fraud or mismanagement or for any other reason. The new government body would be responsible for enforcing rules on pension fund administration designed to minimise potential claims on the scheme. Pension fund law is already under review by Professor Goode's committee and the new body would have to monitor compliance with any changes brought in on the basis of his recommendations. These rules are those which the government is expected to lay down to protect future pensioners against frauds such as that by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The plan would be funded by 'risk-related' premiums assessed on each scheme in which those schemes that followed industry best-practice would bear the lowest relative cost. Mr Ron Amy, a member of the NAPF council and pensions manager at Grand Metropolitan, said that to reduce potential claims, the government would for the first time have to prescribe key aspects of pension fund administration. Those aspects could include rules requiring member representation on boards of trustees and minimum solvency standards for schemes. Mr McMahon said it was not realistic for the compensation scheme to be made retrospective to cover payments to pensioners of companies controlled by the late Mr Maxwell.

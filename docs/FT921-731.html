			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / West rejects Lockerbie proposal LIBYA was diplomatically marooned last night over its alleged role in the Lockerbie bombing after the west rejected another proposal from Tripoli, and the Arab League said it had suspended attempts to mediate. Arab diplomats in Tunis reported that Libya's latest offer entailed handing over the two suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 wanted by the US and Britain for trial, but on condition they were not interrogated in either country. Tripoli reportedly proposed that the pair should be interrogated by the United Nations or a UN body. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, last night rejected the proposal while repeating his demand that Libya supply a written declaration that it will hand the two suspects to the US or Britain. British officials characterised the Libyan offer as vague and a further attempt to stall a UN Security Council vote to impose sanctions. They said the UN had neither the competence nor mechanism to deal with 'civil criminal matters'. Officials stressed that UN resolution 731 calls simply for the two men to be handed over to the US or Britain for trial. UN vote on sanctions, Page 4</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] With the end of apartheid, the countries which  surround South Africa are beginning to think about an African  economic commonwealth. Almost all belong to the British  Commonwealth. Mozambique is one such country, and its status as  observer has led many economists and intellectuals to say that  Mozambique should adopt the English language.    However, speaking to RDP1 this morning, President Joaquim  Chissano said Mozambique will keep Portuguese as its official  language and will not seek membership in the Commonwealth.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Will  Mozambique seek full membership of the Commonwealth?    [Chissano] Mozambique has never asked to join the  Commonwealth. Mozambique has always asked for support and has  widened its range of countries for economic and other,  diplomatic, cooperation. And so the Commonwealth decided at one  point to invite us to attend its meetings as an observer. This  was because our country is surrounded by Commonwealth countries  and because we played a very important role in the independence  struggle in Zimbabwe, South Africa-Namibia. We have always been  considered an important country in these processes, and the  Commonwealth wanted to benefit from our practice and from our  experience.    But we have never asked to join the Commonwealth. Therefore  I do not understand why there is concern in Portugal about  whether we are members of the Commonwealth or not.    [Correspondent] But will you seek to join?    [Chissano] We will not ask to join. If we are invited to  join, I also do not see it, even though today the Commonwealth  does not mean being a member of Great Britain or paying [word  indistinct] to Great Britain. It is an organization like the  Islamic Conference or other conferences where countries are  welcome; it is an international organization which today is not  based on whether a country speaks English or not. At the moment  is it the English- speaking countries. [passage indistinct] [end  recording]    That was President Chissano speaking on the first day of the  registration of voters in Mozambique. He was speaking about the  future of Mozambique and its language, and its relations with  the Commonwealth. We apologize for the sound quality of the  recording.</p>

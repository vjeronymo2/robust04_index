			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS  </P> <P> I am writing you in response to the article "MCA/Spectacor to Take Over L.A.  Coliseum" (March 27).  </P> <P> I agree with the idea of the takeover of the Coliseum. Al Davis is going to  make the best decision between Oakland and Los Angeles which will help him  financially. Even though the Coliseum is a historical landmark, it could use  the revisions that Davis has asked for. Davis was told when he first came to  Los Angeles that he would get the changes and he is still waiting. The Los  Angeles area needs a professional football team and the Raiders "bad boy"  influence is what we need.  </P> <P> DARRIN EVANS  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

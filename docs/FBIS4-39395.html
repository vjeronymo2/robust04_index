			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Larisa Kislinskaya] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- ITAR-TASS has learned about  some details of an explosion, which occurred at 17.20 Moscow  time on June 7 near the Paveletskiy railway station in Moscow,  opposite the restaurant "Vityaz." It was informed by officials  of the Moscow criminal investigations department today that an  explosive device of an unknown design was planted in an Opel  passenger car, parked next to house no. 40 on Novokuznetskaya  Street, where the office of the Logovaz joint-stock society is  located.    A Mercedes car, carrying Logovaz President Boris  Berezovskikh, was damaged by the explosion when it drove out of  the gates of the Logovaz office. The driver died on the spot.  Berezovskikh, his bodyguard, and three passers-by were wounded  and had to be hospitalised.    Chief of the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department  Vasiliy Kuptsov believes the terroristic act was directed  against the Logovaz president. But this is only one of the  versions. In any case, the owner of the blown-up Opel car with  licence plates of one of the Baltic republics has still not been  found. The explosion was very powerful.    Experts have still not established the type of the explosive  device, but one thing is clear -- it was distant-controlled by  radio. The investigation is being continued.    The board of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance and the  Logovaz joint-stock society has called for immediate vigorous  measures to find and punish the criminals, who had attempted on  the life of director-general of the All-Russia Automobile  Alliance and President of the board of directors of the Logovaz  joint-stock society Boris Berezovskikh.    "The attempt on the life of the initiator of Russia's first  private investment project, who had earned the trust of millions  of Russian citizens and who enjoyed the support of the president  and the government clearly shows that there are forces in our  society who are vigorously striving to prevent by brutal  criminal methods the development of civilised entrepreneurship  in the country, to preclude its economic revival," ITAR-TASS was  told today at the board of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance  and Logovaz.    The board and share-holders of the All-Russia Automobile  Alliance and Logovaz believe that the attempt on the life of  Berezovskikh, member of the leadership of one of the country's  largest financial-industrial groups, can be qualified as a  terrostic act and calls for the most serious attention of the  Russian law enforcement bodies and the public.</p>

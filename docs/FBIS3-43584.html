			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Burundi-African Alliance for Salvation, ABASA,  today held an extraordinary meeting with only one item on its  agenda: The candidature for the post of president of the  republic of Dr. Jean Ndederi, a lecturer at Burundi University  and general adviser of the party.    At the end of the meeting, the executive committee  unanimously decided to support his candidature and called on him  to swiftly perform the required administrative formalities in  accordance with the Constitution and the electoral laws.    Meanwhile, the ABASA secretary general, Mr. Sadiki Ruvako  Dieudonne, has resigned from the ABASA party. He feels that,  quote: Since the beginning of the 21 October 1993 crisis in  which the lamented Melchior Ndadaye, president of the republic,  was assassinated in a cowardly way along with some of his close  collaborators, he has been witnessing with regret the political  harassment orchestrated against the remaining government members  by the opposition parties, including ABASA, end quote. Mr.  Sadiki Ruvako Dieudonne feels that before his compatriots and  his conscience, he finds it very painful to defend a policy in  which he does not believe, and he has therefore taken the firm  decision to resign from the ABASA party.</p>

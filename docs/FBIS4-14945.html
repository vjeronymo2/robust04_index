			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- A meeting of the Commonwealth  Council of Border Troop Commanders set up a coordinating service  here today.    The meeting was for the first time attended by  representatives of all commonwealth states to discuss  interaction of border troops, meeting participants told a news  conference. They have also met Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.    Commander-in-chief of the Russian Border Troops Colonel  General Andrey Nikolayev told correspondents they also dwelt on  the future concept of protection of the commonwealth outer  borders to include purely military issues and a system of mutual  obligations in provision of commonwealth security. The concept  will be submitted for discussion by fall 1994.    The meeting discussed stabilization of the situation at the  Tajik-Afghan border and supported proposals of the Commonwealth  Council of Defence Ministers of March 16 on measures to  stabilize the situation at the commonwealth southern border. It  was decided to take urgent measures in order to prevent  uncontrolled migration in the commonwealth, as well as drug and  arms trafficking.    The Russian side informed the meeting participants of  preparation of bilateral agreements on border protection with  the commonwealth states, which have not signed corresponding  documents.    The Russian delegation held bilateral negotiations with  Commander of the Ukrainian Border Troops General of the Army  Valeriy Gubenko on preparations of a memorandum on cooperation  in the protection of borders of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.  Asked about joint protection of borders with some commonwealth  states, Nikolayev said the border with some states, including  Armenia, is considered common due to the coincidence of  strategic interests.    Nikolayev told ITAR-TASS upon the news conference  completion,  the new agreements provide for open borders within the  commonwealth despite a number of limits. Joint check points may  be set up on major areas on the border with Ukraine.    The border with Azerbaijan provokes concern, as 42 border  trespassers, including 15 citizens of third states (Iran,  Pakistan, the United States, Canada and others) were detained at  the border within three days of March alone, together with the  contraband and unlicensed cargo worth of some 60 million rubles.    There are positive changes in negotiations with Azerbaijan  on  a possibility of joint protection of both domestic and outer  borders, he said.    The border with the Baltic states is being equipped,  although  it costs about one billion rubles to equip one kilometer of the  border.    Nikolayev said there are no Russian border guards in the  Chechen republic but they are ready to protect the Chechen  border with Georgia and Azerbaijan as soon as corresponding  documents are signed.    Ukraine for the first time signed documents on border issues  and it is a positive result of today's meeting, said Nikolayev.</p>

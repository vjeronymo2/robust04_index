			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Country town gets terminal fever as high-tech telecentre takes off: Paul Cheeseright monitors the progress of an attempt to stimulate a local economy Gill Lowes popped four doors down Kington High Street from Howard and Palmer, the chemists, and into the telecentre, now labelled Kington Connected Community Project, to hire a laptop computer for the weekend. She is trying to work up a database of nutrition information which, she hopes, will find a commercial application. Mr Sam Llewellyn, author of Riptide, Clawhammer and other thrillers, sat inside the centre at a computer terminal he was using for about Pounds 3.50 an hour. Apart from novel-writing he has a little publishing business. 'The telecentre facilitates that immensely - you can do the design, the typesetting, the lot yourself,' he said. The telecentre in Kington, Hereford and Worcester, stuffed with more than Pounds 250,000 of electronics, has in three months become the focal point for the Connected Community Project - the shop window of the attempt to stimulate the economy of a small country town by the application of the latest high-technology. The leading partners in this experiment of creating an electronic community are the Department of Trade and Industry and the Rural Development Commission, both of whose motives are to foster economic growth. Other leading partners are British Telecommunications and Apple Computer, which are looking for new ways of selling equipment and services. Kitting out the telecentre is a continuing business. 'We've done something called future proofing. As equipment gets faster this network won't get outdated,' explained Mr Keith Harris, Kington's technical director. The installation of cabling and equipment has been done to make future change easy. 'You don't have to rewire the building to change the position of a telephone,' he said. The telecentre has drawn the curious to such an extent that, to allow the serious to carry on working, it is now closed during the mornings for those dropping in casually. 'We expected the level of interest in the centre would grow organically, but it's been a bang,' said Mr Miles Swinburne, the Kington project manager. 'We're having to introduce booking times.' Word processing and desktop-publishing courses, taking place at the telecentre until a full-scale training centre can be set up, are three-times subscribed. Youngsters are coming in on Saturday mornings. 'We're teaching the kids to build a picture,' said Mr Lawrence Smith, a local art teacher. Anybody with the right equipment at home can pay a subscription, link with centre, be given storage space in the telecentre's computers and become part of the electronic mailing system. The telecentre is also a gateway to the the world through BT's newly installed Integrated Services Digital Network - phone lines which can transmit almost instantaneously text, data, voice and image. The development of the centre, after of public meetings in Kington last summer extolling the potential benefits of a high-technology infusion, created expectations which Mr Swinburne and Mr Harris, the only two people paid full-time by the project company, cannot easily meet. The project has 34 Macintosh computers provided by Apple but, said Mr Swinburne: 'People believed we had 100 machines in a cupboard and we are mean bastards not letting them out.' Of those 34 machines, 16 are in the telecentre, six are destined for the training room, and six are in local schools. For the rest, progress in getting them installed and running around the community has been slower than Mr Swinburne had expected during the planning days of last summer. This is partly explained by the concentration of effort on the telecentre and partly by delays in the training of those who will use them in the first instance. Three machines, for example, will be used by a chain of local sports shops to control stocks, but the retailers themselves have had to concentrate on the Christmas trade rather than computer training. But the work of finding computer applications relevant to the economic development and commercial growth of Kington has not stopped. Just as Ms Lowes is trying to work up her nutrition database, so Ms Ann Pollock is working on a tourism project which would computerise and make available according to demand information such as traffic flows and future local attractions. Mr Richard Hammond is working on the computerisation of farm accounts. Now that the project is moving out of the teething-trouble phase, the method of funding it has started to change. Kington Connected Community is dependent not just on the four main sponsors but also on the Hereford and Worcestershire Training and Enterprise Council and the Leominster District Council. 'They're moving quickly from chucking money in the pot to project-driven funding,' said Mr Swinburne, citing work that the project has received from the district council to computerise information for housing-tenants associations. But, against the background of a so far feeble revenue stream, he warned that 'all documentation on this tells you it takes about three years to be self-financing'. Technology, Page 13</p>

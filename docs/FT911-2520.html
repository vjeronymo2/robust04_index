			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Management (The Growing Business): New funds launched Three new UK venture capital funds have been launched despite forecasts that the scale of venture investment will fall by around a quarter over the next two years. All three funds have been set up by established venture capital groups. One is targeted at the small business in inner city areas while the other two are intended to finance larger, development capital stage deals. The three funds are: A Pounds 20m Inner City Fund established by 3i, the largest UK venture capital group, to back start-ups and established small companies in city centres throughout the UK. Finances for the new fund will come from 3i's own resources. 3i's first Inner City Fund, set up in February 1988, hasprovided a total of Pounds 15m to inner city companies. The aim of both fundsis to invest small amounts of equity - usually of between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 50,000 - in inner city businesses identified by the government-funded City Action Teams or Task Forces, whose brief is to revitalise enterprise and employment. A Pounds 21.5m fund created by Granville &amp; Co, a private investment bank. The ThirdGranville Modern Management Trust fund will finance management buy-outs and buy-ins, debt restructurings and acquisitions. Granville's first fund, launched in 1985, has fully invested Pounds 10m, while a second fund, created in 1988, has invested 70 per cent of its Pounds 21m. A planned Pounds 140m European Acquisition CapitalFund launched by Enskilda Ventures, part of the Scandinavian banking group. Thefund managers have raised the first Pounds 30m towards the fund which will complement Enskilda's existing Scandinavian Acquisition Capital Fund. Venture capital in the UK faces a difficult few years, according to a survey carried out forthe British Venture Capital Association last year. The scale of investment by the industry is expected to fall by 20-30 per cent over the next two years from the 1989 level of Pounds 1.65bn. The institutions which provide finance to the venturecapitalists are demanding better performance from funds they back.</p>

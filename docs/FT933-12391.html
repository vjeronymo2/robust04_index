			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Life assurers hit back at Treasury plan INSURANCE companies have reacted angrily to the Treasury's decision to make life assurance sales agents disclose more information to customers. Many insurance companies said consumers do not need or want to know details of a sales agent's commission. The Treasury, responding to recommendations from the Office of Fair Trading, announced on Thursday that sales agents will have to tell prospective policyholders how much commission they will receive. The new rules on commission disclosure will apply to both independent financial advisers and those who sell the products of a single provider. The Treasury also ordered companies to tell prospective customers by how much their charges are likely to reduce investment returns; how early surrender would affect the value of a policy; and to allow low-cost sales outlets to charge less for the same product than high-cost outlets. With more than 80 per cent of all policies sold through direct or tied sales agents, the Treasury's ruling will have a significant effect. Mr Tom King, general marketing manager at Standard Life, said: 'The chancellor's decisions are not what we were hoping for, especially in relation to disclosure of commission and longer-term surrender values.' Mr King said the difficulties of finding a common method of calculating commissions to different types of sales agents would be too great to make reasonable comparisons. 'That cannot be in anyone's interest, least of all the consumer,' he said. An eventual shift to so-called level commission - payments to sales agents spread over the life of the policy - has been considered by many in the industry for the past year. Mr Peter Roberts, head of corporate affairs at Skandia Life, which sells exclusively through independent financial advisers, said: 'There is no way a sales agent can go out and show this big cash payout to the public and still sell policies.' Industry experts say that not only will the absolute level of commission have to fall, but companies will be forced to abandon the 'front loading' of commission payments that give immediate payouts to agents each time a new policy is sold.

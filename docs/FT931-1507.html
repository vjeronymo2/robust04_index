			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Shanghai Vacuum surges ahead SHANGHAI Vacuum, the first Chinese company to offer shares to foreigners, has reported a 311 per cent leap in attributable profits and a doubling of turnover for the year to December 31. However, the profits surge was due to an increase in what the company described as 'investment income' and not due to a boom in its business of manufacturing tubes for colour televisions. The source of the investment income was not disclosed. Investors reacted indifferently to the figures, marking down Shanghai Vacuum's B shares - denominated in dollars - by 5 cents to 45 cents yesterday. This is partly a reflection of a continuing slide in the Shanghai market. The directors announced a dividend of 3.5 cents per B share and a one-for-10 bonus issue. Shanghai Vacuum is also proceeding with a seven-for-10 rights issue at 44 cents, a 1 cent cent discount to yesterday's closing price. The rights issue would raise about Dollars 92m, assuming the shares are fully subscribed. Attributable profits rose to Yn72.9m (Dollars 12.7m) on turnover of Yn1.02bn. The company expects turnover to be much the same for 1993, and profits to be up by more than 20 per cent.</p>

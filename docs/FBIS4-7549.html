			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 1 (BTA) -- Debates started in  parliament on bills of amendments (demanded by the leading  national dailies) to the Value Added Tax [VAT] Act which is  coming into effect today. However, the bill was not put to the  vote, as the sitting was closed for lack of quorum.    Two bills were moved, one by the MP's of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party (BSP) Yuri Borisov and Ivo Atanasov, and one by  the MP of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) Lyubomir Pavlov.  Under the "Borisov-Atanasov Bill" Bulgarian scientific and  fiction books and non-porn newspapers would be exempted from the  18 percent VAT for a period of three years. Under the "Pavlov  Bill" exemption extends over advertisements as well.    The observations of the parliamentary committees on both  bills were presented at the plenary sitting. The Radio and  Television Committee and the Culture Committee support both  bills. The Economic Committee supports the "Borisov-Atanasov  Bill". According to the Budget and Finance Committee, the  government alone has the right to initiate legislation where  budget-related acts are concerned. It offers a compromise: To  exempt the distribution and sale of newspapers and possibly of  magazines and Bulgarian books from VAT by the end of this year  but to charge further the present 10 per cent turnover tax.  According to the Legislative Committee, the bills are not in  contradiction with the constitution and the principles of the  legal system. However, it maintains that the passage of  amendments to an act which has not even come into effect as yet,  is no contribution to the stability of the legislative system.    Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov who attended the sitting  said he was not convinced that the demanded amendments were in  the interest of the reading public. He pointed out that the  real rise in the prices of published material with the  introduction of VAT should not exceed 7 percent.    Yesterday the editors-in-chief and the publishers of the  leading newspapers presented their demands to the National  Assembly. They insist that the mass media, advertisements in  them, Bulgarian books, trade in newsprint and ink for the  periodicals and for book printing, and printing services be all  exempted from VAT.    The leading national dailies staged a four-day boycott  (Monday- Thursday) in protest against the newly introduced tax.  On Monday [28 March] and Tuesday [29 March] the six private  radio stations did not broadcast. They were back on the air  Wednesday [30 March] but aired several minutes of noise effects  every hour. Local newspapers and radiostations protested as  well. A protest procession of Bulgarian intellectuals --  writers, journalists, publishers and book distributors -- was  held Wednesday.</p>

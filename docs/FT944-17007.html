			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Commodity prices hit industry The cost of materials used in manufacturing rose last month as the impact of recent commodity price increases started to be felt. Overall, the input price index rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent in September, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. Coffee, copper and pulp prices all rose sharply while the cost of crude oil purchased by manufacturing fell slightly during the month. The key reason for the coffee price rise was a world shortage which has been aggravated by recent frosts in Brazil. The price of coffee imports has risen by 5.3 per cent in the past month and has trebled in the past year. The coffee price surge pushed the overall price of imported materials for food manufacturers higher, the CSO said. Imported food manu-facturing materials rose 2.4 per cent in September compared with August, adding 0.2 percentage points to the input price index. This compares with a fall of 1 per cent in the month for home produced food manufacturing products. Rising copper prices on world commodity markets had a significant impact on the metals sector, where input costs rose 2.4 per cent in September compared with August, and 13.9 per cent in the year to September. Copper prices rose 3 per cent in the month and are 30 per cent higher than a year ago, the CSO said. The rise in copper prices has been fuelled by stronger than expected European economic growth and recovery in the construction industry, which has boosted demand for the metal in the housebuilding and car industries. Elsewhere in the index, the pulp, paper and publishing industry reported price rises of 0.6 per cent in the month. These rises were largely passed on to consumers, with output prices in this sector also growing by 0.6 per cent in the month.</p>

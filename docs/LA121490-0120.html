			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN SLAYING;  </P> <P> HEARING: DESPITE BEING IDENTIFIED BY AN EYEWITNESS, THE SUSPECT PLEADS NOT  GUILTY IN THE DEATH OF A NEWPORT BEACH WOMAN WHO OWNED A LODGE IN TULARE  COUNTY.  </P> <P> A man who denied killing the Newport Beach woman who owned Camp Nelson Lodge in  Tulare County was ordered Thursday to stand trial on a murder charge.  </P> <P> Bruce Edward Beauchamp of Fontana declared his innocence, even though he  admitted being in the mountain community the night Bonnie Jean Hood died and  even though a witness identified him as the killer.  </P> <P> That witness, Rudy Manuel, 35, was wounded by an assailant who broke into  Hood's cabin the night of Aug. 19. Manuel said that Hood, 46, went to his cabin  and asked him to check because she thought something was wrong. Manuel, who was  the lodge's caretaker, said he then went to Hood's cabin, and Beauchamp burst  in and ordered him to kneel on the floor.  </P> <P> Manuel said he refused "because I knew he was going to put the gun to the back  of my head and kill me."  </P> <P> Instead, Manuel lunged at the gun and was shot in the head. He said he  pretended to be unconscious and heard two more shots, one of which killed Hood.  </P> <P> Beauchamp, his ankles shackled, testified that he initially went to Camp Nelson  on a weekend in August after Hood's husband, Jim Hood, told him about the  resort.  </P> <P> The defendant once worked for a real estate development company partly owned by  Jim Hood, Valley Business Center in Newport Beach. During the preliminary  hearing, Beauchamp said he recently had been collecting unemployment but also  made $400 under the table from Jim Hood and his partner.  </P> <P> Beauchamp, 30, said he returned to the mountain community the evening of Aug.  18 in a futile search for a woman he had met on the previous visit. After  drinking, dancing and ingesting methamphetamines, he claimed that he left Camp  Nelson at 1:30 a.m. Aug. 19 to return to the Fontana area about 250 miles  south. Beauchamp said he arrived at a female friend's home in Southern  California at 6 a.m.  </P> <P> Bonnie Hood was slain about 3 a.m. that morning.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. MacCrae O'Heaghra said other testimony impeached Beauchamp's  credibility.  </P> <P> However, defense attorney Charles Rothbaum challenged the credibility of  Manuel's eyewitness identification because of Manuel's head injury.  </P> <P> "The evidence in this case stinks, your honor," Rothbaum told Visalia Municipal  Judge Joseph Kalashian.  </P> <P> But the judge said Manuel's testimony and Beauchamp's admission that he was in  Camp Nelson the night of the murder are sufficient evidence to order the  defendant to stand trial. Kalashian scheduled a Dec. 28 arraignment in Tulare  County Superior Court.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mamduh Nawfal (Palestine National Council </F> member, participant in negotiations to implement Oslo  Agreement): "Major Obstacles Hindering Entrance of Palestinian  Police to Gaza, Jericho"]    [Text] Following the signing of Cairo agreement number two  on 31 March of this year concerning the situation in Hebron,  there was much talk in political circles and the press about the  entrance of Palestinian police to Gaza and Jericho. The talk  climaxed by setting the days and hours for the entrance. Is it  true that the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho  and the entrance of Palestinian police to take up their duties  there has become imminent? Will their appearance among their  people be appreciated and respected? Or are there major  obstacles hindering this entrance--obstacles that might mar  their coming--not to mention other hidden obstacles that could  surface in a moment?    As a preliminary to answering these questions, we must pause  to consider the implications of the agreement concerning Hebron;  for that agreement reflects the Israeli leadership's way of  thinking and their modus operandi in handling the specious and  artificial basic problems and obstacles that have appeared or  will appear during the negotiations and during implementation of  the agreements. I think there is no doubt in the Palestinian  ranks that the agreement concerning treatment of the Hebron  massacre was inadequate and that Palestinians are right to  criticize it and consider it a negative sign of the policy and  way in which Rabin has handled and will handle subsequent  problems. At Rabin's insistence, the agreement lacked any  mention or practical step against the settlers and their weapons  and against their behavior. The Hebron massacre gave Rabin  opportunities to make up for the time he has wasted since 13  December to the present; yet he reaffirmed his insistence on  continuing the policy of advancing slowly on the path of  negotiations--a policy he has followed thus far since assuming  office, especially after the signing of the Oslo Agreement on 13  September 1993. The massacre gave him an opportunity make the  racists, extremists, and all Israeli enemies of peace understand  that they would not be allowed to toy with such major Israeli  issues as the issue of peace; but he hesitated. Instead of  removing the settlers from the city of Hebron and ending the  friction there, he imposed on the people of Hebron measures that  increased the friction, raised the degree of tension, and could  lead to the evacuation of several thousand residents of central  Hebron.    I think that anyone who wishes can register even more  criticism of the Hebron agreement and those responsible for it.  Yet this will not undo the fact that the agreement has been  signed and become a fait accompli that, in coming days, will be  translated into practical steps on the ground in Hebron.  Norwegian, Italian, and Danish forces will arrive there shortly.  I think their arrival is an important gain that must be seen and  dealt with positively and that one must work to develop. The  value of this foreign presence lies not in the military and  security capability of these forces to confront the settlers'  provocations and crimes--for these matters are beyond their  capacity and outside the scope of their activity and  responsibilities. Rather, it lies in the implications and  dimensions of their presence itself. Their presence with Rabin's  agreement means that he acknowledges that the West Bank and Gaza  are occupied territory; for no one would accept the entry and  stationing of foreign forces on his own territory. It also means  that sovereignty over this territory does not belong to Israel;  for a foreign presence involves a violation and challenge to the  sovereignty that Israel claims over part or all of this  territory. I think that the value of this presence will increase  even more and become more and more prominent as greater numbers  and more nationalities of foreign forces arrive in Gaza and  Jericho under the provisions of the Declaration of Principles  (DOP), which alludes to such a presence.    Regardless of the difference of opinions over the Hebron  agreement, it has confirmed objectively that the positive  momentum that the peace process has possessed to date remains  greater and more powerful than the obstructive force that has  grown in recent months. However, objectivity forces one to  acknowledge that no one can be absolutely certain that the  positive momentum can compel Israeli forces to hasten their  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho or cause the American cars and  vehicles that have arrived for the Palestinian police to set out  quickly in a few days' time on the Rafah-Gaza road and the South  al-Shuna-Jericho road. Preventing the peace process from being  torpedoed is one thing; accelerating the conclusion of final  agreements is something else, with other considerations and  calculations, especially on the part of the American sponsor.  Although donor nations have moved energetically and have  thankfully begun shipping the civilian and military aid needed  to equip the Palestinian police, and although the Israeli side  has begun to evacuate certain sites in Rafah, Gaza, and Jericho  and has proposed that the Palestinian side send a delegation of  senior officers for reconnaissance to prepare for the sending of  the vanguard of the Palestinian police forces, it is also true  that these steps remain formal and must not be allowed to cover  over the large issues of dispute still being discussed and  debated between the two sides.    The Palestinian side has estimated the size of the police  force needed to cover the duties assigned to it at 10,000 men.  For reasons relating to skill, experience, and urgency of the  operation, it has insisted that 8,000 policemen should come from  abroad and that 2,000 West Bankers and Gazans should be  recruited later. Although the Israeli side acknowledges that  major and varied missions await the Palestinian police, it is  still haggling. In its most recent offer, it agreed to 9,000,  with the number from overseas limited to 6,500. I do not think  it will be difficult to reach a common denominator on this point.    Along with disagreement over numbers, there is substantial  disagreement over the schedule for the withdrawal of Israeli  forces and therefore for the entry of the main body of  Palestinian police. The Palestinian side proposed to the Israeli  side that negotiations on withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho be  accelerated: one should work toward reaching an agreement on all  the security questions without prejudicing the other issues on  the table. However, the Israeli delegation rejected this and  insisted on reaching an integrated "Gaza-Jericho First"  agreement. It continues to regard the signing date of this  integrated agreement as the starting point and date for the  beginning of the Israeli withdrawal and the beginning of the  entry of the main body of Palestinian police and their  assumption of duties. According to the agenda that the two sides  approved as a basis for the current negotiations, this means  that the following problems would have to be discussed and  resolved:    1. Economic issues: in this area Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators still must complete an agreement on labor and  employment, farming and industry, tourism, banking problems, and  the operation of accident insurance companies.    2. Legal questions: the Israeli side proposes discussing  issues of jurisdiction, criminal jurisdiction, and cooperation  in legal matters.    3. Civilian authorities: the two sides still have not  resolved questions concerning water control and management,  archaeology, and regional planning.    4. In security matters, besides the withdrawal plan and the  police deployment plan, the negotiations still must reach  agreement on the security laws dealing with individual  incidents, the question of a temporary international presence in  Gaza and Jericho, and the secure corridor back and forth from  Gaza to Jericho.    If one ponders all these still unresolved issues, the main  inference one can draw is that discussing and debating all these  unresolved questions will require several weeks, if--and this  must be emphasized--Israeli intentions are sincere. As the  saying goes, the man who has been bitten by a snake fears the  trail of a rope. The Palestinian side has been stung by Rabin  three times: first when he put off negotiating for a year before  entering the Oslo channel; second when he missed the 13 December  date set in the Declaration of Principles for beginning  withdrawal; and third when he protected the racists and  extremists in Hebron and allowed them to stay there. If the  visible unresolved questions confirm that the Israeli side is  going to miss the 13 April date for full withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho according to the provisions of the Oslo agreement,  we shall be faced with ample time that Rabin and the Israeli  negotiating delegation will try to fill with formal moves such  as the entry of a group of leaders for reconnaissance, the entry  of 300 policemen into Gaza, Rafah, and Jericho, or beginning to  design and build joint liaison offices.    I think this stretch of time will witness a race between  those international, regional, and local forces eager for  progress and success in the peace process and those local and  regional forces that oppose the process. Each of the two  tendencies will throw its full weight: the former to pass  through the period in peace and safety. I think we shall notice  the practical translation in the movement of American planes  toward Cairo and al-'Arish airports, carrying military vehicles  and armored cars for the Palestinian police, and in the movement  of planes from donor nations, carrying the remaining kinds and  quantities of military and civilian equipment. It will also be  seen when Norwegian, Danish, and Italian forces land at  al-'Arish and Cairo on their way to Hebron. The other tendency,  particularly the racist, extremist forces that are friends and  allies of Rubinstein, naturally will concentrate its efforts on  committing a new massacre somewhere. Why not, when the massacre  at Abraham's Tomb derailed negotiations on the Oslo agreement  for six weeks, and when the punishment it received was very  light and was not without an implied compensation!    From now on, until the signing of the final agreement on  implementing the Oslo agreement, talk about the entrance of the  police will continue and may increase, but it will remain  nothing but talk until the beginning or middle of May. I believe  that great and varied tasks await the Palestinian side from now  until such an agreement is reached. These tasks include  developing the management of the negotiations and improving the  negotiating method itself. It is no accident that the  Palestinian negotiating delegation lacks specialists and  experts. It is also damaging nationally for experienced and  skilled residents from inside [Palestine] to remain absent from  the negotiating table. Another task is to plan and prepare the  forces needed to undertake the great and varied work that will  have to be accomplished on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza.  Anyone who thinks that the success of the Palestinian police in  their patriotic missions depends on good training, large  numbers, or powerful equipment is wrong. The basis of their  success lies in good behavior with the people. Above all, it  lies in effecting a qualitative change in people's lives. Such a  desired change can be made only by mobilizing all resources and  energies and by relying on the collective organizing role of  institutions.</p>

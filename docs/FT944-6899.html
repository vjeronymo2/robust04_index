			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Mazda in pact to make Fiesta Ford is expected to announce this week that it has reached agreement with Mazda, its Japanese affiliate, for the production in Europe of a Ford car for sale under the Mazda badge. The two companies have been examining the possibility of producing a Mazda-badged Ford Fiesta for sale by the Japanese carmaker in European markets. The Fiesta is built at three plants in west Europe: Dagenham in the UK, Cologne in Germany, and Valencia in Spain. Approval of the project could be announced this week, but a decision on which plant will produce the Mazda-badged cars may not be made until early next year. Germany is overwhelmingly Mazda's most important market in Europe. Production of the Mazda-badged Fiesta is expected to begin in late 1995 or early 1996 with output of about 30,000 cars a year. The plan aims to give the loss-making Mazda group its first production source in Europe, where it has lagged behind Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi and Suzuki, which all have car plants already in production or under development in Europe. Mazda, which is 24.5 per cent owned by Ford, has suffered a steep fall in west European sales of 9.6 per cent in the first 10 months of this year in a market that has grown by 4.9 per cent.</p>

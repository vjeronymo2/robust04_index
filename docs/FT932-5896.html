			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Move to speed London SE trade settlement is likely THE LONDON Stock Exchange should abolish its traditional account period and move quickly to settling share trades on a rolling basis, a Bank of England sponsored committee is planning to recommend. Initially, the exchange may move to settling share bargains 10 days after they are struck, but that might shorten quickly to seven days, then five, the committee believes. The committee, headed by Mr Pen Kent, associate director at the Bank of England, was formed after the collapse in March of the stock exchange's proposed Taurus paperless settlement system. The taskforce has been asked to find a 'quick and cheap' solution to modernising London's cumbersome settlements system and to report to the Bank of England by the end of June. Under the account system, all share transactions that take place over a two-week period are settled on a single day a week later. The committee is said to have asked the stock exchange to review how to adapt its Talisman settlements system to rolling settlement. A full move to rolling settlement is unlikely for 12 months. Once that is in place, though, the committee will recommend that settlement periods rapidly be brought down. Also, the committee is said to be considering whether shortening the settlement period would require London to establish a central depository for share certificates similar to those used in other leading markets. Committee members are said to have examined the German Kassenverein, the US's Depository Trust Company and the Euroclear system used to settle international bond transactions, and decided that none meets London's needs sufficiently. The committee is studying commercial clearing and settlements systems, such as provided by Reuters or Thomson Financial Services, to see whether those 'off-the-peg' systems could be adapted. 'The problem is that none of these has a built-in custodial and central registrar capacity,' one committee member said. Lloyds Bank, the UK's largest central registrar of share certificates, is said to have proposed itself as the supplier of a registration system to interact with any commercial system selected by the committee. Meanwhile, there are signs that trying to satisfy the competing commercial interests of City firms remains a stumbling block. Committee members have agreed that the interests of users, rather than of service providers such as registrars, should prevail. However, market makers - those firms which agree to buy and sell shares in specific companies under all conditions - are said to be displeased that the settlements period is not contracting more quickly. Meanwhile, private client stockbrokers, who are also represented on the committee, are said to be unhappy about plans to contract the settlement period much further. Private client stockbrokers cannot collect funds from their customers quickly enough to settle bargains five days after they are struck. See Lex</p>

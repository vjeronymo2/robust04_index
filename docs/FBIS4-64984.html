			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["uhl"-signed report: "Rexrodt Sees Favorable Signs in </F> Industrial Research in East"]    [Text] Bonn, 9 May -- At the 21st meeting on the economic  situation in the new laender with leading industry and trade  union representatives, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed  concern about the decrease of employees in the research  departments of eastern German industry. However, Kohl commented  favorably on the economic development in the new laender.    "With the coming of spring," he said, "the climate for a new  upswing in Germany has also become warmer." He added that in  1994, an investment quota would be reached there that had not  even been reached in the old republic during the years of the  so-called economic miracle. According to the chancellor,  housing construction is one of the "particularly gratifying  chapters" of the catching-up process in the new laender. He  said that this year, investment in housing construction per head  of the population would exceed the western German level by  approximately 10 percent. There had been an "incredible  increase" in building permissions to approximately 100,000.  Federal Construction Minister Irmgard Schwaetzer (Free  Democratic Party -- FDP) said that housing construction in  eastern Germany had changed "from a problem child to an economic  driving force." This year, 70,000 new apartments will be built  in the new laender, compared with 23,611 in 1993.    Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) said that  the productivity of eastern German industry had also made  considerable progress. In the manufacturing sector, for  instance, it had, in 1993, exceeded the result reached in 1991  by 110 percent. Of course, the serious decrease in employment  had played a central role in this respect.    Owing to the high investment dynamism and the Trust Agency's  successful privatization work, modernization had not remained a  passive operation, said Rexrodt. Nonetheless, there were still  "very many difficult cases." Rexrodt mentioned as examples Eko,  DWA, and Wolfen. This year, the number of unemployed in the new  laender would on the whole increase relatively slightly, by  approximately 100,000.    German Industry Federation (BDI) President Tyll Necker  called  upon the state, employers and trade unions, and industry to  concentrate the tight funds on the strengthening of production  forces in eastern Germany. "Let us not be deceived by the  improved number of orders, about the economic situation, which  continues to be very unstable, above all in the eastern German  medium-sized sector, and let us not forget the very bad starting  position." Moreover, according to the example of Section 16 of  the former Law on Aid for Berlin, ways should be found to  channel private capital through banks into productive companies  in the new laender, said Necker.    Kohl voiced concern about the considerable decline in the  number of employees in research and development departments in  the eastern German industry. He said research and development  should be given better opportunities. For this purpose, the  Federal Government had appropriated approximately 2.4 billion  German marks [DM] in the new laender since 1991. The share of  federal subsidies in the companies' research expenditures was  thus about eight times as high as it was in the old laender,  Kohl said.    In a report on eastern German industry research that Rexrodt  and Federal Research Minister Paul Krueger (Christian Democratic  Union) submitted at the economic meeting, "favorable signs" are  noted for the first time, "despite the difficult overall  situation." According to this report, the shrinking process has  clearly decelerated at a low level [as published]. According to  estimates, between 2,500 and 2,700 production companies are  currently dealing with research and development. Small- and  medium-sized companies already stabilized their respective  activities in 1992.    They also stress in the report that companies in eastern  Germany make larger efforts than those in the west to reduce  costs by way of process innovation. However, these efforts are  often oriented toward the imitation of competitive products and  at the national market in particular. Since it is more  difficult than expected to develop an efficient research and  development in eastern Germany, the Federal Government will  continue to increasingly appropriate funds over the medium term.  While the Federal Government spent approximately DM315 million  for this in 1991, it spent as much as approximately DM690  million in 1993. This year, an increase to approximately DM740  million is envisaged.    Craft Industry Federation President Heribert Spaeth said  that  the craft industry would make new training efforts. He said,  however, that a large common effort of industry as a whole was  required to guarantee an adequate supply of apprenticeships in  the new laender in 1994. Roland Issen, chairman of the German  Union of White Collar Workers (DAG), reiterated his demand that  training be financed in part by firms, because firms in eastern  and western Germany increasingly dodged their training  obligation.    Employers' Federation President Klaus Murmann called upon  his  colleagues and entrepreneurs to give the new generations in  their companies the prospect of a thorough vocational training.  Murmann deplored the fact that in the new laender, too,  training places in offices and the service sector are favored,  whereas training places in production and technical areas often  cannot be filled.</p>

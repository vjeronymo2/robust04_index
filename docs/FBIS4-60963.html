			<p>BFN     [Text] The Presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and  Uzbekistan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, Askar Akayev and Islam  Karimov, had a meeting in Cholpon-Ata, Kyrgyzstan.    During the meeting, held at the proposal of Kyrgyzstan  President Askar Akayev on Friday [29 April] and Saturday, the  three leaders spoke about the social and political situation in  their countries, discussed the current state of affairs in  Central Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in  general, and dealt with some international problems.    The presidents said there was a need for practical  mechanisms  to carry out the trilateral treaty to create a single economic  area, an accord which, they said, is in line with the CIS  economic union treaty and is an instrument for the  implementation of the latter document within Central Asia.    Nazarbayev, Akayev and Karimov also brought up some regional  political problems, mainly that of migration and consequent  coexistence between different ethnic groups in Central Asian  countries, and discussed the damage done to Kyrgyzstan's economy  by recent mudslides.    The presidents issued a joint communique, in which they  urged  stronger friendship and cooperation between their countries in  all fields.</p>

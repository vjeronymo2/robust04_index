			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Barclays new loan procedures BARCLAYS, the UK's biggest bank, is making senior executives personally responsible for their mistakes when making big corporate loans, following the Pounds 240m losses which it made on Pounds 422m of loans to Imry, the troubled property group. The change in lending procedures emerged as Chester Holdings, Imry's parent company, disclosed that it had a deficit on shareholders' funds of Pounds 357.6m on March 31 1992. These losses were in part absorbed by holders of Chester's subordinated loan stock totalling Pounds 161m. However, Barclays was forced to write off Pounds 197m from its loans to the group and has made additional provisions to cover possible further losses. Accounts filed at companies house also show that Chester made a pre tax loss of Pounds 105m last year and an after tax loss of Pounds 158m. Barclays exposure to Imry stems from its 1989 loan of Pounds 214m to Marketchief, a financial vehicle which acquired Imry in a leveraged buy - out. That loan was intended as a bridging facility. However, Marketchief was unable to pay it off as quickly as hoped, so in the middle of 1991 Barclays decided to put in place a longer term facility. A banker said yesterday that the security given on the original loan was inadequate. Barclays wanted to secure an improved charge over Imry's assets when making the new longer term loan, but was prevented by the terms of a Pounds 175m 'club' loan from a group of banks to a separate Imry arm, called Imry Merchant Developers. Barclays decided it was vital to take an improved charge over the assets, so it took the unusual step of lending a further Pounds 199m to pay off the Pounds 175m club loan. The club was led by Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Hill Samuel, National Westminster, Bankers Trust, Citibank and Midland, each of who provided Pounds 18.5m. A club member yesterday described Barclays actions as providing 'manna from heaven'. The club, whose agent was Citicorp, was in a powerful position when negotiating with Barclays because a condition of the club loan was that it became immediately repayable if there was a change of control of Imry - and the financial reconstruction of Marketchief amounted to a change of control. A banker said that Barclays has subsequently punished executives involved in the original Marketchief loan. However he added that assigning responsibility for the Imry mistakes was difficult, because at least ten executives had been involved in the lending decision, including three directors whose rank was just below that of the main board. So Barclays has now instituted a new system for approving big corporate loans. No matter how many Barclays employees are involved in the process of making a loan, there will always be one senior executive who takes personal responsibility for the loan.</p>

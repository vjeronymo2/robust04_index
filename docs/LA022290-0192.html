			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PISTONS DON'T LET UP ON MAGIC, 140-109  </P> <P> The Detroit Pistons, who used an impressive defense to carry them to the NBA  championship last spring, can also turn on the offense on occasion.  </P> <P> Joe Dumars scored 22 points and five teammates were in double figures Wednesday  night at Auburn Hills, Mich., as the Pistons routed the expansion Orlando  Magic, 140-109.  </P> <P> The Pistons, who built a big early lead and coasted to their 13th victory in a  row, have not lost since the Lakers beat them Jan. 21.  </P> <P> The Pistons, who began to emphasize defense a few seasons ago, again have the  best defensive record. They have yielded an average of 97.5 points per game.  </P> <P> In this game, though, it was the offense that prevailed. The Pistons scored 70  points in each half. At halftime they led by 17 and the Magic never made a game  of it.  </P> <P> Dumars, the most valuable player in the NBA Finals last season, scored the  5,000th point of his career late in the third quarter. The basket gave the  Pistons an 87-63 lead. The crowd of 21,454 gave the guard a standing ovation.  </P> <P> "That's not a real big number," Dumars said, "but it's nice to be appreciated.  A few years ago I didn't play well enough to be appreciated."  </P> <P> Cleveland 121, Portland 109 -- The Cavaliers have struggled all season because  of a wave of serious injuries. So they were in no mood to sympathize with the  Trail Blazers, who played this game in Richfield, Ohio, without injured star  Clyde Drexler.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers, slowly rounding into playoff form, made 61% from the field in  the first half to build a 64-48 lead, and the Trail Blazers never were able to  get back in the game.  </P> <P> Rookie Chucky Brown and Mark Price led the Cavaliers with 24 points each. Price  sank three three-point shots. Monday night, Price missed all seven of his  attempts from long range to end his streak of games in which he made a  three-pointer at 34.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers had won three in a row on the road. They are hoping that  Drexler, their leading scorer who has a sprained ankle, will play Friday night  at Chicago.  </P> <P> Indiana 123, Atlanta 96 -- When they missed their first seven shots at  Indianapolis, the Hawks had a pretty good idea their slump was not over.  </P> <P> The game was five minutes old before they made their first field goal and the  Hawks, in danger of blowing a playoff spot, lost for the 13th time in the last  15 games.  </P> <P> The Hawks' star, Dominique Wilkins, never did find the range. He was two for 14  and had only four points in 28 minutes.  </P> <P> The hot Pacers made 15 of their first 19 shots to build a big early lead, with  Reggie Miller getting seven points in the first three minutes. Indiana went on  to earn its 28th win, matching its total for all of last season. They have 29  games left.  </P> <P> Utah 116, Boston 103 -- Before losing his cool in the third quarter and being  ejected at Salt Lake City, Karl Malone had already scored 27 points and helped  the Jazz put away the weary Celtics.  </P> <P> It was the 17th win in a row at home for the Jazz and the Celtics' fourth loss  in a row on their tough trip West. Referee Jack Madden charged Malone with two  technicals only 16 seconds after Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan was ejected with five  minutes left in the third quarter. The Jazz led at the time, 77-60.  </P> <P> Thurl Bailey also scored 27 points for Utah, and John Stockton had 17 points  and 17 assists for the Jazz, who are 25-3 at home, with their last defeat Dec.  11 against Cleveland.  </P> <P> Kevin McHale, who was only two for 11 in a loss Tuesday night at Phoenix, led  the Celtics with 34 points. He was 10 for 17 from the field.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 96, Golden State 95 -- Hersey Hawkins sank a three-point shot to  break a 93-93 tie with a little more than a minute left at Oakland and the  76ers held on to win.  </P> <P> A jumper by Terry Teagle with 34 seconds left brought the Warriors to within a  point, but they never got the ball again. The 76ers ran the clock down, and,  after Hawkins missed, Mike Gminski pulled down the rebound and the 76ers ran  out the clock.  </P> <P> New Jersey 95, Minnesota 93 -- The Nets' 14-game losing streak came to a halt,  but just barely, at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> The Nets built a 75-57 lead late in the third period, then blew it and trailed,  93-92, with six seconds to play. Lester Conner took the inbounds pass, dribbled  down the court and sank a 10-foot jumper at the buzzer. He was fouled on the  play and his free throw made it a two-point victory. The Timberwolves had won  four in a row.  </P> <P> Seattle 92, Miami 85 -- Nate McMillan sank a three-point field goal with 1:25  left at Miami to thwart a rally by the Heat and lift the SuperSonics to the  victory.  </P> <P> The Heat trailed, 75-62, after three quarters, then scored the first nine  points of the last quarter, but didn't have enough left.

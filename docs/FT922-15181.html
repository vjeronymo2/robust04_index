			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: Airbus subsidy accord awaits final hurdle of ratification IT was perhaps appropriate that the European Commission and the US should resolve their six-year-old dispute over government subsidies for Airbus on April Fool's Day. Until the last minute, few in the aerospace industry believed the two sides would reach a compromise. The issue has provoked intense and regular trade frictions between the Europe and the EC since 1986, spilling over into the US election campaign this year and casting a dark cloud over the broader trade liberalisation negotiations under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). But the pact reached in Brussels yesterday is unlikely to be the end of the story. It still has to be ratified by the US government and the 12 individual EC governments. 'The Europe versus US issue will remain pretty active for the balance of this year and in the years ahead inspite of the agreement,' said Sir Barry Duxbury, director of the Society of British Aerospace Companies, the UK industry's trade organisation. But both the European Airbus consortium and its two US rivals, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, acknowledged that the last minute compromise 'looks like good progress'. The US had set a deadline of March 31 for an agreement threatening to take the Airbus subsidy issue before the Gatt subsidies panel, or worse still to take unilateral action against Airbus by imposing contravening duties on Airbus airliners which are sold in the US market. That in turn would have led to retaliatory action on the part of the EC against US aircraft sales in Europe. 'It would have been a no win situation,' an Airbus official said. 'If a compromise is not found, we will both be losers,' Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus managing director, warned a few months ago. The new bilateral agreement will cover all new civil airliners over 100 seats but government subsidies granted by both sides before the agreement will not be affected. This reflects the fact that Airbus has now reached maturity, having captured more than 20 per cent of the world market and having developed a complete family of aircraft to compete against the traditional dominance of the market by the US manufacturers. Without government support, Airbus would never have got off the ground. As Mr Pierson has often argued: 'Airbus stands today as the only recourse against a monopoly of the civil aerospace industry by US manufacturers.' But the US manufacturers, worried by the growing inroads of the European group in their home market, felt Airbus could now stand on its own feet. In turn, the EC and Airbus complained the US manufacturers had benefited from indirect subsidies from military programmes and other US government agencies. Each side claimed that the other had received in direct or indirect subsidies at least Dollars 25bn during the last 15 years. Tentative agreement has now been reached on the following issues: Direct subsidies: Direct grants for aircraft production will be banned and direct subsidies for new aircraft programmes will be limited to about 30 per cent of total development costs. Conditions will be imposed on the timing of repayments because the US was worried of the risk of manufacturers not repaying subsidies at the end of a development programme. Indirect subsidies: The level of indirect grants is expected to be limited to less than 5 per cent of a manufacturer's civil aircraft turnover. EC and Airbus officials claimed this was the first implicit admission by the US that its civil aircraft industry benefited from defence and space research subsidies. Transparency: The two sides will meet twice a year for consultations and will be expected to keep each other informed about current and future projects and the level of government support attached to these programmes. Inducements: New rules will include a ban on governments putting pressure on third countries to buy aircraft. Suspension of restrictions: Both sides can ask for suspension of part of the agreement if a manufacturer's business is badly hit by 'external' political and economic factors. Trade disputes: Both sides have agreed not to initiate any new unilateral trade action against the other over aircraft subsidies. The new bilateral agreement will find its first applications with the current proposals of the three manufacturers to launch programmes to develop new ultra large 600-800 seat airliners as well as some less ambitious programmes for smaller airliners. These include the proposed Airbus 120-seater A319 aircraft, an eventual replacement for the Boeing 737 narrowbody twinjet and McDonnell Douglas' plans for a new medium sized airliner the MDXX. McDonnell Douglas is also hoping to launch later this year its MD-12 400-600 seater airliner programme with Asian partners. Disputes seem certain to continue on the extent to which military research grants are of direct benefit to commercial aircraft development; on transparency of aircraft financing with the EC arguing in the past that too much transparency risked releasing commercially sensitive information; and especially on government inducements and other practices to win new aircraft sales. But the two sides, at least, managed to avoid an all out trade war. See Editorial Comment</p>

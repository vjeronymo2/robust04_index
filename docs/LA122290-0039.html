			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OUSTED LEADER ASSAILS ALLIANCE BETWEEN SIERRA CLUB, BERNHARDT  </P> <P> San Diego City Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt's anti-recall forces sought to  "circumvent" campaign laws by funneling contributions from an ambulance company  to the Sierra Club to pay for pro-Bernhardt campaign mailers, an ousted Sierra  Club leader charged Friday.  </P> <P> Mark Zerbe, who was pressured to resign from the Sierra Club's top leadership  panel Thursday night, issued the charge Friday in a blistering nine-page memo  that contended that the preservationist organization has abandoned its  environmental principles to support Bernhardt at all costs. None of Zerbe's  many accusations could be independently confirmed.  </P> <P> "The Club's staunch support for Linda in the face of certain defeat (in an  expected recall election this spring) is embarrassing and may result in the  loss of an environmental majority on the City Council," Zerbe wrote in the Dec.  13 memo to Sierra Club officials that he distributed publicly Friday. "The Club  now smells as bad as the dead horse it chained itself to."  </P> <P> Sierra Club Chairman Rob Langsdorf declined to discuss any of Zerbe's  allegations, which included its relationship with Bernhardt, manipulation of  elected Sierra Club leaders by the organization's political lobbyists and the  environmental report card the club released Nov. 26.  </P> <P> Bernhardt, however, called Zerbe's charges "baseless allegations" made by a  political opponent. "The guy apparently has some serious problems," Bernhardt  said.  </P> <P> Glen Roberts, chief executive officer of Hartson Medical Services, denied  Zerbe's accusation that a contribution to Bernhardt's campaign was linked to a  council vote on the Hartson contract with the city. Roberts said he has  contributed funds to every City Council member except Abbe Wolfsheimer, but did  not recall when he last contributed to Bernhardt.  </P> <P> The City Council voted, 6 to 2, Sept. 18 to negotiate an extended contract with  Hartson and added 10 firefighters to the paramedic force. Bernhardt voted with  the majority.  </P> <P> Zerbe, then treasurer of the Sierra Club's political committee, claimed that,  when he balked at accepting the money, he received a call from David Gould,  Bernhardt's campaign treasurer.  </P> <P> "Mr. Gould called me the next day and suggested ways of circumventing the  city's $250 contribution limit and ban on contributions from businesses, such  as getting a stack of contributions from employees of Hartson's and depositing  them in the Sierra Club's account in San Francisco so that it wouldn't appear  in campaign records in San Diego," Zerbe wrote in the memo.  </P> <P> Gould did not return a telephone call to his office Friday.  </P> <P> The scheme was never carried out, Zerbe said. But, in the memo, he added that  "lobbyists seldom give contributions just prior to important votes without  making sure the politicians involved are aware of them. I also find it  difficult to believe that the Bernhardt campaign would casually expect me to  allow the (Sierra Club political committee) account to be used to launder  contributions without someone within the Club first making the suggestions to  them."  </P> <P> Zerbe, who worked to defeat former Councilman Ed Struiksma, Bernhardt's 1989  political opponent, acknowledged Friday that he no longer supports the 5th  District councilwoman. Last month, he publicly accused the Sierra Club of  manipulating its environmental report card so that Bernhardt would be ranked  first.  </P> <P> Those accusations led to his ouster at a Sierra Club meeting Thursday night.  Langsdorf declined to discuss the situation, issuing a three-paragraph  statement that said, in part, that "Mark made it clear that he did not wish to  use the (club's) process to deal with his concerns."  </P> <P> In Friday's memo, Zerbe went further, claiming that the Sierra Club's second  report card was published as an "alternate method" of supporting Bernhardt,  when the organization's executive committee balked at sending out a favorable  mailer to its membership.  </P> <P> "It was discussed that (the report card) would have to be prepared quickly in  order to have an impact on the recall," Zerbe wrote.  </P> <P> Zerbe also said in the memo that Julie Dillon, chairman of the local Building  Industry Assn., told him in a meeting that "Bernhardt had effectively been  extorting money from developers, and that they were considering a financial  boycott."  </P> <P> Dillon said the charge was "totally false" and that she discussed only water  conservation and campaign reform with Zerbe.  </P></p>

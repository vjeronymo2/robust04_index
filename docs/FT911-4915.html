			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch soars 338% as Wall St fortunes recover THE EXTENT of the turnround in Wall Street's fortunes since the beginning of the year was fully revealed yesterday when Merrill Lynch, the biggest securities house in the US, reported a 338 per cent increase in first-quarter profits, to Dollars 181m. The Dollars 1.62-a-share earned by Merrill Lynch in the quarter exceeded the Dollars 1.59-a-share reported by the company for the whole of 1990. In the first quarter of 1990, it made a profit of just Dollars 41.3m, or 34 cents a share. The stock market had been expecting good news from the company and, by mid-session, Merrill Lynch shares had risen only Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39 5/8 . An 18 per cent increase in revenues to a record Dollars 3.1bn was behind the dramatic improvement in earnings, with income from principal trading business rising 57 per cent to Dollars 550m, another all-time high. The company said trading revenues from swaps, government and agency securities, high-yield corporate bonds, corporate equities, and money market products rose significantly. Commission revenues also rose sharply, climbing 21 per cent to Dollars 521m, a reflection of improved market conditions, increased demand for securities from investors, and higher transaction fees charged to customers. Merrill Lynch even turned in a profit on investment banking, the business that has endured the biggest contraction in the past 12 months. Revenues from investment banking rose 7 per cent to Dollars 195m, with an increase in the underwriting of corporate debt and mortgage and asset-backed securities compensating for a decline in merger and acquisition activity. Asset management and custodial fee income advanced 12 per cent to Dollars 191m for the quarter, with assets under fee-based management increasing by a record Dollars 11bn to Dollars 121bn. The results of the restructuring of Merrill Lynch that began in 1989 showed through in lower costs for the quarter. Operating expenses, excluding insurance, compensation and benefits, fell 5 per cent to the lowest level for over three years, aided by a 15 per cent reduction in expenditure on advertising and market development. The number of staff fell by about 800 in the quarter, taking the total jobs shed since the end of 1987 to over 8,000. Total expenses actually rose, to Dollars 2.9bn, primarily because of the rise in commissions paid to financial consultants and account executives and in bonuses paid to other employees. Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday unveiled fiscal third-quarter profits of Dollars 57.7m, up 82 per cent on the Dollars 34.6m earned a year earlier. Gross revenues were Dollars 626.9m, against Dollars 587.6m.</p>

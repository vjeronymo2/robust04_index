			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSESSOR'S SHORTCOMINGS COST $11.5 MILLION A YEAR, AUDIT SAYS  </P> <P> Failure of the assessor's office to fully implement recommendations made two  years ago could cost Los Angeles County more than $9 million annually in lost  interest, according to an audit report issued Monday.  </P> <P> Conducted by the public accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young, the audit  determined that the county could lose an estimated $9.1 million in annual net  interest because of processing delays and problem billings, and an additional  $2.4 million in uncollected tax revenue because of problem billings -- problems  that were addressed in recommendations made by the county grand jury in fiscal  1987-88.  </P> <P> The review, completed in April at the request of the 1989-90 county grand jury,  comes as Assessor John J. Lynch is facing a November runoff against Kenneth P.  Hahn, a mid-level manager in the assessor's office, to head the department that  determines tax bills for 2.2 million properties throughout the county.  </P> <P> Besides advising the assessor's office to begin or continue the implemention of  seven recommendations by the grand jury, the report offered 11 new suggestions  for improving the office's efficiency, including the development of procedures  to better deal with the public's confusion over tax matters.  </P> <P> Although Lynch has been criticized for not getting tax bills out on time and,  therefore, costing the county revenue, the assessor said that many of the  problems raised in the audit are being addressed and that the estimated losses  are largely speculative.  </P> <P> "The grand jury auditors can only do so much in a given time," Lynch said.  "While they're doing their very audit, improvements are locking into place."  </P> <P> Saying many problem bills have been reprocessed since the office review was  completed in April, reducing interest losses, Assistant Assessor Roy Sharman  said an Ernst &amp; Young auditor has already reduced the $9.1-million estimate  of lost annual interest to $6.3 million, and cut the $2.4-million figure in  half.  </P> <P> "A lot of this is supposition," said Sharman, referring to the report's  estimates of lost revenue. "They're supposing this will happen and projecting  years into the future."  </P> <P> Ernst &amp; Young could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Assessor's spokesman Robert Knowles said a written response to the report will  be issued through the county Board of Supervisors.  </P></p>

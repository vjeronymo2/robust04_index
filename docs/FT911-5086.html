			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Twelve push open the door to east Europeans a little further EUROPEAN COMMUNITY foreign ministers yesterday gave negotiators from the European Commission more leeway to reach association agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. After three rounds, negotiations had reached deadlock, the east Europeans complaining that the EC was being economically protectionist and politically evasive in refusing to offer them membership. The Commission expressed 'considerable satisfaction' at the ministers' decision yesterday that: The prospect of membership can figure in the association agreement's preamble as an ultimate goal, but there will be nothing automatic about it. The EC will drop its demand for a half-way review of the 10-year phasing in of mutual free trade. The three east European countries see this review as putting in question the EC's commitment to free trade. The east Europeans will be given more time to establish the tariffs they are supposed to phase out over the 10-year period Agricultural concessions by the EC can be considered, provided the east Europeans make a reciprocal effort. Tariffs on textile imports from east Europe will be eliminated over the 10 years, while restrictions on steel imports will end in five years, provided the east European countries cut out subsidies to these sectors. So far, Brussels has not responded to Romania and Bulgaria's interest in similar association accords. Talks to widen Yugoslavia's long-standing economic co-operation agreement with the Community are for the moment held up by the political turmoil there. The EC presidency and Commission are due to visit Belgrade shortly.</p>

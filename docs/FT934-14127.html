			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Government insolvency unit slammed THE GOVERNMENT'S insol-vency service is failing to disqualify enough directors of collapsed companies, says a highly critical National Audit Office report to be released tomorrow. The audit office, the watchdog on government spending and efficiency, calls for greater efforts by officials to debar from future directorships executives who have been responsible for the failure of their companies. The report says the insolvency service, part of the Department of Trade and Industry, has failed to prosecute many directors criticised by official receivers and by private-sector insolvency practitioners appointed as receivers and liquidators. The insolvency service gained powers to bring prosecutions under the 1986 Directors' Disqualification Act, which allows the courts to suspend individuals from holding directorships. In 1992-93, 651 directors were disqualified against a total of 450 in 1991-92. But the audit office estimates that only half of the cases against directors identified by practitioners or the service's own staff as candidates for disqualification have been pursued for prosecution. It also highlights considerable variations by the regional offices of the service in pursuing directors for disqualification. The attack comes when record numbers of companies have failed and insolvency practitioners within accounting firms have been expressing concerns that their recommendations are not being pursued hard enough by the service. The insolvency service - often supported by practitioners - has argued in the past that its failure to disqualify more directors reflects insufficient funding. That concern led to a 9 per cent budget and staffing increase in the insolvency service approved by ministers during the current year. The audit office's report calls for greater publicity for the penalties of disqualification and of those who have been prosecuted. A survey it conducted of company directors showed that half were not even aware of the existence of the legislation and its penalties. It also criticises provisions within Scottish insolvency legislation which allow companies without any assets to be dissolved without the option for scrutiny of directors.</p>

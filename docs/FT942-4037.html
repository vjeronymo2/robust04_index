			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Two account periods left There are only two complete account periods left until rolling settlement begins on July 18, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. The stock exchange divides the year up into account periods, named by letters of the alphabet. We are now in account period L, in which the last day for dealings is June 17. All trades conducted any time in the account period, which began on June 6, are totalled and a single bill for the net amount is sent out which has to be settled on June 27. This allows some investors (ie, those who have dealt early in the account) up to 15 working days to settle. The system allowing them to settle the net amount is useful for all investors. And speculators who aim to buy and sell at a profit within the same account can, if successful, make money without ever having to put up a penny. Account periods will disappear from July 18, although investors who dealt in the last period - account N - can still settle in the usual way on July 25. From July 18, the settlement day will be 10 working days after dealing day - or T+10.</p>

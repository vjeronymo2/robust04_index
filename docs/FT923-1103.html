			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NY commodity markets fight for fresh trade IN A DRIVE to boost trading volume, the New York commodities markets have launched or won approval for trading a spate of new contracts this autumn. Many attempt to engage more international traders or address differences in US regional markets. But the success of new futures products is anything but certain. A rough industry standard is that only about one in four contracts makes it. The New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange's effort to start a Euro-Differential Coffee futures last year came to an end earlier this month. The coffee market has been trading at all-time lows, and the product  -launched in April 1991 - just did not catch on. The exchange puts the failure down to 'bad timing'. Last week the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) launched its new Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline contract. This is the second new big contract, after sour crude, launched by Nymex this year. Nymex believes that the contract will capture more Midwest and Southwest users who must hedge. The exchange's New York Harbor delivery contract had not proved as useful to these users, given that cash prices in the Gulf Coast area differ from those of the Northeast. Regional differences in environmental legislation could also add some allure to the Gulf contract, given that the two blends will reflect regional standards. The Nymex New York Harbor delivery contract for unleaded gas has in any case seen increased volume this year. For the period of January to August, 4.7m contracts were traded, up from 3.6m for the same period last year. The New York Commodity Exchange (Comex), which is increasingly competing with Nymex by creating similar contracts, is perhaps the most eager of the exchanges to boost trading volume. Primarily a precious metals market, Comex's futures trading volume this year, for January through August, is down to 7.7m contracts compared to 8.8m for the same period last year, according to figures from the Futures Industry Association. Comex will launch futures based on the Eurotop 100 Index, under an agreement with the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam, on October 26. It hopes the contract will have some interplay with the American Stock Exchange, which will launch cash options on the the Eurotop 100 the same day. Cutting closer into Nymex's territory, Comex has won approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to trade jet fuel futures. These are expected to begin trading during the first quarter of 1993. The jet fuel contract will be for physical delivery on the Gulf Coast. The New York Cotton Exchange is also moving ahead with the launch of its new World Cotton futures contract on October 1. The exchange is trying to address the world cotton market, where prices can diverge from those of the US. Its existing contract is for US cotton only. The new contract, which will be cash settled, is based on Cotlook's daily survey of raw cotton from 13 countries. The daily average is made up from the five cheapest quotes.</p>

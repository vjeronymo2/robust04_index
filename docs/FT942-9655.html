			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Facts fall victim to the butcher's knife: Quentin Peel and Alison Maitland examine the dispute over British beef exports to Germany The sign pasted up over the meat counter in the Stussgen supermarket in a Bonn suburb this week said it all. 'Buying meat is a matter of trust,' it declared. 'We sell only German quality beef.' To any German consumer, the message is clear: it means there is no British beef on the counter. For in the minds of most German consumers in recent weeks, the words British beef have become synonymous with a fear of human infection with 'mad cow disease' - bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The Bonn butcher was relaxed enough: 'I've been getting questions from my customers all right, wanting to know where the beef was from. But since we have had the sign up, I think they have been reassured. They know we only sell fresh local meat.' Yet statistics for all beef sales in Germany in recent weeks suggest otherwise. The German wholesale meat traders' association claimed yesterday there had been 'a dramatic slump in sales'. The butchers' federation in Frankfurt said the decline was at least 5 per cent in the past few weeks, since Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister, first suggested that a selective ban on British beef imports was needed to protect the public against the threat of BSE. The row threatens to blow up into a serious confrontation, not just between Britain and Germany, but also between Germany and the rest of the European Union. The European Commission has until now accepted that Britain has done enough to control BSE, and prevent any danger of its spreading to other member states. It is considering tougher enforcement, but nothing so drastic as an import ban. Yet that is what Germany is threatening to enact unilaterally if there is no compromise agreed by agriculture ministers by May 30. The battle over BSE looks like becoming a classic reconfirmation of national prejudices in Britain and Germany: the former complaining of German fanaticism and high-handedness, the latter of sloppy British standards in vital areas of public health and environmental awareness. Yet the experts on both sides are far more divided than the battle-lines suggest. In Germany, the farmers' union has sharply criticised Mr Seehofer for threatening to go it alone in his battle with Brussels. They fear that the backlash will hit far more important interests - like their campaign for more money from Brussels for German farmers who have been forced to slaughter some 800,000 pigs because of swine fever in the past six months. There is also a widespread recognition that German consumers are notoriously prone to overreaction in anything concerning food health - an overreaction compounded when politicians get involved. On the other hand, in Britain there are a number of scientists who would support the German health minister in his contention that as long as there is the slightest possibility that BSE might cause human infection, the strictest possible controls should be enforced. In spite of the BSE scare, total British beef exports rose 51 per cent last year to Pounds 407m, which the British Meat and Livestock Commission attributes to successful marketing and the devaluation of sterling. Some Pounds 355m of that went to the EU, with France by far the largest importer  -to the tune of Pounds 189m - and Germany the smallest, taking only 900 tonnes, worth Pounds 2.6m. The British government says the German debate has not only hit beef exports  -they totalled 2,000 tonnes to Germany in 1992 - but lamb and pork sales as well. But the real British concern is the domestic beef market, which earned British farmers Pounds 1.85bn last year. German observers are quick to point out the irony of the situation. 'I am amazed that even while there are thousands of animals still being slaughtered in the UK because of BSE, the British consumer does not appear to be concerned,' said Mr Richard Brucker, head of the livestock section in the German farmers' union (DBV). 'Yet here in Germany, where we really don't have the problem at all, the consumers are all up in arms. It's quite contradictory.' The BSE scare in Germany is only the latest in a string of food health scares. One of the most startling was the thread worm crisis which threatened to devastate the German fish market in 1987: a single television programme suggesting that fresh fish contained live worms when they got to the fishmonger's slab caused a dramatic slump in consumption. Per capita, the level dropped from 13.2 kg in 1986 to 11.8 kg in 1987, as panic spread through the fish-buying public. 'There was an hysterical outcry to begin with,' said Mr Matthias Keller, chief executive of the Hamburg-based fishing industry association. 'But the consumers listened to reason in the end.' That was not until the European Commission, the German government, and the industry had launched a big and costly public relations exercise. Another good example of Germany's special sensitivity was over the fall-out from Chernobyl. Watercress growing along the German bank of the river Rhine was torn up and destroyed. The same plant on the French bank was cheerfully harvested and sold - some of it to Germany. BSE looks to be another case where Germany is determined to be stricter than all its neighbouring states. Mr Brucker blames politicians in general, and Mr Seehofer in particular. 'He has set himself up as the great consumer's protector,' he said. 'But he is risking his neck in this confrontation with the Brussels Commission.' If Mr Seehofer is under attack on his home front, Mrs Gillian Shephard and the British Agriculture Ministry are also open to criticism. Dr Stephen Dealler, a microbiologist at York District Hospital who has researched BSE, says the Germans are right to want to take action to protect their consumers. 'If you sit and wait, you're taking a risk of unknown proportions,' he said. 'The Germans are saying 'We're not going to take this risk, it's too high.' They're right.' Scientific tests on other animal species and his own calculations, based on agriculture ministry and other scientific data, suggested the risk that BSE could cross the 'species barrier' from cows to humans was high, he said. Cattle become infected when very young but the incubation period is four to seven years, he said. The risk of infection grows as the incubation period advances. 'For every cow we're slaughtering with the disease, we're eating five to six others while they're incubating it but showing no signs of it,' he added. Now it is up to the EU agriculture ministers to find a compromise. They will be hard put to do so. For the real difference between Britain and Germany is not about scientific evidence. It is about different public perceptions of what constitutes a food danger to health. It is a question of culture, not of fact.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 2 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- T. Elbegdorj  leader of the largest public and political establishment of  Mongolia -- the Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU) who was one of  those laying down foundations for democratic transforming of the  country and being currently in opposition to the incumbent  authorities has been released today by the session of the Great  State Hural of Mongolia of his duties of a member of the  parliament. Out of the 57 members of the parliament being  present at the sitting some 69.6 percent of them voted for  complying with the request by T. Elbegdorj on releasing him of  his duties of legislator which was filed by himself during the  days of this April hunger strike. His refusal of  parliamentarianship he motivated by the impossibility to be  representing the interests of its voters in the parliament. He  reaffirmed his refusal at the meeting. Meanwhile the majority  of members of the parliament were of other opinion considering  T. Elbegdorj has lost both moral and juridical right to be an MP  bearing in mind the recent hunger strike calling for the  resignation of the government of members and supporters of the  MDU and the accuse of being guilty in leaking the state  classified information which was brought against him by the  Central Investigation Board. It is likely that it is the latter  which would be applied as a basis for the parliamentary bill on  releasing T. Elbegdorj of his duties of an MP.</p>

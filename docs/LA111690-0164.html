			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AROUND TOWN;  </P> <P> NIGHT AND DAY DESIGNS;  </P> <P> IRIT EHRLICH: SIMPLE SHAPES AND LUXURY FABRICS ARE HER TRADEMARK. IN THE BEST  NEW DESIGNS, GOLD LACE PLAYS AGAINST BLACK VELVET FOR A RICH EVENING LOOK.  </P> <P> Irit Ehrlich has three rules for designing clothes: simple shapes, basic colors  and only the most exquisite fabrics.  </P> <P> The results of this formula are lush and appealing, and it's easy to see why  Ehrlich has survived in the antiquated world of custom order.  </P> <P> In a fashion show Monday for the 500 Club of the City of Hope, Ehrlich gave a  sampling of daytime, cocktail, black-tie and bridal clothes for the  winter/holiday season under her label, Irit Designs.  </P> <P> The colors were black, gray and ivory, with touches of gold and red; fabrics  included silk velvet, silk satin, lace, wool and cashmere.  </P> <P> Among the standouts: long wool herringbone jackets over short skirts and  re-embroidered lace dresses sculpted to fit the body.  </P> <P> To the surprise of some audience members, most skirts were about eight inches  above the knee. They can, of course, be ordered in longer versions.  </P> <P> At her very best, Ehrlich uses gold fabrics against black velvet for a look  that has the richness and radiance of a Zeffirelli film: a sheer gold poet's  jacket floats over a black silk velvet sheath, for example, and a long opera  coat and pencil-slim pants, both in black silk velvet, pair with a splendid  gold lace blouse with a scalloped edge.  </P> <P> The Irit Designs salon is in Los Angeles.

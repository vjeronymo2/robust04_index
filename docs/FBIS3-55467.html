			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense Ministry press service provided the  following information on 7 January. Despite sustaining crushing  blows in various sectors of the front in recent days, the  Armenian Armed Forces are not giving up their occupationist  plans, and are trying to breach the defensive positions of the  Azerbaijani Army. Their efforts in this direction are being  brought to naught thanks to the gallantry of our fighters; and  the enemy is retreating, while sustaining enormous losses.    Our brave fighters destroyed more than 200 enemy troops and  more than 50 armored vehicles in fighting today. The fleeing  Armenians, who were chased out of the positions they had  previously occupied, are leaving behind considerable amounts of  military hardware and provisions. The gallant Azerbaijani Army  once again showed its strength to the enemy.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Return to profit at Aerospace Engineering AEROSPACE Engineering turned round from a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.16m to a profit of Pounds 214,000 in the year to April 30, adjusting for the FRS 3 accounting changes. The final dividend is held at 0.5p. Following the cut at the interim stage, however, that gives a total of 0.75p, against 1p. Earnings per share were 0.75p (losses 3.76p). Mr John Davis, chairman and chief executive, said the recovery was achieved after absorbing Pounds 122,000 (Pounds 1.12m) costs relating to disposal of businesses, Pounds 51,000 (Pounds 742,000) restructuring costs, and against difficult trading conditions in UK markets. The aerospace sector, in particular, suffered from weak demand exacerbated by severe competition in an over-supplied market, he pointed out. Much of the improvement was the result of the programme to reduce costs and gearing and improve efficiency, and also to the divestment of businesses. Mr Davis said while UK demand for circuit boards remained patchy, overseas sales were rising steadily. Conditions in the international aerospace markets were still depressed. The sale of Forward Industries in June had a significant impact on the balance sheet, reducing debt by Pounds 2.61m. At the close of the year total debt was Pounds 5.33m (Pounds 9.21m), supported by shareholders' funds of Pounds 11.8m, reducing gearing from 79 per cent to 49 per cent. Capital expenditure of Pounds 750,000 has been authorised for equipping a new microwave circuit board facility and Pounds 500,000 in a new 'clean room' status printed circuit board.</p>

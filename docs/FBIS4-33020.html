			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 May (NOTIMEX) -- Official  sources have reported Colombian President Cesar Gaviria today  canceled his trip to El Salvador where he was to attend the  swearing in ceremony of Salvadoran President-elect Armando  Calderon Sol. Presidential Palace spokespersons have said the  Colombian president will not attend the swearing in ceremony,  because the doctors who performed surgery on his right foot 10  days ago have recommended rest. [passage omitted]    Gaviria underwent surgery on 19 May to relieve pressure in  his posterior tibial nerve. Using crutches, the Colombian  president was the first to vote in Sunday's presidential  elections, in which 18 candidates sought to become president of  Colombia for the next four years.

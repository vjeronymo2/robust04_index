			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead A FIRST profit contribution from the US should help Body Shop International, the eco-friendly retailer of beauty products, to a 25 per cent-plus increase in pre-tax profits. A figure of Pounds 25m to Pounds 26m is expected when the full-year results are announced on Wednesday. With UK growth limited by recession, the turnround in the relatively new US chain will be a critical factor alongside continued progress on the continent. Carlton Communications, the television and television services group, is expected to announce a modest increase in interim pre-tax profits on Wednesday. Analysts are predicting around Pounds 48m, which suggests that Carlton has still been suffering from recession. The Pounds 46.3m figure last year was nearly 30 per cent down on 1990. When MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, reports its interim results on Thursday, attention will be focused on its development programme, which is the largest in the sector. Analysts will be particularly keen to hear of any progress in letting Alban Gate, the largely-empty office block straddling London Wall in the City. The pre-tax profits for the half year to March 1992 are expected to be around Pounds 63m, down from Pounds 67.4m a year ago. Although the rental income is likely to rise, this will be offset by an increase in financing costs as the company reduces the proportion of capitalised interest associated with development properties. On the same day, Thorn EMI is expected to report annual pre-tax profits slightly down from last time's Pounds 258.6m to about Pounds 255m, although they could fall as low as Pounds 240m. Recent acquisitions - the half of Chrysalis Records which Thorn did not already own, Remco America, and Virgin Music Group, this latter only acquired at the beginning of March - will probably have boosted the pre-tax line, though earnings are likely to be down around 10 per cent.</p>

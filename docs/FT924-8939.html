			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / EC application backed in Oslo Norway's ruling Labour party voted yesterday to apply to join the European Community, although the electorate remains firmly opposed to membership, Karen Fossli reports from Oslo. The party's conference in Oslo voted 183 to 106 in favour, a smaller majority than expected. Opposition came mainly from northern delegates who said their primary source of income - fishing and farming - would be threatened by closer ties to Brussels. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, plans to deliver a fresh application for membership this month.</p>

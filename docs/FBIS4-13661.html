			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo--Relations between Egypt and Sudan have  tensed again following a statement by Sudanese President 'Umar  Hasan al-Bashir, which Cairo considered harmful to its  sovereignty and an intentional offense, and a strong Sudanese  protest against a planned conference in Cairo to which rebel  leaders from south Sudan have been invited.    An Egyptian Foreign Ministry source told AL-SAFIR that the  Sudanese president's statement to the magazine AL-MULTAQA that  the Egyptian regime has no clear program concerning the Hala'ib  region and that it always seeks to obstruct negotiations with  Sudan is unacceptable.    The source quoted al-Bashir as saying that "despite all the  Egyptian acts and positions against Khartoum, the option of  fighting our Egyptian brothers contradicts our position and  policy, which reject the idea of sacred borders. This idea is  one aspect of Arab weakness."    Egypt rejected al-Bashir's statement and sent a cable of  protest to Khartoum saying it flagrantly harms bilateral  relations.    The cable said Sudan always seeks to create tension between  the two, whether through words, such as al-Bashir's statement,  or deeds, such as appointing a Sudanese governor to Hala'ib and  sending "terrorist elements" to the disputed region.    The cable also considered al-Bashir's statement a violation  of the unsigned agreement reached with Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak in Cairo. The agreement says differences should not be  discussed through the media.    Egypt's refusal to stop a conference on minorities in the  Arab world, which the Ibn-Khuldun Center for Political Studies  intends to organize in Cairo, added to the tension. Sudanese  Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih on Tuesday asked that the  conference be prevented from taking place because rebel leaders  from south Sudan, including John Garang and Rick Mashar, are  scheduled to attend.    Diplomatic sources in Cairo said that on Wednesday, Egyptian  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa sent a verbal message to his Sudanese  counterpart telling him that Cairo rejects the request. He  explained that the issue hinges on freedom of political and  intellectual activity in Egypt and is part of free  decisionmaking. No individual or state has a right to interfere  in the sovereignty of another country, he said.    The sources cited Musa as saying that Egypt is a politically  open country and that the south Sudanese rebel leaders were  invited in their capacity as Sudanese citizens. The aim was not  to entrench separatism. Cairo's firm and principled position  against any attempt to divide Sudan is well known, Musa said.    AL-SAFIR learned that Khartoum may react by organizing its  own conference. Egyptian political sources expect such a  conference to include some Islamist leaders, something over  which Cairo will not remain silent. [passage omitted]</p>

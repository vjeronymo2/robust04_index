He told AL-HAYAH in Jeddah that this British step "confirms  the soundness and verity of the Sudanese decision expelling the  British ambassador from Khartoum because he interferred in the  same way in Sudanese affairs."    He added: "It is really regrettable that Sudanese people now  enter the British Parliament and talk about the issue of the  south forgetting that Britain was the main cause of that problem  originally. It was the one which created the problem of the  south and then prevented the interaction of the north and south  for many years."    Sabdarat ridiculed the Sudanese opposition parties meeting  in  London saying that "they believe victory will be theirs at the  hands of the crusaders. They forget that by embracing them  Britain aims to kill the Islamic and cultural trend in Sudan."  He criticized the results of the meetings and said that "they  gave a true picture of the state of the Sudanese opposition  abroad. They were unable to agree at these meetings. While the  Democratic Unionist Party supported Sudan's unity, the Ummah  Party wanted an interim period after which the question of  self-determination would be considered, and then Bona Malwal,  representative of the south, said that Sudan's independence came  about incorrectly, held the north responsible for all the  mistakes, and presented the issue as a dispute between the north  and the south." The Sudanese information minister added: "The  opposition grouping cannot take a stand on the question of  self-determination in southern Sudan because the Sudanese people  know the weakness of that point."    Sabdarat said that "those urging the Security Council to  intervene militarily and to impose a blockade against Sudan  forgot, as they sat in hotels in London and Europe, that they  were in fact calling for a blockade against, and for the  starvation of, their own people in Sudan, as if they were on  another planet." He accused them of "having a narrow view of  things, and the fact that they stay at posh hotels in luxury  does not enable them to judge the situation in Sudan  realistically."    The Sudanese information minister praised his country's  relations with Eritrea saying that they "are strategic relations  and we will not allow emotions and emotionalism to affect the  strategy of these relations."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Antonello Caporale report: "The League Raises the Stakes -- </F> `We Want the Interior Ministry'"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- "Preliminarily," or rather "peremptorily"  the League has requested the interior ministry for itself. The  claim to the Viminale [Interior Ministry] was put forward  yesterday, not for the first time, by means of this crude and  undiplomatic statement by Luigi Rossi, [League Secretary]  Bossi's spokesperson. It is a longstanding claim, and also,  naturally, a farsighted one.    In order to build federalism, the Senator [Bossi nickname]  is  convinced that majority agreements, alliances, and documents are  useful but not sufficient. A political authority endowed with  broad, far-reaching, and autonomous power is needed. And, it  goes without saying, the interior minister is not lacking in  power. He gives orders to the police (whose chief he must in  fact trust), and he supervises the secret services. Above all,  he appoints, transfers, promotes and, if necessary, removes  questers and prefects. The prefecture, the state's "long hand"  in the outskirts, is the League's number-one enemy. A  centralized power rests with thee prefects. In order to  dismantle this power, therefore, can a better weapon possibly be  found than occupying the Viminale? Will there ever be a better  opportunity than this to place Bobo Maroni [League lower house  floor leader], the bandwagon's [League nickname] statesman par  excellence, at its head?

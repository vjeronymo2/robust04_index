			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: John Wood ahead at Pounds 18.5m JOHN WOOD Group, the privately-owned energy contracting company based in Aberdeen, continued to expand in 1992 but at a slower rate than in the previous year. Sales were up 17 per cent at Pounds 203.6m and pre-tax profits ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 18.5m. Mr Ian Wood, chairman, said that trading conditions had been more testing than in 1991, with slower expansion in the North Sea where exploration companies in particular were finding life more difficult. 'We needed to draw breath a little,' said Mr Wood. In 1991 turnover rose 44 per cent from Pounds 120.8m to Pounds 173.8m, and pre-tax profits jumped 78 per cent from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 16.9m. The company, which claims to be the UK's largest indigenous oil and energy service company, is working closely with Shell Expro in the North Sea and last year won a five year contract worth about Pounds 150m overall from British Petroleum for design and engineering services to three North Sea fields. The company won two large contracts for oilfield services in Kuwait where it employs 1,000 people, and invested Pounds 1.5m in workshops in the United Arab Emirates. In the US the group spent Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.7m) on two acquisitions in the oilfield services sector. In the non-oil sector the group invested Pounds 3m in a repair facility for gas turbines at Aberdeen and won a five year repair and maintenance contract with National Power.</p>

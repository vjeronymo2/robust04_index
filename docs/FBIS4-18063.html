			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, at the </F> ceremony of signing the Treaty on Social Accord in the St.  George's Hall of the Moscow Kremlin -- live]    [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich [Yeltsin], Your Holiness  [Aleksiy II], esteemed colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,  comrades. As chairman of the fifth State Duma in Russia's  history, I express -- I do not hide -- my profound satisfaction  at the signing of this treaty. Ever since it started its work  the Duma has actively and consistently advocated the achievement  of civic peace and accord in our society, regarding it as  fundamentally important and extremely necessary. Though not  going the full way, perhaps, to meeting our needs, it is  indispensable in overcoming the crisis and bringing about the  genuine revival of Russia.    When the State Duma adopted the memorandum on accord on 23  February this year, a new stage, basically, was initiated in the  relationship between the authorities and public organizations in  our country. It created the prerequisites for ending the state  of political sectarianism, which is unnatural in a parliamentary  democracy, for ending the division of society into reds and  whites, into them and us, into radicals and conservatives. Our  society can see for itself that confrontation offers nothing,  that confrontation and violence create far more problems than  they resolve. People are tired of empty promises. But they are  even more weary of intrigue, ambition, and uncertainty about the  present and especially the future.    While welcoming the signing of the treaty, I cannot fail to  stress that this is not a panacea for all our problems, but the  extent of the treaty's force is strictly limited by the law and  social practice. Perhaps this is where its moral and ethical  aspect, authority, lies. Our age-old tradition of solving  problems all together [vsem mirom] is being revived. There are  differing attitudes in contemporary Russian society to the  present treaty. But it is in the interests of accord not to  dramatize the situation. Let us be wise and patient. Different  assessments reflect profound social differences and  disagreements which cannot be overcome at one go. We are  dutybound to listen to different views and positions, to heed  the anguish and alarm which they reflect, while specific  objectives in ending the crisis and seeking realistic mechanisms  for settling real contradictions are worked out.    One other thing is obvious. No matter how the programs of  those taking part in the treaty may differ, they are close to  each other in that they agree on the main thing. Society must  be relieved of the burden of social tension. Normal relations  between the branches of power must develop on the basis of  unconditional observance of law and order. After all,  separation of the powers certainly does not mean alienation from  each other, let alone confrontation. Our routes must meet at a  crossroads. The country's statehood must be transformed into  something which benefits Russia and its citizens. The economic  reforms must be deepened in the interests of the entire people  rather than those of some small select group of people. The  democratic thrust of foreign policy must be safeguarded, while  ensuring that the national distinctiveness and geopolitical  interests of Russia are rigorously observed.    We all need these things very much, and it is important to  think on the fact that the time has come not to hack as we used  to do before, but to patiently and knowingly untie the Gordian  knots into which Russian problems have become knotted. Of  course, the path toward the accord is thorny and long. Today we  are merely taking the first step on this path. Our ancient  ancestors used to say: He who has begun something has already  half done it. I subscribe to what Boris Nikolayevich said. The  main thing is to win the struggle within ourselves, and then at  a certain stage we can recall the words of the unforgettable  Konstantin Simonov, who said some time ago: Yes, we did not gain  the victory easily. Yes, our enemy -- our internal enemy -- was  strong. The greater is our glory. Thank you.</p>

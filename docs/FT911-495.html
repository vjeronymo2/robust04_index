			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Food: Capital need for chocolate ALMOST two years ago to the day I was in Angers in the Loire Valley and was taken on a tour of the city chocolate shops. It was hard not to be impressed by the sheer dedication of these provincial chocolatiers, upholders of a 150-year tradition of quality chocolate making. Like many French cities, Angers has its speciality which is available from shops like La Petite Marquise in the rue des Lices: quernoux d'Angers are nougatines dipped in blue-tinted white chocolate and fashioned to resemble local slates. In Galloyer in the rue Lenepveu there were fantastic arrays of hand-made chocolates, some of them with Cointreau liqueur (which is made in the suburbs) to give them a typically Angevin flavour. Angers is just one town or city in a hundred. Virtually everywhere in France you will find specialist chocolate makers in the same way as you would expect to find a superlative pork butcher, baker or wine-merchant. Quality thrives because Frenchmen care about what they eat. The British are gluttons for chocolate. It is impossible to stray 100 yards from your door without encountering someone crumpling a chocolate wrapper after wolfing the contents. The big difference between the English and the French, however, is that the Quaker families who started up chocolate making in the UK addressed their main thrust to the mass market and, having won its undivided loyalty, continued to smother it in Mars bars, Topics, Flakes and Maltesers. Apart from a handful of artisan chocolate makers selling in the West End of London, the top of the British market is represented by firms such as Thorntons and Bendicks. I visited Bendicks in Winchester, where the company moved when Mr Benson and Mr Dickson sold out to the Hampshire company of Cox. Having been variously owned by biscuit makers and cigarette manufacturers, they are now owned by the Storck group of Berlin. Seventy per cent of Bendicks' production is in the form of chocolate mints such as their famous bittermint invented, it is said, by Mr Benson's sister-in-law. Bendicks maintains its mints are the best in the world, which is easy enough to say since only the British make this sort of chocolate and the competition in the UK is not exactly fierce. Still, Bendicks uses high quality chocolate - as I learned on my tour of its factory - and it was interesting to taste the two elements of the bittermint: the peppermint-flavoured fondant centre and the virtually pure, unsweetened couverture which englobes it; by itself the chocolate is too bitter and the fondant too fiery to be pleasant. Bendicks' mints are good, but their chocolate boxes contain too many synthetic flavours for my liking. Everything is made for a long shelf-life with no perishable products being used. When I returned to London I asked Paul Gayler, a chef noted for his chocolate, whom I should see. He put me in touch with John Huber, the Swiss born chocolatier who heads the department at the Thames Valley College in Slough. Going from Winchester to Slough is a bit like descending from the sublime to the ridiculous, but there was nothing foolish about Mr Huber who runs Britain's only professional chocolate-making school. Huber had no illusions about Britain. He pulled out piles of French, German and Swiss chocolate making magazines: 'Look,' he said, 'every month they get these, and all this equipment here, you can't get that in Britain, I have to go France once a year to buy it.' Huber took me into the workshop where some of his students were preparing for exams. Any chef who wants to be able to master the fine art of tempering chocolate has to pass through his hands. 'You can find decent chocolates here,' Huber told me, 'but for the time being mostly in hotels: the general public aren't prepared to pay for quality.' I suppose that it is good news but it will be a long time before London can offer the sort of choice available to the people of Angers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ast" signed report: "SPOe Unanimously for Entry Into </F> European Union; Yes Recommended for 12 June"]    [Excerpt] Innsbruck -- On Thursday [12 April], at a  "historic party council session" in Innsbruck, the Social  Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] advocated a clear yes to  Europe and thus to the European Union [EU]. The SPOe will  recommend that Austrians vote for Austria's entry into the  European Union in the referendum on 12 June; 220 delegates from  all provinces and prominent party members came to Innsbruck.  They not only listened with rapt attention to SPOe Chairman and  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's pleading for Europe, but they also  agreed unanimously to the Federal Party Council's declaration.    In his speech of more than one hour, Vranitzky not only  advocated entry into the European Union, but also the  maintenance of neutrality. Both for security policy and  economic reasons, it is absolutely necessary for Austria to  participate in shaping and determining the European integration  process. This cannot be done from the outside, but Austria has  to actively shape things within the European Union. "This is  also necessary because we have to take note of the fact that  phenomena like nationalism, chauvinism, and fascism, which were  believed to have been overcome long ago, are popping up again  before our front door."    In the first place, Austria's road to the European Union  also  has to be positively assessed in the field of economy. "Full  participation in a single market of 350 million people enlarges  the domestic market 50 times for our small country, which  depends on foreign trade," Vranitzky stressed. Austria will  benefit above average alone because of its Central European  location. [passage omitted]</p>

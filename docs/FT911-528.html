			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hopes of lower rates put bourses in positive mood HOPES OF lower interest rates helped bourses return from Thursday's holiday in a positive mood yesterday, but turnover was light outside Madrid and Oslo. Brussels was closed, writes Our Markets Staff. MADRID rose again in active trading, which included large blocks of Banesto and Banco Zaragozano. The general index gained 3.00 or 1.1 per cent to 282.55, a rise on the week of 1.7 per cent, in turnover of about Pta30bn, up from Pta11.8bn. Hopes of a further interest rate cut and a good inflation figure, due on Tuesday, encouraged investors. A total of 1.25m shares was traded in Banesto, including a block of 1m shares, or 1 per cent of the bank's capital, at Pta3,755 a share. La Corporacion Banesto, the bank's industrial group, said that it was in talks with AGF of France on co-operation in the insurance sector. The stock rose Pta55 to Pta3,780. La Union y el Fenix, Banesto's insurance unit, slipped Pta20 to Pta6,900. Banco Zaragozano rose Pta25 to Pta3,000 on 1.87m shares, including a block of 1.79m shares, or 10 per cent of its capital. The activity could be part of a restructuring, said an analyst, because the bank is owned by the Albertos, the former husbands of the Koplowitz sisters who announced the merger of two construction companies earlier this week. There was speculation that Cofir, the holding company of Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian financier, which owns 10 per cent of the bank, could be raising its stake. PARIS rose after Wall Street's overnight gains, but turnover was light after the two-day holiday. The CAC 40 index added 20.09 or 1.1 per cent to 1,850.27 - a gain of 1 per cent over the week - amid hopes of a forthcoming interest rate cut. Turnover was estimated to be similar to Tuesday's FFr1.4bn. Elf Aquitaine rose FFr6 to FFr366 on volume of 184,200 shares on the news that it and Enterprise Oil of the UK would jointly buy Occidental Petroleum's North Sea assets. Cetelem, the short-term credit company, gained FFr47 or 6.8 per cent to FFr740 on hopes of lower interest rates. FRANKFURT took its direction from Wall Street, but there was a lack of action on the trading front. Volume fell from DM4.4bn to DM3.4bn. The FAZ and DAX indices rose by 4.55 to 685.76, and 13.35 to 1,620.63, but fell by 0.8 and 0.7 per cent on the week. There was a flurry in Continental, the German tyre manufacturer which has been fighting off advances from Pirelli Spa of Italy. Mr Horst Urban, Conti's managing board chairman, resigned on Thursday over his opposition to a merger, leaving the way open for renewed talks. Conti peaked at DM209 and turnover in the stock rose from DM22m to DM50m on the day; but, said Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, there was no follow-through after the morning gains and the shares closed DM6 higher on the day at DM203, down DM7.50 on the week. The speculation seemed to spread to Nixdorf, which has had a bad year so far but which rose DM13 yesterday to DM252. Metallgesellschaft fell another DM12 to DM534, suffering from a high p/e and a drop in profits. Good results took PWA, the papermaker, up DM5.50 to DM275. MILAN was boosted by Pirelli which rose for a second day on news that it was resuming co-operation talks with Continental of Germany. The Comit index rose 3.00 to 577.38, down 1.6 per cent on the week, in volume estimated at close to Thursday's thin L100bn. Pirelli was fixed L26 or 1.5 per cent higher at L1,701 in spite of a cut in the 1990 dividend to L70 from L110 and a drop in net profit. The stock rose to L1,718 after hours. Italcementi fell L160 to L20,830. After hours, the cement company said that, in spite of an improvement in 1990 group net profit, there had been a marked slowdown in the construction sector. OSLO leapt 2.5 per cent to a second successive 1991 high in heavy volume, on renewed foreign buying, strong company results and low interest rates. The all-share index rose 12.53 to 518.70, a jump of 7.2 per cent on the week, in turnover of NKr820m, up from NKr588m. ZURICH saw support for banks and insurers as interest rates eased slightly and on hopes of further cuts later this year. The SBC banks index rose 7.8, or more than 1 per cent, to 643.3 as the Credit Suisse index gained 3.3 to 545.5, down 1.1 per cent on the week. AMSTERDAM came off the day's highs in thin trading as many operators took a long weekend after Thursday's holiday. The CBS tendency index closed 0.7 higher at 94.9, down 0.5 per cent on the week. STOCKHOLM rose on demand for Astra before its first-quarter results, due on Monday. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 7.9 to 1,043.9, down 0.6 per cent on the week. Trading in Astra accounted for SKr184m of a total SKr326m, down from SKr380m. Its free B shares rose SKr24 to SKr584.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - May 10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am    11 am    Noon     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1128.96  1129.01  1128.87  1129.59  1129.62  1129.85  1129.91  1130.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High   1130.64     Day's Low   1128.41 May 9         May 8      May 7       May 3      May 2 1125.62***    1119.87    1125.75     1129.77    1128.32  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  *** Indicative.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

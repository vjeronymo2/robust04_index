			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- In the past few days army units and  establishments within Ukraine's Ministry of Defense received an  order by Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukrainian defense  minister, that introduces "regulations on penal battalions in  Ukraine's Armed Forces." It sets out the procedure and  conditions for punishing compulsory service soldiers and also  defines the procedure for the penal battalion's activity.    The regulations provide for the commander of the penal  battalion to be appointed personally by the Ukrainian defense  minister and determine that the military district commander is  directly responsible for its leadership.    According to the resolution, the duration of service of  officers in the penal battalion should not exceed five-six years  for a battalion commander and 3-4 for other posts.    Today, there are two penal battalions in the Armed Forces of  Ukraine: in Kiev's Darnitskiy Rayon and in Chernomorskiy  settlement in Crimea.</p>

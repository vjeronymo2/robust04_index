Parker Jr., author of five wine books and publisher of a wine  newsletter, canceled a book-signing tour of Los Angeles and San Francisco this  week after threats were made against him, his secretary said.  </P> <P> Parker, an attorney who left that profession after founding the successful wine  journal The Wine Advocate in 1979, couldn't be reached for comment on the  report.  </P> <P> Joan Passman, Parker's secretary, said that on the advice of police and  attorneys, he was not making public comments about the situation. "There have  been threats against him, and the events are under investigation," she said.  </P> <P> A friend of Parker, who requested anonymity, said a caller made threats in  which Parker's West Coast schedule was mentioned.

He also canceled appearances at Draper  &amp; Esquin and Pacific Wine Co. in San Francisco and at Beltramo's in Menlo  Park.  </P></p>

Palestine Wants  `Political Revenge,' Not a Bloody One"]    [Excerpts] Instinct is the worst guide to useful and  creative political work; such work needs the ability to apply "a  bundle of pressure factors" on the adversary to force him into  accepting the Palestinian reading of the Declaration of  Principles.    The PLO has gradually built up a cumulative position,  presenting specific demands that create a balance between  pushing the peace process onto a more serious course and giving  the necessary response to the angry popular reaction to the  Hebron massacre as dictated by its duty and role as a  representative of the Palestinians. [passage omitted]    It goes without saying that the PLO understands Washington's  role and influence in the United Nations. But Palestinian  insistence on a Security Council resolution condemning the  massacre, calling for an international presence in the occupied  territories to protect our people, and indicating that Jerusalem  is part of the occupied territories, as a condition for resuming  bilateral talks with Israel may lead to some sort of  confrontation with the United States, as indications have shown  since the massacre. But the PLO, for its part, realizes that  the United States has a genuine interest in resuming the  negotiations as soon as possible, and this is also the position  of other influential international parties with clearer support  for our people and cause. Moreover, Israel's position is weak,  and it is difficult to defend all its components. All these  factors, consequently, help the PLO achieve better political  gains that previously offered to it.    An effort for a political achievement does not necessarily  require confrontation. That is why the PLO accepted, as  President 'Arafat said a few hours after the massacre, U.S.  President Bill Clinton's invitation to 'Arafat and to the  Israeli prime minister to resume the bilateral talks in  Washington as soon as possible. American intervention in the  talks, indeed, had been a Palestinian demand for months, and it  is not right to abandon it when opportunity knocks. The  conditions for taking up the invitation must be satisfied,  basically by the government of Yitzhaq Rabin doing what it must  do vis-a-vis the tragedy. [passage omitted]    PLO's hardline position, and the fact that the organization  did not immediately respond to exaggerated suggestions that time  is not on the side of the Palestinian position, may be in order.  But we must understand and realize the fact that these two  factors have limits, and that it is inevitable for the PLO to  return to the negotiating table. The PLO is not in the business  of a revenge governed by instant angry reactions, but is seeking  a political achievement that may return things to the right  track and make up for our loss in the negotiations in Davos and  Cairo, with a view toward adopting the Palestinian reading of  the joint Declaration of Principles.</p>

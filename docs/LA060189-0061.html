			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRIP HOME A SUCCESS FOR PADRES  </P> <P> For the first time this season, the Padres leave for a trip today not wondering  if happiness is seeing San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium in their rear-view  mirrors.  </P> <P> Their 2-1 victory Wednesday night in front of 13,533 gave them a three-game  sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies and their first winning home stand (6-3) in  four tries.  </P> <P> Even better, they did so in one of those dramatic ways that leave a good  feeling.  </P> <P> Marvell Wynne was the hero, hitting a two-out, eighth-inning RBI double down  the right field line that landed barely fair near the Philadelphia bullpen.  </P> <P> Roberto Alomar, who led off the inning with a walk off loser Jeff Parrett, was  running on the pitch and scored easily.  </P> <P> The Padres could not have asked for a better sendoff to launch them on a  10-game trip that will take them through the cities of three of their closest  National League West rivals.  </P> <P> The victory raised their record to 29-25, four games over .500 for the first  time, and kept them in third place in what is becoming an increasingly close  division race. That could begin to sort out in the next week as the Padres  embark on a trip that will take them in succession to Cincinnati, fourth-place  Houston and division-leading San Francisco.  </P> <P> After having squandered several earlier scoring chances, they have Wynne to  thank for their standing.  </P> <P> "I got it up in the (strike) zone, belt high," said Parrett, who started the  eighth in relief of starter Bob Sebra. "He was right on top of it."  </P> <P> That was because Wynne was anticipating exactly what Parrett delivered.  </P> <P> "I got the pitch I was looking for -- a three-one fastball," Wynne said. "It  was right where I wanted it."  </P> <P> The hit made a winner out of reliever Greg Harris (1-2). Harris pitched a  scoreless eighth after starter Dennis Rasmussen left having allowed only two  hits, including a first-inning home run by former Padre Dickie Thon, in seven  innings.  </P> <P> Mark Davis came on in the ninth for his 17th save in as many opportunities, but  he had to pitch out of a jam after Von Hayes reached third with one out on a  single to right and a two-base error by John Kruk, who allowed the ball to get  under his glove and roll just in front of the warning track.  </P> <P> Davis got Chris James to ground out to third and Steve Lake to strike out to  end the game.  </P> <P> Rasmussen wasted little time adding to his most undistinguished statistic -- a  penchant for first-inning trouble. This time it was Thon, the game's second  batter, who added to Rasmussen's season-long first-inning woes by hitting a  line drive to left on a one-and-one pitch. The ball clanged off the railing in  front of the lower stands.  </P> <P> It was the second home run for Thon, equaling his total of the previous two  seasons and extended his batting streak to 10 games.  </P> <P> Thon's homer marked the 10th time in 11 starts that Rasmussen had yielded a  first-inning run and raised the first-innning count against Rasmussen to 17  runs, 28 hits and five home runs.  </P> <P> But this time, the Padres, who by contrast have had trouble scoring in the  first inning -- only 13 times in their previous 53 games, including four of  five times against the Phillies -- got the run right back. They needed only one  hit off Sebra to do it.  </P> <P> Right fielder Bip Roberts opened with a single to center, extending his  three-game on-base streak to seven plate appearances. Roberts (whose streak  ended on a groundout to first two innings later) stole second and moved to  third on Alomar's groundout to second. He scored on Tony Gwynn's fly down the  left-field line in foul territory.  </P> <P> Rasmussen did his best to make the most of lone run. He had no trouble in the  second and third, setting down the Phillies in order. But he found himself in a  jam in the fourth, loading the bases on two out with a single and two walks  before going to three and zero on Lake.  </P> <P> But Rasmussen was able to work the count back to three and two before getting  Lake to end the inning on a popup to first.  </P> <P> Rasmussen got back on track the next three innings, retiring the side in order  the fifth and sixth and allowing only a two-out walk in the seventh before he  was lifted for a pinch hitter and replaced by Harris.  </P> <P> Rasmussen left with his best pitching line of the season -- one run on the  homer to Thon, two hits, four walks and four strikeouts in seven innings. The  Padres, meanwhile, were having their own problems against Sebra, a career 13-24  pitcher who was making only his third start since being recalled May 17 from  triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.  </P> <P> Sebra, the 10th pitcher to start for the injury-riddled Phillies staff, had  handled the Padres easily in his first start -- a 3-1 victory on May 21 in  Philadelphia in which he allowed one run on seven hits and struck out eight in  eight innings. But in his next start, he was racked for five runs in four  innings in a 6-1 loss at San Francisco.  </P> <P> That is not to say the Padres did have their chances, putting runners on base  in the second, third, fourth and seventh innings, including leadoff hitters'  doubles in the fourth and seventh. But each time Sebra was able to pitch out of  trouble.  </P> <P> In the fourth, Wynne opened with a double and was sacrificed to third by Benito  Santiago, but Sebra avoided a run by getting Tim Flannery on a liner to third  and Garry Templeton on a strikeout.  </P> <P> The seventh followed a similar pattern, after a leadoff double by Santiago and  a sacrifice by Flannery put a runner on third with one out. But the Padres  failed to score as Templeton again struck out, Kruk (batting for Rasmussen)  walked, and Roberts ended the inning by popping out to third.  </P> <P> Sebra was replaced by Parrett to start the eighth.  </P> <P> "Sebra kept us in the game," Phillie Manager Nick Leyva said. "But I had to  take him out, he was completely out of gas."  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> The annual summer free-agent draft will be Monday through Wednesday, and  Manager Jack McKeon, who became a grandfather for the fourth time Sunday, is  playing a different kind of expectant father role. His youngest, son Kasey, is  a senior catcher at San Diego State and has hopes of being drafted. . . .  Utility infielder Randy Ready, who has not played since May 20 in Philadelphia  because of a right hamstring injury, should be available to start when the  Padres begin a three-city, 10-game road trip Friday in Cincinnati, McKeon said.  Ready strained the muscle May 17 in Montreal. . . . The Padres will not return  home until June 13, when they open a three-game series with the Reds to kick  off a 12-game home stand.  </P> <P> WINNING PITCH  </P> <P> KFMB-AM will retain the rights to broadcast Padre games.

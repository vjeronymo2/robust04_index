			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Brussels' green activism goes on: Subsidiarity will not mean repealing EC environment laws, says Van Miert THE European Commission intends to continue pursuing an activist environmental policy, and will resist any roll-back of its green powers by the EC member states, according to Mr Karel Van Miert, the new environment commissioner. 'Certainly, as far as I'm concerned, there can be no question of backtracking, or of demolishing or diluting our policies,' Mr Van Miert emphasised in an interview, his first on the environment since he took over the portfolio last month from his controversial predecessor, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana. Mr Van Miert implied that it would be foolish to blunt one of the few policies for which Brussels is popular, in the middle of a backlash against the Community and the Maastricht treaty. 'At the end of the day, no one can contest that (the environment) is one of our most successful policies, and one of the best understood. We should build on that confidence - this is a policy where you can clearly prove that it is working for our citizens,' he argued. Mr Ripa di Meana, who interpreted his job as a sort of Tribune of the People, has had numerous bruising encounters with the UK and several other EC governments. But in the wake of Danish voters' rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June, the EC has been awash with rumour that great swathes of Community environment policy would be repatriated to the member states, to emphasise a new commitment to 'subsidiarity'. This ill-defined doctrine says the EC should only intervene when decisions are not practical at national or regional level. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has espoused it with particular enthusiasm, but last month said his own earlier suggestions that certain EC environment powers were a prime candidate for devolution had been misunderstood. Mr Van Miert yesterday also swept aside reports that under the current UK presidency of the EC there would be a repeal of some existing EC green laws. 'Repealing can only be done on the basis of a proposal from the Commission and a decision by the Council of Ministers (of the 12), and modifying (EC law) implies the same procedure,' he said. But he did concede that 'we are prepared to discuss the merits of particular laws.' Brussels last month dropped five legal cases against the UK for allegedly failing to carry out proper environment impact assessment studies for road and construction projects, including at Twyford Down in Hampshire. It is still looking at two possible infractions - at the East London River Crossing through Oxleas Wood and the British Petroleum refinery in Falkirk. This decision followed the postponement of legal hearings against the UK on inadequate bathing water purity, in a move designed to spare Britain embarrassment at the start of its presidency. Taken together, they were interpreted by most environmentalists as showing the Commission pulling in its green horns. But both Mr Van Miert and officials who had prepared the environmental impact dossiers insisted yesterday that the UK was able to provide proof in all but the two cases still open that it had complied with EC law. Nevertheless, the commissioner said he would be proposing an 'updating' of impact assessment legislation to avoid 'misunderstandings'. Mr Van Miert also made clear he intends to pursue the controversial Brussels plan for an energy tax.</p>

"The move indicates that customs emphasis has been turned  from the inspection of import and export goods to the oversight  of companies dealing in the goods," Cao said.    With reference to international conventions, Shanghai  customs  will classify foreign trade companies in accordance with their  internal operation and previous cooperation with customs.    The first class, including companies with a high business  reputation, will enjoy preference and more preferential  treatment when undergoing customs affairs. So far there are  altogether 24 such companies in Shanghai.    Companies with a less than stellar business reputation fall  into the second tier, while those with poor management or  suspected of illegal trafficking will have their import and  export goods strictly examined at customs, the director.    Every year, the Customs Office will hold appraisals to  upgrade or demote the companies according to their achievements.    Along with rapid economic growth, more than 9,000 companies  were dealing with foreign trade in Shanghai by the end of last  year. There were only some 200 companies in 1985.    During the same time, the value of import and export goods  through customs increased from 14.87 billion U.S. dollars to  30.9 billion U.S. dollars.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Letter: Realities of pay policy and inflation control Sir, Samuel Brittan writes (Economic Viewpoint, April 25) apropos of the relentless rise in wages, 'employers and unions appear to have responded not to fundamentals but to a backward-looking glance at the headline Retail Prices Index'. That weasel word 'fundamentals'] What does it mean? Here, it seems, 'the forces of supply and demand which we know from our neo-classical economic textbooks to be all-important'. As everybody acknowledges - not least Layard and Nickell who popularised and Samuel Brittan who continues to give credibility to, that dreadful concept, Nairu (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) - the segments of the labour market where supply/demand forces work, where unemployment bites fairly quickly on pay, are tiny; temporary secretaries in London, construction labour, the office cleaning industry. Average pay rise rates are overwhelmingly determined by bargains in the unionised sector, amplified by the Confederation of British Industry's 'emergent-norm setting' - its monthly announcements of 'the average rate of settlement so far this round'. And what influences those bargains? Such factors as: the last year's inflation rate and expectations of next year's, unions' perceptions of firms' ability to pay as evidenced in profit and dividend levels, fairness demands prompted by self-awarded managerial salary increases, skill shortages unrelated to general employment levels, the confidence in the continued growth of markets, and so on. Are those who bargain ever influenced more than marginally by what they read in the papers about the rate of unemployment? So why do we never hear about Nairie (the non-accelerating inflation rate of inflation expectations) or Nairmsi (managerial self-indulgence) or Nairdi (dividend increases), and continue to hear endless speculation as to whether Nairu is going up or down? Because, I suppose, Nairu deals with supply and demand - the fundamentals of the textbooks. Can anyone think of a worse case of far-from-defunct economists managing so successfully and for so long to screw up the thinking of the practical men and prevent them from facing up to the realities of pay policy and inflation control?

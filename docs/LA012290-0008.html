			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METALLIC BALLOONS  </P> <P> Recently, while driving south on the Harbor Freeway between Imperial and  Rosecrans, I saw a group of about five metallic balloons tied together floating  above. They came to rest to the west of the freeway on power lines, at which  time a series of flashes ensued.  </P> <P> As a result, two or three (possibly more) of these power lines were severed and  fell earthward.  </P> <P> The balloon manufacturer has made its profit and the public collectively shares  in the costly repair.  </P> <P> Of course this pales in comparison with the scenario whereby lives are  endangered due to dangling live wires.  </P> <P> Metallic balloons are not an essential to our quality of life, and as a result  of my experience, I cannot imagine reason enough for their continued existence.  </P> <P> DIANE McDOWELL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

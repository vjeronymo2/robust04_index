			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Wall Street influences Pacific Rim The cut in German interest rates and Thursday's rally on Wall Street encouraged investors, and equities rebounded on futures led buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei issue average rose 142.27 to 17,332.90, 1.8 per cent up on the week, after moving between 17,223.64 and 17,413.67. Volume rose from 284m to 320m shares on active cross-trading, as investors tried to realise profits without changing their portfolios. Gainers led losers by 694 to 256 with 178 unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 7.64 to 1,308.47. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 1.59 to 1,062.12. After Thursday's cut in the discount rate by the Bank of Japan, investors shifted their attention to fiscal policy. 'The effects of the rate cut will come into the market slowly, but the market is waiting for an income tax cut or another supplementary budget,' said an official at Nippon Life. Individual and foreign investors were seen buying large-capital blue chip shares in small-lots. Nippon Steel gained Y2 to Y290 while Hitachi Zosen gained Y9 to Y522. Regional bank shares were actively traded on cross activity. Joyo Bank was the second most active issue of the day, falling Y10 to Y850, Bank of Yokohama remained unchanged at Y995 and Shizuoka Bank fell Y10 to Y1,300. Hopes of a recovery in the US semiconductor market boosted Tokyo Electron, a trading company specialising in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, by Y100 to Y2,130. NGK Spark Plug, which makes ceramic packages for semiconductors, gained Y23 to Y950. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 96.12 to 18,672.98 in volume of 44.9m shares. Roundup Wall Street's strong performance also provided a lead in some Pacific Rim markets. AUSTRALIAN investors took a lead from the US to push prices higher and the All Ordinaries index climbed 11.9 to 1,543.3, a 1 per cent rise on the week, in turnover of ADollars 224,5m. Biscuit maker Arnotts was a focus of trade ahead of Campbell Soup's takeover deadline. Arnotts closed steady at ADollars 9.51, 1 cent above the US company's offer. HONG KONG opened strongly but turned down on profit-taking. The Hang Seng index finished 30.80 easier at 5,747.21, little changed on the week. Turnover totalled HKDollars 2.08bn against HKDollars 1.86bn on Thursday. Cheung Kong slipped 10 cents to HKDollars 20.2 and Hutchison Whampoa fell 40 cents to HKDollars 16.

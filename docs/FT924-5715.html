			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Drayton Cons 0.5p terminal dividend Drayton Consolidated, the investment trust which is in the throes of being reorganised, yesterday announced a terminal dividend of 0.5p. Invesco MIM, Drayton's fund manager, recently paid the trust's shareholders Pounds 9.5m compensation. This related to Drayton's exposure in a near-Pounds 40m loan made by Invesco MIM to Alma Holdings, the Scottish confectionery company which collapsed earlier this year. Drayton shareholders never fully knew the extent of exposure, in part because as new loans were being extended old ones were being written down. The settlement of 85p cash per share is part of a package which is also intended to create a new investment trust, Second Consolidated, with net asset value of 158p per share.</p>

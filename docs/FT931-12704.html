			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Old problems dog Nigeria's new team: IMF looks to a budget which revives reform WHEN Chief Ernest Shonekan was landed with one of Africa's toughest jobs he promptly called in some old friends. Inaugurated on January 1 as the chairman of Nigeria's transitional council, responsible for day-to-day administration under the military government, he had less than a month to preside over the preparation of the 1993 budget. Along with other Harvard Business School graduates in Nigeria, Chief Shonekan had helped to prepare an annual pre-budget policy paper for the past several years. This time it was the real thing. Three weeks later a reworked civil service draft was ready. The result, due to be delivered in Abuja today, is a critical test for Nigeria. Unless the budget revives a lapsed economic reform programme, paves the way for the renewed agreement with the International Monetary Fund, sets in train further rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars 29bn (Pounds 18.9bn) external debt, and helps restore creditor confidence, the country's prospects remain bleak. It is a formidable task. In the seven months to the installation in August of an elected government, Chief Shonekan and his team will be trying to impose fiscal and monetary discipline which has been lacking during much of the military regime's past seven years. But the men in key posts offer a combination of business experience and technical expertise which could improve the country's economic performance - provided they get the backing from President Ibrahim Babangida. Chief Shonekan himself, one of the country's most respected businessmen, has been seconded from the chairmanship of United Africa Company Nigeria, the Unilever subsidiary. He has brought with him Mr Isaac Aluko-Olukon, one of his closest advisers who is a leading economist. Mr Oladele Olashoro, who has the finance portfolio, is a former head of First Bank of Nigeria, one of the big three clearing banks. Mr Philip Asiodu, the new oil minister, ran the State-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) in the 1970s and had a distinguished career as a senior civil servant. Capable as the team is, it faces strong resistance from senior military officers and from civil servants to reductions and controls on government expenditure. Recent indicators show how necessary they are. During the first nine months of 1992 net domestic credit grew by 22.3 per cent, compared with 11.7 per cent in the same period in 1991, according to World Bank figures, reflecting a sharp increase in net credit to the federal government of 38 per cent. Inflation more than doubled, from 23 per cent at end 1991 to 51.3 per cent at end-August 1992 (year-on-year basis). Alongside cuts in spending, and improvements in the taxation system (the federal government derives 80 per cent of its revenues from oil exports), western donors will be watching for action on oil products subsidies. Some of the business community in Nigeria regard the removal of the subsidy as essential to the credibility of the transitional council. They argue that it would save the government approximately N80bn (Pounds 2.56bn) a year, enough to wipe out most of last year's budget deficit. Proceeds, they argue, could be used to provide public transport. Opponents of a drastic cut in the subsidy believe that this would only solve half of the problem. The lack of accountability in Nigeria's public finances would make it difficult for the transitional council to ensure that the saving from the subsidy was spent on economic development. Since controls on government spending are very weak, the additional income could well go on military purposes and on uneconomic industrial projects. Above all, there are fears that a cut in the petroleum subsidy would lead to riots. Nigerians not only cherish their access to the cheapest petrol in the world; they faced a sharp rise in other consumer prices since the 40 per cent devaluation of the naira in March 1992. Observers will be cautious about making any assessment of today's budget based solely on the figures presented to the National Assembly, however. In recent years budgeted and actual figures have not tallied, and official statistics have been unreliable. The Central Bank of Nigeria has recently published its 1991 annual report, for example, which states that instead of the government surplus of N100m for 1991 which was announced in last year's budget speech, there was a budget deficit in 1991 of N35.3bn. This deficit is about 12.5 per cent of GDP, well above IMF guidelines. The surplus in the 1992 budget looks likely to result in a deficit even larger than in 1991, according to local bankers. The real test of the new government, say observers, will not be the budget but how it puts it into practice.</p>

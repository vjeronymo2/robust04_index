			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The cutting edge of science - Two physicists who turned their knowledge of lasers into a business When Dr Malcolm Gower looks at newspaper advertisements for the correction of short-sightedness by surgery with laser beams, he wonders whether he could have been a millionaire by now. Nine years ago, soon after he and fellow physicist Dr Phil Rumsby had started Exitech, the future seemed mapped out. However, instead of plunging into the lucrative world of consumer optics, the two men decided to concentrate on micromachining across a variety of applications, using extremely precise excimer lasers, in which they are international authorities. Nowadays Gower and Rumsby travel the world, and visitors from many countries come to the rural Oxfordshire headquarters of what chairman Dr Gower calls 'the world's most precise hole boring operation'. An example of what this means can be seen in the company's display area. A photograph taken with an electron microscope shows how Exitech lasers can cut precise notches in a strand of human hair. In an adjoining laboratory, there is a small production line for a commercial customer where a laser bores microscopic holes into catheters for blood monitoring in babies. This batch work earns Exitech Pounds 100,000 a year. It undertakes similar work for the electronics industry, inserting almost invisible 'gratings' or windows into optical fibres, to convert them into optical sensors which measure temperature and stress changes. In 1985, shortly after Gower and Rumsby, had formed Exitech in a former slaughterhouse building in Oxford, they were asked by a London ophthalmology professor to explore the use of lasers to correct short-sightedness. They successfully researched the use of lasers for corneal sculpting - now a widely advertised private treatment - but decided against developing equipment for that application. 'We thought very hard about it but decided that the amount of money involved in developing the equipment would have meant seeking major outside investment - something we did not want to do at that stage,' Gower said. 'The potential was vast but it was too early in the company's history. We would have lost control of Exitech.' Instead the pair continued to work at the place where they met, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in nearby Abingdon for several more years. 'We agreed that we should always grow the business out of profits,' Gower said. 'Our borrowings have never exceeded our overdraft limit, currently Pounds 150,000.' Exitech is still a research-based company, specialising in developing high powered short wavelength lasers to perform tasks that cannot be seen with the naked eye. 'Five of our 20 employees are PhDs and the majority of the others have science degrees. The Excimer lasers we use were only invented in 1975, and they are only just being used as industrial tools. Here we combine research that would not be out of place in a university with collaborative projects with major manufacturers,' Gower said. About 50 per cent of the company's Pounds 2m turnover comes from commercial contract research and development. About Pounds 150,000 a year comes from British government and EC projects. For these projects the company gains only 50 per cent funding, so it has to find half the cost itself. 'Generally we only get involved in part-funded projects that we would in any case want to undertake as a company,' Gower said. Exitech aims at 40 per cent profit on turnover, although Gower admits they have yet to hit that figure. The company has expanded in the last three years, with the purchase of two more industrial units on the park where it is based, one of which is rented out to a hi-tech start-up company in which Exitech holds a 30 per cent share. The main reason for the big expansion in the past three years is the Exitech Series 7000, a complete excimer laser microdrilling system. Each machine is built to order and sells for between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 500,000. Exitech builds up to 12 a year. 'All the machines are designed and built here to the customer's specification. No two are the same,' Gower said. It needs a highly flexible workforce to switch from batch processing one day to assembling such a machine the next, but the team of research scientists, software specialists, designers and mechanical designers is able to cope. 'We tend to expand when we need to and when we see a market,' Gower said. 'Our market is so specific and our products so specialised that we can usually see the trends and can adapt ourselves accordingly. For a small company we probably do too many things and we are still not entirely clear about the best way of marketing ourselves. 'Our great strength is that we can move fast when we see a new technology. We can never beat the Japanese at manufacturing, but when we have innovative ideas we are good at explaining them to foreign customers, who are happy to come here for lengthy bench sessions.' About half Exitech's turnover comes from sales of the 7000 series machine. Gower and Rumsby are grateful that the percentage is no higher. Manufacturing such expensive machines creates problems of cash flow. 'Cash up front, even for a machine that might cost Pounds 500,000, is something that large multinationals are loath to supply to a small company on the other side of the world,' he said. 'We have to live with this. We have had sticky moments when building a machine that costs Pounds 400,000 and face an immediate bill of half that amount for buying in components. However, the bank is usually sympathetic when we are in a huge cash flow trough. 'They have no doubts over our profitability, and have the comfort of knowing that we own our three buildings outright. 'There are many laser producers who would like to work closely with us, and we have good relationships with biomedical and electronic end users. It's nice to be liked.'

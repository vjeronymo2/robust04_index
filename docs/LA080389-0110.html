			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOBIL AGREES ITS REFINERY TAINTED GROUND WATER  </P> <P> Mobil Oil Corp. has acknowledged publicly for the first time that its Torrance  refinery is responsible for part of a huge plume of gasoline-tainted ground  water that stretches at least three-fourths of a mile from its plant, and has  agreed to participate in a cleanup effort.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Mobil, which has spent $3 million over three years to define  the problem, said the company could not estimate how high the cost will climb  or how many years the cleanup will take.  </P> <P> The oil company -- already pumping nearly pure gasoline from atop the water  table beneath the refinery -- has also agreed to install a barrier of wells to  block the flow of contaminated water from its property, the company confirmed  Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accepts Responsibility  </P> <P> The company accepted responsibility for part of the pollution in recent letters  to the city and a state regulatory agency, although it has yet to find the  specific source of the gasoline among its many tanks and pipes.  </P> <P> Mobil now believes that gasoline leaks at its tank farm in eastern Torrance not  only deposited 2.4 million gallons of fuel into shallow ground-water pockets  and a regional aquifer but also spread dissolved hydrocarbons southeast of the  refinery, spokesman Greg Munakata said.  </P> <P> The pollution poses no threat of explosion and has been found only in water  basins not used for drinking in the Torrance area, he said. Mobil has tested  drinking water aquifers beneath the contaminated basins and found no pollution,  Munakata said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, test wells show that a toxic plume up to 1,000 feet wide stretches  at least 4,000 feet from the tank farm at Van Ness Avenue and Del Amo Boulevard  south to Torrance Boulevard. The plume underlies the city's largest  redevelopment project, the $200-million American Honda Motor Co. national  headquarters now under construction.  </P> <P> Mobil accepts responsibility for the northern 500 feet of the plume. And,  Munakata said, if more tests "tell us that we have a greater responsibility,  then we'll accept it."  </P> <P> Munakata said Mobil expects the Regional Water Quality Control Board to  eventually conclude that several other companies share responsibility for the  contamination, which consists mostly of highly toxic chemicals found in  gasoline.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Sources Discovered  </P> <P> But state water engineers and city officials said they think Mobil is  responsible for nearly all of the plume, even though two other sources of the  pollution have also been discovered in recent months.  </P> <P> Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert said Mobil's position is hardly a large step  forward. In fact, she said, the city is looking at its legal options because of  the slowness of Mobil's response.  </P> <P> "It's a recognition of what appears to be the obvious," she said. "None of this  has moved at the rate expected."  </P> <P> Torrance filed suit against the refinery in April in an attempt to have it  declared a public nuisance and subject to city regulation. The city maintains  that the refinery's use of deadly hydrofluoric acid and its history of fires,  explosions and illegal air emissions justify city intervention. Mobil has  countersued, saying that the refinery is safe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Four Years of Tests  </P> <P> Mobil's acknowledgement of responsibility for part of the plume comes more than  four years after the regional water board directed Mobil and 14 other  refineries in Los Angeles County to conduct tests to determine the extent of  ground-water pollution under their facilities.  </P> <P> Last year, the water board's chief refinery engineer, Jim Ross, said water  pollution at Mobil had led to "the largest off-site migration" of any of the  refineries. The board then ordered Mobil to pump gasoline from beneath its  refinery and to come up with a comprehensive plan for cleaning up the plume by  this spring.  </P> <P> "There had been some concern that Mobil wasn't owning up to the problems that  were being detected off-site," Ross said. "I wouldn't say they're rushing to  achieve the fastest possible cleanup. But to say they aren't cooperating is  totally inaccurate."  </P> <P> Torrance Councilman Dan Walker, also a member of the regional water board and a  vocal critic of the refinery, said he has been assured by state engineers that  "things are proceeding in a satisfactory manner, and I have to place my  reliance on them."  </P> <P> Ross said Mobil's proposal to build a wall of wells to pump and clean  contaminated water at the border of the refinery answers the state's greatest  concern at this point -- the migration of gasoline to the plume. "Once they've  accomplished this, then it makes sense to go after the off-site cleanup," he  said.  </P> <P> Munakata said Mobil plans to begin drilling the barrier wells this fall and to  complete the project next June. Meanwhile, it will also continue testing of  tanks and pipelines to try to pinpoint the source of the leaks. Tests over the  last two years have detected only two dime-sized holes in two tanks, he said,  probably not enough to account for the seepage.  </P> <P> It will also drill many new wells to confirm its contention that other  companies, including a now-defunct plating company, share in the blame. "We  know there's gasoline contamination in that plume," Munakata said. "We also  know there is contamination of industrial solvents that the refinery hasn't  used and are not present in the northern portion of that plume. And we know  there are other sources of gasoline contained in the southern portion of that  plume."  </P> <P> Test wells have found levels of benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, thousands  of times higher than the state standard for drinking water in the plume. High  levels of other toxic chemicals, including toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene,  have also been found.  </P></p>

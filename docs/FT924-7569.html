			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / People: Eddies from Copp's departure Biwater, the privately-owned water contractor which also controls three water supply companies, has appointed Kenneth Gardener as chairman of Bournemouth and West Hampshire Water companies, following the resignation of Martin Copp. Gardener, 65, who spent two decades at ICI and who has been a director of telecommunications group STC since 1987, has been on the main Biwater board on a part-time basis for six years and is vice chairman (finance) and chairman of its finance and audit committee. Shortly before the resignation of 54-year-old Copp, who was also deputy chairman of East Worcester water company, Biwater had effected an internal reorganisation whereby the three water companies were put into a new division, entitled Biwater Supply (Holdings), with Biwater executive Robin Turrell installed as chief executive. 'I felt the company wanted to get more and more involved (in running the water supply companies). I could no longer clearly see a role for an independent chairman,' says Copp, who has recently become a non-executive director of Portsmouth Water. Biwater owns 98 per cent of Bournemouth and 80 per cent of both West Hampshire and East Worcester. Copp is an economist with a merchant banking background. Once regional director for the south of England for Slater Walker, he moved after the group's collapse in the secondary banking crisis of 1974-75 to Singer &amp; Friedlander, where he ran the Bournemouth office. Subsequently, he has pursued a variety of other business interests; he was non- executive chairman of Fyne Machinery, which was sold to Beazer Engineering in 1986 and a founder-director of commercial radio company Ocean Sound.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / West Germany poised for growth THE western part of Germany is poised to be 'back on the growth track' next year, Deutsche Bank's chief economist predicted yesterday. In an upbeat assessment of west Germany's medium-term prospects, Mr Norbert Walter said in Berlin that economic growth there would rise to 3 per cent next year after growing only 1 per cent this year. He acknowledged that many conventional indicators, such as the fact that short-term interest rates are higher than long-term ones, suggested Germany was on course for a serious recession. But 'structural changes' in Europe would help ensure this did not happen. Germany would not have to rely on US recovery. Impetus for growth would come from implementation of the EC's single market at the start of next year, and closer trading links with Efta countries. Germany would benefit from high immigration. An increase of 2.5m in west Germany's population since 1987 had ensured a flexible labour market, and stimulated the economy through demand for housing and consumer durables. 'For the short term, the outlook is bleak,' Mr Walter said. 'It is moderately good for the second half. A good chance exists that structural factors will take over next year and (west German recovery) will help Europe recover from the present doldrums.' A 'dramatic' downturn would occur in west German inflation rates in the second half of the year, with year-on-year rates falling decisively below 4 per cent, against an expected 4.7 per cent peak for March and April. The Bundesbank was unlikely to relax its tight monetary policy until early June.</p>

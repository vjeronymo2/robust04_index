			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / People: Manduca to leave Henderson Paul Manduca, deputy group managing director of City fund manager Henderson Administration, is to become chief executive of Threadneedle Asset Management, the newly formed fund management arm of BAT Industries. Manduca has been at Henderson for just over a year. His appointment there followed the acquisition of investment trust managers Touche Remnant Holdings where he had been chief executive. At the time, there was considerable speculation about how Manduca's outspoken personal style would mesh with Henderson's 'City gents' culture. Henderson, which has been losing pension fund clients in its institutional business, had been buoyed by the acquisition of TR, which made it the UK's largest investment trust manager, and by the acquisition of Manduca, arguably its most dynamic board member. While Henderson insists Manduca's departure is 'not a bitter blow', it says it is very sorry to lose him. Moreover, the departure now creates a succession problem at Henderson. 'It was Henderson's intention to announce that Manduca would succeed Jeremy Edwards as chairman when he retires at the turn of 1996/97,' a spokesman said. Threadneedle is the amalgamation of the fund management businesses of Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar insurance companies and it has combined assets of Pounds 30bn.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> OIL PRICES SOAR AS WINTER NEARS  </P> <P> Oil prices rose sharply today as the United States and Europe laid in winter  fuel in what has lately begun to look like a tighter world petroleum market.  </P> <P> The worldwide average spot crude oil price is now $18 a barrel, according to an  index compiled daily by Britain's National Westminster Bank. That is a dollar  up on the average for September and $2 above August. It is fully $4 up on the  average for the whole of 1988.  </P> <P> Market analysts said demand has rebounded by nearly 9% since a glut took hold  in 1983, helped along by weaker prices during the glut and by booming economies  -- especially in Asia.  </P></p>

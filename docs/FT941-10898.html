			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (30): A new asset class created - Debt trading Out of the disaster of the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, a number of big international banks have created a booming business in issuing and trading emerging markets debt. The skills learned have been transferred to the Far Eastern markets, and now some of the banks hope that the same pattern can be repeated in eastern Europe. From the rubble of the sovereign lending boom that originated in the petrodollar recycling bubble of the 1970s, the international banks have ingeniously created a new class of high-yielding international debt instruments. They may be of uncertain creditworthiness in the long run, but they are immediately attractive to income-starved investors. 'We are at the forefront of recognising that emerging markets are global,' says Mr Jorge Jasson, senior vice-president in charge of the emerging markets group at Chase Investment Bank, in New York. 'We have dedicated our resources to the asset class.' Chase is by no means alone. Big US banks such as Citicorp and JP Morgan, which sweated for years over their Latin American exposures, are now cashing in. Elsewhere, one of the few European banks to have persevered in Latin America during the bad times is the Dutch-based ING; and it is now seeking to make its experience count in Europe, where it has, for instance, just bought a stake in Bank Slaski, in Poland. 'ING expanded in Latin America while other international banks were retreating,' says Mr Jacques Kemp, chairman of its international division. 'Now we are doing the same in eastern Europe.' He adds: 'There is a global transformation as multinationals transfer to emerging countries. For the next five years there will be more growth in the non-OECD economies, especially in comparison with western Europe. The next generation will talk about the problems of the First World rather than the Third World.' The trading of emerging markets debt has now become an important activity, based principally in New York and London. There are indications that trading teams are also being established in Hong Kong to develop the Far East market. An Emerging Markets Traders Association has been established, to provide a self-regulatory framework in which common standards can be developed. And, to complement the 15 or 20 international banks which handle most of the trading, a network of inter-dealer brokers has sprung up to improve the flow of information. Brokers are in the process of installing live screens, a reflection of the fact that emerging markets debt is no longer a thinly-traded fringe market but now operates on a comparable basis to the mainstream securities markets such as First World government paper. One of the leading brokers, Mr Martin Quintin-Archard, says that the development of the legal documentation by the market has been a significant advance. 'You can assign a loan without a thought,' he remarks. Mr Quintin-Archard, who is managing director of debt trading at Intercapital, in London, says that the Latin American crisis was of fundamental importance, in that it taught the banks to trade loans. 'If there is another crisis like this elsewhere, you already have the blueprint,' he says. Bank regulators may regard this with misgivings: the reported readiness of certain banks to trade distressed debt in cases such as Euro Disney may hamper crisis management. Yet the banks are making considerable fortunes out of Latin America. One result, however, is that there is a serious shortage of skilled traders. 'There's tremendous movement in the market,' says Mr Quintin-Archard. 'Entire teams are being lifted.' The big boom came last year. Although the climate had been rapidly improving since 1990, and many Latin American governments and corporate borrowers regained access to the international markets in 1991, it was in 1993 that the big payoff was seen in emerging market debt. A cascade of money (mainly from US institutions) arrived, seeking high returns in the face of slumping yields on US Treasuries and similar top-grade paper. The inflows generated their own lucrative price spirals, and the average return on Brady bonds, for instance, was around 44 per cent. The action more recently has been shifting to still more speculative debt, in anticipation, for instance, of Brady-type restructurings yet to come. Mr Jacques Kemp, of ING, comments that a lot of bank provisions are being written back; and, in fact, Latin America's overall credit record in the past 10 years has been quite good, certainly in comparison with the extensive bad debts which banks suffered in the developed countries between 1989 and 1992. But are investors losing sight of the credit risks? The collapse of Banco Latino, Venezuela's second-largest commercial bank, a few weeks ago provided a reminder of the problems. The Latino failure was a one-off, insists Mr Jasson. But he agrees that a lot of paper is coming to the market without a credit rating, and without consistent quality. 'There is an over-enthusiasm to bring to market issues that don't meet international standards,' he says. 'You should be very selective.' Mr Kemp is also wary about the extent of the securitisation of the debts, which raises questions about who exactly will be holding the paper when future defaults occur. 'We are concerned that there will be an over-extension of credit in the next few years,' he says. 'But most of the issues are in the private sector, which has a much better record than the public sector. The markets have been steering clear of major issues for the governments.' Now the game moves on. Once international emerging market debt - much better-sounding than junk bonds - has been established as an asset class, there is enormous scope to supply an ever-broader range of product. 'There is rapidly increasing interest from global investors who have a greater need to diversify their holdings,' says Mr Jasson. Mr Kemp has his eyes on the potential of eastern Europe: his bank has 2,000 staff there, and it hopes to open a branch in Moscow later this year. 'Latinos are now investing in east European debt, because they feel there are some common trends,' he says. A rise in status can be very profitable for investors, as Latin America has shown. 'East Europe will have to start at spreads of 300-400 basis points, but they will fall,' Mr Kemp predicts.</p>

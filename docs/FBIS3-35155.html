			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The PLO is seeking Israeli consent to the entry  of its intelligence and police officers into the Gaza Strip and  Jericho prior to the Israeli evacuation. Our Arab affairs  correspondent Ehud Ya'ari says that in the discussions, which  resumed in Cairo today, the Palestinians stressed that such a  move is essential to prevent an interim vacuum in the  territories.    [Ya'ari] The talks, which were resumed at Cairo's Shepherd  Hotel today, are headed by Major General Amnon Shahaq and Dr.  Nabil Sha'th. Members of both delegations have said that on 23  February, they may be able to deliver a public statement on the  results of this round.    This time the Civilian Affairs Committee will discuss issues  such as a fuel excise tax, the manner in which stamps printed by  Palestinians will be introduced and used, and the Palestinian  city planning powers. The Security Committee will decide on the  number of Palestinian police and their equipment. The  Palestinians want to set up a UN-supervised police training camp  in the Bethlehem area, but Israel refuses to allow any foreign  sponsorship. [passage omitted]</p>

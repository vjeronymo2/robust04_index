			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: SeaCon sees earnings per share rise SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based cargo equipment and ferry group, has forecast an increase in earnings per share from Dollars 1.95 to between Dollars 2.10 and Dollars 2.25 for 1992. In addition, the group is pressing ahead with plans to sell a second Dollars 25m tranche of senior subordinated debentures as part of an overall plan to sell Dollars 125m as it raises funds to expand its container and high-speed ferry operations. Mr James Sherwood, chairman, said the group's fourth quarter results would show a modest profit against Dollars 0.40 loss per share last time. He noted that 1991 earnings included a Dollars 0.62 per share contribution from an Dollars 6.2m out-of-court settlement with British Rail. SeaCon reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 28.5m (Dollars 27.6m) in the September quarter.</p>

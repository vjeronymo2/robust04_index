			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy With European elections looming, it is hardly surprising that the government used yesterday's first-quarter growth figures as an excuse to trumpet recovery. Without the contribution of oil and gas production, though, the 2 per cent output growth achieved in the first quarter is less impressive than the 2.6 per cent headline rate. The same is true of the longer-term trend. Non-oil GDP remains some way below the pre-recession peak reached in the second quarter of 1990, despite steadily increasing contribution from government spending in the intervening four years. More important, the rate of non-oil growth was actually down on the final quarter of last year. That is disappointing, given the recent run of encouraging economic indicators. But until more detailed figures are released next month it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. Variable factors - such as electricity generation, which depends on the weather  - may have been a drag despite seasonal adjustment of the figures. Still, it would be encouraging to see an acceleration of growth in manufacturing. Manufacturers will have to take up the running if tax rises slow what, until now, has been a consumer-led recovery. If growth remained reasonably well-balanced in the first quarter, the economy stands a fighting chance of meeting the government's 2.5 per cent growth forecast this year. That adds to the weight of argument against an early cut in interest rates, at least until the impact of higher taxes on consumer spending can be judged.</p>

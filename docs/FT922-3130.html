			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / People: Kingfisher flutters European wings The Kingfisher retailing conglomerate appears to be girding its loins for overseas expansion by yesterday appointing one of its leading retailers to the post of international development director. He is Jim Hodkinson, 48, a dynamic, straight-talking executive who helped develop B&amp;Q into a strong market leader in the DIY field. For several years, Kingfisher has been investigating the possibilities of expansion in mainland Europe, in the electrical retailing and DIY markets in particular, but has so far been frustrated through lack of suitable acquisition opportunities. 'We have been looking at Europe in our spare time so to speak and we did not think that was sufficient to drive the process,' the company said yesterday. Hodkinson will relinquish the post of deputy chairman and chief executive at B&amp;Q to take up the new post but will remain on the company's board as a non-executive director. His new job notwithstanding, he still intends to fulfil a long-held desire to retire at 50 and spend the considerable wealth he has amassed in a varied business career. His move neatly solves the succession question at B&amp;Q as it makes room for Alan Smith, currently managing director of Superdrug, to take on the top role. Smith will temporarily be replaced at Superdrug by Woolworth's property director Roger Jones until a full-time successor is found.</p>

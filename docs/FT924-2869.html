			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Hepworth raises Pounds 24m to fund Dutch buy HEPWORTH, the building materials and home products group, yesterday raised Pounds 24m by a share placing and announced the acquisition of a Dutch boiler business in a deal worth Fl 28.6m (Pounds 10.2m). The placing of 9.75m shares at 249p was underwritten by Henry Schroder Wagg and sold to institutions in conjunction with James Capel. Hepworth shares closed 4p up at 263p. The rest of the proceeds will be used to strengthen the group's European gas boiler operations. Hepworth is paying cash for AWB, an Eindhoven-based subsidiary of Mignot de Bloeck, which makes combination boilers and gas-fired radiators. AWB last year incurred an operating loss of Pounds 500,000 on sales of Pounds 13.5m, and had net assets of Pounds 4.8m. Hepworth is also buying the technical expertise, customer stock and certain other assets of Kiddy, a subsidiary of Meppeler Machinefabriek, which makes high-efficiency condenser boilers. The UK group said the acquisitions would provide it with significant market share and strong brand position in the Netherlands, which it estimated as the fourth largest market for combination boilers in Europe. Hepworth is one of the largest gas boiler businesses in Europe through its subsidiaries, Saunier Duval and Hepworth Heating. It said a manufacturing plant in the Netherlands would enhance its ability to service the Dutch market and give it access to new technology in condensing boilers and more products. When reporting a 7 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits in July, Hepworth said the trading outlook for the remainder of the year was extremely difficult. The group said yesterday that since then, trading conditions had worsened in some UK markets, although Saunier Duval had continued to perform well. Last year Hepworth recorded earnings per share of 24.3p. Despite the fact that earnings had been affected by difficult trading conditions and by significant exceptional costs, the board said it expected earnings in the current year to exceed the 14.85p level of last year's total dividend and said the distribution would be maintained.</p>

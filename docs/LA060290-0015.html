			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER NEA FUNDS FOR ART  </P> <P> The appeal of Fein and Meese to shut down the NEA struck a chord in me. The  American public doesn't know the half of the outrage being perpetrated on it by  the vile and money-grubbing "arts community." Every taxpayer is being soaked to  the tune of 68 cents per capita for federal arts funding. And this kind of  irresponsible waste is taking place just when the derelict S&amp;Ls -- products  of the free-market forces Fein and Meese so justifiably eulogize -- are lining  up with tin cups asking us for several thousand each. Excuse me while I wipe  this precious little tear. Why, instead of spending profligate sums on the  "arts," we could even buy two new sets of tires for the Stealth bomber.  </P> <P> Has the NEA, Fein and Meese ask with caustic wit, found even one Voltaire, one  Mozart? Not a one. And if it had, they'd be illegal aliens to boot. In West  Germany, the poor idiots spend nearly $39 per capita on arts, and look at them  -- all their good artists are dead! Anyhow, as the authors point out, there is  a reliable way to calculate genius to the decimal. On the Christie's scale of  "acrophobic prices" (in Fein/Meese's eloquent phrase), Van Gogh's "Dr. Gachet"  is $28.6 million better than his "Irises" (allowing for inflation).  </P> <P> Let's be serious here: Why would we need art and art funding when we can get  HBO in every corner of the country (and free in most motels)? We should do as  Meese and Fein suggest and use those staggering sums the NEA spreads around to  unwashed performance artists to "underwrite earthbound education." Local school  boards are much more cost-effective at censorship than the NEA could ever be.  And if just one more child knows that the Earth was suddenly created 6,000  years ago, won't it all have been worth it?  </P> <P> RALF ERIK REMSHARDT  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

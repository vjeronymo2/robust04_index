			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): TGWU drives for equal pay IT TOOK 18 years and two strikes for a group of female sewing machinists at Ford to win what they saw as a battle for equal pay with male workers. A further seven years of battling by other female workers has failed to eradicate what unions see as widespread sex discrimination on pay in the motor industry. Yesterday the TGWU general workers' union, the biggest union in car manufacturing, launched an equal-pay drive which it said could lead to rises of up to Pounds 1,000 for some of its 4,000 female workers in the motor industry. The union is backing equal-value claims for 380 women sewing machinists at Jaguar, Vauxhall and Aston Martin. Ms Margaret Prosser, TGWU national women's officer, said the union was actively seeking out equal-value claims on behalf of other groups of undervalued women car workers. She added that the average weekly pay of women in the motor industry was Pounds 207, about 78 per cent of the rate for men. Wherever possible, the union would try to win rises for women through job evaluation and grade-structure reorganisations. The dispute at Ford began in 1966 when a job evaluation scheme left sewing machinists, mainly female, on less pay than pattern cutters, most of whom were men. A strike that year and subsequent tribunal decisions failed to win them higher pay. The women finally won rises in 1985 after another strike and the setting up of an independent tribunal. Ford, however, saw it as a grading dispute, rather than one over equal pay. Earlier this year an independent expert was asked by a tribunal to investigate the case of sewing machinists at Vauxhall. The claimants are being backed by the AEU engineering union.</p>

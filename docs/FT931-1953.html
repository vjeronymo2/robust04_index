			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pendragon Pounds 16.6m rights to help fund acquisitions PENDRAGON, the motor distributor demerged from Williams Holdings, yesterday launched a 1-for-4 rights issue at 225p to fund acquisitions as it reported an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31. Profits rose from Pounds 4.73m to Pounds 5.23m on increased sales of Pounds 214.6m (Pounds 168.3m). The rights issue will raise Pounds 16.6m, net of expenses, leaving the group with net cash of Pounds 7.8m to fund its expansion programme. The shares fell 8p to 276p. Since the beginning of 1991 Pendragon has increased its franchises by 29 to 50. Its last cash call, in June 1991, raised Pounds 11m, of which Pounds 5.2m was invested in a Mercedes-Benz dealership and another Pounds 4.2m in other projects. However, last year another Pounds 9.4m was invested in various projects which turned a net cash position of Pounds 2.1m into net borrowings of Pounds 8.8m, representing gearing of 26.9 per cent. Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said: 'The rights issue will allow us to continue with a programme of expansion while maintaining a healthy balance sheet.' He said the declining car market and recession had meant that the performance of many of the past investments had not reflected their profit capability. Consequently, Pendragon's expansion with some manufacturers is not likely to continue at the same pace. Instead the group is to concentrate on selected infill acquisitions in large urban areas and on investment in big market segments in which the group does not have a significant presence. New car gross profits improved from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 9.1m, while overall new car sales in the UK were flat at 1.6m units. Earnings per share were 12.2p (12.1p). The final is 4.4p making 6.6p (6p).</p>

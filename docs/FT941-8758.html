			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Daewoo to set up design centre Daewoo Motor, the South Korean vehicle maker, is setting up a design and engineering centre in the UK as part of its expansion into world car markets. It has taken over the facilities and staff of International Automotive Design in Worthing, West Sussex, where it plans to form the Daewoo Worthing Technical Centre. IAD, formerly a leading UK automotive design and engineering company, was taken over from the receiver last year by Mayflower, the specialist automotive engineering group. The move by Daewoo is a bold step by the smallest of the big three South Korean carmakers to create a global design and engineering presence to accelerate the development of its new-vehicle programme. The South Korean motor industry has embarked on a rapid expansion overseas and both Hyundai and Kia, Daewoo's bigger domestic rivals, have entered many European car markets. Hyundai cars were launched in the US in 1986 and Kia is entering the US market for the first time this year. The Daewoo Motor technical centre in the UK has a workforce of about 200 and is recruiting additional engineering specialists, product planners and designers. The technical centre plans to start work this year on a project to design and develop a range of medium-sized family cars. It aims to take on a new vehicle project each year. Daewoo Motor plans to establish itself as one of the top 10 carmakers in the world and is seeking to more than triple its world production capacity. It recently bought a 51 per cent stake in Oltcit, a Romanian vehicle maker, to provide it with its first production base in Europe. This follows the signing of several contracts for potential joint-venture projects in Uzbekistan, Iran, the Philippines and Vietnam. Its export drive follows the collapse in 1992 of its eight-year-old 50-50 partnership with General Motors, under which it supplied to GM in the US a Korean-built version of the Opel Kadett.</p>

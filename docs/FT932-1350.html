			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Hopes of revival in construction THE FIRST signs of a revival in construction activity may have appeared, according to figures for new orders published yesterday by the Department of the Environment. These show that contracts won by construction companies in Great Britain rose 10 per cent in the February- April period compared with the previous three months. Orders were 1 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. The improvement is consistent with increased optimism reported in recent workload surveys by the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Contractors say, however, that overall order books remain very depressed and that it is far too early to talk of 'green shoots' in the sector. Miss Joanne Cutler, economist at the Building Employers Confederation, said yesterday that the improvement was very patchy. The rise in orders was due partly to a rebound from exceptionally low order figures reported in December, when there was a big fall in public sector and infrastructure work. Miss Cutler said: 'We are seeing some growth in the more cyclical housing and private industrial sectors, but it is questionable whether a few months of limited growth constitutes a recovery.' She added that industry leaders were apprehensive about the possibility of public spending cuts in the November Budget which 'could set the recovery back a further 12 months'. There is also concern that the big rise in house sales, seen earlier this year, has slowed in recent weeks. According to the department, private housing orders jumped 29 per cent in February, March and April compared with the previous three months - and were 13 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. Infrastructure orders, including contracts placed by private water and power generation companies, were 7 per cent higher than during the previous three months but 2 per cent lower than a year ago. Commercial orders, mostly offices and shops, although 7 per cent higher than in the previous three months, were 17 per cent lower than during the corresponding period last year.</p>

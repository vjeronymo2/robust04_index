			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 'MONSTER IN NURSE'S WHITES' SENTENCED IN INJECTION DEATHS  </P> <P> Convicted killer Richard Angelo, a nurse who tried to become a hero by reviving  patients he injected with lethal doses of drugs, was sentenced today to 61 1/3  years to life in prison.  </P> <P> "During my many years on the bench, I've heard many stories of horror, but this  is at the top of the list," said Suffolk County Court Judge Alfred Tisch.  </P> <P> "The course of conduct taken by this defendant gives new meaning to the concept  of depraved indifference," Tisch said as Angelo, 27, stood before him without  expression, occasionally biting his lip.  </P> <P> Angelo, described by the prosecution as "a monster in nurse's whites," was  convicted Dec. 14 of two counts of second-degree murder and one count each of  manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the deaths of four patients  from fatal injections of Pavolon, a muscle-relaxant drug.  </P> <P> Angelo's parents, Joseph and Alice Angelo, sat behind him in the front row but  showed no emotion while the judge imposed the sentence. As he spoke, Tisch  glanced at the two retired schoolteachers and remarked to them, "It is likely  that during the remainder of your natural life your son will be incarcerated."  </P> <P> As a handcuffed Angelo was being taken out of the courtroom, the son of one of  his murder victims shouted, "Enjoy life in jail, fat boy."  </P></p>

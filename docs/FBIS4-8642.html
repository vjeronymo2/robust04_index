			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic received Russian Special Envoy Vitaliy  Churkin this evening for the third time in the last 24 hours.    Commenting on the three rounds of talks with Milosevic,  which  altogether lasted about five hours, Churkin told journalists he  was satisfied with the talks, that they were constructive, and  had focused mostly on the cessation of hostilities in the whole  of former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "I can say now, after the third round, that what I have in  my  hands now is a good basis for achieving an agreement on the  cessation of hostilities in the whole of former  Bosnia-Herzegovina," Churkin stressed.    The Russian envoy told journalists he was leaving for Pale  and Sarajevo early tomorrow morning and that he would work very  intensively on the realization of the agreement on the cessation  of hostilities in former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "My main objective is to end the current very difficult  situation and to proceed toward the political resolution of the  Bosnian crisis," Churkin said.    He refused to give any more details regarding the talks with  President Milosevic, but expressed hope that the other (Muslim)  side would show as constructive an approach as the Serb side.  "In any case, I am awaiting the talks in Sarajevo tomorrow with  hope," Churkin added.    Asked whether he was now, after the third round of talks  with  Milosevic, more optimistic then before the talks, he said: "I  think we have done a good job and, with a bit of luck, we could  change the situation in Bosnia."</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Put a premium on possessions STUDENTS may be impoverished but many still have items of interest to burglars: stereos, televisions, watches, jewellery, cameras or personal computers. Insurance can seem an unnecessary expense, but habits such as leaving doors unlocked and living in shared houses make students easy targets for opportunistic thieves, and many insurers refuse to cover them. As a student, probably the cheapest way to insure your belongings is if your hall of residence has a block policy; ask if it does. The next cheapest is to use your parents' home contents insurance, which often covers items 'temporarily removed' to another place. But cover could be restricted so check the details. Extending the policy could be better, but some insurers will no longer do this. The other, more expensive, solution is to buy student possessions insurance. National Westminster, Barclays and Lloyds sell a policy from Norwich Union via Harrison-Beaumont, while Midland and the Bank of Scotland have their own insurance. Endsleigh Insurance, which has branches near most universities, also has a policy. Rooms in halls of residence generally are cheaper to insure than rooms in non-university accommodation. The Norwich Union charges Pounds 28.50 for Pounds 2,000 cover in halls anywhere in the UK, the Bank of Scotland charges Pounds 37.50, and Endsleigh Pounds 27. Rates for rooms elsewhere depend on your postcode. Students in inner cities could pay twice as much as small-town students. With the Norwich, Pounds 2,000 cover in the cheapest district costs Pounds 40 and Pounds 82 in the most expensive. The Bank of Scotland charges from Pounds 43.75 to Pounds 82 and Endsleigh ranges from Pounds 35 to Pounds 99. The Midland charges between Pounds 51.75 and Pounds 162.15 for Pounds 2,750 cover. Policies do not all cover the same things: exclusions vary; replacement can be new for old or second-hand value only; and there can be other benefits - such as loss or damage to library books and college property, which is covered under the Endsleigh policy. All-risks cover for personal items taken out of your room sometimes costs extra. One point to watch is whether theft is excluded unless there is evidence of forcible entry (this does not cover theft by flatmates or strangers wandering through an open door). Endsleigh does not specify forcible entry but Norwich does. All policies have a limit for individual items - if this is too low for your computer, or other valuables, you can usually increase the cover. Student bicycles are an even worse risk. Endsleigh cannot insure them at present but hopes to have a policy again by the start of the academic year. The Norwich policy includes bicycles for an extra premium of 17.5 per cent of the machine's value, with a minimum premium of Pounds 24 and a maximum insurable value of Pounds 300. Again, a cheaper option could be to include it on all-risks cover under your parents' policy. Commercial Union charges between Pounds 10 and Pounds 40 (depending on postcode) for Pounds 1,000 of all-risks cover as a policy extension. The individual item limit is 25 per cent of the sum insured, up to a maximum of Pounds 500. So, a bicycle worth Pounds 250 could be insured for as little as Pounds 10, along with Pounds 750 of other goods.</p>

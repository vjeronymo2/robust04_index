			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finns refuse to build fifth nuclear plant FINLAND'S parliament yesterday voted against building the country's fifth nuclear power plant. MPs rejected the project by 107 to 90 after a heated three-day debate, writes Christopher Brown-Humes from Stockholm. The decision was immediately condemned by Finnish industry and trade unions, who say the reactor is essential for the country's energy and for jobs at a time of 20 per cent unemployment. The FM10bn-FM15bn (Pounds 1.1bn-Pounds 1.7bn) plant would have provided up to 10 per cent of Finland's energy needs by the year 2000. The vote has a wider symbolic value, with France and the UK now the only west European countries with reactors under construction. It will disappoint the international contractors who had already made bids to build the plant: Sweden's ABB Atom, Russia's Atomenergoexport, and NPI, a consortium formed by Germany's Siemens and France's Framatome. The Finnish prime minister, Mr Esko Aho, opposed the plant, although his cabinet colleagues within the centre-right government gave it the go-ahead in February. Mr Tauno Matomaki, chairman of the Confederation of Finnish Industry and Employers, described the decision as 'a disincentive to industrial business in Finland'.</p>

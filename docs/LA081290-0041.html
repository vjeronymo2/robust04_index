			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE VIEWS: A NEW SHIP FOR ALASKA  </P> <P> The newest cruise ship sailing Alaskan waters is the 960-passenger Crystal  Harmony, built in Nagasaki, Japan, for Los Angeles-based Crystal Cruises at a  cost of $200 million.  </P> <P> The vessel offers 12-day round-trip cruises from San Francisco along the Inside  Passage, with calls at Victoria and Vancouver in British Columbia, and Haines,  Juneau, Ketchikan, Sitka, Skagway and Wrangell in Alaska.  </P> <P> Passengers can take shore excursions that include:  </P> <P>  -- Helicopter flights over glacial rivers of ice.  </P> <P>  -- Rides aboard the wooden parlor cars of a historic narrow-gauge railway that  once carried supplies to the Klondike.  </P> <P>  -- Inflatable raft trips into the Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve near Haines.  </P> <P>  -- Flights in a bush pilot's floatplane over the fiords.  </P> <P>  -- Fishing trips in search of salmon off Ketchikan.  </P> <P> These excursions cost from $15 to $168 apiece.  </P> <P> The Crystal Harmony offers three dining choices. In addition to the Crystal  Dining Room, which has two seatings, passengers can dine free in one of the  ship's two specialty restaurants: Prego, which serves Italian cuisine, and  Kyoto, which offers a variety of dishes from many Asian countries.  </P> <P> The ship offers the first seagoing branch of Las Vegas' Caesars Palace, with  six blackjack tables, a craps table, a roulette table and about 75 slot  machines. News-hungry passengers can receive Cable News Network by satellite  throughout the day.  </P> <P> The highest ratio of public space per passenger, lots of private verandas,  generous expanses of teak decking, a sliding glass roof over a pool and deck  area, 24-hour room service and in-cabin dinners add to the voyage's comfort and  pleasure.  </P> <P> The ship's decor is rich and luxurious, with marble, wood and brass used  throughout. Pianists, harpists and violinists continually fill the ship with  music, and 526 staff members in custom-designed uniforms seem to be everywhere.  </P> <P> The public room most successful is the Palm Court, an expanse of polished wood,  ceiling fans, rattan chairs and potted palms arranged below conical skylights  like a Victorian conservatory.  </P> <P> Entertainment on the ship is slick and professional, featuring musical  productions and such performers as magicians and marionettes.  </P> <P> Largest accommodations are the 948-square-foot Crystal Penthouse suites, with  private verandas, whirlpool tubs, wet bars, separate living and bedrooms, entry  foyer and guest half-baths, which cost $950 to $1,200 per person, double  occupancy, per day. Nineteen spacious inside cabins, meanwhile, cost $245 per  person per day, double occupancy.  </P> <P> Deluxe outside staterooms come with or without private verandas. Since they are  all comparable in size and furnishings -- king-sized or twin beds, sofas,  built-in desks with chairs -- those without verandas seem more spacious and  have somewhat larger closets. There are also four well-designed cabins for  handicapped passengers.  </P> <P> The best buy on board appears to be the standard outside stateroom with  portholes, which are somewhat larger than the deluxe outside staterooms with  windows, but cost about $255 a day per person, double occupancy.  </P> <P> Decks No. 7 and No. 8 contain about 98 deluxe cabins with views partially or  fully obstructed because of hanging lifeboats. Prices for these are about $275  to $285 a day. All cabins have bathtubs, hair dryers and safes.  </P> <P> After the last Alaska cruise of the season, which departs Aug. 29, the Crystal  Harmony will sail south to the Mexican Riviera (from San Francisco Sept. 10 and  Los Angeles Sept. 11) for a series of 10-day Panama Canal transits between  Acapulco and San Juan, Puerto Rico.  </P></p>

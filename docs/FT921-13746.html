			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / EC postal services face regulation POST OFFICES throughout the European Community will have to publish detailed information on the performance of their services as part of a tighter regulatory framework proposed by the Commission. The proposals are contained in the Commission's long-awaited green paper on postal services, expected to be published by the end of the month. Most of the proposed changes are designed to increase competition, but they do not advocate the abolition of the national local letter delivery monopolies. However, a final draft of the paper, prepared by Mr Pieter Weltevreden, director-general responsible for telecommunications, shows that the Commission will seek a number of measures to increase liberalisation as the price for supporting the monopolies. Sir Leon Brittan, Competition Commissioner, has made it clear, according to Commission officials, that 'monopolies are now the exception and not the rule'. The paper advocates an end to cross-subsidies from reserved letter areas to express mail. If a post office props up its parcels division, for example, by using revenue from its letters monopoly, this would be viewed as anti-competitive. Each member state is also urged to set up a regulatory body to ensure that its national post office does not abuse its dominant position. Cross-border competition is to be introduced by giving private postal operators the right to send outward mail to other post offices - known as remail. The Competition Directorate has insisted that private couriers should also be able to receive international mail and deliver it within any of the 12 member states. The paper states that it is not about to sanction the extension of monopolies. Neither will any member state be able to place restrictions on services which are currently liberalised. Mr Jim Campbell, special counsel on postal affairs for the International Express Carriers Conference, said: 'The most important thing that could come out of the green paper is for the Commission to open up cross-border mail to competition.' Commission officials say Sir Leon has made it clear that as postal services make their transition from a long tradition of legal protection they will continue to be pushed towards further liberalisation.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Anheuser-Busch to take over Chinese brewery Anheuser-Busch, the biggest brewer in the US, is continuing the international assault on China's beer market with the planned takeover of the Zhongde brewery in Wuhan on the Yangtze River. The group, which produces Budweiser beer, has announced that it would take an 80 per cent stake in the Wuhan brewery and expected the deal to be completed by the end of this year. Last year, Anheuser-Busch secured a 5 per cent stake in the Tsingtao brewery, China's best known brewer and one of nine companies selected for a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The US company's investment in the Wuhan brewery will be made through Anheuser-Busch International and is part of aggressive expansion plans in emerging markets. It is certain to pay a premium price for its stake in the Zhongde Chinese-German joint venture, which was established in 1988.</p>

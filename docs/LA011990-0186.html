			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> PHOENIX TEAM CUTS TICKET PRICES  </P> <P> Phoenix Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill, vilified by some fans for having the  NFL's highest ticket prices the past two seasons, has done something about it.  </P> <P> Bidwill announced a restructuring program Thursday that will cut the cost on  55,911 seats and reduce the average ticket price to $30.77 -- down from $38 in  1988 and $36.33 last year.  </P> <P> Overall, the pricing format for the 1990 season will lower the average ticket  price 15.5% with reductions from $5 to $25 per ticket.  </P> <P> Ticket prices will still range from $200 per game for 202 premium loge seats at  the 50-yard line to $15 apiece for seats in the south end zone at 74,724-seat  Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe.  </P> <P> But Bidwill said 9,201 premium seats have been eliminated so there are now  43,000 tickets priced at $15 and $20 per game with about 10,000 of the new $20  tickets located on the sidelines.  </P></p>

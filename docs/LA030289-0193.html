			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN HAILED FOR SIGN LAW STAND  </P> <P> Three cheers for Pomona City Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, who has the  courage to speak out against the Asian American Business Group, which is suing  to overturn that city's language-related sign ordinance (Times, Feb. 16).  </P> <P> It is ironic that while bitter campaigns have been waged in other parts of the  country to have English declared our official language, the Asian business  leaders in Pomona would have it the other way around.  </P> <P> It has always been disconcerting for Americans who have grown up here to live  alongside immigrants who continuously resist assimilation into our culture and  refuse to speak anything but their foreign language.  </P> <P> The business group's suit alleges that the sign ordinance has caused injury to  their "personal, cultural, political and economic freedom." Perhaps the group  should bear in mind that in no other nation of the world could they enjoy the  freedom to establish a business enterprise as they can here. And are they  overlooking the harm that has been inflicted on our economy by the unending  flood of imports from their countries?  </P> <P> In my view, the litigation over the Pomona sign ordinance may very well reach  the Supreme Court, where I hope, our nine justices will shed valuable new light  upon the First Amendment. I doubt if the Founding Fathers intended freedom of  speech to encompass Oriental store signs.  </P> <P> STEVE PROWLER  </P> <P> San Dimas  </P> <P> The San Gabriel Valley section of The Times welcomes all viewpoints from  readers about issues in the San Gabriel Valley.

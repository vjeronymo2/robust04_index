			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of provisions in subpart 2 and elsewhere in the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are particularly important to emphasize here. Part D establishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a scheme for more polluted areas to have more time to attain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those more polluted areas to a graduated program of additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and more stringent specific control requirements to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished over the longer time-frame.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 181(a) provides for classification of ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonattainment areas based on the degree of the nonattainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem in the area (as measured by the area's ozone design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value), and provides that attainment ``shall be as expeditiously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as practicable but not later than'' specified deadlines expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as years after enactment. The areas, and the corresponding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment deadlines are: Marginal (1993); Moderate (1996);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Serious (1999); Severe (2005 or 2007, depending on the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value); and Extreme (2010). The Act also provides for additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``unclassifiable/no data'' nonattainment areas. All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classifications other than Extreme are represented in the OTR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 184(b) also specifies additional requirements applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for attainment areas in ozone transport regions, including: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance programs in cities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting specified size thresholds; (2) state-wide implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of reasonably available control measures (RACT); (3) ``Stage II''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle refueling vapor controls or ``comparable measures''; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) treatment of major stationary sources of ozone precursors as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if they were in moderate nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 182 establishes the graduated control measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable for each nonattainment classification. These measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are additive in that the higher classifications must generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt, in addition to measures specifically applicable to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher classification, all measures identified for lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classifications as well. A basic requirement applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marginal and above classifications is that States are to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventories of actual emissions from all sources in each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonattainment area. See sections 182(a)(1) and 172(c)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These emissions inventories may be important in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the LEV program is necessary in the OTR. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the inventories may be important to determining the magnitude of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions reductions that may be needed for attainment, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness of various measures to obtain such reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another potentially key requirement is that Moderate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above areas must submit attainment demonstrations. Under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 182(b)(1)(A), for Moderate and above areas States are to specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in their plans specific annual reductions in emissions ``as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to attain the [NAAQS] for ozone by the attainment date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable under this Act.'' Under section 182(c)(2)(A), for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Serious and above areas States are to submit a demonstration that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State Implementation Plan (SIP), ``as revised, will provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for attainment of the ozone [NAAQS] by the applicable attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date.'' Further, this provision continues, ``[t]his attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration must be based on photochemical grid modeling or any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other analytical method determined by the Administrator, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator's discretion, to be at least as effective.'' These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements provide the motivation for the OTC's recommendation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as additional measures may be necessary for the States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that their SIPs will achieve timely attainment. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modeling information is, of course, important to determining what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions are necessary in what areas for attainment in the OTR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is also relevant that States are obligated to adopt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various measures specified for progress toward attainment, and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve certain percentage reductions in emissions by interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dates. In general, section 172(c)(2) requires that SIPs ``require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable further progress'' (RFP), defined in section 171(1) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mean ``such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant air pollutant as are required by this part or may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring attainment of the [NAAQS] by the applicable date.'' More  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically, section 182(b) provides that for Moderate and above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas States were to submit, by November 15, 1993, SIP revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing for a 15% reduction in emissions of volatile organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds (VOCs) from a 1990 baseline to be achieved by 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, section 182(c)(2)(B) provides that for Serious and above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas States are to submit, by November 15, 1994, SIP revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that will result, subject to a limited feasibility exception, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional reductions in VOC emissions from the 1990 baseline of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3% each year averaged over consecutive 3-year periods beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1996 and until the attainment date. Section 182(c)(2)(C)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for substitution of reductions in emissions of nitrogen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxides (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) for VOC, in accordance with EPA guidance. These RFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements establish minimum reductions that certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonattainment areas in the OTR will be required to achieve apart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from whether EPA approves or disapproves the recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, section 110 of the Act establishes general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for SIPs. Section 110(a)(2) specifies minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements of a State's SIP, and subparagraph (D) specifies that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State's SIP shall contain adequate provisions prohibiting, consistent with the provisions of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title, any source or other type of emissions activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the State from emitting any air pollutant in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts which will contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interfere with maintenance by, any other State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to any such national primary or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary ambient air quality standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision, as discussed in detail below, is the key  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism under the transport provisions of sections 176A and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 184, and is central to the OTC recommendation and to EPA's action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Ozone Transport Region Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTR was established by operation of law under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 184 of the Act and is comprised of the States of Connecticut,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District of Columbia, and the portion of Virginia that is within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area that includes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District of Columbia. Congress established the OTR in the 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments to the Act based on the recognition that the transport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ozone and ozone precursors throughout the region may render  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Northeast States' attainment strategies interdependent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 184, the Administrator established a Northeast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ozone Transport Commission for the OTR consisting of the Governor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of each State or their designees, the Administrator or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designee, the Regional Administrators for the EPA regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices affected (or the Administrator's designees), and an air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollution control official representing each State in the region,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appointed by the Governor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

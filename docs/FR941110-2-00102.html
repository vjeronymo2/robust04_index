(Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, is cited as the ``Fair Housing Act.'') Section 810(f) of the Fair Housing Act requires the Department to refer complaints to State and local agencies that have ``substantially equivalent'' fair housing standards, as determined and certified by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 115 of the Department's regulations (24 CFR part 115) contains the certification standards and the procedures for certifying State and local fair housing laws that provide substantive rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory housing practices that are substantially equivalent to those provided in the Fair Housing Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Announcement of Initial Determinations and Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 24 CFR 115.6(c)(1), this notice announces that the fair housing laws of the States of Connecticut, Ohio, South Carolina and the city of Cambridge, MA, have been determined by the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to be substantially equivalent, on their face, to the Fair Housing Act. The Assistant Secretary has determined, after application of the criteria set forth in 24 CFR 115.3 and 115.4, that the fair housing laws for these three States and this locality provide, on their face, substantive rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory housing practices that are substantially equivalent to those provided in the Fair Housing Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following a review of performance standards and other materials pertaining to the fair housing laws of these three States and this locality, the Department expects to make final determinations that the law of each of the three States and the locality, in operation, provides rights and remedies that are substantially equivalent to those available under the Fair Housing Act. The Department intends to execute a Memorandum of Understanding with the agency charged with enforcement of the fair housing law of each State and locality in accordance with 24 CFR 115.6(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 24 CFR 115.6(b), the public is invited to submit written comments on this notice. Specifically, the Department requests written comments on the proposed determinations that the current practices and past performance of the agencies charged with administration and enforcement of the fair housing laws of the three States and the locality demonstrate that, in operation, these laws provide substantive rights and remedies that are substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Act.

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUSTICES LET FAIR-HOUSING SUITS STAND;  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT: THE CASES CENTER ON NEWSPAPER ADS IN THE WASHINGTON, D.C. AREA  THAT USED ONLY WHITES AS MODELS.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today refused to kill two fair-housing lawsuits that stem  from newspaper real estate advertisements showing only white models posing as  homeowners.  </P> <P> The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that forces developers of a  Virginia condominium community to defend themselves in a jury trial against  allegations they violated federal law.  </P> <P> The suits center on ads that appeared in the Washington Post over a 17-month  period beginning in 1985 for Colonial Village, a condo community in Arlington,  Va., just across the Potomac River from the District of Columbia.  </P> <P> The suits were filed by Girardeau Spann, a black resident of Washington who is  a professor at Georgetown University's law school, and two advocacy groups --  the Metropolitan Washington Planning and Housing Assn. and the Fair Housing  Council of Greater Washington.  </P> <P> Named as defendants are Colonial Village Inc. and its parent firm, Mobil Land  Development Corp., a subsidiary of the huge oil company.  </P> <P> The lawsuits allege that the defendants violated the Fair Housing Act by  featuring only white models in ads that appeared in the Post. The suits said  the ads were racially preferential and discriminatory, and they sought an  injunction and monetary damages.  </P> <P> A federal trial judge in 1987 threw out the suits, ruling that they had been  filed too late.  </P> <P> But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here reinstated them last March 13, and  sent the dispute back to U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene for trial.  </P> <P> In the appeals acted on today, the justices were urged to dismiss the suits for  several reasons. The appeals said applying the Fair Housing Act to bar the use  of six ads showing 10 human models would violate free-speech rights.  </P> <P> Lawyers for Colonial Village Inc. argued that the appeals court ruling "in  effect sent the case back for a jury trial based on nothing more than the  appearance . . . of a handful of ads in which pictures of black models happened  not to be included."  </P> <P> The appeal added: "With no evidence of discriminatory intent being required,  Colonial's facially neutral ads may now subject it to liability if a jury in  the District of Columbia finds that they can be read as racially preferential  or discriminatory."  </P> <P> All the disputed ads contained an Equal Housing Opportunity logo reflecting the  developer's compliance with fair housing laws.  </P> <P> In another action today, the court refused to kill an affirmative action  program in Florida aimed at awarding more public works contracts to businesses  run by minorities and women.  </P> <P> The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by companies that said the  Tampa-area program is unconstitutional because it condones reverse  discrimination against white men.  </P></p>

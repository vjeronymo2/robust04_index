			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: RUSSELL WHITE INELIGIBLE AT CAL THIS YEAR  </P> <P> Russell White, who will be a freshman this fall at the University of  California, will not participate in football during the coming academic year  because he failed to meet the minimum Scholastic Aptitude test score of 700  required by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  </P> <P> White, who is the nephew of former Ram running back Charles White, said  Thursday that he will concentrate on his studies at Berkeley and return to the  football program as a sophomore with three years of eligibility remaining.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed that I will not be able to play this season, but I came here  to Cal to get a good education and this gives me a chance to focus on my  academics the first year," White said.  </P></p>

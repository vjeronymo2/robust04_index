			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PHYSICIST'S BOOK ON GLOBAL WARMING INSPIRES TV MOVIE  </P> <P> A new scientific book intended to promote understanding of the greenhouse  effect is being used as the basis for a fictional TV movie examining what life  will be like for a group of people in 30 to 40 years if global temperatures  climb.  </P> <P> Producer Robert Greenwald calls the proposed movie, currently in development  for ABC, a "futuristic 'Grapes of Wrath.' "  </P> <P> It is being adapted by Dennis Nemec from "Dead Heat: The Race Against the  Greenhouse Effect," by Robert Boyle and Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric  physicist and senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund.  </P> <P> "Instead of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, it's set in Oppenheimer's world, and  it's not too far ahead," Greenwald said. "It will be about a family that's on  the road in search of a liveable habitat, as the environmental destruction has  raised havoc."  </P> <P> The scenario, in part, as described in "Dead Heat": "The global economy will  gradually feel the strain of the warming as farms, industries and tens of  millions of people are forced to migrate and then move again; as natural  resources are stretched to the limit and finally are exhausted; as conflicts  erupt in the struggle over what remains."  </P> <P> The project began, Greenwald said, when he consulted the Environmental Media  Assn. about doing a film about global warming and was told he should get in  touch with Oppenheimer. "Dead Heat" had not yet gone to print, but Greenwald  read the manuscript and decided to make his movie.  </P> <P> "It was based, first and foremost, on the opening chapter of his book, which  was the most devastating and potent description of what our future will look  like, in a very practical and specific way," said Greenwald, whose TV movie  credits include "The Burning Bed," "Daddy," "A Deadly Silence" and the upcoming  "Hiroshima."  </P> <P> The fact that some scientists do not agree with Oppenheimer's grim predictions  for the future will not affect the project, Greenwald said.  </P> <P> "It's a hypothetical case about what could happen, based on a significant  amount of scientific knowledge," he said.  </P></p>

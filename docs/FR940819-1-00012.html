			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The programs are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under number 10.760, Water and Waste Disposal Systems for Rural Communities, and are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been reviewed in accordance with FmHA Instruction 1940&hyph;G, ``Environmental Program.'' RDA has determined that the action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91&hyph;190, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance with Executive Order 12778 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation has been reviewed in light of Executive Order 12778 and meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and (2)(b)(2) of that Order. Provisions within this part which are inconsistent with State law are controlling. All administrative remedies pursuant to 7 CFR Part 1900 Subpart B must be exhausted prior to filing suit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0575&hyph;0015 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507). This proposed rule does not revise or impose any new information collection requirement from those approved by OMB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A change is proposed in the security requirements for loans made for construction or improvements to solid waste facilities. The requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency Subtitle D regulations have increased the capital needs of rural communities for disposal of solid waste. The current security requirements for loans on solid waste facilities are too stringent, and this proposed action will add flexibility that is needed to improve the program. Currently, additional security is required when revenue is the primary security for loans involving solid waste facilities. The proposed change will remove the requirement for additional security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed action also incorporates into RDA loan and grant regulations the provision contained in the REA Act of 1993 which prohibits a recipient of the programs from imposing certain conditions on the users of the service provided. For example, a utility, supplier, or cooperative that provides electric service cannot obtain RDA financing for a water system and require that the water customers connect to their electric system as a condition for receiving water. The REA Act requires that appropriate measures and sanctions be implemented against any person violating or attempting to violate this prohibition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1942 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Community development, Community facilities, Loan programs-Housing and community development, Loan security, Rural areas, Waste treatment and disposal-Domestic, Water supply-Domestic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, Chapter XVIII, title 7, Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1942_ASSOCIATIONS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

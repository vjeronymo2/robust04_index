			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / China boxes clever for the Olympics with US match IN A drab stadium in Beijing on Saturday night, the workers of China came face to face with the blood, sweat and hoopla of American professional boxing. It was billed as the 'Brawl at the Wall'. The promoter, Mr Harold Smith, appeared elegantly attired in a dinner jacket. Local girls, in short white skirts and matching tops, semaphored each new round. Many in the crowd, bemused and exhilarated by the spectacle, had spent a month's wages on a single ticket. Muhammad Ali, boxing envoy, former world champion and sporting icon, was introduced to the cheering crowd. He raised his arm in acknowledgement of the greeting. Mr Han, a producer for Chinese television, which was broadcasting the event to millions, caught the mood of joyful puzzlement: 'It's crazy, but I like it.' If China, preparing a bid to host the Olympics in 2000, needed a lesson in sports promotion, it certainly got one. Fighters were greeted on their arrival in the ring with their signature tunes blaring from amplifiers. A honey-voiced American ring announcer boomed out their details. The bill included five bouts, featuring 10 boxers, whose abilities were not undersold. At the ringside sat the American promoters, managers, attorneys, wives, mistresses, girlfriends, sponsors and other assorted hangers-on. Among many bizarre moments during a long night which combined American and Chinese entrepreneurship in unlikely circumstances was the brief opening ceremony. Hardened veterans of the American fight game became misty-eyed at the playing of the US national anthem on the site where not many years ago mass rallies were held to denounce American imperialists and all their works. When American Leeonzer Barber retained his World Boxing Organisation (WBO) light-heavyweight crown over countrymen Mike Sedillo, it was probably the first time a world title fight had been staged on Chinese soil, certainly since the communist revolution in 1949, and perhaps for many years before. China's rulers banned boxing as cruel, exploitative and capitalist, but in 1986 the ban was lifted after the Chinese began to move back into the mainstream of international sport. Entering into the diplomatic spirit of the occasion the fighters - nine out of the 10 were Americans - said they had come on a mission of peace, never mind that inside the ring several exhibited murderous intent. Chinese media reporting revealed a certain lack of expertise. A reporter for the official New China news agency described as a 'demonstration' the first bout between a hulking Kevin Ford and a puny, by comparison, Keith McMurray. This is likely to have been news to a battered McMurray who was sent crashing to the canvas several times. The Chinese promoters made little secret of their motives for staging the 'Brawl at the Wall': 'Of course, we see this as part of our campaign to stage the Olympics,' said one official.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to new information on the attack on the  Lebanese Consulate in Australia, unidentified persons threw  gasoline and set fires around the consulate and at the entrance  of the building. Australian firemen managed to extinguish the  fire before it reached the inside of the building. Only the  garage and the consul's car were damaged.    Diplomatic sources in Sidney said the consul had refused to  sign forged documents which two fugitive suspects in the al-Zuq  Church bombing and assassination of engineer Dany Sham'un, Tony  'Ubayd and Jean Shahin tried to obtain.    The investigation links the fire to the indictment in  connection with the two cases.</p>

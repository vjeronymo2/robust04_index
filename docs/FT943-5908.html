			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cairn falls 35% as oil price dips Low oil prices hit Cairn Energy, the Edinburgh-based oil and gas explorer which yesterday announced a 35 per cent drop in interim net attributable profits to Pounds 415,000, compared with Pounds 641,000. A 19 per cent decline in the average price of oil per barrel to Dollars 13.54 offset the benefits of a rise in production. Turnover increased by 2 per cent to Pounds 8.4m, while production rose by 370 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 4,936. The results included a three-month contribution from the on-shore assets acquired from Kelt Energy for Pounds 6.7m. Earnings were 0.64p (1.21p) and there is no dividend. It is proposed to dispose of a further stake in Cairn Energy USA, the US subsidiary, to raise a net Pounds 17.5m. The UK group has over the last year been steadily selling shares in the US company to raise funds for exploration and to reduce debt. Including the proposed disposal, the group will have raised Pounds 33m from the share sales and issues since June 1993. Cairn is proposing to sell 3.7m shares in CEUSA, reducing its holding from 54 per cent to 17.9 per cent. The resulting stake would be worth some Pounds 15m. Mr Bill Gammell, chief executive, said the group intended to use the proceeds of the sale to increase its production and reserve base outside the US.</p>

Workers analyzed the problems of a lack of equipment and  spare parts and the immediate possibilities for expanding  achievements the industry has made. Sugar Industry Minister  Nelson Torres reiterated the need to find immediate solutions in  a spirit of cooperation so as to overcome resource shortages.    Eugenio Maynegra, head of the Department of Science and  Technology of the Central Committee [of the Communist Party of  Cuba], said the goal is to improve in the energy area. To that  end, work is already being done to install vacuum pumps and to  cool turbogenerators and evaporators.    The exhibit highlighted the difficulties and problems being  faced by this sector in agriculture, transportation, the sugar  industry, the by-products industry, construction and assembly,  and self-sufficiency, for example.    A new period of great challenges is beginning for Minaz  workers, from the base-level worker to the highest  administrator, in each of its organizations.</p>

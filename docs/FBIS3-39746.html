			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Friedrich Bohl, minister in the </F> FRG Chancellor's Office, by Hans-Joachim Wiese in Hamburg --  live]    [Text] [Wiese] Good morning.    [Bohl] Good morning.    [Wiese] How does the FRG Government assess the fact that the  NATO ultimatum has expired without the threatened air strikes  having been necessary?    [Bohl] Well, the situation is that NATO and the United  Nations are making it clear after all that air strikes are not  required now and this development is very positive. I think it  is always good if war-like and military conflicts or strikes are  not necessary. In this respect, it is certainly a good  development.    [Wiese] International deliberations on a new peace  initiative for Bosnia are to be held in Bonn tomorrow.  Chancellor Kohl is said to have suggested these talks in a  telephone conversation with Russian President Yeltsin. Is this  correct?    [Bohl] Well, over the past few days the chancellor had many  telephone conversations, particularly with the U.S. President  and the Russian president. I think one can say the chancellor  has done his decisive share in the fact that we will now have an  apparently good round of high-standard talks in the diplomatic  sector. I think that major credit for the present development  goes to the chancellor.    [Wiese] What will be the contents of these talks, Mr. Bohl?  Can you give any details?    [Bohl] No. I neither can nor want to do this. The FRG  foreign minister already made relevant statements yesterday  evening. Nothing more can be said at the moment. It would also  be inappropriate to do this now. I ask you to understand this.  However, as I have said, I hope that we now have a positive  basic tendency and we will make progress now.    [Wiese] You referred to FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.  He also called for a solution for the Bosnian areas that are  still contested, for example, Bihac and Tuzla. Is another NATO  ultimatum conceivable for these areas?    [Bohl] I really ask you to understand that I do not want to  comment on this. I do not want to make any statement that goes  beyond what the foreign minister has already said.    [Wiese] How does the Federal Government assess the role of  Russia in connection with the NATO ultimatum?    [Bohl] Well, I think it has already been expressed in my  response to your question regarding the decisive progress in  this respect made by the chancellor, the U.S. President, and the  Russian president and mention of the fact that Russia has  certainly made a decisive contribution to the present  development. Altogether I think it has to be very positively  assessed that all those who are responsible are making great  efforts to prevent the further escalation of this conflict and  to achieve a tendency toward peace. I think it is important  that the Balkans not become a powder keg, that all responsible  persons are making efforts to prevent this -- apparently with  success -- and to achieve a peaceful development in the Balkans,  which will probably be unstable for many years.    [Wiese] However, Mr. Bohl, rather threatening voices were  still heard from Moscow yesterday. For example, Churkin,  Russian envoy to the Balkans, urgently warned NATO against going  ahead with its threat. Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said he  is not at all interested in the ultimatum. Are these arguments  to achieve a strong position or what does that mean?    [Bohl] Well, I do not want to comment on that. For me, the  result counts. I want to continue to evaluate it as has already  been done.    [Wiese] My last question: What are the Federal Government's  ideas of the next steps in and around Sarajevo? In other words,  what do you think of the proposal to place Sarajevo under UN  control?    [Bohl] We want to leave that for the further talks.    [Wiese] Thank you for this interview.</p>

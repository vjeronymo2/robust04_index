			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE STRUGGLES BUT STOPS FINNISH NATIONAL TEAM  </P> <P> UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan was hoping to see an improving Anteater  basketball club on the court in the team's second exhibition game.  </P> <P> A victory seemed to be a given. After all, the Finnish national team that  Irvine met Monday night in the Bren Center had lost to Chapman College by 31  points Saturday.  </P> <P> But instead of revving its running game in preparation for the season opener  against UCLA in less than to weeks, Irvine struggled to a 101-90 victory,  trailing briefly in the first half and playing to a halftime tie.  </P> <P> "I wasn't concerned with playing the Finns as much as I was with how much we  had improved," Mulligan said. "We haven't."  </P> <P> Irvine, coming off a 5-23 season that was the worst in school history, didn't  lead by double digits in the second half until 6 minutes 9 seconds remained,  when Ricky Butler's layup off a pass from Gerald McDonald gave the Anteaters an  11-point lead.  </P> <P> And Mulligan knew, it might have been worse.  </P> <P> "If the Finns hadn't gotten into foul trouble, they might have won," he said.  </P> <P> Four Finnish players fouled out.  </P> <P> Butler, Irvine's senior center, led the Anteaters with 32 points, 27 of them in  the second half. Butler made 14 of 20 shots and also had 14 rebounds.  </P> <P> "Aside from Butler, I can't think of anyone else who played well," Mulligan  said.  </P> <P> In their first exhibition game, a 127-122 loss to High Five America, the  Anteaters struggled with turnovers and poor free-throw shooting.  </P> <P> Irvine committed 19 turnovers Monday, down from 29 in the first exhibition  game.  </P> <P> But the Anteaters still struggled at the line, making only 26 of 42 free throws  (62%), compared to 53% in the first exhibition.  </P> <P> But perhaps most disappointing to Mulligan was the team's fast break, which he  has hoped will be its trademark. A busy fall schedule of conditioning and  early-morning workouts didn't seem to have yielded much Monday.  </P> <P> "I was disappointed in our break, and our lack of conditioning, which I can't  believe," Mulligan said.  </P> <P> Jeff Von Lutzow, a sophomore forward, added 15 points for Irvine, and sophomore  guard Dylan Rigdon, who made only three of 11 shots, added 13.  </P> <P> Gordon Herbert scored 16 points for the Finnish team, leading five players in  double figures.  </P></p>

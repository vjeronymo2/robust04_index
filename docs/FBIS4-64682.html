			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "People's Party For Freedom and </F> Democracy Demands Cabinet Seats After Big Election Gains"]    [Text] The VVD [People's Party For Freedom and Democracy]  is demanding a role in government after its big gain in seats on  Tuesday [3 May] evening, but its leading candidate Bolkestein  personally would prefer to continue to lead the parliamentary  party. Bolkestein rejected a role in the opposition. "We are a  party of government," he said.    "The VVD was not set up to be in opposition," the VVD's  leading candidate said in a nearly euphoric mood at the party  meeting in Aalsmeer. "We are out to govern."    Like other prominent party members, he did not say which  coalition he would prefer. But like MP Erica Terpstra, second  candidate on the list, the VVD leader attacked the PvdA [Labor  Party] and was mild toward D66 [Democrats 66], which in his view  had "performed terrifically" in doubling its number of seats.    MP Dijkstal, the third candidate on the list, said the most  eye- catching results were those of the CDA [Christian  Democratic Appeal] and the PvdA, the coalition parties. "It is  completely clear that another cabinet must be formed and we will  talk about that from tomorrow onwards," he said.    Terpstra regarded the chance of a "purple" coalition  [consisting of the VVD, the PvdA, and the D66] as "not probable"  because the PvdA was directly opposed to the VVD in the field of  social security. Bolkestein emphasized that [PvdA] Kok would  have to reorientate in that field. He called the position of  the PvdA leader "eccentric, peculiar."    Bolkestein said that after yesterday evening's election  results, it was in no way certain "that the biggest party would  also provide the prime minister." "The prime ministership  cannot be claimed," he said. In the formation process, Kok and  Brinkman would certainly have to "moderate their tone," the  VVD's leading candidate said. "The time of the big power blocks  in politics is past."    The VVD achieved its second-best election result in the  history of the party. "Who would have dared think a year ago  that the difference with the CDA would only be four seats?"  Bolkestein said.    "The VVD could thank its success to a clear program, in his  view. For the VVD, more than other parties, it was about  policies," he said at the meeting in Aalsmeer.    After the seats had been divided out, Bolkestein's initial  analysis was that the present coalition of the CDA and the PvdA  had "received an incredible beating from the electorate." From  this it followed that "the Netherlands wants another cabinet  with different policies."    He rigorously rejected speculation that the VVD would prefer  a strong role in the opposition to a small place in government.  His party was certainly seeking to participate in government.  "The electorate expects a cabinet where something will change,"  he said. "That is a cabinet including the VVD."    He was angered by suggestions that the CDA and the PvdA  could  continue to govern with the addition of the senior citizens'  parties, for example. "It would be unprecedented if a coalition  which suffers such big losses is put in a position to continue  its policies," he said.    At first, Bolkestein was silent when asked about his own  specific political future. However, after some seconds passed  in the momentarily silent room, he repeated what he had already  said before the elections: Even after yesterday evening's  strong gain in seats, Bolkestein will continue to prefer leading  his parliamentary party.</p>

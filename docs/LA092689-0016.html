			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET CIVIL WAR  </P> <P> In response to "Yeltsin Sees Discontent but No Soviet Coup," Part I, Sept. 11:  </P> <P> Lately, I have been reading that, because of the general economic  dissatisfaction in the Soviet Union, there is a possibility of a civil war. The  recently visiting (Communist Party populist) Boris Yeltsin tackled this rumor  by indicating that the war scare was simply a "scarecrow" created for the  purpose of frightening the republics' citizens concerned about "growing"  nationalism.  </P> <P> It is difficult to conceive of a "civil" war in the Soviet Union. Unlike the  United States, the individual republics are not analogous to our individual  states. The only way one can have a civil war is within each individual  republic. Westerners cannot seem to grasp that the term "Soviet Union" simply  indicates the political manner in which these 15 republics, along with Russia,  are held. The word "soviet" means council. According to the constitution, every  republic is a separate entity with representatives to the supreme council.  </P> <P> Has anyone else noticed that, every time the Russian-dominated empire loosens  its grip on the rest of the republics, the first thing we notice is that  nationalism raises its head? What does that tell us?  </P> <P> PAUL V. PLEMIANNIKOFF  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

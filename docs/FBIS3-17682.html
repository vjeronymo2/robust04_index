At dawn Azeri armored forces backed by combat planes and  helicopters launched an offensive along the entire eastern  frontline.    "Thanks to skillful and efficient actions by Karabakh forces  all the Azeri attacks were countered by 9 a.m. the enemy  suffered great losses, especially in combat vehicles", the press  service reported.    A spokesman for the press service claimed over 10 armored  vehicles were destroyed, among them six T-72 tanks and three  armored infantry vehicles. Losses in personnel on the Azeri  side exceed 150 persons. On the Karabakh side losses were  minimal: one man was killed and 14 were wounded. In the  afternoon the Azeri forces were thrown back to their initial  positions. Hostilities in that section stopped.    Noteworthy changes were not reported from other sections on  Monday.</p>

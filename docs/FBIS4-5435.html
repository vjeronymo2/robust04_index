			<p>BFN     [Text] Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon received Feng  Zhicheng, managing director of the China International Trade  Center; Li Hetian; and Zhang Liexiong at the Landmark Hotel on  Sukhumwit Road yesterday morning. The three Chinese officials  are in Bangkok to attend an Asia-Pacific meeting. During the  talks, the two sides exchanged views on efforts to strengthen  friendly cooperation between Thailand and China and to expand  bilateral trade relations.    Commerce Minister Uthai said that during his recent visit to  China, he was very happy to see the great progress made during  the past 10 years. This was his third visit to China since he  paid his first visit 10 year ago. He said that China has made  rapid progress and achieved fast economic development and that  Thailand and China should expand direct economic and trade  cooperation.    Uthai said that China is a big market. Currently, China  imports Thai fruits through Hong Kong. But communications are  easier now and there are direct flights between the two  countries. Thai mangos, durians, papayas, and pomelos can be  exported to China through direct air links.    Uthai said that he will attend an international trade  meeting  in Mexico in a few days and will meet Wu Yi, Chinese minister of  foreign trade and economic cooperation, to discuss ways to  strengthen bilateral trade.    Feng Zhicheng said that he would convey Uthai's message to  the Chinese minister when he returns home.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yo Yun-chae, alias name for leader of the </F> Socialist Workers Alliance, by unidentified reporter in Seoul,  date not given; first paragraph is the editor's note]    [Text] The Sanomaeng [Socialist Workers Alliance, pro-DPRK,  anti-government in Seoul] had planned to conduct a separate  socialist rally with the other socialistic political  organizations while the laborers' rally was going on at the  Hyochang sports arena on 30 October, but issued a joint  statement only because there was not enough time. This  interview was possible because the SISA JOURNAL made a  counteroffer to the Sanomaeng when it requested us to report the  movement for the legalization of the Sanomaeng taking the  opportunity of this rally. The SISA JOURNAL planned this  article to contribute to the public interest by reporting as  accurately as possible the intention and the development of the  Sanomaeng.    It took exactly five hours to meet him at a restaurant in  Yongdungpo. He insisted that it was a necessary process in  order to avoid the eyes of intelligence agencies that might  chase them. They call it "sterilization." A member of  Sanomaeng was with the reporting team all the time, but he did  not know when the sterilization would end.    We changed taxis four times. I suspect that the other member  of the Sanomaeng checked our moves somewhere near the assigned  place. The sterilization that started in Kwangwhamum at 1400 on  9 November finally ended at Yongdungpo after passing the  Tongyodong intersection, Kungmin Daily News building, and  Kungmin Bank building, Kongdokdong. It was 1830. Another 30  minutes had passed when a man showed up and introduced the  Sanomaeng. This is how a reporter of the bourgeois news media  (Pak No Hae once called SISA JOURNAL this in a magazine) and a  socialist met. He has a much more polished outstanding  appearance than I expected. His name was Yo Yun-chae, but it  was an alias. He answered questions with the logic of a leader  befitting a political organization classified as an antinational  organization by the security agencies. He allowed taking  pictures as long as his face did not show.    [Reporter] Who are you?    [Yo Yun-chae] Because of the National Security Planning  Agency [NSP] has not figured me out, it is not good to expose  myself entirely. If my identity is known, my activities will be  limited. All I can say (about myself) is that I entered Seoul  National University and studied there from the end of the 1970's  to the early 1980's and I planned to put all my efforts into the  farmers movement, but I decided to devote myself to the  Sanomaeng due to the change of environment.    [Reporter] Can you represent the Sanomaeng?    [Yo] I am a central committee member and chief of policy  making of the Sanomaeng. Now, our organization is run by the  collective leadership. We had our interim discussion before I  came. Accordingly, my words reflect the thought of the central  committee members and, I think, I can represent the Sanomaeng.    [Reporter] How many central committee members are there?    [Yo] I can say there are fewer than ten.    [Reporter] It is known that the Sanomaeng was in fact  dissolved after Pak No-hae and Paek Tak-wung were arrested. At  this moment, how much has the Sanomaeng restored the  organization?    [Yo] Naturally, there was a time when, in fact, the  organization did not work after the two `accidents' (he  expressed it this way). Those were critical blows. However, we  put much effort into restoring the organization ever since, and  now full members of our organization have reached 90% of  the  number of members in the past. But we lost supporters and  collaborators. The restoration of the organization was  accomplished within two months after the accidents. The  question is whether or not we can secure political leadership.  In the past, we judged power according to who could mobilize  more people in mass rallies, but now times have changed. At  this moment, the local organizations are located in Honam  Province, Central area, and Yongnam Province.    [Reporter] Socialism has collapsed internationally, and the  influence of the opposition groups has diminished within the  country. Do you believe that socialism can indeed be carried  out in South Korea?    [Yo] The collapse of socialism was the most difficult  experience for us. The Sanomaeng has carried out a critical  examination of socialist ideology ever since. After all, it was  the problem of a country. Marx regarded communism as the  extinction of countries through the extinction of classes, but  Stalinistic socialism, on the contrary, pursued the  reinforcement of a country. That was Leninism that Lenin did  not like. We insist on socialism that restores the communistic  point of view. In the future, the Sanomaeng will have its basis  in the mass movement and will realize socialism through fair  competition in the capitalistic society. Despite the merits of  capitalism, there are some people who feel that `this is not  it.' This is the reason for us to transform our organization  from the centralized pyramid style of the past to the  network-style organization that connects positions in all  fields. With this renovation of the Sanomaeng and under  conditions of fair competition, I am confident of victory in the  election.    [Reporter] The Sanomaeng was rather evaluated as a political  organization that does not have a power base among the people.  There is also a criticism that they are `socialists inside the  flags'...    [Yo] I accept that. The Sanomaeng approached the people not  by taking root in organizations among the people but by  depending heavily on some `stars' and the method of distinct  propaganda and instigation. We were accustomed to barricading  and confronting enemy face to face. But we will use tactics of  positions from now on. We will penetrate into movements in all  fields such as labor, students, citizen, and religious  movements. Recently, the labor movement in the Ulsan region  lends optimism. The Sanomaeng will not be a far away  organization but will be a trustworthy organization. The most  important point is the connection of all positions by political  leaderships. After hardening the power base like this, we will  make a socialist workers' party.    [Reporter] Recently, Pak No-hae called the Sanomaeng `my  illigitimate child' in an interview from prison with a magazine.  What is your opinion about that?    [Yo] It is true that there are many stories about comrade  Pak. But he is not free. He is serving a life sentence in  prison. I have heard about his agonies through the news media,  but I think it is a process for him to grope along the way of  human liberation under the changed circumstances. It will be  more clear when he, who is still a central committee member of  the Sanomaeng, is set free and becomes a free man.    [Reporter] When will you form a party? Is it possible?    [Yo] We believe the time will be either the end of 1994 or  the beginning of 1995. The Sanomaeng should be legalized before  we start the party. Because we have been under concentrated  attack by investigation agencies, we have maneuvered via both  legal and illegal tactics (it is called simultaneous  construction theory in their terms). But we will launch  struggles for legalizing the Sanomaeng directly from now on. We  plan to start full-scale open activities in the near future.  Even though it is not known to the public, socialist power is  building within the labor movement now. Labor union movements  in South Korea have not yet conducted a political campaign. If  labor unions can conduct a political campaign, they will rise to  become a socialist power. We are building a party that is based  on the solidarity of socialistic powers and labor unions. At  the same time, the People's Political Union (Professor Oh Se  Chol of Yonsei University is the head) openly proclaims that  socialism is active. Many people, including some former members  of the Sanomaeng released from prison, are involved in this  organization.    [Reporter] If so, is the People's Politic Union a legal  political organization that the Sanomaeng launched in advance?    [Yo] Absolutely not. We will just maintain a close  relationship because we have same direction.    [Reporter] Funding will be needed to wage a full-scale  struggle for legalization. How can you provide that?    [Yo] It is run with the help of some patrons around us and  membership fees from employed comrades. Sometimes we collect  several 10 million won by holding a supply drive when we plan a  big event. However, that is not enough. After all, forming a  political party is costly, isn't it? It is yet in the planning  stage, but we plan to run businesses by making the most of our  members. We concentrated on running seminars for mental  arithmetic in the past, but we will concentrate on manufacturing  businesses this time. Then, we can build the fund consistently.    [Reporter] Are there any plans for legalizing the Sanomaeng?    [Yo] The election for the local government system in 1995  will be an important opportunity in our socialism movement let  alone this administration. I think that the Kim Yong-sam  administration will build the base for two-stage political  reform by the revised election law. The socialist movement will  be the first political challenge since the civilian government  took office. What happens now will form the foundation of the  Sanomaeng's future. We plan to ally with the progressive power  and suggest `a combined meeting of labor unions and progressive  organizations for the innovative local government system' and to  respond with all our efforts.    [Reporter] What relationship do you have with the other  socialist political factions? Do you want only the Sanomaeng  legalized?    [Yo] For example, `international socialists', `short-term  laborers' alliance', and `revolutionary socialist laborers'  exist already as a socialist power. The government firmly  defines these groups as illegal organizations. Eventually, the  struggle for legalizing the Sanomaeng will achieve the freedom  of ideology. We have to work together. South Korea is the only  country that does not allow the socialists power on earth.  These moves such as the revision of the National Security Plan  law and the repeal of the National Security Law are optimistic  signs.    [Reporter] Isn't it in vain if the government does not  recognize it?    [Yo] If the government does not recognize us, we cannot  legalize it with our power only. We plan to negotiate with them  on the legalization. We can do it by responding according to  the situation.</p>

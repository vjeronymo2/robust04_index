			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] New Delhi April 28 TASS -- "Prospects for  Russo-Indian cooperation in military aviation are unlimited,"  Rostislav Belyakov, designer-general of the Mikoyan Design  Bureau, told ITAR-TASS on Thursday. He attended a session of  the Russo-Indian commission on aviation among a  widely-representative delegation of the Russian aircraft  industry and a number of leading design bureaus.    "A specific example of such cooperation has been provided by  the initialing of an agreement in Delhi on the establishment of  a joint venture for the maintenance of MiG aircraft that are in  service with the Indian Air Force and for the manufacture of  spare parts for them," Belyakov said.    "Along with our design bureau, the agreement was initialed  by  representatives from the `Moscow Aircraft Industry Amalgametion'  and the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) company.    "The realisation of the agreement will began immediately  after it is approved by the governments of the two countries.  This is expected to be done during the forthcoming visit of  Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to Moscow in summer,"  Belyakov said.    The two sides discussed the technical aspects modernising  MiG-21- Bis aircraft, which are to be fitted out with Russian-,  Indian- and Western-made equipment, at HAL enterprises. The  aircraft will be provided with new weapons and systems to  control them and on-board instrumentation. This will increase  the aircraft's combat potential several-fold, including its  target spotting capability, Belyakov said.    Touching upon prospects for the purchase of an additional  batch of Russian aircraft by India, Belyakov said it showed  interest in buying ten MiG-29 aircraft. The Russian delegation  officially offered a MiG-at training aircraft which the Air  Force of the republic acutely needs, and suggested that the  Indian side not only purchase these aircraft, which by their  performance excel the British Hawk and the French Alpha jet  aircraft which compete for the local market, but also co-develop  and produce them.</p>

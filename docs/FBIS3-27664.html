			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Huanli (1728 3562 0448)] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- Chinese State Council  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji met Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa and other  officials of the Federation of Economic Organizations  (Keidanren) of Japan at the Shin Otani Hotel in Tokyo this  evening, and accepted an invitation to attend a banquet hosted  in his honor by the Keidanren.    Zhu Rongji spoke highly of the precious contribution made by  friends of the Keidanren over a long time to the development of  Sino-Japanese trade and economic cooperation, and gave a  briefing on the current state of China's reform at the request  of people in Japan's economic circles. He said: This year is a  crucial one for China's economic reform. Many important reform  measures were introduced at the beginning of this year. These  reform measures were drawn up on the basis of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. They have been implemented for more than 50  days and are making relatively smooth progress. This further  strengthens our resolve to promote reform. In the process of  drawing up reform bills, we used the experience of developed  countries, including Japan, in economic development.    Keidanren officials, including Hiraiwa, said: Japan is very  interested in China's economic development. The Keidanren set  up its China Committee in May last year to promote the  development of Japanese-Chinese economic relations.    Senior personnel in the entourage, including He Chunlin,  deputy secretary general of the State Council General Office,  were present at the meeting and were invited to attend the  banquet in the evening.    Zhu Rongji also met Chairman Kosaku Inaba of the Japan  Chamber of Commerce and Industry [JCCI] at the Shin Otani Hotel  this afternoon.    During the meeting, Zhu Rongji said: "The timing of my visit  to Japan is very good. This year is a crucial one for China's  economic reform. Japanese friends have been following with  interest the economic situation in China. One of the purposes  of my visit to Japan is to introduce China's domestic economic  situation. Markets and prices are now stable in China, and so  is the general mood of the people there."    Zhu Rongji said: "This year is also important for Japan.  The Japanese Government wants to take some important measures  to stimulate economic development. The timely exchange of views  between China and Japan is very necessary for the two countries  in improving mutual understanding and developing cooperation."    Inaba said that, when he visited China last year, Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji suggested that the JCCI organize a delegation  to visit China every year. Inaba said: The JCCI followed up  the suggestion. This year, it is preparing to organize a  delegation to visit cities in central and west China to conduct  survey.</p>

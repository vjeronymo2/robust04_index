			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Classic FM set to silence sceptics LATER this week Classic FM is expected to show that broadcasting 'the world's most beautiful music' has the makings of a beautiful little business. Rajar, the new joint radio industry research body, will announce on Friday its first findings and is expected to show that Classic, the UK's first national commercial station, has attracted more than 4m listeners a week. Classic said before its launch on September 7 that it would reach 2.8m listeners a week. In spite of the depth of the advertising recession, Classic has already either taken or booked revenues of about Pounds 3.5m in advertising and sponsorship - more than some people forecast it would earn in a year. In the early weeks the advertisments came mainly from the music industry. Now they have broadened to include financial services, travel and cars - reflecting the fact that 60 per cent of the station's audience comes from the ABC1 marketing categories. Capital costs were Pounds 6.3m with running costs about Pounds 7m a year. Breakeven seems very likely next year and has not been totally ruled out this year. When Mr John Spearman, former chairman of advertising agency Collet Dickenson Pearce, sounded out friends in the media about whether he should accept an offer to run Classic FM, the advice was unanimous. He was told: 'Don't touch it with a barge pole.' The consensus was that a commercial radio station devoted to classical music could not possibly work in the UK and might never get on air. The apparent size of the challenge, combined with the commitment of shareholders such as Time Warner, the world's largest media group, Associated Newspapers, and GWR, the commercial radio group, persuaded Mr Spearman to become chief executive. Purists have sniffed at the occasional mispronunciation of a composer's name. But Mr Spearman is likely to have the last laugh. 'We are a serious national ABC1 medium. We will be quite difficult for advertisers to overlook,' he says.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Today's press commentaries address the objectives of  the ceaseless Israeli attacks on Lebanon, and Israeli officials'  threats to launch a large-scale aggression.    Under the headline "The Future of the Peace Process," the  newspaper TISHRIN says: The peace process has become a target  for Israeli officials, who were compelled to attend the Madrid  conference in the first place, thwarted the Washington talks,  disavowed the essence of the U.S. peace initiative, and made a  deliberate effort to scuttle U.S. efforts.    The paper adds: Judging by Israeli acts, one can safely say  that Israel's acts run counter to the principles and objectives  of the peace process. For, the shelling and bombardment of  villages and towns in southern Lebanon, the displacement of  Lebanese civilians, the destruction of their property, and the  killing of innocent people in premeditated barbarous air raids  have become the order of the day for Israeli officials. As for  their political discourse on peace, it is merely deceptive talk  designed to delude the world public. For, the peace talks have  not registered the slightest progress on the Syrian and Lebanese  tracks. As for the Gaza-Jericho accord, it has pushed the  opportunities for peace further away, and dealt a painful blow  to the efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the  Middle East.    TISHRIN urges the international community, headed by the  United States, to intervene to put an end to Israeli aggression,  which is targeting Lebanon, just as much as it is targeting the  U.S. initiative and the peace process.    The paper wonders: Has not the region been pushed further  away from the desired just and comprehensive peace? Why has  United States failed to push the peace process in the right  direction, given that it has committed itself to play the role  of a full partner and honest broker?    TISHRIN concludes by saying: The failure of the  international community to put the necessary pressure on Israeli  leaders to make them comply with its resolutions and principles  has encouraged them to perpetrate further massacres and crimes,  and to demonstrate total disregard for the peace process and  international legitimacy, as well.    The newspaper AL-THAWRAH addresses the same issue, saying:  Given the serious Israeli escalation of the military situation  in southern Lebanon, the international community must have  become fully convinced that the Rabin government holds the peace  process in contempt. For judging by its words and deeds, one  reaches the conclusion that this government seeks to frustrate  the hopes for a just and comprehensive solution in the Middle  East, and to create further obstacles and difficulties that can  only exacerbate the situation and render it more precarious.    AL-THAWRAH adds: The Israeli military buildup in southern  Lebanon, as well as the constant Israeli attacks there make it  impossible for observers to identify any single Israeli positive  step. This is certainly not an indication of an Israeli desire  to achieve peace in the full sense of the word.    Concluding its commentary, the paper says: The Tel Aviv  government must understand that the party that is seeking peace  cannot work to stoke fires in southern Lebanon, nor can it  resort to military power and arrogance to force its dictates and  conditions on others. Nor can it, for that matter, flaunt its  defiance of the relevant international resolutions, and the  principles cherished by the international community. For peace  has its own well-known components and requirements. Once the  Rabin government declares its commitment to these components and  requirements, and renounces its policy of provocation and  aggression, then, and only then can there be talk of just and  comprehensive peace. But, given the current state of affairs,  one can say that Israel is as far as it can ever be from peace.  Worse still, nobody can trust the sincerity of its peace claims.    For its part, the newspaper AL-BA'TH comments on the same  issue, reiterating that the continuous Israeli attacks on  Lebanon are indicative of Israel's aggressive character, and  also of its disregard for regional security and peace, and the  entire world community as well.    The paper believes that this Israeli policy has been  supported by the position of the international community,  represented by the United Nations and the UN Security Council in  particular. This is because Israel is the only party in the  world that escapes punishment whenever it perpetrates  aggressions against the Arabs, kills innocent civilians, and  destroys their houses.    In this regard, the paper notes the massacre Israel  perpetrated on Thursday [9 June], which resulted in the death of  scores of Lebanese civilians. Israel has persisted with its  aggression and massive military buildup on Lebanese territory,  the paper adds.    The paper wonders: Will Israeli acts lead to just and  comprehensive peace in the region?    The paper explains that had Israel been actually seeking  peace, it would have, at least, declared a commitment to the  terms of reference of the peace process; that is, it would have  expressed a willingness to implement the relevant international  resolutions, which provide for complete and full withdrawal from  the occupied Arab territories. Nonetheless, what we, along with  the entire world community, have seen is Israel doing its best  to keep the region away from true peace.    The paper concludes by saying: The requirements, components,  and obligations of just and comprehensive peace are too clear to  be obscured. They have been recognized and identified by the  entire international community. He who wants to see the region  enjoying security, stability, and peace must, first and  foremost, make a total commitment to implementing the relevant  international resolutions. As for the policy of aggression and  threats, it will only create further tension, and consequently  kill the last opportunity for saving the peace process.</p>

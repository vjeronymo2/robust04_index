			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following the publication of the final nutrition labeling regulations, trade associations representing both manufacturers and retailers asked FSIS to make an exception for ground beef and hamburger to allow the use of `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  percent lean'' on package labels. They contend that a lean descriptor standard, such as ``ground beef, not less than (X)% lean,'' has been in use for 20 years and became a legal requirement in some States. Industry believes that such labeling assists consumers in selecting leaner versions of these products and provides industry with incentives to market products lower in fat than the 30 percent permitted under 9 CFR 319.15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western States Meat Association, Oakland, CA, submitted a petition to FSIS, dated October 15, 1993, to permit the use of a `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  percent lean''/`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  percent fat'' statement following the product name for ground beef and hamburger. The petitioner states that, for many years, consumers have been receiving truthful and useful information from the `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  percent lean''/`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  percent fat'' labeling. The petitioner argues that the statement is widely used by both wholesalers and retailers in the marketplace and the final nutrition labeling regulations will take this information away. Additionally, the petitioner states that this information will accomplish the objective of the new nutrition labeling rules of bringing more meaningful and more useful information to consumers. The petitioner urges FSIS to amend the nutrient content claims provision of the nutrition labeling regulations (9 CFR 317.362(c)) to provide for the use of the statement `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  percent lean''/`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  percent fat'' following the product name for ground beef and hamburger.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS has reviewed the information provided by the petitioner and the comments received, and has determined that, with the preclusion of ground beef and hamburger from the use of the terms ``lean,'' ``extra lean,'' and `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  percent lean,'' these products should be labeled to permit consumers to readily identify and differentiate between the varying lean to fat ratios in such products. Identification of fat content by means of percentage labeling of lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger would allow consumers to recognize products at the retail level that are now frequently marketed with terms such as ``regular,'' ``lean,'' and ``extra lean,'' or with lean percentages. Allowing such labeling would also assist consumers in selecting leaner versions of these products and provide incentives for manufacturers to market products lower in fat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS also recognizes that the practice of labeling ground beef and hamburger with lean percentages has been in use since 1973, following the development of the Uniform Retail Meat Identity Standards by representatives from the meat industry, the Council of Better Business Bureau, the White House Office of Consumer Affairs, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The standards recommend that nomenclature and specifications for retail ground beef be decided by the lean-to-fat content and shown on the label as ``ground beef, not less than (X)% lean.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These standards for retail ground beef are available for public inspection in the office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, FSIS believes that a percentage lean and a percentage fat labeling statement on the product would be potentially misleading unless appropriate nutrition information for the product is available to the consumer. Requiring the percentage lean and percentage fat labeling statement to be accompanied by nutrition information would ensure that consumers do not misinterpret the percentage lean portion of the identifying statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FSIS is proposing to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations by permitting percentage labeling for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger. Such labeling may be used only when the product is accompanied by nutrition information which characterizes the nutrition profile of the product. Consistent with guidelines for voluntary nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw meat products, FSIS is proposing that this nutrition information may be presented on the labeling of the product or in the form of point-of-purchase materials, such as signs, notebooks or leaflets, in close proximity to the product and readily available to the consumer. Guidelines for point-of-purchase materials, as stated in 9 CFR 317.345 for supplying nutrition information in the absence of a nutrition claim, would apply to these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

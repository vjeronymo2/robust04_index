			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA: 1990'S QUOTES OF NOTE -- AND EVEN A FEW UNNOTABLES  </P> <P> People say a lot of things to reporters. Sometimes they even mean what they  say. Sometimes it just comes out wrong. And sometimes it comes out right, they  just didn't mean to say it.  </P> <P> But it came out anyway.  </P> <P> That's the joy of being a reporter. People say things to you, and you get to  write them down. People who say they are misquoted often simply forgot -- or  regretted -- what they said.  </P> <P> More often than not, the words reveal more than their surface meaning. There is  truth in them, although sometimes it's necessary to dig for it.  </P> <P> Often this column is about quotes, examining the things people say. Here are  some personal favorites from the past year:  </P> <P> * "Anchoring is a lot harder than it looks."  </P> <P>  -- KGTV (Channel 10) anchorman and commentator Herb Cawthorne  </P> <P> * "It looks like the news from the old 'Mary Tyler Moore Show.' I expect to see  Ted Baxter on the air and Murray pounding at the typewriter."  </P> <P>  -- An unnamed source describing the KUSI-TV (Channel 51) newscast.  </P> <P> * "I'm just glad I wasn't discriminated against because I'm white."  </P> <P>  -- KGTV (Channel 10) anchorman Stephen Clark, responding to questions about  racism on Channel 10's "Ask the Media."  </P> <P> * "Hands up those who thought that was a mealy-mouthed answer."  </P> <P>  -- ABC's Peter Jennings, responding to an answer by Channel 10 General Manager  Ed Quinn during "Ask the Media."  </P> <P> * "We think they are outstanding personalities, and they will fit well into a  talk-show format."  </P> <P>  -- Channel 8 vice president Bill Moylan, explaining the choice of Pat Brown  and Dave Hood to host an afternoon talk show, a few weeks before Hood was  dropped from the show. A few weeks later, the whole concept was scrapped.  </P> <P> * "Year after year, we get ripped a new one (over problem with the Emmy  Awards), but every year it's there."  </P> <P>  -- National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences board member Sue Strom,  defending the Emmy Awards.  </P> <P> * "It was a bunch of incredible stupidity on my part. Do I look embarrassed? I  feel like a 9-year-old sent to the principal."  </P> <P>  -- Channel 8 sports guy Ted Leitner, apologizing on the air for using  unauthorized video of a fight.  </P> <P> * "Considering that Ross is an unemployed news reader who made a name for  herself at another station, there can be only one explanation for Channel 10's  enthusiasm to portray her as a top San Diego celebrity -- they've decided to  hire her."  </P> <P>  -- Kevin Brass, L.A. Times, seven months before Ross was hired by Channel 39.  </P> <P> * "We decided our viewers didn't want to know where bad restaurants are."  </P> <P>  -- Channel 10 food critic Jack White, explaining why his reviews are almost  always positive.  </P> <P> * "Keep a low profile. Keep a check on your ego and smile a lot."  </P> <P>  -- Channel 8 anchorwoman Susan Roesgen, giving advice to new Channel 10  anchorman Stephen Clark.  </P> <P> * "The news you want from people you like."  </P> <P>  -- Channel 8's short-lived promotional slogan.  </P> <P> * "San Diego is the biggest little fishbowl in the world. There is not a  heckuva lot going on here for people to talk about."  </P> <P>  -- Former Channel 10 anchorman Michael Tuck, explaining why he has been the  focus of so much gossip.  </P> <P> * "I've always had heavy eyelids."  </P> <P>  -- Tuck, explaining why he had plastic surgery.  </P> <P> Former KSDO-AM (1130) talk host John Krist has landed a job with WERC in  Birmingham, Ala. He'll be the station's operations manager, as well as handling  a talk show. . . .  </P> <P> KSDO has signed Michael Reagan to a one-year contract extension. There are no  new provisions in the contract, "just more money," general manager Mike Shields  said. . . .  </P> <P> The addition of Allison Ross to Channel 39's news team has fueled speculation  about Denise Yamada's future. With Monica Gayle and Ross in the newsroom, the  station has an abundance of top-drawer women anchors. But station General  Manager Neil Derrough said Yamada is secure. "Allison is not going into the  (anchor) rotation," he said. "She'll be part of the 4:30, and that's it." The  station picked up a two-year option on Yamada's contract last summer. . . .  </P> <P> Buoyed by Congress' inability to reregulate the cable industry, Daniels  Cablevision, which serves coastal North County, is joining Cox Cable in raising  the cost of its basic "Cable Plus" service by $2, to $20.95 from $18.95. The  press release says it is still "the best entertainment bargain available at  only 70 cents a day for 24 hours of entertainment, news and sports." Well,  that's one way of looking at it. . . .  </P> <P> KPBS-TV (Channel 15) will rebroadcast "Ballad of an Unsung Hero" and "Trail  North," two excellent, locally produced programs depicting different  experiences of Latinos in America, beginning at 8 p.m. Thursday. Another  KPBS-produced program, "Uneasy Neighbors," will re-air as part of the new  "American Pie" series, at 10 p.m. Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Smaller shares hit the comeback trail - And a revival is certainly overdue HAS THE revival of the smaller company share arrived at last? The first quarter of 1993 certainly suggested so. The extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies index (excluding investment trusts) rose 15.2 per cent over the period (including dividends), compared with growth of just 4.6 per cent in the FT-A All-Share index. A revival is definitely overdue. The Hoare Govett index underperformed the All-Share for the four consecutive years from 1989 to 1992. Not only was this the first four-year period since 1955 in which this phenomenon occurred  -there had been no previous consecutive three-year period of small company underperformance. Over the period since 1955, Hoare Govett figures show that its smaller companies index has produced returns of 18 per cent a year, some 4 per cent ahead of the returns achieved by the All-Share. Why did smaller company shares perform so well? It is obviously easier for a small company to grow at 50 per cent a year than it is for, say, ICI. A second reason is that small company shares are less 'efficient' - in other words, researched less well than companies in the FT-SE 100. There is more scope for the shrewd fund manager to pick a winner. With these higher rewards come higher risks, however, as investors discovered between 1989 and 1992. 'Earnings' growth of smaller companies is greater but it is more volatile,' says Paul Woolley, of fund manager GMO Woolley. His figures show small company profits were hit particularly badly in recessions such as 1973-74, 1979-80 and 1990-92. The lack of diversity of smaller companies makes them more vulnerable to the problems of individual customers and market niches - and to the fortunes of the UK economy; thus, the latest recession hit them particularly hard. The illiquidity of their shares worsened the effect on prices. But the very factors which held smaller companies back should help them prosper in the recovery. Douglas Ferrans, of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, writes in the group's monthly investment review: 'Smaller companies should now enjoy growth in productivity, a widening of margins and superior growth in earnings.' Even if you accept these arguments, how much of the recovery is in the price? The FT-Small Cap index is trading at present on an historic price-earnings ratio of 31.25, far higher than the FT-SE 100 and pretty racy by any standards. According to Ferrans, though, if you exclude loss-makers and use the latest reported earnings' figures, the ratio falls to around 20. 'On our measure of valuation, small company shares are currently under-valued,' says Woolley, adding that this applies particularly to the relationship of price to assets. 'However, this under-valuation is not as stark as the over-valuation smaller companies reached in 1987.' There certainly does seem to be a change in the climate of opinion towards small companies. Hoare Govett is seizing the opportunity to launch a second investment trust linked to its extended index. The first trust, launched in December, raised Pounds 28.5m. The new trust will invest in more than 200 companies and, by aiming to match the index, will remove the danger of poor stock selection. The full prospectus is expected to appear in June. For most private investors, a collective fund probably is the best way of backing the small company revival (if they believe the argument). The best-performing investment trust in the sector over the past three and five years has been Foreign &amp; Colonial Smaller Companies; over 10 years, the leader is Moorgate. The average UK smaller companies unit trust has achieved a rise of just 16 per cent over the five years to May 1 (offer-to-bid with net income re-invested; source: Micropal). Returns range from the 92 per cent growth of Royal Life UK Emerging Companies to the 25.3 per cent decline of the Waverley Penny share. Trusts in the sector with above-average performance over one, three, five and 10 years are Edinburgh UK Smaller Companies, Lazard UK Smaller Companies Growth, and New Court Smaller UK Companies. Edinburgh's fund is also the best performer over both three and 10 years. There is also an indexed fund in the unit trust sector: James Capel's Trixie trust. But it has not done especially well to date; Micropal shows it as 48th of 66 in the sector over the year to May 1. Nigel Legge, of James Capel, says the recent rally has allowed active managers to outperform; however, he expects the fund to produce an above-average performance in the sector over the long term. There is an automatic tendency for private investors to prefer buying 'blue chips' because they know the names and products of the companies concerned. But the long-term performance of small company shares indicates that investors should not ignore the area altogether. After all, putting less than 10 per cent of your portfolio in the smallest 10 per cent of the market is actually betting against the small company sector.</p>

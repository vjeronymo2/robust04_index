			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Walesa prunes parties in poll President Lech Walesa yesterday called a general election for September 19, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. A day earlier, he had signed an election law which promises to cut the number of parties in the next parliament. The election will still be held under the proportional representation system which in 1991 introduced over 20 political groups into the last parliament. But those parties which fail to get 5 per cent of the national vote will not be represented.</p>

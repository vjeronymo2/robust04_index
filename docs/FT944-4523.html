			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Post-VAT vote of confidence The government, still reeling from its defeat over value added tax on domestic fuel, survived a confidence vote in the Commons yesterday. A key provision in the European Union finance bill was approved almost without challenge. Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, the paymaster general, confirmed it was a confidence issue, but there was none of the drama which marked the second reading of the bill, when eight Tory backbenchers were deprived of the Conservative whip for failing to back the government, reducing it to a minority adminis-tration. Mr Dennis Skinner, the leftwing Labour MP for Bolsover, failed to make Tory backbenchers troop through the government lobby over a vote on the EU's 'own resources'. His unusually muted opposition was not heard by Mr Michael Morris, chairman of the committee, who ruled that the clause had been approved without a division. A 52-minute speech by Mr Bill Cash, Tory MP for Stafford and a leading Eurosceptic, indicated that the committee stage of the bill was unlikely to be swift.</p>

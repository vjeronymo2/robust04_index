			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Societies criticised on women directors BUILDING societies were yesterday told by their regulatory body that their record on appointing women directors was among the worst in British industry, John Gapper writes. The 87 societies were told at their annual conference in Brighton that the Building Societies Commission had found that fewer than 3 per cent of directors and 'hardly any' senior executives were women. Mr Terry Matthews, a commissioner, told societies they were 'overlooking a great many talented and able people, particularly internally, who have a great deal to offer.' Mr Matthews said the cultural problem in the industry was illustrated by the experience of a woman director at a recent conference. During the coffee break male society executives assumed she was a waitress. The most prominent woman in the industry is Mrs Rosalind Gilmore, the chairman of the Building Societies Commission, who is due to address the conference today. Mr Matthews said he thought many societies were trying to recruit women directors. The commission was working on guidelines for corporate governance of societies similar to the Cadbury Code of practice for companies with shareholders. He suggested that the commission might try to restrict directors or senior executives from participating in share option schemes of their societies' subsidiaries.</p>

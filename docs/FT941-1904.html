			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Iceland ahead 18% to Pounds 65.2m - Buoyant result masks a growing focus on price in the marketplace Iceland, the frozen and chilled foods retailer, yesterday warned it was beginning to feel the pressures of an increasingly price sensitive environment, in spite of an 18 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 65.2m. Mr Malcolm Walker, the chairman and chief executive, said there was a growing focus on price in the marketplace. While Iceland was insulated from the worst effects of price cutting, by carrying a smaller proportion of the most vulnerable items such as bread and milk, 'we are not immune from the problem,' he said. Like-for-like sales in existing stores in the first few weeks of the year were running about 2 per cent lower, partly because of the effects of lower prices. This followed a sharp slowdown in comparable sales growth last year, from 7 per cent in the first half to 3 per cent in the second. However, Mr Walker said he was confident the group would advance this year. Gross margins had stabilised, and the Iceland outlets at Littlewoods were expected to contribute profits in 1995. Sales for the group as a whole were 14 per cent higher at Pounds 1.18bn for the 52 weeks to January 1. The period compared with 53 weeks in 1993. New Iceland stores contributed 8 points of the increase, with the Littlewoods outlets a further 4 points. Like-for-like sales were 5 per cent ahead, with nil inflation. The group opened a record 103 new stores, including 43 Littlewoods food halls. Mr Walker said Iceland planned to open a minimum of 50 stores this year. Higher capital expenditure of Pounds 110m, against Pounds 64m last time, helped to push up debt from Pounds 65m to Pounds 70m. Debt as a proportion of shareholders' funds fell from 40 per cent to 32 per cent. Iceland's foray into France, which has cost Pounds 4m so far, was disappointing. Mr Walker said Iceland would not invest any further and would decide by the end of the year whether to remain in France. An improved final dividend of 2.6p is proposed for a total 14 per cent higher at 3.8p. Earnings were 14 per cent ahead to 15.68p. COMMENT Many analysts have been left scratching their heads after this set of figures. Second half sales were much lower than expected and losses at Littlewoods and in France were also higher than forecasts. Yet profits were in line with expectations. Cost-cutting and improved buying power may explain some of the profits achievement, but many question whether this is sustainable. Iceland also appears to be struggling for comparable sales, which have fallen from growth of 10 per cent to a negative 2 per cent in less than 12 months. The bears have cut forecasts from Pounds 71m to a flat Pounds 65m. While the multiple of 11 appears attractively low, this is likely to reflect a degree of pessimism over the longer term.</p>

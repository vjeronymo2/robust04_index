The session called on the Chinese people of all  nationalities, led by the CPC and guided by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, to work with one heart and one mind; to  resolutely carry out reform; to rely on themselves; to  assiduously blaze a new path; and to strive to win new victories  in reform, opening up, and modernization construction.

Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing,  Hu  Jintao, and Rong Yiren were seated on the rostrum along with  members of the Presidium.    After the voting, the 2,721 deputies present adopted a  resolution approving the government work report. The resolution  notes that the report offers a factual summation of work over  the past year as well as puts forth positive and prudent tasks  for the coming year. The resolution also holds that in order to  smoothly fulfill the various tasks set forth by the current  session, people all over the country must carry out their work  in all fields under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the party's basic line; must comprehensively implement the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; and must  subordinate themselves to and serve the overall interests of  seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability, thereby seeing  to it that reform, development, and stability coordinate with  and promote each other.    After the voting, the deputies adopted a resolution on  implementing the 1993 national economic and social development  plan and the 1994 national economic and social development plan,  as well as a resolution on the implementation of the 1993 state  budget and 1994 state budget.    The "PRC Budget Law" proposed by the State Council, which  was  deliberated and amended during the current session, was approved  during the voting. The law consists of 11 chapters comprising  79 articles, including general principles, powers of budget  management, scope of budgetary revenues and expenditures,  drafting of budgets, examination and approval of budgets,  implementation of budgets, budgetary adjustments, final  accounts, supervision, legal responsibilities, and an appendix.

The session further approved the NPC Standing Committee's  work report and voted on a resolution on the report. The  resolution urges the NPC Standing Committee to continue  following the guidance of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; to take the  construction of socialist democracy and legal institutions as a  fundamental task; and to improve its role as a permanent body of  the organ of supreme state power.    The session also voted on resolutions on the work reports of  the Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate,  and decided to rename the NPC's Environmental Protection  Committee the Environmental and Resource Protection Committee.    Qiao Shi delivered a speech following the voting.    In his speech, Qiao Shi pointed out: During the session, the  deputies took account of the overall national interests as well  as the people's fundamental interests; conscientiously performed  their constitutionally vested functions; emancipated their  minds; sought truth from facts; spoke out freely; and discussed  state affairs, thus ensuring all resolutions and decisions  adopted by the session would fully reflect and convey the will  and wishes of people of all nationalities across the country.  The session fully demonstrated the great unity of the people of  all nationalities across the country, as well as their  confidence in certain victory in advancing reform and  development. The session was democratic, united, realistic,  pioneering, and progressive. It is bound to have a significant  impact on comprehensively advancing the socialist market  economy, socialist democracy, and socialist spiritual  civilization, all the while taking economic construction as the  central task.    Qiao Shi stated emphatically: We must carry out all fields  of work, while bearing the people's interests in mind, making  sure they will help liberate and develop the productive forces,  increase the country's overall strength, and improve the  standard of living. State organs and functionaries at all levels  should earnestly change their work styles, go into the thick of  life, conduct investigations and studies, listen to people's  views, and show concern for people's well-being. They should  never treat lightly matters of immediate concern to the people,  and should solve each and every one of those matters. We should  firmly oppose bureacraticism and boastfulness; guard against  formalism; avoid holding meetings and issuing documents that do  not solve problems; refuse to confine ourselves to issuing  general appeals; refrain from engaging in empty talk and  platitude; and avoid reporting only good news and not the bad.  More importantly, we should permit no lies. We should perform  our official duties honestly and diligently in order to serve  the people. We should work in a down-to-earth manner, immerse  ourselves in hard work, rely on the masses, and carry out our  work creatively.    Qiao Shi hoped the deputies would actively publicize and  implement the guidelines of the session, as well as the various  resolutions and decisions adopted by the session. He expressed  hope they would conscientiously perform their functions as NPC  deputies, set an example in abiding by the Constitution and the  law, and actively throw themselves into the great practice of  reform and construction.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zou Yuchuan (6760 3768 1557), director of the </F> State Land Administration Bureau: "Enliven Land  Property--Enlightenment Gained From the Comprehensive and  Coordinated Reforms of Beijing No 1 General Light Industry  Company"]    [Text] Under the guidance and with the support of  departments concerned, the Beijing No 1 General Light Industry  Company has carried out comprehensive and coordinated reforms  and made useful attempts to enliven state assets and large and  medium-sized enterprises. The core of the "No 1 Light Industry  type" activation created by them is to reform the old land-use  system, tap the tremendous potential in existing land assets,  and make use of different rents to accumulate a large fund for  activation. We can say that it is precisely by grasping this  "golden key" of land that the reforms have been smoothly  activated and carried out. This move has enabled people to  fully understand the position and role of the reform of the  land-use system in the entire reform of the economic structure  and in economic development, and thus has opened up a new path  for deepening the reforms and for faster development of the  national economy and opening wider to the outside world.    The successful experience of the Beijing No 1 General Light  Industry Company has at least enlightened us in two things  concerning the land-use system.    The first thing is: Reform of the land-use system can  effectively promote the transformation of large and medium-sized  state enterprises. There have been many causes why large and  medium-sized state enterprises have not been enlivened over a  long period, but the main one is a shortage of funds. For a  long time, state enterprises have had an excessive burden and  have suffered losses in operation. They have been unable to  provide funds for readjustment and transformation of the product  mix and production setup. This has given rise to a vicious  circle. Besides, quite a lot of state enterprises are located  in golden areas of cities. Following deepening of reform of the  land-use system, their land assets have attracted the attention  of more and more people. The practice of the No 1 General Light  Industry Company has widened the train of thought on making use  of the "differential rent" of land to transform old enterprises.  That is: They have pushed toward the market according to law  land-use rights originally given them by the administration so  that benefits obtained from land assets are revealed, and this  has enabled enterprises to obtain valuable funds for activation  and has provided motivation for further transformation of large  and medium-sized state enterprises.    The second thing is: The experience of the No 1 General  Light Industry Company has provided an effective way to deepen  the reform of the system of allocating and using land in stock.  The nationwide reform of the land-use system which began in  1987 has fundamentally changed the system of allocating land by  the administration without demanding compensation, without time  limits, and without the right to transfer. The system of the  transfer of land-use rights has been instituted, and a land  market has been established. The advantages of such reform is  shown in three aspects: Promoting rational use of land and  optimizing land disposal; ensuring the realization of state  revenue from land assets; and improving the investment  environment. However, this reform has progressed faster and has  obtained more apparent results in newly increased land for  construction. Regarding the issue of entry into the market of  land in stock originally allocated for use by the  administration, although ways to overcome transfer formalities  and charges for transfer have been worked out, not much progress  has been made and enterprises are not very enthusiastic about  them because of reasons including the lack of sufficient funds.  This has affected the process of the entire reform of the  land-use system. What is valuable in the experience of the No 1  General Light Industry Company lies in enlivening, by means of  shares controlled by the state, land assets allocated by the  administration, strengthening enterprises' enthusiasm about  pushing onto the market land originally used by them, thereby,  providing an effective way to deepen reform of the land-use  system and perfect the development of the land market.    From the comprehensive and coordinated reforms of the No 1  General Light Industry Company, we can draw the conclusion that  with the establishment of a modern enterprise system, enlivening  and strengthening management of land assets are the requirements  of enlivening large and medium-sized state enterprises and are  also the needs of deepening reform of the land-use system. We  must start studying how to solve the problem of land assets  management in the course of establishment of a modern enterprise  system so that land assets can serve the entire economic  construction, reform, and opening up.    At present, various localities have started at selected  points to carry out experiments on reorganizing state  enterprises to make full use of state land assets in stock, and  they have played an important role in promoting reorganization  of state enterprises and in enlivening their assets. On the  whole, the situation is good. However, problems such as unclear  land property rights relationships, conversion of land assets  into shares at low prices, sales of land assets at low prices,  the transfer of land assets to individuals even without  compensation or time limits, and so on, have also emerged in  some localities in the course of reorganizing state enterprises.  If these problems are not solved in good time, they will  inevitably lead to losses, or losses in disguise, of state land  assets in large quantities and will do harm to the establishment  of a modern enterprise system. We must pay great attention to  the above problems and seriously and earnestly adopt measures to  solve them. Generally speaking, in the course of the  establishment of a modern enterprise system, we must uphold the  following principles in the disposal and management of land  assets: The first is to ensure the maintenance and increase in  value of state land assets and to prevent losses, or losses in  disguise, of state assets. The second is to promote the  reorganization and enlivening of assets of enterprises selected  for carrying out experiments. The third is to ensure that the  redisposal of state land assets of enterprises is in line with  existing land laws and regulations and with the direction of  development of reform of the land-use system.    To be specific, in the establishment of a modern enterprise  system, we should properly carry out work in three aspects in  land asset management:    1. Clarify property rights and strengthen property rights  management. To establish a land asset management system which  meets the needs of a modern enterprise system, we should first  of all fix land-use rights of enterprises and as soon as  possible complete registration and issuance of certificates of  land-use rights. Enterprises which already have certificates to  use state land should have, when they are reorganized in  accordance with the requirements of a modern enterprise system,  the situation of using land in the original enterprises  rechecked in accordance with the requirements of the  registration on changes in land and have changes in land  registered in accordance with changes in the use of land.    2. Properly carry out land appraisal and fix the quantity of  land assets of enterprises. As reflected by the experience of  the No 1 General Light Industry Company, land appraisal is the  only means to correctly reflect the quantity of land assets of  enterprises. Therefore, in accordance with the needs of  developing the land market and the establishment of a modern  enterprise system, we should energetically carry out the  appraisal of base and benchmark land prices. The work of land  appraisal should be carried out by land appraisal organs which  have independent legal person status and can undertake civil  responsibility. In appraising land assets, we should put  forward a scientific and comprehensive appraisal report. Land  appraisal results can be used as the basis for disposal and  conversion into shares of land assets after they have been  examined and confirmed by land management departments and  reported to state assets management departments for the record.  This can prevent the conversion or sale of land assets at low  prices which will lead to the losses, or losses in disguise, of  state land assets in large quantities.    3. Dispose land assets according to law and straighten out  the relationship of distribution of benefits from land between  the state and enterprises. In the course of establishment of a  modern enterprise system, there are three ways to dispose of  land assets: The first is for enterprises to handle transfer  formalities and payment for the transfer of land-use rights. In  this way, enterprises will have the land-use rights for a  certain period of years and land assets will become assets of  legal persons of enterprises. The second is for the state to  use payment for the transfer of land-use rights as funds for  obtaining shares, and these shares will be managed by units or  departments authorized by the state. The third is for the state  to provide land-use rights for reorganized enterprises in the  form leases and to collect annual land rents. No matter which  form reorganized enterprises may adopt, the relationship of  benefits from land assets between the state and enterprises must  be clearly defined. Firstly, state land assets should not be  underappraised in any way. Secondly, out of consideration of  enterprises' ability to bear and the needs of enlivening large  and medium-sized state enterprises, payment of benefits obtained  from land assets can be delayed or reduced, and enterprises may  carry out operations while incurring debts, but the situation  must be shown in accounts. We must also ensure by effective  means that enterprises will hand over to the state the original  value together with the added value of land assets after they  have improved the conditions of operation. It is learned that  in the near future, the No 1 General Light Industry Company will  be able to attain goal of handing over benefits obtained from  state assets to the state.    In short, comprehensive and coordinated reforms carried out  by the Beijing No 1 General Light Industry Company have  enlightened the people in many aspects. As representatives and  managers for owners of state land assets, land management  departments should emancipate their minds, carry out in-depth  studies, energetically support reform, seriously sum up good  experience and means of various localities, standardize and  improve such experience and means in a bid to enliven land  assets and deepen reform of the land-use system, and make  greater contribution to the establishment of a modern enterprise  system and to the development of the national economy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the most recent reports, the coalition  talks between the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which began this morning,  will continue on 9 June. If everything proceeds according to  the schedule just accepted, and if the sides are able to agree  on the details, the new Hungarian Government could be set up by  the end of the month. Here is a report by Kata Peli-Nagy on the  press briefing by [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn and [SZDSZ  Chairman] Ivan Peto.    [Begin Horn recording] We agreed that we would set up  experts  committees for the purpose of coordinating, working out, and  finalizing the individual topics. [end recording]    [Peli-Nagy] In accordance with the announcement made by the  MSZP's prime ministerial candidate, Gyula Horn, the coalition  talks begun today will be continued and the government agreement  will be prepared in 10 committees. The MSZP and the SZDSZ each  charged one leading expert with continuing the discussions.    The leaders of the working group dealing with economic  policy  issues are Laszlo Bekesi [MSZP] and Marton Tardos [SZDSZ]. The  leaders of the agricultural committee are Laszlo Lakos [MSZP]  and Pal Juhasz [SZDSZ]. Those heading the committee dealing  with health and social issues are Pal Kovacs [MSZP] and Andrea  Szolnoki [SZDSZ]. The leaders of the committee on cultural,  minority, and church policy are Gyoergy Janosi [MSZP] and Gabor  Fodor [SZDSZ]. The discussion of issues concerning public law  and safety will be led by Zoltan Gal [MSZP] and Peter Hack  [SZDSZ]. Ferenc Baja [MSZP] and Ferenc Wekler [SZDSZ] are  dealing with self-government issues. Laszlo Kovacs [MSZP] and  Istvan Szent-Ivanyi [SZDSZ] are dealing with foreign and  security policy; Mrs Kosa, nee Magda Kovacs [MSZP], and Tamas  Bauer [SZDSZ] are dealing with social interest coordination.    A separate committee will discuss the government structure,  and it will be headed by Imre Szekeres [MSZP] and Gabor Kuncze  [SZDSZ]. Imre Szekeres and Balint Magyar [SZDSZ] will discuss  the coalition agreement guarantees.    The leaders of the committees are not the individual  parties'  minister-designates. The work could involve experts too. This  was said by Gyula Horn, and then he added:    [Begin Horn recording] We would like the experts committees  to schedule their work so that the first version of the  coalition agreement will be prepared by 20 June, so that we can  put the final touches on it, and so that it will be ready for  signing, at the latest, by 24 June. I must say that this  discussion was characterized by a fully constructive approach.  We thought in a virtually identical manner concerning the great  majority of issues. [end recording]    [Peto] I would also like to highlight what Gyula Horn said  --  that what we have experienced indicates extremely encouraging  and very effective talks in the future. Naturally, tough and  long debates can be expected in the questions of content, but we  agree -- and we agreed on this too -- that the date for  convening the National Assembly is a firm framework for us to  which we would like to adhere under all circumstances.</p>

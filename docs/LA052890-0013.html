			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 115;  </P> <P> IT'S REFORM, NOT ATTACK ON RIGHTS;  </P> <P> PROP. 115: ISSUES OF PRIVACY, ABORTION, SEXUAL PREFERENCE, TAXES WOULD NOT BE  AFFECTED.  </P> <P> Most of the ballot arguments against Proposition 115 are based on the false  premise that the measure will eliminate the state constitutional right to  privacy. Article 1, Section 1 of the California Constitution guarantees that  right and is entirely unchanged by Proposition 115. What the initiative would  do is limit a criminal defendant's procedural rights regarding search and  seizure, speedy trial, privacy, and other matters to those provided under the  federal Constitution.  </P> <P> The right to privacy has been abused by criminal defendants to keep the jury  from learning relevant evidence against them. For example, defendants have made  claims that their rights to privacy would be violated if the jury were told of  their confessions made in police cars or recorded by police in jail cells.  </P> <P> The opponents of the initiative are also claiming that it will somehow affect  the abortion issue. There is no reference in Proposition 115 to abortion. It is  clear from the ballot argument in favor of Proposition 115, and from the  language of the proposition itself that it was intended to affect only criminal  procedure and not the right to abortion.  </P> <P> Among the most outrageous claims made by the initiative's opponents is that it  will "undermine religious freedom" and eliminate free-speech rights such as the  right to circulate petitions. Proposition 115 has nothing to do with religious  freedom or free speech. More important, these rights are guaranteed by the  First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  </P> <P> Nor will Proposition 115 make it "difficult" to keep medical records private.  The confidentiality of medical records has been protected by statute for as  long as anyone can remember, and the initiative does nothing to change that.  </P> <P> Nothing in Proposition 115 suggests any intent to "criminalize certain sexual  preferences." The due process clause of the U.S. Constitution does not permit  punishment for status (such as sexual preference), but only for conduct.  California was one of the first states to decriminalize sexual conduct between  consenting adults, including persons of the same sex, and there is no threat  that the outmoded and unenforceable "bedroom laws" of the past will ever be  resurrected.  </P> <P> In case there are some voters who do not care about any of these issues, the  opponents throw in an old standby: the threat of new taxes. The ballot argument  claims that Proposition 115 will cost "millions of dollars in new taxes." The  initiative contains no provisions for tax assessments. In fact, it will save  money by eliminating unnecessary court appearances for which court-appointed  attorneys are paid, and by shortening the trial process. This will be  accomplished by streamlining the jury selection process to allow the judge  rather than the lawyers to ask the questions, by eliminating separate closed  sessions for questioning of jurors in death penalty cases, by allowing the  statements of certain witnesses to the police to be used at the preliminary  hearing instead of a live appearance in court, and by eliminating duplicative  pretrial probable-cause hearings.  </P> <P> A final misconception is that Proposition 115 will result in more trials. What  the initiative would do is restore the option of prosecutors to proceed by  grand jury indictments or by preliminary hearing. This option is contained in  the state Constitution, but was effectively nullified by the Rose Bird Court.  While most cases will continue with the preliminary hearing procedure,  Proposition 115 will give prosecutors the flexibility to use the grand jury for  those cases in which it is more efficient to do so.  </P> <P> Voters should not allow these scare tactics to prevent essential reform of the  criminal justice system.  </P></p>

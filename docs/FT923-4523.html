			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: Venice opens its doors to change - A new-look film festival THE PEOPLE chosen to run the Venice Film Festival change almost as often as the people chosen to run Italy. The guest director of this year's Mostra Del Cinema is film-maker Gillo Pontecorvo, who made that masterpiece of docudrama generalship The Battle For Algiers. Running a film festival is harder, as we know, than organising a military campaign. Number one: you cannot win. Number two: whatever you do, your enemies will increase rather than decrease. Even Pontecorvo's popular precursor Guglielmo Biraghi ended up with more knives in his back than medals on his chest. But first signs this year are good. Fresh gales are being allowed to waft into the cultural corridors. Special events include a 'Vetrina sulla cinema Italiana' and a 'Finestra sulle imagini': one window on the imagination, one shop window for native film. In addition a skylight has been opened for American cinema, with Brian De Palma's brilliant new thriller airdropping into Venice alongside Alexandre Rockwell's breezy film about film-making In The Soup (top prize winner at the recent Sundance Film Festival). And a small bathroom window has even been eased open for Britain, welcoming new films by Neil Jordan, Peter Greenaway and others. Jordan being on jury duty at Venice, his The Crying Game showed out of competition - perhaps as well for this strange, vulnerable bloom. Half political thriller, half love mystery, it follows guilt-haunted terrorist Stephen Rea from a tragic kidnapping in Ireland to a tryst-of-honour with a dead soldier's beloved in London. Planted with riddles and ambiguities - chiefly, when is a girlfriend not a girlfriend? - the story is a fable about the minefield of misperceptions we walk through in both love and war. Before the close, however, the film's mood of mazy convolution becomes more sedative than hypnotic. A key character is too opaquely played to involve us, and the odd-couple 'romance' at the film's centre conjures fatally invidious memories of Jordan's better Mona Lisa. Brian De Palma's Raising Cain, by contrast, could be re-titled Raising Lazarus. Some thought Mr De P had been buried for ever by the debacle of The Bonfire Of The Vanities. Now he leaps forth with all limbs jangling. This deliciously crazed thriller about a child psychologist with a multiple personality (John Lithgow) is in the best tradition of Carrie, Obsession and Dressed To Kill. De Palma is often pilloried for imitating Hitchcock, but at his best he improves on the master. The visual booby traps and ambushes here are quite inspired - from a ubiquitous black wig to a not-quite-drowned woman to a last-scene showdown between a madman, a bag of oranges and a sun-dial - and so is the film's parodic eclecticism. Bits of Psycho, Vertigo and Peeping Tom flutter about the imagistic aviary, but we are never in doubt who is the true birdmaster. Comic and kinetic, witty and weightless, and dazzlingly fluid in its movements between dream and waking, this is as close to 'pure cinema' as the form can come. After De Palma how impatient we become with films that slap their message-heavy stories up on screen, uninflected by wit, ambiguity or provocational trompe l'oeil. Golden Yawn contenders thus far at Venice include Claude Sautet's atrophic romance Un Coeur En Hiver (beautiful violinist Emmanuelle Beart tries to inspire some vibrato in repressed violin-maker Daniel Auteuil), Ousmane Sembene's Guelwaar, a stiffly directed satire on colonialised culture, and Maurizio Zaccaro's The Valley Of Stone. This last is a Euro-pudding in the grand modern tradition. It tempts one's spoon into the rich mix of cultural flavours, then breaks one tooth on the unyielding polyglot awkwardness. England's Charles Dance plays a German land surveyor in an Italian-speaking tale about greed and humility. Preachy, pedestrian and post-synched, the film's only interest is that it was double-billed with a rare screening of Steven Spielberg's 1969 Amblin', the calling-card short that brought this prodigy into show business. Time has not been too kind to the Coca-Cola sunsets and feelgood hippyisms of this tale of two hitch-hikers meeting cute in the American West. But at least, unlike Zaccaro's film, it is loud, cheerful and alive. So is Alexandre Rockwell's In The Soup. This is a comedy about an aspiring film-maker (Steve Buscemi) who cannot even get to make his calling-card film; unless the eccentric Mafioso he meets (Seymour Cassel) will finance the project after our hero has reluctantly co-operated in a series of robberies. Minor in ambition, major in off-the-wall comic appeal. None of these films, I predict, will win the Golden Lion. That animal traditionally favours esteemed and non-controversial veterans. At this stage he is probably mulling the merits of Pupi Avati's Brothers And Sisters and Bertrand Tavernier's L 267. The French film is a disappointment from the maker of Sunday In The Country and Life And Nothing But: a ponderous docudrama about anti-drugs cops in Paris, unvitalised by its non-professional cast and rushing Steadicam style. But Avati's film is a small-scale delight. Evading the curse of the co-production, its tale of Italian-American family life in St Louis, Missouri, is funny, subtle, astringent and elliptical: a soap opera which stings the mind and senses. More if it wins, much more if and when it comes to Britain.</p>

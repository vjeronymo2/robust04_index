			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Bombay scam Everybody was to blame, especially foreigners. This is the conclusion of yesterday's report from the Indian parliamentary committee which investigated last year's securities scandal. Its description of how easily money flowed out of the banking system into the stock market in flagrant violation of banking and stock exchange regulations will make many people feel uncomfortable. None of those involved are spared from criticism. The report is particularly tough on the finance ministry and the Bombay stock exchange. Foreign banks, it says, were the 'originators and also the biggest players'. Many of its conclusions are self-evident. It is clear that there was systemic laxity in oversight of financial markets. However, the report errs in suggesting the scandal was the result of liberalisation of financial markets. It was precisely because of official attempts to control the money markets that institutions with money on deposit at low, regulated rates sought methods of earning a better return, including portfolio management schemes offered by foreign banks. If interest rates were liberalised, the temptation to circumvent control would not exist. India needs better supervision, but fewer rules. That central bank restrictions were violated has been admitted by several foreign banks. That internal controls of some banks were lax is clear. Standard Chartered of the UK has shuffled managers, dispensed with some staff in India and reported a Pounds 305m loss from its Indian operations in 1992. Nor can foreign banks suggest this was a purely Indian problem in which they were hapless victims. Their international expertise helped them to dominate the inter-bank securities markets in which most irregularities occurred. The committee's suggestion that banks broke laws of their own countries deserves thorough investigation. As for the treatment to be meted out in India to the foreign banks, the committee is right to suggest that a country seen consistently to uphold rules will attract foreign investors rather than deter them. However, suspension or expulsion would send the wrong signal when India's reforms are seeking to break down barriers to the outside world. It would suggest renewed insularity and xenophobia, as well as an unwillingness to tackle the true inadequacies of the financial system. It takes more than one party to make a scandal: many Indian banks have changed top managers as a result of the scam, and a number of once-prominent people face criminal charges. The scandal will have been of benefit if it forces Indian regulators into more effective supervision. What is most important, however, is that this should take place against a background of further liberalisation. India's hopes lie in greater openness, not in a return to bashing foreigners.</p>

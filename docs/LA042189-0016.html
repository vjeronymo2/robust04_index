			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROJECT GETS CONDITIONAL PERMIT  </P> <P> The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has certified the completion of an  environmental impact report and imposed 83 conditions of approval for the  proposed Marriott Corp. retirement complex on Crestridge Road above the  Peninsula Center.  </P> <P> On a 3-2 vote Tuesday, the council approved the conditional-use permit, grading  application and zoning variance for the controversial project, which will  include 250 independent living units and a 100-bed hospital.  </P> <P> One of the conditions requires Marriott to reserve 12 of the independent living  units for Rancho Palos Verdes residents, whose income cannot exceed 80% of the  city's median income, an amount that has not yet been determined. Rent for the  12 units cannot exceed 30% to 35% of the residents' income. The condition is  designed to help the city meet affordable housing requirements set by state  law.  </P> <P> Other conditions of approval include staggering employee shifts to limit  rush-hour traffic and paying for an additional sheriff's patrol car to enforce  truck speed limits and other safety regulations along the route to be followed  by trucks hauling dirt from the construction site.  </P> <P> The project has been opposed by neighbors, who said it is too large.  </P></p>

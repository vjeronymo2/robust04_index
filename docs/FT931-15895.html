			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Books: Yet another turn of the screw - Anthony Curtis wants biographers to let Henry James up from the analyst's couch HENRY JAMES: THE IMAGINATION OF GENIUS by Fred Kaplan John Curtis/Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 25, 566 pages WHEN Leon Edel revised his four-volume biography of Henry James and condensed it into one volume - Henry James: A Life (1987) - he managed to do the job in 717 pages plus notes and index. Now another American James biographer, Fred Kaplan (born 1937 and with previous biographies of Carlyle and Dickens under his belt) has come along and has performed a similar task, a complete life from cradle to grave, in a mere 566 pages plus notes, etc. Kaplan's book prompts three questions. Has the saving of 150 pages of text resulted in the omission of any significant material that the first-time reader of a life of Henry James would need to know? Have the five years that have elapsed since the appearance of the one-volume Life by Edel revealed some startling material unknown to Edel and included here? And finally, even if the material is basically the same here, does Kaplan's use and interpretation of it give the reader a series of radically new insights into Henry James? The short answer to all these three questions is the same - No. It must be conceded that Kaplan is a skilful writer who succeeds in reducing the facts of James's long, arduous literary career, and the complex web of personal relations it entailed, into a tighter package than Edel did. The price to be paid for this comparative concision is in loss of readability - Edel is more enjoyable - and in Kaplan's fewer references to the novels and stories. Edel traces many more echoes and resonances of the life in the work. Some new facts do emerge in Kaplan. The most vivid concerns James's sad relationship with Constance Fenimore Woolson - an American authoress living in exile in Italy who contributed to the character of Miss Tina in The Aspern Papers. This poor lady committed suicide, probably on account of James's refusal to propose marriage to her. Kaplan has a scene - straight out of a Roeg movie yet to be made - where, after her death, James takes her voluminous black dresses with him in a gondola and throws them into the lagoon. For a long while the sombre garments refuse to drown and bob up out of the water as black shapes to haunt him. On the other hand, there is some fresh material in Edel not taken account of here by Kaplan. He accepts the received view, put out originally by James himself, that The Turn of the Screw derived from an anecdote told to the novelist by Edward Benson, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Yet it is rather odd, as EF (Fred) Benson confessed in As We Were, that none of the Benson children could ever remember hearing that anecdote from their father. There may have been some shadowy remark, about children being corrupted by servants in a big house, from the lips of the archbishop that triggered James's imagination. But, as Edel fascinatingly showed in his one volume, the true source was a story 'Temptation' published in the widely ready American 19th-century story magazine, Frank Leslie's New York Journal (the forerunner of Collier's). It was a horror story serialised there between January and June 1855 when James was a schoolboy. The parallels with James's tale - a villain called Peter Quin who was the valet of an employer who lived in Harley Street; Quin having a henchman called Miles - these parallels are too abundant to be mere coincidence. The story was published anonymously but Edel has deduced the author was Tom Taylor, a former editor of Punch. 'What James', writes Edel, 'seems to have carried over into his later years, more than the memory of the names he borrowed, was the sense of portentous evil in Tom Taylor's story, the insidious power of Peter Quin and the . . . child victims'. Both Edel and Kaplan adopt a Freudian stance in their interpretation of the works. They see little Miles, for instance, as a projection of James's immediate anxieties about his occupancy of Lamb House, Rye, and more ingrained fears and jealousies, rooted in childhood, concerning his older brother William, the professor of psychology, whose approval he wanted for his purchase of the house. Both biographers are also of a mind in regarding What Maisie Knew as being crucial in James's efforts to resolve his own psychological difficulties. In that novel Kaplan affirms that 'James dramatized his own lifelong problems of growth, choice and personal freedom'. Kaplan makes slightly less of the theatrical failure than Edel, who sees it as the great trauma. (Understandably he does: it was the origin of Edel's interest in James when as a French-speaking Canadian student of literature at the University of McGill in Montreal, he published his doctoral thesis in 1931.) Writing in our contemporary climate, Kaplan is a little freer in dealing with James's sex-life - the lack of it in practice - than was Edel. James never seems to have had a real physical affair with anyone of either gender and it was not until The Wings of the Dove, written when he was pushing 60, that he intimated that sexual congress had recently occurred between two of his principal characters. But in his latter years in real life he had a very physical way of addressing people he was fond of, certain younger men like the sculptor Hendrik Andersen. 'My dear friend, I pat you on the back . . .' and similar phrases. Kaplan concludes that James was 'homoerotic' - an ugly-sounding word he uses a great deal. It comes from psychiatry, defined in the OED 2nd edition as meaning: 'Pertaining to or characterised by a tendency for erotic emotions to be centred on a person of the same sex'. With particular reference to Henry James, it means that basically he was gay but he never did anything about it. The psychological profile of James we get from Kaplan may well be perfectly true but it becomes unhelpful when it serves to concentrate the mind of the biographer on viewing the fiction largely as a form of self-therapy. One may hope that the next Jamesian biographer to come along will pull the old boy up from off the analyst's couch and permit him to stand once more on his own two feet. What we need now is a biographer who will treat James's fiction not as the dramatising of interior anxieties but as the expression of the keenest, most scrupulous observations we possess concerning the men and women of his period.</p>

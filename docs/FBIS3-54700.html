To argue with  him is as pointless as with the leader of the Russian Liberal  Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. This is how a  high-ranking Russian diplomat dealing with Baltic problems  commented on Landsbergis's recent statements concerning  relations with Russia.    Addressing a news conference in Vilnius recently,  Landsbergis  criticized the present Lithuanian leadership for its "policy of  rapprochement with the East". According to him, the "aggressive  nationalism of Russia, whose policy had been identical to that  of Zhirinovskiy who only speaks more openly, revealed itself in  full lately".    "Such escapades on the part of Landsbergis no longer  surprise  anyone," said Interfax's interviewee. "They have become so  biased and subjective, that they can hardly be taken seriously  even in Lithuania itself," he noted.    The interview with the Russian diplomat will be published in  more detail in tomorrow's edition of Diplomatic Panorama.</p>

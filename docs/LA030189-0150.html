			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MINNESOTA IS BACK IN NBA, 29 YEARS AFTER LAKERS LEAVE  </P> <P> Twenty-nine years after the Lakers moved west, the Land of 10,000 Lakes  officially is home to a National Basketball Assn. franchise.  </P> <P> Owners Harvey Ratner and Marv Wolfenson said today that they met today's  deadline for the second installment of their $32.5-million NBA expansion  franchise fee by wiring $16.25 million to the NBA. The payment enables the  Minnesota Timberwolves to begin play in the 1989-90 season, assuming that the  owners have met other NBA criteria.  </P> <P> "Today we officially have the NBA back in Minnesota," Ratner said in a  statement. "It is a credit to the Timberwolves staff and to area fans. We could  not have accomplished the league's requirements without the support of state  and local officials, and particularly, Timberwolves fans."  </P> <P> Ratner and Wolfenson said they also made a $100,000 non-refundable deposit when  making application for the franchise in 1986; a $3.15-million payment in the  summer of 1987 and a $13-million installment Dec. 1, 1988.  </P> <P> Timberwolves President Bob Stein has said that half the total $32.5-million  franchise fee came from the pockets of Wolfenson and Ratner and half is bank  financing.  </P> <P> NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre said this morning that he expects no problems with  the final payment.  </P> <P> The Timberwolves said they have also met the NBA's requirements that they sell  at least 10,000 season tickets with at least 50% payment by Dec. 31, 1988, sign  radio and television contracts, finalize leasing and scheduling agreements in  their home arena and make adequate progress in the construction of their new  arena.  </P> <P> The Lakers played in Minnesota for 12 years before moving to Los Angeles, where  NBA-great Jerry West and the Los Angeles franchise began their rookie seasons  in 1961.  </P></p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / EC social policy to wait for UK election EUROPEAN Community ambitions to design a social policy giving workers a stake in the single market and monetary union were put on hold yesterday until after the British general election. But it became clear that one of the main labour market measures the UK hoped to impede through exclusion from the Maastricht European union treaty would go ahead however the election transpired. All sides appeared to recognise that a form of collective bargaining at Community level was certain to be established whether or not the social protocol, which Britain's 11 partners agreed at Maastricht, is activated. Employment and social affairs ministers were holding their first discussion of the implications of Maastricht at an informal meeting in Portugal. The protocol envisages voluntary agreements between EC federations of unions and employers as a self-regulatory substitute for Brussels putting forward laws for approval by member states. The bolder social provisions of the protocol will not start operating until next year, after the treaty is ratified. But already, European capital and labour have started enacting proposals blocked by the UK under existing EC social provisions. The Commission had hoped to get a vote on April 6 on another proposal which the UK is holding up - to introduce a 48-hour working week. That meeting of the Council of Ministers is now certain to be postponed until after the UK election. 'It is right that the Community should not interfere with the British elections,' Ms Vasso Papandreou, EC social affairs commissioner, said.</p>

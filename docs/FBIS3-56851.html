Ivan Korotchenya told INTERFAX that the Executive  Secretariat  and other CIS bodies were having serious problems at present.  He said that because "the embassies of Turkey and Ukraine, the  U.N. mission and the premises of some commercial structures are  located in the Commonwealth building, the government and  high-frequency communications systems in the building have been  disconnected, which defies all logic."    "The government of Belarus has still not solved the  accommodation problem for officials from Commonwealth countries.  The Economic Court of the CIS is situated in an unsuitable  place, too," Korotchenya said.    He expressed the hope that the future agreement between the  Executive Secretariat and the Belarusian government would, among  other things, make provisions for the construction of a CIS  complex in Minsk.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Luis Inacio Lula da Silva plans to lead a bloc of  debtor countries to negotiate with creditors. In his first news  conference as an official candidate, Lula said that, if elected,  he will seek to form a bloc of poor countries and noted that he  would only break relations with the IMF if creditors are  intransigent. He added: "One cannot discuss social issues with  the IMF managing director."    Upon closing the 9th Workers Party [PT] convention, Lula  resigned as PT president. He was replaced by Deputy Rui Falcao,  a member of PT radical group, who was elected in return for the  radical groups' agreement to withdraw their proposal for a debt  moratorium from the PT platform. Lula then canceled a rally  following the death of car racer Ayrton Senna.    Lula said he does not fear capital flight from the country  if  he is elected president because "there has always been capital  flight here." He believes the final version of the PT program  shows rich countries that the PT "is aware of the responsibility  entailed in ruling a country as important as Brazil, which needs  to adopt a political position in keeping with its standing, and  thus prevent it from being treated as a mere exporter of kiwi  fruits." Euphoric over his victory over PT radicals, Lula said  the PT remains united and that "the war predicted by the press  prior to the convention never took place."</p>

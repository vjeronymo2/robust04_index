			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Berezovskiy: "Timur Rises in Place of </F> Marx"]    [Text] Tashkent -- In the center of Tashkent, where only  recently there towered a pensive granite Karl Marx, Amir Timur  has ascended the pedestal, in gilt spurs. The fearsome  conqueror of the East, whose empire stretched from Delhi to  Damascus, henceforth symbolizes the might of the state and the  unity of the Uzbek nation. Over here he is now like Prince  Vladimir for Russians or Bismarck for Germans.    Uzbekistan's best minds have been thrown into the creation  of  a new ideology. The powerful wave of "perestroyka" nationalism,  which smashed to pieces the dogmas of Marxism-Leninism, has  receded. But what will take its place? All the signs suggest  that the resulting vacuum will be filled by Islam.    A Western diplomat, arriving in Tashkent, was pleasantly  surprised that Uzbeks remain...Uzbeks. He was not exactly  discovering America. The people have not lost their national  psychology. An Uzbek, just as he was hundreds of years ago, is  loyal to his family and the norms of the Shari'ah; respectful of  authority -- which, as a rule, he personifies; tolerant in  interethnic relations, practical, and sociable. Not to mention  the fact that he has kept his own cuisine, songs, dances, and  customs....    It is from this well that the authors of the new ideology  draw their ideas. The aim is to unite the people around the  leader, lead them through the wilderness, and give them hope.  And whereas formerly this was the unattainable peak of  communism, nowadays the country's streets and squares are  adorned with another inspiring formula: "Uzbekistan -- A State  With A Great Future!" The author, of course, is Islam Karimov,  who, unlike certain other CIS leaders, perfectly understands  that, however bad Soviet ideology was, it make it possible to  unite the nation to work for the good of the republic. He also  perfectly understands that a nation cannot exist in an  ideological vacuum.    The supporting structure of the emerging ideology is  patriotism.    For instance, the Basmaks [anti-Soviet Uzbek nationalist  movement in early twenties] are now esteemed as "champions of  the faith and freedom." Like others who fell in the struggle  against the "Red Empire," they will have a monument raised in  their honor in Kokand. Writers and poets accused of nationalism  and repressed under Stalin are being rehabilitated -- people  like Usman Nasyr, for whom one of Tashkent's central streets has  been named.    One of the purposes of the new ideology is to overcome  regionalism, the age-old separation of Uzbeks into Fergana,  Khorezm, Bukhara, and Tashkent Uzbeks, which can still be seen  today in the structure of the ruling elite. Disconnection and  isolation have led to this people being virtually "absent" from  world civilization for three centuries.    There are people and political forces who are trying to  build  a new social consciousness on "pushing away" from Russia and the  Soviet Union, whom they represent as colonizers. Their sins are  endless: russification, the forced imposition of socialism, the  exportation of national treasures for a pittance.    The main target of the "reforging" is, of course, the  younger  generation. It is easier for young people to rid themselves of  Soviet stereotypes and take on board new ideas. Hence, the  entire education system is being hurriedly restructured. In  just a few years Uzbekistan is to change its alphabet from the  Cyrillic to the Latin, which will undoubtedly "cut off" the  younger generation from the huge bulk of Soviet and Russian  literature. Meanwhile, Tashkent has sharply reduced "Ostankino"  and almost completely "cut out" RTV.    The old, for whom it is too late to change their views, have  not been forgotten either. In Uzbekistan, 1 May -- Victory Day  -- and 8 March have been left untouched. Monuments to Pushkin  and Gorkiy have not disappeared, and Fergana's central street  bears the name of Dmitriy Skobelev, the czarist general who  built the city.    The ruling People's Democratic Party with its leader Islam  Karimov aspires most of all to be the architect of the new  ideology. The president never tires of repeating that the  people are not ready for democracy of the Western type, and will  not accept it entirely. And the spiritual face of Uzbekistan is  probably being molded as a synthesis of the Turkestan  renaissance, renascent Islam, and modern civilization.</p>

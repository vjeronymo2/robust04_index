			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour attacks Lilley plans LABOUR yesterday attacked Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, as 'insincere and two-faced' over his plans to shake up the welfare state. Shadow social security secretary Mr Donald Dewar said the end result of the review of benefits would be 'a cut-price safety net with gaping holes through lack of funding'. Mr Dewar warned that Mr Lilley was looking to an American model, with more restricted benefits.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Fashion: The global wardrobe in the office - Tokyo Tokyo's prices are among the highest in the world, and the prices of clothes are no exception. A few years ago, that would not have stopped the city's business men and women from indulging their taste for fine clothes, even if the deadly morning rush hour meant that the Y200,000 (Pounds 1,120) Armani suit or Y100,000 Gucci bag got thoroughly beaten up on the way to work. For Tokyo's regimented office workers, dressing in designer clothes has offered one of the few means of expressing some sense of individuality in the grey, characterless buildings they inhabit. But in Japan's conformist business society even that luxury is strictly regulated by a dress code that is conservative, to say the least, by western standards. The rule to dressing for work in Japan is to be discreet. Bold colours and adventurous tailoring are discouraged and businessmen generally restrict themselves to grey or navy suits with equally dull-coloured ties. Women tend towards the sweet and simple, exemplified in the ubiquitous white blouse with ribbon or frills. For many a female clerk, a single pearl around the neck or hair barret are often the only relief from the monotony of the grey, navy and black uniforms that are still common. There are, of course, exceptions to the general rule and some younger men have become more adventurous in their choice of clothes. This summer, businessmen in tasteful jackets of soft yellow, ivory and pale green were among the few surprises spotted on Tokyo's subways. The braver office women, meanwhile, might take a risk with tight-fitting, body-conscious clothes and miniskirts, but not those planning to stay with the company for long. Another change that is creeping into Tokyo offices these days is the increasing acceptance of discounted clothes. As the recession bites, the news is that mens' suits at one-tenth the price of an Armani are selling very well indeed.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WARRIOR CAGERS COLLIDE WITH PASADENA, TOUGHEST SCC OPPONENT  </P> <P> The El Camino College men's basketball team will travel to Pasadena City  College on Saturday to open South Coast Conference play at 7:30 p.m. The  Warriors are 15-5 after Wednesday's 84-81 victory over Fashion Institute.  Pasadena (12-4) is thought to be El Camino's toughest SCC opponent. The Lancers  ended a 10-game winning streak when they fell to Santa Monica in their own  tournament last month.  </P> <P> The Loyola Marymount women's basketball team will play its third straight road  game at 1 p.m. Sunday at Wyoming. The Lions were 7-4 after losing at Weber  State, 83-63, on Tuesday. Sunday's game is Loyola's last non-conference  contest. They open West Coast Athletic Conference play Jan. 13 at San  Francisco.  </P> <P> The 11th annual Redondo Beach Super Bowl Sunday 10-K on Jan. 22 will offer  prize money to the athletic programs of schools that win the centipede race --  10 or more runners linked by costume fabric -- and the six-pack competition for  teams of six runners. Race organizers offered team prize money for the first  time last year and an El Camino College team won $500 for the track program.  Team entry information is available at 376-6913.  </P></p>

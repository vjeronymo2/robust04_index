			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Confusion arises on orimulsion plant THERE WAS confusion last night over plans for the UK's largest orimulsion-burning power plant after the plant's owners denied a statement by the pollution authorities that they had withdrawn their application for authorisation. The Pollution Inspectorate said National Power had withdrawn an application to burn orimulsion at its Pembroke plant and was seeking authority to burn heavy oil instead. The inspectorate referred to a letter from the manager of the Pembroke plant on December 21. Orimulsion, developed in Venezuela in the mid 1980s, is about 70 per cent bitumen by volume mixed with water and an additive to keep the mixture stable. National Power said the letter from the plant manager was intended to seek more time to respond to a call from the inspectorate earlier in October for stronger environmental safeguards. National Power said it was still investigating the commercial prospects for orimulsion, although he confirmed that it was also planned to burn heavy oil. Oil is currently burned at the 2,000MW Pembroke plant. National Power's plans to convert it to orimulsion have been denounced by the environmental lobby, which labels orimulsion 'the filthy fuel'. The fuel became notorious in August last year after an accident at Richborough power station, in Kent, left cars corroded by 'acid smuts', a kind of acid rain. In October, the inspectorate told National Power that it could not approve the plant unless more environmental measures - which it did not specify - were adopted. The power generation industry accepts that orimulsion contains more sulphur than most oil or coal, but argues that its overall emissions are less harmful. It is cheaper than domestically produced coal and competes with imported coal. PowerGen, the smaller of the two power generators, has been burning orimulsion for several years on an experimental basis without environmental controls at Richborough and at a power station in Cheshire.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / EU 'must release Rwanda aid' Two big aid agencies will today urge the European Union to release a mountain of aid for Rwanda they said was blocked by demands which could not be met without the funds. The international medical agency Medicins Sans Frontieres and the British charity Oxfam said their work in saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees was in vain unless Rwanda could rebuild. 'While the new administration in Rwanda struggles to rebuild . . without tables, chairs, pens and paper, EU development ministers sit on an unspent Ecu 159m (Pounds 125m),' they said. They implored EU development ministers meeting in Brussels today to unblock funds to enable Rwanda to create conditions to foster justice, national reconciliation and basic services. The new Rwandan government says it cannot properly foster national reconciliation after the massacre of up to 1m people and three months of civil war without international aid.</p>

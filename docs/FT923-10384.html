			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market pleased with BAT A RECOVERY in Eagle Star's insurance business helped to lift the shares of parent BAT Industries by 22 to 756p yesterday. Turnover was strong at 6.5m shares. Second quarter losses at Eagle Star were cut to Pounds 47m from Pounds 175m as the first quarter's improvement in the level of provisions required for repossessions in the housing market was maintained. Nevertheless, chairman Sir Patrick Sheehy said: 'Continuing uncertainty over the UK economy is a cause for concern.' After raising the interim dividend to 14.6p from 13.4p, Sir Patrick commented that 'this is consistent with our commitment to sustained dividend growth significantly in excess of the rate of inflation, and is a rate of increase that I expect to at least be maintained'. Growth in exports was the 'most exciting' aspect of tobacco performance. Cigarette exports increased by 20 per cent and now account for a fifth of group cigarette sales. Tate &amp; Lyle hit Profits downgrades hit Tate &amp; Lyle, as the market showed increasing concern about overcapacity in production of the corn syrup sweetener used in soft drinks such as cola. Staley, T &amp; L's US subsidiary, could be severely affected by this problem, according to analysts. The shares weakened 11 to 293p on turnover of 2.8m after Hoare Govett lowered its profits forecast for the year to September to Pounds 210m from Pounds 235m, followed by cuts from several other brokers. Mr Carl Short, food analyst at Nomura, said that acting on a worst case assumption he is trimming the 1991/92 forecast to Pounds 207.5m from Pounds 232m. Last year's profits figure was Pounds 234.6m. Properties weak While the equity market shone for a second day, the maligned property sector took another knock as BZW reduced its net asset values (nav) for nearly all the leading stocks, arguing that property values will decline further this year and fall again in 1993. While the reduction is based on the dimming signs of economic recovery, BZW also believes that a sharp fall in tenant enquiries since mid-May points to 'the dismal prospect of declining rents well into 1993'. As a result, the house's forecast of an average 8 per cent nav decline for this year is changed to 10 per cent, and the 5 per cent rise for 1993 has been altered to a 6 per cent fall. All of the leading property stocks suffered on the BZW downgrades. British Land dipped 6 to 168p, Land Securities 3 to 373p and MEPC 10 to 243p. Hammerson was further undermined as talk in the market suggested that the group may soon be in breach of its covenants. The shares tumbled 19 to 239p. Holiday blow News that Airtours was considering dropping holidays to Euro Disney from its brochure came as a further blow to the Paris theme park, already reeling from poor attendance figures, forecasts of interim losses and the need to reduce its prices for winter. Airtours blamed its decision on lack of demand, although more cynical observers pointed out that Euro Disney is about to start negotiations over its new price structure with British tour operators and sugg-ested spoiling tactics by the UK tour group. Euro Disney declined 20 to 940p. Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas said he remains a seller of Euro Disney even at this level, arguing that high costs and low margins will probably mean the company making losses for the next two years. Meanwhile, other holiday groups continued to bask in the general sentiment that bookings have picked up. Airtours climbed 22 to 253p, Eurocamp 8 to 324p and Owners Abroad 3 1/2 to 80p. First quarter figures, well down on those of the comparable period last year but significantly higher than expected by market analysts, saw BT aggressively bought and finally 13 higher at 346p. Turnover in the 'old' shares reached 15m, well above usual levels. This was also boosted by a single deal of 5.8m shares traded at 346 1/2 p as part of a programme trade, and another single trade of 3.2m shares. The partly-paid stock was also well supported, closing 12 ahead at 244p on turnover of 8.8m. The transatlantic battle in BP shares flared up again as one of the big US brokerages, believed to be PaineWebber, was said to have moved in as a heavy buyer. Many UK broking concerns have been keen sellers of BP amid worries that the group may cut the quarterly dividend by up to 50 per cent when it announces figures a week from today. The US buyers had the upper hand for much of the session, driving BP to a closing level of 216 1/2 p for a net gain of 8 1/2 p, a significant outperformance among the Footsie stocks. Turnover was a hefty 19m shares, a figure boosted by a series of large trades, including a block of 4.2m at 214 3/4 p, as part of a programme trade, and a line of 2.2m traded at 216p. Lasmo shares, among the market's most volatile counters in recent weeks, blew hot and cold after the group revealed half-time figures. Worries over the interim dividend had brought heavy downside pressure recently. However, the interim payout was maintained and profits were better than expected, sufficient reasons to bolster the share price, which initially raced up to 140p, before slipping back to 131 1/2 and closed a penny up at 134p. Turnover was a heavy 7.5m shares. Some of the company's severest critics said it had put on a brave face in maintaining the dividend but had hit the balance sheet at the expense of the profit and loss account. 'These figures may look very good superficially, but that does not change the underlying weak fundamentals of the company,' said one oil analyst. Bank shares performed well, and were led up by Lloyds, which kicks off the interim results season tomorrow. The shares rose 10 to 419p on 4.4m traded. NatWest was also heavily supported, closing 8 better at 330p on 6.5m. The recent buy note from one of the London market's most influential securities houses lifted HSBC 8 more to 338p on very heavy turnover of 11m. Lloyds Abbey Life delivered one of the poorest performances in the Footsie list, the shares sliding 10, or 2.8 per cent, to 345p after disappointing interim figures and, more importantly according to the market, poor new business figures. Wall Street buying helped Glaxo, the shares racing ahead 19 to 730p. MARKET REPORTERS: Colin Millham, Christopher Price, Steve Thompson.

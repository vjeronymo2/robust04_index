The National Electoral Commission [CEN] has  announced the partial results for the 19 constituencies where  the 20 February elections took place. However, it was of the  view that it was not in a position to announce the results for  the five remaining constituencies, where serious incidents  disrupted the smooth running of the electoral exercise. The CEN  has, therefore, submitted the dossier to the Supreme Court.    The government has no intention of interfering in the  settlement of the election disputes. It hopes that the  competent organs, which are provided by the Constitution and the  Electoral Law to settle electoral disputes, will be able to make  their decisions with full sovereignty -- and without any  pressure. It will do everything in its power to facilitate the  establishment of the institutions of the Fourth Republic with  peace and security for all.    Finally, the government hopes that everyone will respect the  Constitution and the Electoral Law, as is the tradition in each  of the countries serving on the Internatonal Follow Up Committee.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front is still refusing to  negotiate with the Rwandan transitional government. [passage  omitted]    France's Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin yesterday  explained Paris' position in a speech in the National Assembly:    [Begin Roussin recording] Our ambassador in Rwanda has been  entrusted with an assessment mission and has been asked to  establish contacts with a view to obtaining a cease-fire and the  resumption of dialogue between the Rwandans. Our ambassador is  meeting with all sides: the transitional government and the  leaders of the Rwandan Patriotic Front.    France is maintaining close contact with the UN secretary  general in order to assess the contributions of the  international community toward the normalization of the  situation.    Finally, as long as conflicts continue, it is our duty to  continue to carry out humanitarian operations. French NGOs  [nongovernmental organizations] especially are bringing support  to the martyred people, and I would like to hail their action.  However we must do more. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan's trade surplus  appears to be shrinking, but the still-rising gap with the  United States is worrisome, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito  said Thursday.    The merchandise trade figures for May released earlier in  the  day underscored "the rising imports and falling exports in terms  of volume," Saito told a regular news meeting. "But I want to  see if that becomes a fixed trend, and I'm worried about the  unchanged (upward) trend with the U.S.," Saito said.    The May preliminary figures showed that Japan's surplus fell  15.9 percent from a year before to score the first fall in six  months, but the gap with the U.S. continued to rise for the  third month in a row, gaining 7.5 percent.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bridgestone turns in 10% fall BRIDGESTONE, the leading Japanese tyre maker, yesterday reported a 10.1 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the year to the end of December, largely a reflection of the slump in Japanese vehicle production. However, Sumitomo Rubber, one of its main competitors, reported a 2.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits on a slight increase in sales. Bridgestone said pre-tax profits fell to Y68.9bn (Dollars 586m) from Y76.6bn in the previous year on a 1.5 per cent drop in sales to Y725bn. The company said its earnings were hit by the slump in domestic vehicle sales and by the appreciation of the yen against the dollar, which depressed the value of its US earnings. Although the company has no concrete plans for restructuring, it will be led by a new president from April who is expected to introduce significant management changes. Mr Yoichiro Kaizaki has spent most of his career in Bridgestone's diversified and relatively decentralised chemical division. He has been responsible for the rationalisation of Bridgestone's US operations at Firestone, which it acquired in the late 1980s. The company yesterday announced a sweeping change in its board, with the promotion of four executives to report directly to Mr Kaizaki. The Bridgestone group's consolidated worldwide sales were Y1,745bn, 1.1 per cent down on 1991. Consolidated after-tax net earnings rose from Y7.4bn in 1991 to Y28.4bn last year. Bridgestone/Firestone, the US subsidiary, is forecast to make a Dollars 10m profit this year, against a loss of Dollars 132m last year. Sumitomo Rubber attributed its profit increase to strong domestic sales of new products and streamlining measures. Its pre-tax profits rose by 2.3 per cent in the year to Y11.8bn. Its sales rose by 2.3 per cent to Y260bn, largely as a result of higher sales of high performance tyres.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [See "Selected Video Reports" section for TV footage.] </F>   [Text] Istanbul, May 16 (AFP)--A bomb exploded in the  administrative offices of the Turkish postal service Monday,  killing one person and injuring another, both believed to be  involved in planting the device, police said.    The afternoon blast took place in the toilets of the  building.    Another bomb which exploded in a train at Istanbul station  overnight Sunday hurt two people, also believed to be  responsible for the attack.    On Sunday a bomb attack in a cinema wounded 12 people,  including six soldiers, in Elazig, southeastern Turkey.    A Russian-made explosive device was thrown inside the cinema  premises where 140 people were watching a film. There was no  immediate claim of responsibility.    Police generally attribute blame for such attacks on the  outlawed Kurdish separatist guerrilla movement, the Kurdistan  Workers' Party.</p>

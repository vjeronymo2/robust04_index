			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Police Lieutenant General Kowit  Phakdiphum, the commissioner of the Narcotics Control Bureau,  talked about the arrest of Major General Thanat by DEA [Drug  Enforcement Administration] officials. He said that the DEA  informed him of the impending arrest just two or three days  before the arrest. The first arrests were made in Eugene,  Oregon. Then, Maj. Gen. Thanat was arrested in Hong Kong. The  two arrests were connected to each other. American officials  have confirmed that they have evidence. DEA officials asked for  our cooperation in arresting a Chinese Burmese named Mr. Lee.  Thai police officials arrested him on 9 December and extradited  him on 11 December. Most recently, DEA officials arrested the  sixth member of this gang in Oregon. None of those arrested  there were Thais.    The reporter asked if the DEA had identified any Thais as  being involved with this narcotics trafficking gang. Police Lt.  Gen. Kowit said that no such information has been provided. He  said that he had met with the head of the DEA in Thailand  earlier in the day and that they had talked about the Associated  Press report that a Thai police official was involved in this.  But the DEA official told him that they have no evidence to that  effect, unless the suspects implicate others.    The reporter asked if this arrest will tarnish Thailand's  image. Police Lt. Gen. Kowit said that this will have a good  effect, because it will show the world that Thailand is  cooperating and that we are sincere about wanting to suppress  narcotics. The United States has praised Thailand for this.    The reporter asked is the DEA had confirmed that no Thai  police officials or soldiers were involved. Police Lt. Gen.  Kowit said that none were involved. But that may not be so in  other cases, because nothing has happened yet. As far as this  case is concerned, Maj. Gen. Thanat has personal ties to Thais  living in Oregon. It's unlikely that others were involved. He  confirmed that there is strong evidence against Maj. Gen.  Thanat. He was not arrested as a scapegoat as some fear.    As the person responsible for overseeing the work of the  Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB), Mr. Amnuai  Wirawan, the deputy prime minister, said that the ONCB is doing  a good job. The arrest of a Thai general abroad has nothing to  do with the ONCB.    Mr. Amnuai said that with respect to statements by U.S.  officials that senior Thai military officers, police officials,  and civil servants are involved in narcotics trafficking  activities, the ONCB has frequently contacted international  organizations concerning suppression activities. It must be  admitted that there are some senior Thai officials who are  involved. But there are only a few such people. There are a few  bad people in every large organization. Steps must be taken to  get rid of the "rotten fish." "I don't think that this news will  tarnish the image of Thai officials, because there are many good  people in the Thai bureaucracy. The Thai Government has  constantly helped other countries suppress narcotics. If  Thailand had not made those arrests, the damage would have been  much greater. The military has never tried to pull strings to  help one of its men."    The reporter asked if the ONCB will coordinate things with  the United States and ask for the names of those senior [Thai]  officials said to be involved in narcotics trafficking  activities so that action can be taken against them. Mr. Amnuai  said that we have always cooperated with them. Thailand has  compiled a list of names, too, and some of the names appear on  both lists. Some of the names do not appear in the directory of  Thai officials but appear abroad. There is nothing unusual about  this.    Police General Prathin Santipraphop, the acting director  general of the Police Department, discussed the statement made  by General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, minister of interior, who said  that information provided by the DEA indicates that police  officers are involved in narcotics trafficking activities.  Police Gen. Prathin said that the Ministry of Interior has not  issued any instructions. If information is provided, the matter  must be investigated. The United States has not said who is on  the list. The only names that have been released are the names  of those who were arrested.    Lieutenant General Anuphap Songsunthon, the 2d Army Region  commander, said that the news that a major general has been  charged with trafficking in heroin is very disturbing. The Army  is a very large organization and so there are both good people  and bad people in it. But high-ranking officials should not be  involved in such things. Being involved in narcotics-trafficking  activities is a very serious matter. But what happened is a  personal matter. This has nothing to do with the military.    Second Lieutenant Phairot Suwannachawi, a National  Development Party member of Parliament from Nakhon Ratchasima  Province and an activist in Group 16, said that the units  concerned, that is, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ONCB,  and the Police Department, must provide clear and detailed  information to show if there are real grounds for charging a  general with being involved in heroin trafficking. Otherwise,  when senior Thai officials travel abroad, they may not be  treated with respect. He said that he once traveled abroad  together with a provincial governor and they were both stripped  and searched. This is a terrible matter. But this is a personal  matter that does not involve the military. He said that he hopes  that politicians and the mass media will think carefully before  saying anything or criticizing something.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / French consumer spending stays flat The fragile nature of France's economic recovery was underlined yesterday by the release of statistics which showed flat consumer spending on manufactured goods in December. The weak performance in December meant that fourth-quarter spending on manufactured goods contracted by 2.1 per cent compared with the July-September period, undermining hopes of a revival in demand. The statistics also raised fears of a fall in overall gross domestic product. 'The results for December were surprisingly weak,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Bros. 'They show that consumers are still very cautious in the face of rising unemployment and falling incomes.' In addition to the uncertain economic outlook, the weak consumer spending figures were blamed on the effect of increases in certain taxes. Duties on petrol and alcohol were raised, as were social security payments. 'Part of the fall in fourth-quarter spending probably reflected the delayed impact of these measures,' said one economist. Concerns about rising unemployment, which is currently in excess of 3.2m, and about the sluggish state of demand, has prompted the government to consider further measures. Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has held a series of meetings with business leaders and economic officials to discuss what action might be taken.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (AFP)--Former student democracy  leader Wang Dan called on the government later Friday to release  both Wei and Xu.    "I am surprised by these arrests and I call on the  government  to release them immediately," he told AFP by telephone.    "The situation is much more tense than last year," Wang  added, although he said he had not been troubled by the police  recently. Wang was one of the leaders of the student-led  democracy protests in 1989 in Beijing's Tiananmen Square which  ended in a bloody military crackdown.    Fellow dissident Yang Zhou said the arrest of Xu had roused  considerable concern in dissident circles. "It is a fresh  attempt to intimidate those who are fighting for democracy," he  said by telephone from Shanghai.    "It may also be an attempt to stifle any action against the  authorities during Balladur visit," added Yang, who is the  founder of the Chinese human rights association.</p>

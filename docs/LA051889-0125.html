			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INCEST VICTIM SAYS MORE AT ISSUE THAN JUDGMENT  </P> <P> A 21-year-old woman who won a $750,000 judgment in a suit against her father  says the jury's recognition of her as a victim of sexual abuse was more  important than the money.  </P> <P> "The fact that I had been wronged meant a lot to me," Jennifer Hawley said  Tuesday during a news conference at the San Diego office of her attorney, James  Scott.  </P> <P> On Monday, a San Diego Superior Court jury awarded the judgment to Hawley after  finding that her adoptive father, Ronald, caused emotional distress through  molestations.  </P> <P> The abuses occurred when Hawley was 13 years old.  </P> <P> The jury's decision followed a four-day trial and a half day of deliberations.  </P> <P> At the news conference, Hawley said she brought the suit in the hope her father  would seek and receive counseling and to try to prevent similar cases from  happening to other children.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that, from the beginning, the motivation was not the  ultimate collection (of a reward)," Scott said.  </P> <P> Hawley said her younger sister and older brother never were molested by her  father, although she said she was victimized repeatedly between Christmas,  1981, and Mother's Day, 1982, while the family lived in Vista.  </P> <P> She said she told her mother about her father's actions the day after Mother's  Day, 1982.  </P> <P> No criminal charges were filed against Ronald Hawley, reportedly because he was  the sole wage earner in the family, and the mother feared disastrous financial  consequences for the family should her husband go to jail.  </P> <P> The couple divorced after the molestations, although the family continues to  receive financial support from Ronald Hawley, who works as a civil servant.  </P> <P> Jennifer Hawley filed the suit after she turned 18.  </P></p>

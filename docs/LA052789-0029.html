			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD LOYALTY  </P> <P> Does no one in this town repay loyalty anymore?  </P> <P> We are responding to the May 10 Morning Report that Universal has decided to  replace Janet Waldo with the young singer Tiffany as the voice of Judy Jetson  in a new Jetsons movie.  </P> <P> Waldo has been the voice of Judy Jetson from the beginning of the TV series.  Just three days before this announcement we had the pleasure of meeting Waldo  at a charity function, and her enthusiasm for the movie was catching. She  signed autographs for children and enthralled them with the authentic voice of  Judy Jetson.  </P> <P> This town gets scarier every day. What's next? Shaun Cassidy in "Garfield: The  Movie"?  </P> <P> DOUGLAS and ROSANNE  </P> <P> WELCH  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

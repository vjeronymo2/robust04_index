			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "The Issue is in Safe Hands,"  AL-THAWRAH writes about the atmosphere preceding the awaited  summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill  Clinton mid-January. AL-THAWRAH says: Perhaps it is not  surprising that we are seeing desperate attempts and various  techniques to disturb the summit. In this context, we  understand Israel's statements--or rather threats--yesterday  about a military escalation in southern Lebanon on the eve of  the summit to influence its results within the framework of a  persistent endeavor to change its results or derail it.    AL-THAWRAH adds that yesterday's statements by an Israeli  military commander concerning an escalation in Lebanon and  attributing such an escalation to a Syrian wish to strengthen  its position, as he alleges, are an explicit Israeli threat to  hold Syria responsible for the consequences in advance.    AL-THAWRAH affirms that such attempts will not cease. The  Israeli circles and the media under their influence are not  short of means to put pressure on the summit in an attempt to  confuse the U.S. decisions that Clinton will carry to Geneva.  This is especially since, based on experience, they know well  who Hafiz al-Asad is and what exceptional communication skills  he possesses, skills that will enable him to convince President  Clinton of the fairness of our cause and of our nation's right  to restore the occupied territories.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Fairness and rights are the central issue  that this exceptional leader, Hafiz al-Asad, will carry to the  Geneva summit. They realize, and so does the entire world, that  Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva is not Syria's president and not an  interlocutor with Clinton on behalf of Syria. Rather, the  importance of the summit basically stems from the fact that  President al-Asad will not speak for or represent Syria alone.  Nay, he is the pan-Arab president who will carry the entire  pan-Arab issue to the table of negotiations with Clinton in  Geneva.    AL-THAWRAH adds: That is what al-Asad stands for, that is  what he represents, and that is how he dealt with the three  other U.S. Presidents with whom he met -- Nixon, Carter, and  Bush. The issues that the three other summits dealt with were  in fact comprehensive, pan-Arab issues concerning the right of  all Arabs to peace and fairness. The upcoming summit will also  be like this.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Here again, is the exceptional  importance of the upcoming Geneva summit. The entire world is  aware of the exceptional importance of this summit, and it is  definitely so.    TISHRIN comments on the recent Israeli statements expecting  an escalation of tension in southern Lebanon prior to the  Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva mid-January. TISHRIN explains that  Israel has never ceased its attacks on Lebanon. Hardly a day  goes by without a southern Lebanese village being subjected to  artillery shelling or an air raid.    TISHRIN affirms that Israel is dissatisfied with the  convocation of the Syrian-U.S. summit. This is simply because  the objective of the summit is to boost the process leading to a  comprehensive Middle East peace. Israel does not want peace.  It wants to firmly entrench the occupation, continue the  settlement activity, and drag Arab sides into separate deals,  such as the case with the Palestinian side. Israel also wants  to inflame the situation in southern Lebanon. This, the Israeli  officials believe, would help cast doubts about the usefulness  of the Syrian-U.S. summit.    TISHRIN says that if Israel is really interested in peace  rather than inflaming and exploding the situation, why does it  not accept the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and  cooperate with the U.S. initiative and international efforts to  establish a firm, durable, and comprehensive Middle East peace?  Why does Israel not help render U.S. President Bill Clinton's  move successful by declaring its readiness to fully withdraw its  troops from the occupied Arab territories and to trade these  territories with a genuine, firm peace?    TISHRIN says: Syria and Lebanon have spent two years of  talks in Washington, but they saw nothing from the Israelis  except maneuvering, procrastination, and security pretexts.  This is as if Israel's security can only be ensured by  threatening the security of Syria and Lebanon and by continuing  the occupation of their territories.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Needless to say, Israel's record  in southern Lebanon is black and full of crimes. The Lebanese  have not yet forgotten the deportation of the entire population  of the south during the recent aggression nor Israel's public  announcement that it wants to create a new refugee problem in  the Middle East. Proceeding from these facts, the Lebanese rule  out nothing. Israel is experienced in aggression and in  pretending to be an innocent victim.</p>

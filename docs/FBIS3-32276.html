			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections,  which are scheduled for 8 May 1994, monitored through 3 February.    Pedro Vallarino Cox, president of the National Renewal  Movement (Morena), has invited Ruben Blades, presidential  candidate for the Papa Egoro Movement, to support the  presidential candidacy of Ruben Dario Carles. When asked if  Morena has been set aside now that the Nationalist Liberal  Republican Movement (Molirena) has decided to name Carles as its  presidential candidate, Vallarino Cox replied: "Carles is the  Morena candidate, and I welcome the decision by other parties to  support Carles." Presidential candidate Carles has visited  David, Chiriqui Province, in the company of Molirena and Morena  sympathizers. Carles told his supporters: "I am offering a  government that will resolve problems with actions." (Panama  City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 24 Jan 94)    Tomas Cabal writes in his "Hidden Truths" column that the  candidacy of Ruben Dario Carles has gained strength now that  Molirena has decided to support him. He adds: "Many in the  Arnulfist Party and Authentic Liberal Party are also endorsing  Carles, even though those two parties are supporting Mireya de  Gruber's presidential candidacy." (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA  in Spanish 30 Jan 94 p6a)    Cesar Aparicio, secretary general of the National  Integration  Movement (Mina), announced during a news conference on 28  January that the party's rank and file members are "going to  support the presidential bid of Jose Salvador Munoz of the  Doctrinaire Panamenist Party (PPD)." Earlier, Mina President  Arrigo Guardia had thrown his support behind Molirena candidate  Carles. Aparicio added the PPD will allow certain prominent  Mina figures to run for office under the PPD banner. (Panama  City LA PRENSA in Spanish 29 Jan 94 p4)    Talking to San Miguelito residents, presidential candidate  Ruben Dario Carles has promised to upgrade social services, such  as education, health, transportation, and security. He has  said: "The Metropolitan Sanitation Directorate has sufficient  workers and equipment to collect garbage, but it is not doing  its job." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300  GMT 31 Jan 94)    During a news conference, Carles has vowed he will strive  "to  stamp out corruption, influence peddling, nepotism, and  cronyism." He has said the democratic regime that began on 20  December 1989 "has been timid about ending corruption," adding  he will take a hardline position against it with popular  support.

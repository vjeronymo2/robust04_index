			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / People: Hoechst by his own petard Wolfgang Hilger, chairman of Hoechst, will not seek election to the company's supervisory board when he retires next year, writes Christopher Parkes. His unexplained decision is a departure from German business tradition - especially strong at Hoechst - whereby top managers normally end their careers supervising the activities of their successors. The announcement followed promptly on the heels of a press report on Friday that present members of the supervisory board did not want him. The report said his conduct during a series of chemicals leaks and accidents a year ago was considered to have severely damaged the group's reputation. During late February and early April 1993, after 10 years clear of noteworthy accidents or spillages, the company reported almost 20 within less than two weeks. Hilger was condemned in the German media as an 'insensitive technocrat' after he blamed fate for the 'statistical frequency' of the accidents, which resulted in one death.</p>

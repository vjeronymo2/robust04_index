			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Hanson The more bullish medium-term profits forecasts for Hanson depend heavily on the recovery potential at Quantum Chemical. So its strong Pounds 46m profit contribution in the third quarter was particularly encouraging. As ethylene and polyethylene prices have continued to improve there should be plenty more to come. SCM Chemicals, which was lagging behind the general improvement in the first half, has also seen prices start to harden. The strong third quarter has pushed up underlying growth in operating profits from around 8 1/2 per cent in the first half to an estimated 12 per cent in the nine months. Although the third quarter was slightly flattered by comparison with an unusually weak period for Imperial Tobacco last year, the trends are strongly positive. Given the shares' high rating, the market expects nothing less. On some brokers' forecasts, the shares are on a premium to the market as far ahead as 1996. While the shares yield a fat 5.7 per cent, Hanson needs to rebuild dividend cover significantly given the cyclical nature of its businesses and the longer-term threats to Imperial Tobacco's profits. Disposals, such as the Ertl float, are revitalising the balance sheet but even at the full price suggested it is not expected to enhance earnings. Before long, some of the old Hanson magic will be required to justify the rating.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Management: Dress codes and how to wear them Lord Hanson does not like to see a speck of dandruff on the shoulders of his colleagues. At the first sign of a receding hairline or bulging midriff he sends them off to the in-house trichologist, or to the doctor to have their cholesterol levels assessed. This is one of the more interesting revelations in a new book about him by journalists Alex Brummer and Roger Cowe. On the face of it, Lord Hanson's feelings about dandruff do not matter one way or another. But what is shocking in these post-paternalist times is a boss who involves himself personally in the appearance of his staff. On closer inspection, however, Hanson may just be doing what other companies do less explicitly. Most employers do not have such meticulous standards, yet they do have a dress code that communicates itself informally. Last week Linklaters &amp; Paines made the headlines for withdrawing its ban on trousers for its women solicitors. This was only remarkable in that the rules are laid down; in other firms women - and men for that matter - learn what to wear by looking at their colleagues. I remember being outraged when a superior at my first employer, Morgan Guaranty, took me aside for a word about my appearance. I should blow-dry my hair, wear some make-up and buy one of those nice Brooks Brothers navy blue suits, she advised. At the time I took this pep-talk as evidence that I was working for an uptight American company set on crushing the individuality of its employees. What I failed to see was that to disregard a company's uniform is on a par with not getting to work on time. There is nothing wrong with companies taking an interest in their workers' wardrobes. After all, their staff are an important part of the corporate image they are trying so desperately to project. However, it is better for companies to take a lesson from Hanson and Linklaters and be as clear about the uniform as possible. A visit to the trichologist or to Brooks Brothers today is better than a missed promotion tomorrow. Still on the subject of clothes, did you know that 90 per cent of British blue-collar workers say there is nothing worse than having to wear a pair of dirty overalls? I know this because I have just received a press release from the Liverpool Business School telling me so. Yet I am puzzled. Why are MBAs researching this sort of thing? On second glance it all becomes clear: the sponsor for this 'research' was Johnson Group Cleaners. This sort of pseudo-scientific survey is little more than a (poorly) disguised means of advertising. Every week a fresh bundle lands in my in-tray, each with an arresting 'fact' written across the top and a giveaway sponsor's name across the bottom. Among the latest batch is one from a firm of caterers claiming that 90 per cent of office workers think morale would be transformed by a good staff canteen. Another shows that 83 per cent of secretaries are bored rigid at work - this from a company that runs secretarial training courses. My favourite is a survey that shows headhunters are more widely used and give more satisfaction to their clients than management consultants, accountants and most other advisers you can think of. No prizes for guessing which profession conducted that survey. Opinion polls are suspect at the best of times. But those that set out to prove an often tenuous point are so obviously partial, it is surprising that companies are optimistic enough to embark on them and that recipients are naive enough to believe them. Since I wrote about the tedious management books that sit unread on shelves, I have received a copy of an Institute of Management survey that puts managers' disregard of books in context. Less than 5 per cent of CEOs think management books are a valuable source of ideas, although consultants, the media, their customers or competitors are also given bottom marks for inspiration. When CEOs want ideas it seems they depend on managers in their own company, peers and even junior staff. I was just getting excited about these findings, and the accompanying warning that British bosses are urgently in need of external advice, when I saw that the survey had been sponsored by Mitchell Phoenix, a consultant specialising in developing chief executives. In response to that article, I have also received enough management books to fill a library from authors and publishers protesting that theirs are anything but dull. Having flipped through some of these I do not feel repentant, although I have learnt that the verb 'to manage' comes from a French root referring to dressage exercises for horses. The dictionary says that this use is obsolete, though I wonder if traces of it still remain at Hanson.</p>

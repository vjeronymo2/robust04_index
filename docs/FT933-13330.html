			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: French Lessons - Promenade Concerts The BBC Philharmonic Orchestra's contribution to this year's proms is second only in extent to that of its London sibling the BBC Symphony. The first two of the Philharmonic's five concerts occupied the Albert Hall on Saturday and Sunday; the orchestra's Principal Conductor Yan Pascal Tortelier conducted both of them - a mixed programme of showpieces in the first, Berlioz's dramatic symphony Romeo et Juliette in the second. There is no longer any need to emphasise that the BBCPO has shaken off all suggestions that it is an inferior provincial counterpart of the glamorous metropolitan bands; the reputation for serious, committed music making forged under its previous conductor Edward Downes is undoubtedly being sustained in the quality of tone and ensemble under Tortelier, even though his tastes in repertory diverge quite sharply from those of his predecessor. Tortelier unsurprisingly is most at home in French music and the novelty in the first of these proms was his own orchestration of Ravel's Piano Trio. Beautifully crafted, if a little on the sweet-toothed side, the trio was transformed into a four-movement orchestral piece of almost symphonic power and range, even if that was never enough to displace memories of the original's intimate and more delicate, subtle poetry. Tortelier followed his confection with Respighi's Pines of Rome, all Technicolor glitz and glitter and complete with real nightingales, or rather real recordings of real nightingales. What substance there was in the programme was concentrated in the first half. Cecile Ousset had provided real incisiveness in Rakhmaninov's Paganini Rhapsody, powering through the bravura and giving the lyrical pools relatively short shrift, but Tortelier had covered Tchaikovsky's Fantasy Overture Romeo and Juliet with a heavy romantic impasto, never even momentarily energising its tensions to provide the necessary dramatic contrast. In Berlioz's evening-long treatment of the same theme the next day Tortelier was generally on surer ground. There was still a tendency to over-cook the lyrical intensity, verging on mannerism in the slow, precious moulding of the Love Scene and some slightly too obvious theatrical pauses, but the faster music moved with elan, and a sureness of texture for which the orchestra also deserves much credit. The Queen Mab Scherzo came off best of all, uncomplicated extroversion of the kind which contained no hidden snares, but the solo instrumental playing was consistently reliable. The chorus was supplied by the Huddersfield Choral Society, mustering a convincing dynamic range, though a slightly smaller body of singers might have offered more flexibility, and the excellent soloists were Marie-Ange Todorovitch, Anthony Rolfe Jonhson and John Tomlinson. Tomlinson, in magnificent voice, caught the ear most strikingly; Friar Laurence's monologue was the evening's highlight, overwhelming in its power and eloquence. Royal Albert Hall and BBC Radio 3</p>

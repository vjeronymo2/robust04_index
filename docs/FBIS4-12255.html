			<p>BFN     [Text] Imprisoned leaders of the outlawed Islamic Salvation  Front [FIS] have said that they have never previously committed  themselves to issuing a appeal for halting violence in Algeria.  A statement, signed by two FIS officials who were released by  the Algerian authorities on 23 March, says that the imprisoned  FIS leaders, chief among whom are Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj,  believe that a proposal made by General Liamine Zeroual when he  was defense minister was premature and ineffective.    The FIS leaders' proposal calls for the drafting of an  appeal  urging the Algerian people to remain calm and confident. The  two FIS officials cite three conditions laid down by the FIS  leaders for a political settlement of the Algerian crisis.  These conditions may be summed up as the total release of the  front's leaders, the provision of comprehensive and detailed  information on the general situation in the country, and the  opening of a direct and comprehensive dialogue with various  parties to decide the country's destiny.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Hutchison Whampoa seeks HKDollars 4.4bn HUTCHISON Whampoa, the diversified trading company controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, yesterday sought to raise HKDollars 4.47bn (Pounds 300.5m) through a placement of 300m shares at HKDollars 14.90. Hutchison, which last week reported a loss and cut its dividend, left the market guessing as to why it needed the money. Mr Li will subscribe to 120m shares and Peregrine Capital, a company connected with Mr Li, intends to place the remaining 180m shares with 'independent third parties'. Last month, during Hutchison's acquisition of Cavendish International, Peregrine's broking subsidiary was advising international and local fund managers to sell Hutchison shares. The brokerage said Hutchison was likely to underperform the stock market in the short term, although it represented long-term value. Yesterday an analyst with Peregrine said: 'Institutions have been underweight in Hutchison. We think at these levels it offers an entry into an attractive recovery stock.' Since last Thursday's announcement of a HKDollars 78m interim loss, Hutchison executives have refused to comment. Local analysts said the statement Mr Li released with the interim results raised more questions than it answered. In particular, Mr Li's bearish comments about the performance of Hutchison's UK telecommunications subsidiary sat oddly with comments by Mr Simon Murray, the company's managing director, that it was performing well. Hutchison has lagged behind the Hong Kong market for some time. During the past year it has underperformed the market by more than 45 per cent. Since the beginning of the year, it has underperformed by 20 per cent. Last year Cheung Kong, the company through which Mr Li controls Hutchison, issued covered warrants against 273m Hutchison shares at an average price of HKDollars 17.89. Hutchison's fall into first-half losses came after a HKDollars 1.42bn write-down on its investment in Husky Oil, a Canadian oil and gas producer. A year earlier the company wrote off HKDollars 760m for a fall in the value of Husky's oil and gas reserves. Hutchison's interim dividend was cut by 20 per cent to 16 cents a share from 20 cents.</p>

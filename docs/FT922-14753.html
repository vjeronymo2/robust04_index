			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / The Titanic's tales of terror: Alexander Garrett on a famous maritime disaster IN THE afternoon of the April 15 1912, Bruce Ismay, managing director of the White Star Line, filled out a Marconi telegram form for company headquarters in New York. 'Deeply regret to advise you Titanic sank this morning 15th after collision iceberg resulting serious loss life,' he wrote. 'Further particulars later.' Ismay was aboard the rescue ship Carpathia, one of 705 survivors - 1,516 perished. But his message remained unsent until 5.50 am on the 17th, nearly two days later. The wireless telegraph was Carpathia's only contact with the world, and as its operator worked round the clock to send out messages from survivors, the signal from the White Star managing director - confirming what the world already feared - was overlooked. Today, a vessel involved in a collision would be in contact with coastguard authorities within seconds. Then, the delay caused enormous uncertainty, provoked accusations of censorship, and added one more mystery to the intrigue surrounding the disaster. On Tuesday April 14, Ismay's communique is one of 448 radio signal messages relating to the Titanic to be sold at Christie's in South Kensington, London. Together they provide a poignant chronicle of events in the world's most famous maritime disaster, 80 years ago this week. The collection is being sold by John Booth, who has exhibited them at the Titanic Signals Archive for the last three years. That these signals survived is remarkable. At the time the Titanic went down, telegraph companies kept originals of all transmitted signals for 12 months. Messages from ships involved in the Titanic disaster were assembled for the two public inquiries, one in the US, the other in London. After that, they were returned to the Marconi company where they were held in a vault until the late 1940s. When Cable and Wireless took over the Eastern Telegraph Company - as it had by then become - the signals were earmarked for destruction, but they were salvaged by an unnamed employee, whose son found them hidden in a suitcase when his father died 30 years later. Booth later acquired the signals. He is selling them now, he says, 'because my wife says they take up too much of my time'. Before the wireless was invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1896, ships communicated with each other by flags and light signals. But when the Titanic set sail from Southampton on Wednesday April 10 1912, she had the most powerful wireless yet fitted. She was one of the first liners to have two wireless operators - John Phillips and Harold Bride, both employed by Marconi - who could together provide a round-the-clock radio watch. Early in the voyage, they were busy telegraphing arrangements for passengers to meet relatives in New York. It was a lucrative business for Marconi: each message cost 30 shillings, at a time when the second wireless operator earned 50 shillings a month. It is the tone of optimism that is striking. One starts: 'Fine voyage fine ship feeling fine'. Another: 'Hardly wait to get back. Cable made me awfully happy. Love Mutzie' One, however, was more ominous. 'Westbound steamers report bergs growlers and field ice in 42 N from 49 to 51 West. April 12th Compts Barr' On April 12, the Touraine radioed to report 'dense fog and thick icefields'. Further danger signals followed from the Californian and the Caronia. One of the great unresolved questions of the disaster is why the Titanic's captain continued to sail towards the danger zone at 22 knots, especially as Harold Bride, the Titanic's surviving wireless operator, told the US inquiry that he had passed on the message from the Californian, and it had been 'personally acknowledged' by Captain Smith. Later that day a fateful message was sent: 'Sinking wants immediate assistance'. The shortcomings of the wireless - as then operated - become evident immediately following the collision with the iceberg. Unlike the Titanic, most of the ships that night had only one radio man, if any. Thomas Cottam, sole operator on the Carpathia, should have finished duty at midnight. At 12.30 he was about to retire when the first distress signal came through. The Carpathia sailed to the Titanic's aid at full speed, but it was 60 miles away, three and a half hours sailing. Another ship, the Californian, was (by its own controversial account) only 19 miles away, but its wireless operator, Cyril Evans, had gone to bed. A third vessel, the Norwegian trawler Samson, may have been even closer, but had no radio. Marconi was later asked why his apparatus did not have a bell to wake the operator. He replied: 'On the old equipment used by ships there was a bell arrangement, which did not work well because it alarmed the operators of all ships, as well as the one called.' 'Titanic struck iceberg sunk Monday 3 am. Carpathia picked up many passengers am proceeding New York. Captain Rostron.' The signals flying through the airwaves created total confusion for the press. In New York, The Evening Sun trumpeted 'All saved from Titanic after collision.' The following morning in London, the account in The Times was riddled with contradiction. After reporting that the Titanic had sunk with 'great loss of life,' it cited later that she was being towed by The Virginian to Halifax, or was heading under her own steam to New York. By the following day, April 17, the full extent of the tragedy had become clear and the recriminations began. The Times scolded the Central News Agency over a phantom wireless message which had reported everybody safe; while questions were asked about signals being 'interfered' with by 'amateur operators'. An explanation for one of the 'phantom' signals later materialised. A radio ham unwittingly merged two signals, one asking 'Are all Titanic passengers safe?' and another from the Asian announcing she was towing the German tanker Deutschland to Halifax. The result: 'Titanic passengers safe being towed to Halifax.' Before the Titanic went down, its two radio operators were given permission to leave their posts. Bride was washed overboard, but was picked up by the Carpathia. As the Carpathia headed back to New York, he assisted Cottam in sending messages from survivors. A few remained cheerful, as: 'Meet me dock with two hundred dollars underwear cap big coat. Am well but feet slightly frozen answer George.' Others were tragic: 'Mother girls safe father Charlie missing'. 'Father not seen no hope arrive Carpathia Wednesday New York. Richard.' The US inquiry made a number of recommendations about the use of radiotelegraphy on ships. But although the Titanic sinking had highlighted its shortcomings, the momentous significance of radio communication for sea-going vessels was elegiacally summed up in a Times editorial on April 16: 'But for wireless telegraphy, the disaster might have assumed proportions which at present we cannot measure; and we should have known nothing of its occurence for an indefinite period . . . The advantages conferred by this abridgment of space are enormous. No vessel need be alone, none need vanish without a sign from human ken; and in none but crushing and instant disasters need any despair of help.'</p>

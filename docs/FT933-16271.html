			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Take a train or walk, City motorists told CITY OF London workers were urged by the police and motoring organisations to leave their cars at home or face heavy delays as the experimental scheme of traffic regulation in the heart of the capital faces its first weekday morning. 'Potentially it could be a nightmare,' the RAC said. 'The cost and disruption to everyone could be enormous.' The RAC, along with several other bodies including the City of London police, yesterday issued advice to the travelling public: Leave your car at home if possible. Use trains. Rail and Underground travel is unaffected. Walk. All pedestrian routes are unaffected. Motorists crossing the Thames should avoid the City. Do not expect any extra parking spaces in the boroughs on the fringes of the City. Allow an extra 30 minutes if travelling through the City in a car or bus. Forget your old routes and follow the diversion signs. Do not attempt to drive around or through the temporary barriers - driving irregularly could set off a security alert. Tune into your local radio station to find routes to avoid. LBC, on 97.3 FM and 1152 kHz, has travel news from 6am and bulletins every 10 minutes until 9am. Capital Radio has regular traffic reports from 6am on 95.8 FM. Use the traffic hotline. The Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, is providing a hotline in conjunction with the City Police for traffic information only on 071 332-3555, from 6am to 5pm today and from 9am to 5pm tomorrow. Check that your usual bus has not been re-routed. A bus information hotline is on 071 222-1234. Buses affected include 8, 15, 15B, 15X, 17, 22A, 22B, 25, 26, 35, 42, 47, 48, 78, 141, 149, 172, 214, 271, 344, 505, D1, D9, D11 and night buses N8, N26 and N83.</p>

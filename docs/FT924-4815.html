			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Mafia's wages of sin under attack: Asset seizures are spearheading Italy's war on organised crime THE Italian authorities have seized Mafia assets worth L1,900bn (Pounds 903m) so far this year. Of this, all but L200bn has been seized during the past five months, since Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, took office, according to the Interior Ministry. The most recent case involved L500bn held in 62 companies, property, bonds and shares and in 200 foreign bank accounts belonging to the Madonia family, one of the most powerful clans in Palermo. Police are still assessing the value of cash and securities in the now frozen accounts. The sharp increase in the scale of asset seizures is just one aspect of the way the Italian state has finally gone on the offensive against organised crime. 'We are no longer defensive; we have gone on to the attack,' says Mr Nicola Mancino, the Christian Democrat interior minister. This was begun by Mr Enzo Scotti, his predecessor; but the public outcry over the assassinations of the two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, this year has placed the fight against crime at the top of the five-month-old Amato government's agenda. It is perhaps the first time since the Mussolini era that the state has made a concerted effort to combat the Mafia. Government policy has five main elements, according to Mr Mancino: tougher legislation; a more efficient justice machine; greater police investigative powers; greater attention to attacking Mafia wealth; and increased use of 'super-grass' testimony. The legislation being applied to the Mafia is basically re-directed anti-terrorist policy employed in the 1970s. Police now have great freedom to hold and interrogate Mafia suspects. At the same time, some 160 key Mafia figures have been kept in two high-security isolation jails instead of conducting business freely behind bars in jails near their homes as in the past. In Sicily itself 7,000 troops have been helping anti-Mafia operations since the summer. The long-awaited special section of the judiciary dedicated to dealing with the Mafia, which Mr Falcone was due to head, was put in place last month. The new structure should make it more difficult for the Mafia to find 'crooked' judges' and court clerks (the latter often prevented cases going before the judges by exploiting bureaucratic loop-holes). Also operative, albeit in start-up phase, is the 1,200-strong investigative/intelligence unit (DIA) based on America's Federal Bureau of Investigation and recruited from the police, Carabinieri and Guardia di Finanze. Poorly co-ordinated intelligence and inter-service rivalries have often played into the Mafia's hands. The police have become more determined since they have seen politicians turning against the Mafia, the courts more prepared to sentence, and the public readier to co-operate. But the real breakthrough has been as a result of a conscious decision to use the testimony of super-grasses, the pentiti. 'We now have over 200 pentiti,' says Mr Mancino. 'Some have agreed to talk after negotiating while on the run; most are already in prison facing long sentences; and there have been instances of people being moved to talk because they disagree with the tactics adopted in the killing of Falcone.' The state is offering both money and protection to these pentiti and their families, including a new life outside Italy. These are big incentives. It also seems that the violent rise of Toto Riina to head the Cosa Nostra in Sicily, using a dictatorial, as opposed to the traditional consensual, approach, has alienated many and encouraged them to talk. The emphasis on asset seizures is also new. 'We must hit them where it hurts most - in the pocket,' says Mr Mancino. It is up to those who have had their assets seized to prove they were legally acquired. If not they are formally confiscated and sold. It remains to be seen who has the courage to buy the assets of a well-known mafioso. Behind all this lies the beginnings of a potentially explosive investigation into the political cover which the Mafia has always enjoyed. This has been its ultimate strength. Tommaso Buscetta, Italy's best known pentito, last month gave a tantalising foretaste of this shadowy connection which could explain many of the country's mysteries - not least the assassination of Aldo Moro, a former prime minister. Buscetta has chosen to speak now on the Mafia's links with the politicians because he believes their hold can be broken.</p>

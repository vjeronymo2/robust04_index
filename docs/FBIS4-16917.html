			<p>BFN     [Text] Azeri President Heydar Aliyev has reported that the  Armenian offensive in the zone of the Karabakh conflict that was  launched right after the CIS summit ended in Moscow, "is the  strongest one over the past period."    Addressing a conference in Baku with the government members  and heads of the local administration, the president said that  the "force and the character of the Armenian military operations  indicate that the Armenians get military support from the  outside." "Their military operations are being prepared by  professional military experts," said Aliyev.    He said that the Azeri army rebuffs the aggressor.  Azerbaijan has only one way out -- to defend itself and  strengthen the country's defense potential.    He ordered that military commissariat to recruit additional  soldiers within 10 days. Aliyev said that by his decree he  dismissed three leaders of local military departments. The  president ordered that the defense minister demote these chiefs  and send them to fight on the frontline.    The president said that from now on the branches of the  "power" ministries in the regions should be subordinate to the  heads of the local administration. He said this was being done  to improve the interaction between the representatives of the  administrative-states local bodies.</p>

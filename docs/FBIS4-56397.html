			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Most Controversial Issues"; </F> approved during a PT party convention on 1 May]    [Text] Land Reform -- This is a priority for Lula. It will  be immediately implemented after his inauguration, if he wins.  The PT plans to immediately resolve the problem of rural  workers camping along highways. Some 19,000 families live under  such conditions. A definitive land reform will be implemented  over a 15-year period. The program provides for the distribution  of land and an agricultural policy to assist 3 million landless  families. The state will provide technical assistance and  invest in techniques for using the soil.    Minimum Salary -- Lula has promised to raise the minimum  salary to $300 toward the end of his mandate. The proposal was  made by the PT Struggle faction, but was not backed even by CUT  [Sole Workers Center] President Jair Meneguelli, who abstained  from referring to the issue, or by Rio Grande de Sul Deputy  Paulo Paim, who is the former president of the Labor Committee.  The PT plenary session preferred to back the original text of  the proposed program, which provides for "the gradual, steady  increase of the minimum salary. In real terms, it seeks to  double its value in the shortest possible time, reaching the  level indicated by DIEESE [Interunion Department for Statistics  and Socioeconomic Studies] ($350) at a later stage." Sao Paulo  Deputy Aluizio Mercadante, the main economist of the PT bloc,  justified the decision on the grounds that the program mentions  no quantities. He added: "The growth rate of the minimum salary  will be established by the process. It cannot be defined in the  party's identification badge." The PT believes establishing a  value might become a trap and a target for attacks from  adversaries. "If the salary reaches $295, they will say the  government did not fulfill its promise," Meneguelli noted. "We  cannot advocate wishful thinking," Paim said.    Abortion -- The PT decided to soften the abortion issue in  its program. The text advocating the legalization of abortion  was replaced by a general statement that limits itself to  advocating the use of the public health network for abortion  cases provided for by law (rape and life risk for the mother).  Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino justified the change, saying:  "The campaign should take into account the balance of power and  society's level of understanding and conscience."    Homosexuals -- The 9th PT Convention did not debate the  proposal on marriage between homosexuals. The basic text of the  program was eliminated. The text carries a general statement  saying the future government should take the initiative to  propose legal measures permitting marriage between homosexuals.  The PT withdrew the proposal from the program.    Government -- The PT proposes creation of the Ministries of  Employment and Social Security to replace the Ministries of  Labor, Social Security, and Social Welfare. The Presidency of  the Republic will be strengthened with an increased number of  secretariats and with a reduction in the number of ministries.  Mercadante is the most likely candidate for the Finance  Ministry, although economists Paulo Nogueira Batista and Maria  de Conceicao Tavares, and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party] Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Serra have also been mentioned. PT  economist Paul Singer might be designated to the Planning  Ministry.    Anti-Imperialism -- The effort to defeat the radicals broke  one of the bases of the PT's three-point anti-imperialist  program (moratorium, fight against monopolies, fight against  latifundia). In its party program, the PT defines itself as a  socialist party that favors breaking with the IMF. The program  does not mention the "anti-imperialist fight." Marcos Sokol, of  the PT Struggle faction said: "This is discouraging for party  members. One of our stronger principles has been affected."</p>

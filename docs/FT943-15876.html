			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Accountancy Column: A freedom too far in the regulated industries - Anthony Carey and Martin Cave consider weaknesses in accounting standards setting and recommend how best to improve them They are among the largest companies in the UK, they enjoy some monopoly rights, and virtually all of us are their customers. Yet accounting standards setters seem hardly to have noticed the existence of the regulated industries. The accounting practices of the privatised utilities in the telecommunications, gas, electricity and water industries, as well as BAA (formerly British Airports Authority), are the subject of a new study* which calls for substantial reforms. The absence of a structured accounting framework dealing with issues of substantial importance to regulated companies, coupled with the regulators' lack of disclosure about how allowable price rises are determined, means that companies have wide discretion over the financial information that they place in the public domain. Some of the changes that have been made since or at the time of privatisation have had the objective of bringing the accounting practices of privatised utilities more in line with those of the private sector. For example, in preparation for privatisation, BT ceased to capitalise several types of expenditure and eliminated a supplementary replacement cost depreciation charge from their accounts. British Gas increased the life of many of its assets. BAA has capitalised interest costs incurred in the construction of fixed assets, reclassified some freehold properties as investment properties and extended its airport terminal and runway lives. The various regulated companies have had to cope with two potentially conflicting sets of demands: to show their performance in a positive light to the capital markets, without at the same time giving their regulators the impression that profits are too high. In the case of BAA, which is less in the public eye than the other privatised utilities, it seems clear that the main focus has been on market perceptions. This also seems to be the case for BT, although it has followed fairly constant accounting policies since privatisation. For the more recently privatised water and electricity companies, regulatory considerations would appear to have had a bigger impact on the way in which they have presented accounting information. Ofwat, the water regulator, has taken a significant degree of interest in accounting matters and - unlike other regulators - has published guidelines on Accounting for Current Costs which deals with the form, content and principles of current cost accounts for the water industry. Large price increases have been permitted in the water industry because of the heavy capital expenditure programme currently under way. It would be helpful to know whether the regulator plans to 'claw back' any of these increases in the future: in other words, whether any of the revenue was 'advanced' to the companies to generate the necessary cash flows. If so, the most appropriate accounting treatment would probably be to treat the element advanced as deferred income in the accounts to be spread over future years. Making profit forecasts at the time of privatisation was very difficult for the regional electricity companies. The challenges included uncertainties created by the reorganisation of the industry, the introduction of new management, and the difficulties in forecasting future energy prices due to the Gulf crisis and the unpredicted severity of the winter that followed privatisation. Managers and their advisers were, as a result, understandably cautious in estimating future profits. But many of the potential problems did not materialise, and so many electricity companies exceeded forecasts substantially. In these circumstances, it is perhaps not surprising that they seem to have adopted a conservative approach to the recognition of profits, such as establishing pension and other provisions and in not anticipating under-recoveries of income. A thorny issue requiring resolution is the current cost carrying amount of assets acquired at privatisation. In the water, gas and electricity industries, these were sold at a substantial discount to their replacement cost. It is unlikely regulators will allow a cumulative return equal to this figure. If the regulators provided information on the return they were willing to permit on these assets, the figures could be included in the accounts at their recoverable amount rather than, as at present, at a replacement cost in excess of this number. We believe that the public interest would be best served if the terms of the implicit regulatory contract that exists between the company and the regulator were more explicitly stated. As much as possible of the accounting information used to determine the price-setting formula for regulated companies should also be made publicly available. Specifying the terms of the regulatory contract would ensure that the role of the accounts as the public memory of the regulatory system would be enhanced. It would then be less easy for regulators to overturn the commitments of their predecessors. The regulatory contract should be separately formulated for each industry but deal with the following issues: 'Tilting' (advancing) of revenues. The regulators should indicate the amount involved in individual cases, the period over which the advances are to be made and the length of the subsequent claw-back period. Valuation of assets held at privatisation. Each regulator should indicate the return that the regulated companies will be allowed, and their valuation should reflect how the discount on assets at privatisation should be treated. Treatment of efficiency gains. Regulators should indicate how such gains are to be measured, the proportion of the surplus profits the companies will be allowed to retain, and the period over which they will be allowed to retain them. In addition to developing more transparent regulatory contracts, the quality of regulatory accounting information should be further improved by the introduction of new standards. The core information for regulatory decision-making should be that published in audited regulatory accounts. The accounts should be prepared on a current cost basis applying financial capital maintenance principles, which provide the best information on the real returns being earned by shareholders. Individual industries should be required to justify any special accounting treatments unique to them by reference to their identifiable circumstances. Standards should deal with topics that include accounting for fixed assets, revenue advances, and the need to provide a reconciliation from the figures in the regulatory accounts to those in the statutory accounts. Regulatory standards should be issued by a body under the joint auspices of the Accounting Standards Board and the industry regulators or by a body established by the latter. Regulatory accounts should be brought within the aegis of the Financial Reporting Review Panel. These proposals should ensure that a clear and more useful set of information would exist in the public domain on the special features of accounting for regulated industries.

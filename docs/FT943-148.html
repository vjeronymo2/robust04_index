			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Whitbread gets Pounds 27m for shares in brewers Whitbread, the brewing, retailing and leisure group, yesterday folded the 'Whitbread umbrella,' its 40-year-old portfolio of stocks in regional brewers designed to protect them from takeover. The remaining shares in the portfolio were sold to a new investment trust for Pounds 27m. The purchase by Lazard Brewers Investment Trust, launched yesterday by Lazard Brothers, attracted criticism, however, from some analysts. Instead of buying the shares at a discount typical in such transactions, the trust bought them at the market mid-price. 'Lazard is paying a very full price,' one analyst said. If Whitbread had tried to sell the stake in each brewer in the market it would have probably received a lower price, he added. 'A conventional placing would have got them less.' Mr Peter Rintoul, director of investment trusts at Lazard, said buying at the mid-point between the bid and ask prices was appropriate. 'As a long-term investor, we viewed the package in the round. The portfolio is well diversified by product and geography.' Moreover, some of the stocks were not publicly traded. If the trust had tried to buy the shares in the market, prices would have risen, he added. The portfolio bought yesterday includes shares in HP Bulmer, the cider maker and brewers WH Brakspear, Hardys and Hansons and Joseph Holt. Whitbread had sold the bulk of its regional brewing shares in March for Pounds 225m in a 'bought deal' with BZW. The shares sold yesterday had been omitted from that transaction because they were deemed to be harder to sell. 'The existence of the trust has been useful,' Whitbread said yesterday. Lazard is offering 125m ordinary shares at 25p and 25m warrants in units of five ordinary shares and one warrant at Pounds 5 a unit. The trust will be managed by Mr Billy Whitbread, for the past five years investment manager of Whitbread Investment Company. Subscriptions close on October 22. Mr Alan Perelman, Whitbread's finance director, said the sale would release capital for organic expansion. 'We continue to have excellent trading relationships with all the companies involved.'</p>

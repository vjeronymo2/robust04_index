			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / People: Whitehouse leaves a year between Halifax and NatWest On Monday, Mike Whitehouse will take up the new post of director of operations for National Westminster bank's UK branch business. He signed his contract a year to the day since he left the Halifax building society. Whitehouse, 47, left the Halifax, the UK's largest building society, after 28 years - 25 of them dealing with information technology, and the last three as operations director and a main board director. He joined the society straight from school in Halifax, on the advice of his headmaster, having found that he was too young to join Customs &amp; Excise. When he joined, the number of employees in the information technology department was just five: now it is about 700. 'Information technology was the engine room of the business,' he says. He sees his job at NatWest as similar to the task he was performing at the Halifax: being responsible for mainline products, strengthening the organisation's position in the retail sector, and improving its distribution system. 'Halifax is a bank in all but name,' he says, adding that he does not think he will find a very different atmosphere when he moves from a building society to a bank. He believes he will be much more in tune with the ethos of NatWest than he had become with the Halifax, describing the bank as 'realistic and hands-on'. He also highlights the 'young culture' of the bank - Derek Wanless, group chief executive, is just 46 - and says it has defined what it wanted to achieve much more clearly than the Halifax had done. Having agreed when he left the Halifax not to work for a major competitor for a year, Whitehouse became a non-executive director of the Skipton building society, the 14th largest society, at the beginning of September; he resigned that post just a month later. Although he had had no personal contacts at NatWest, the bank, having seen his record at the Halifax, approached him direct.</p>

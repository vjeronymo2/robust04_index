			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: ICI forms Turkish tie-up IMPERIAL Chemical Industries has formed its first pharmaceuticals joint venture in Turkey. The link with Abdi Ibrahim, a medium-sized pharmaceuticals concern, initially capitalised at Pounds 500,000, will market and distribute seven ICI products. The company will concentrate on antiseptic drugs which account for 60 per cent of the market, which in 1991 was worth Dollars 1bn. The operation is expected to create 400 jobs. The move signals growing foreign interest in Turkey's pharmaceutical sector, despite lingering concern over lack of patent protection and other issues. Annual per capita drug consumption is just Dollars 15.</p>

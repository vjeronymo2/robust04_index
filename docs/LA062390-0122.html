			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI OFFICER SAYS HIGHER-UPS ORDERED BEATINGS  </P> <P> A tearful Israeli colonel broke down during his court-martial Friday, saying  his commanders abandoned him to face charges that he ordered his soldiers to  beat and break the limbs of Palestinians.  </P> <P> "Yes. I said beat them on the limbs and then release them," Israel Radio quoted  Col. Yehuda Meir, 38, as telling three military judges when asked if he had  given orders to break Arabs' bones during the uprising in Israeli-occupied  territories.  </P> <P> But he said he was carrying out orders that then-Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin  issued in January, 1988. Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, former army chief in the West  Bank and Meir's commanding officer, has testified that he did not recall such  orders.  </P> <P> Israel Radio said when asked by his lawyer how he felt about his commander's  testimony, Meir broke down crying and said: "They've abandoned me. They've  thrown me to the dogs."  </P> <P> Rabin defended his policy in a radio interview Friday.  </P> <P> "I ordered the army at that stage, after a time of heavy use of firearms which  did not bring results, that units fighting violent riots . . . should go in and  beat the demonstrators to control them as long as the riots continue.  </P> <P> "I didn't use the phrase 'break bones,' " he said.  </P> <P> The radio also quoted Meir as comparing Israeli soldiers fighting the uprising  to Lebanese Christian militiamen who massacred Palestinian refugees at the  Sabra and Chatilla camps in 1982 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.  </P> <P> "The army began to act like hooligans. The distance between this and what the  Falangists (militiamen) did was small," the radio quoted him as saying.  </P> <P> Meir is the highest-ranking officer to be tried for offenses against Arabs  during the 30-month-old uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> In seven felony counts, he is accused of ordering soldiers to smash the arms  and legs of Palestinians in the West Bank villages of Beita and Hawwara in  January, 1988.  </P> <P> Meir's men are alleged to have rounded up about 21 Palestinians named as  agitators by the Shin Bet secret police, taken them into nearby fields and then  beaten them with rifles and clubs. At least 12 reportedly suffered broken  limbs.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Meir had testified that Rabin instructed senior officers: "You do  the work, I'll deal with the press and the law."  </P></p>

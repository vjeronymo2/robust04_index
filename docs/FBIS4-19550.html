			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F> Daniele Vimercati in Milan; date not given: "This Antifascism  Smells of Fascism"]    [Excerpt] [introductory passage omitted] [Vimercati] Bossi,  are you sure that you want to take part in celebrations that  will be monopolized by the Left.    [Bossi] A decision will be made at the national council  tonight. I think that the League will be there.    [Vimercati] Independently or together with the ANPI  [National  Association of Italian Partisans] and other political forces?    [Bossi] I only know that Formentini and Pivetti, that is the  mayor of Milan and the Chamber of Deputies speaker, could be  present. If they are there it will be the celebration of all  the Milanese people.    [Vimercati] Does it seem worth inconveniencing the public  authorities for a celebration that brings old divisions back to  mind?    [Bossi] We must come to an agreement on words here. It is  absurd to divide ourselves on a fascism that has been dead and  buried for 50 years now. However, another kind of fascism still  lives on and this is represented by the old regime. A  clubby-type of regime supported by the DC [Christian Democratic  Party] and the Left.    [Vimercati] Do you want to demonstrate against this kind of  fascism?    [Bossi] Precisely. The partisans fought for liberty but  these ideals have remained on paper, buried under a centrist  state that was supported by a diarchy, the DC and the Left.    [Vimercati] However, at this moment the Left is relaunching  antifascism.    [Bossi] This paradox must be overturned. On 25 April  [Liberation Day] the gentlemen of the Left should all be out  crying because their fascism died at the latest elections. They  were the ones who resurrected fascism and led it by the hand to  this point. They were the ones who legitimated [National  Alliance leader] Fini during the election campaign. And now  they dare to chatter about antifascism.    [Vimercati] Are you not afraid that the 25 April  demonstrations could unleash tension and generate violence,  especially if there are counterdemonstrations?    [Bossi] I am not afraid of this. We will certainly be on the  alert. But if a popular force like the League is out there, the  gentlemen who still resort to old methods like bombs to support  the old regime will have to retreat. They will not succeed this  time.    [Vimercati] Who, according to you, would have any reason to  launch an attack at this time?    [Bossi] I do not know, I do not believe in this hypothesis  very much today. It is useless to fly high and to look for  contorted solutions. I think that the reason behind what is  happening is very simple and for all to see: The defeated Left  will not reconcile itself to being defeated and is using  antifascism as a means of entering the field again.    [Vimercati] Perhaps with the aid of the old DC?    [Bossi] The DC does not exist any longer, I think that the  antifascist by name, but fascist in practice, reaction is being  led by the former communists and their friends. And do you know  why?    [Vimercati] No, why?    [Bossi] For the simple reason that the old regime was  leftist, statist, and totalitarian, even though it contained a  force like the DC which proclaimed itself a centrist force. In  reality, it expected to get votes from all sides, even from the  Right, to take them to the Left.    [Vimercati] But what do you mean precisely when you talk  about fascism?    [Bossi] I am thinking of a totalitarian ideology, of the  frenzied power of a centralist state in which everything becomes  subordinate to its own interests: the desires of the people,  liberty, cultural and economic pluralism. In this sense fascism  became incarnated in the Mussolini regime and then in the  clubby- type DC and PCI [Italian Communist Party] regime. Two  sides of the same coin: the first, a dictatorship where cudgels  were used, has disappeared; the second, a soft dictatorship, is  still insidiously present. The League has launched its  successful war of liberation against this. It is an unrelenting  war against modern fascism, the basis of party dictatorship.    [Vimercati] There is a paradox in what you are saying. This  war has placed you in government with the MSI [Italian Social  Movement], which has never denied its fascist roots.    [Bossi] I repeat, the old fascism is dead and buried. We  should not be fighting against ghosts, but against real dangers.  In any case, with the League in the government we will be the  best guarantee against any totalitarian or fascist temptations.  We know very well that some forces are trying to recycle the  waste of the party system. They will never succeed as long as  we are around. These restorers have the League breathing down  their backs.    [Vimercati] You say that the DC no longer exists. But there  is the PPI [Italian Popular Party.    [Bossi] If this is the case, even Forza Italia picked up  pieces of the old system. However, at this point the party that  once existed, the permanent force that occupied the state, will  not return. The League will prevent the fragments from  reuniting.    [Vimercati] What do you mean?    [Bossi] Simple. The PPI will never become part of the  government as a political force. We will not permit this. We  succeeded in breaking the CAF [Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani] into two  and we will not let it reunite. The former DC will remain  outside. If Berlusconi wants to take somebody on, he can help  himself. But not all the party: the old DC must not rise  again. It must not return to the buildings from which we chased  it away.</p>

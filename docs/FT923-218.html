			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Observer: Unfair view Red faces at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales yesterday. Three academics it had sponsored to carry out research on the role of auditors came up with the wrong result. The daring dons did not exactly stick to the party line, suggesting instead that audit regulation should be wrested away from the Institute to an independent 'office for auditing' (Offaudit?). Rather than blaming the public for the so-called 'expectations gap' - the difference between what is expected of them and what they actually do - auditors should actually extend their responsibilities to include the detection of material fraud. More radical still, says the report, auditors should be appointed and their fees determined externally, and not by those on whom they are reporting - the directors of a company. The Institute could hardly be said to have presented a 'true and fair' view of the contents of the report. In the accompanying three-page press release, it only mentions these recommendations halfway down the second page - though they come bang at the front of the actual report - and then rebuts them at equal length.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Polish President Lech Walesa arrived in Vilnius  Tuesday for a two-day official visit.    Following the welcoming ceremony at the airport, Walesa and  his entourage went to the Antakalnis city cemetery where they  paid tribute to the memory of those killed for the freedom and  independence of Lithuania. Then the Polish president met  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas.    A treaty "On Friendly Relations and Neighborly Cooperation  Between Lithuania and Poland" is expected to be signed on  Tuesday. Its draft was prepared for several years.    The differences in views on the historic developments taking  place 70 years ago were the main obstacle in preparing the  treaty. The Lithuanian side wanted that the period from 1920 to  1939, when Vilnius and its suburbs were part of Poland, be  described in the treaty as "occupation". The Polish side  disagreed with the wording.    The speaker of the Lithuanian Parliament told Interfax  before  the visit that the arrival of Walesa and the signing of the  Lithuanian-Polish treaty should put an end to the past relations  and become the basis for the development of good relations in  the future. He said that the visit by the Polish leader would  help an early integration of Lithuania into the European  structures, the development of a mutually advantageous  cooperation between the two states.    According to the Lithuanian statistics, in 1993 Lithuania  exported to Poland goods to the sum of about $33.6 million which  is 2.8 pct of total export. The country imported goods from  Poland to the tune of about $9.1 dollars (about 0.7 pct of total  imports).</p>

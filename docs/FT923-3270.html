			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Motoring: The cheap new Bentley: just Pounds 91,000 - Stuart Marshall enjoys a brief taste of the Brooklands YOU COULD, I suppose, describe the new Brooklands saloon as Bentley's entry model; an upper-crust equivalent of a Vauxhall Cavalier or Ford Sierra L. And, compared with the Pounds 168,294 tag on the Bentley Continental R, the Pounds 91,489 list price of the Brooklands is quite modest, even though it is more than Pounds 6,000 dearer than the Bentley Eight it replaces. Rolls-Royce Motors, which makes Bentleys, believes the Pounds 91k price will not frighten off the punters. It says the Brooklands is 'squarely targeted to appeal to luxury car buyers who may not have considered purchasing a new Bentley before.' If they are tempted, and the money is available, what will they get? Probably the best combination of refinement, performance and value Rolls-Royce Motors has offered. In the past, I have criticised Rolls-Royces for their soggy handling, and the firmer-sprung Bentleys for their tyre thump on less-than-perfect roads. I take none of it back. But a brief drive of the Brooklands suggested that the newly-developed suspension damping, controlled by micro-computer, has achieved the best of both worlds. The big car rides silently and shock-absorbently but drives with a new and rewarding crispness. Of course, covering only a few miles in rural Surrey and Hampshire, with four people taking turns at the wheel, is a taste, not a test. Even so, I reckon its handling and roadholding would satisfy many a well-heeled business motorist who previously has driven only Jaguar, BMW 7-Series or Mercedes-Benz S-Class saloons. No one, though, would seriously consider buying a Bentley Brooklands just because it goes and handles well. Its appeal is more subtle. The hand-built interior, trimmed (and perfumed) by Connolly hide, Wilton-carpeted and decorated liberally with flawless wood veneer, is what sets it apart even from the cream of volume-produced motor cars. The Brooklands, named after the famous old circuit on which cars raced for the last time in 1939, looks much better from the front than the Bentley Eight. It has a vertically slatted radiator grille, not one looking as if it were made from silver-plated wire netting. Bentley aficionados (although probably no one else) will notice the Brooklands has a seamless bonnet instead of one with an apparent hinge down the middle. The selector for the four-speed automatic transmission  - bought from General Motors in the US but with Bentley's own control system and as smooth as you would expect - is on the centre console, not the steering column. The 15-inch alloy wheels, shod with sensibly proportioned 70 series Avon tyres that make their own contribution to the Bentley's nimbleness, are also new. Otherwise, nothing really has changed. The engine remains a 6.75-litre V8 of undisclosed output; the detailing, as always, is as good as painstaking craftsmen can make it; and the car is still a heavyweight at 2.35 tonnes. Rolls-Royce Motors can never hope to match the sheer technology of producers like Daimler-Benz with Pounds 1m a day research and development budgets. It does, though, take small but continuous steps in product improvement. They show in the Brooklands, which is a significantly better car to drive than the Eight. Bentley (and Rolls-Royce) brand loyalty must be the envy of many lesser marques; eight in 10 owners expect to buy another. 'We shall have to work on the other 20 per cent,' says Michael Donovan, the managing director (commercial). There are some signs of growth in the luxury car market and he says it has benefited from the appearance of 'powerful new entries at the bottom of the sector from Japan' as well as 'moves up-market by other mass producers such as Mercedes.' Rolls-Royce, which makes more Bentleys than Rolls-Royces, delivered 160 cars in Britain last month (including 21 Continental R coupes worth Pounds 3.5m retail) against 138 last year. While the Brooklands - which replaces the Mulsanne S as well as the Eight - might not overtake the Pounds 116,265 Turbo R as the marque's best seller, I would put my money on it as runner-up.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / People: Sell to encourage French leave Heading Britain's tourist organisations is not everyone's idea of fun. Tourism has not traditionally been a UK government priority. State funding for tourism is constantly under threat. Adele Biss, a former PR consultant, agreed to become chairman of the British Tourist Authority last May. This week she announced that Anthony Sell is to be its chief executive. Sell, 50, joins the BTA from Paris, where he has been managing director of the continental European operations of Thomas Cook, the travel and financial services group. Sell comes to the job with no illusions. He does not expect the government to become substantially more generous in funding the authority. However, he had discussions with officials before deciding to take up the job; he does think they value the authority's work. All the same, it took him five months to make up his mind to accept the post, which has been vacant since April. His predecessor, Michael Medlicott, left to join Delta Air Lines. Sell brings to the post substantial experience of other countries and cultures. He speaks five languages other than English: Russian, French, German, Italian and Serbo-Croat. He also reads Spanish. Before joining Thomas Cook, he was a director of Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the instrument-maker and musical publisher, where his responsibilities included a French clarinet factory and four European music festivals. Sell says his principal task will be to convey the variety of Britain's tourist offerings to potential visitors. He has been struck during his time in Paris by the number of French visitors to the UK who have told him they had no idea how beautiful the Lake District was or how much there was to do outside London. Some have complained to him that they had to drive on the left. Although that is unlikely to change to accommodate French tourists, he says more must be done to help non-English speaking visitors find their way around.</p>

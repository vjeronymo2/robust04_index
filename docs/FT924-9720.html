			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: Glorious Ninth Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the 'Choral', is not long enough to fill an evening, but what to play before it is always a puzzle. At the Barbican on Sunday, the conductor Libor Pesek opted for something completely different: his countryman Bohuslav Martinu's late, almost unknown Rhapsody-Concerto for viola. The soloist was one of the London Symphony's two viola-Principals, Paul Silverthorne. This was one of those occasions when an unfamiliar work bears the unarguable stamp of devoted preparation. The concerto has just two movements, each of them lyrically ruminative at unhurried tempi. The homely, wistful air of the first gives way in the second, however, to a darker elegiac tone and a sharp sense of loss. This performance conveyed all that with penetration and dignity. Nonetheless, a really distinguished 'Choral' must erase from memory anything that has gone before. While it lasted, Pesek's 'Choral' achieved that superbly. Though the LSO and their Chorus were on splendid form, and young Michael Druiett's imposingly large bass led a fine solo quartet (with Nancy Gustafson, Linda Finnie and Dennis O'Neill), it was Pesek's confident, self-effacing hand that secured the triumph. This was the most satisfying, un-quirky, beautifully gauged Ninth that I've heard in several years. Nothing was forced, least of all the orchestra's tone. The peaks of the score were reached by calmly assured ascents. All the instrumental voices were encouraged to sing, which ensured a luminous polyphony - not just in the Scherzo, where clarity is relatively easy (and Kurt-Hans Goedicke proved yet again to be a peerless master of Beethoven's timpani-part), but in the recherche thickets of the opening Allegro and the grand Adagio. Keen music-lovers have long admired Pesek's smooth, soft-grained subtlety, but his liquid command of this noble score demonstrated a rare authority that one mightn't have imagined. The chock-full house was hugely appreciative; it was heartening to find that a 1990s audience can be moved by a purely musical Ninth, without theatrical Semtex. Sponsored by JVC (UK) Limited</p>

At the same time Baku asserts that it was MIG-21 but not  SU-19 aircraft. According to Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, the  aircraft was shot down not above Armenia's Vardeniz region but  above the village of Yanshag in the north of Azerbaijan's  Kelbadjar region.    Baku has no information about the fate of the pilot.    Earlier Armenian sources reported that Armenian air defense  forces shot down a SU-19 fighter and captured the pilot. They  asserted that the aircraft had violated Armenia's air space.    The Defense Ministry also reported that Marat Ishkenov, a  45-year old resident of Kyrgyzstan, a retired officer, and a  Tatar by nationality was the pilot of this aircraft. He  allegedly reported that every month he received salary in the  Azerbaijani army totalling $1000 and $300 per every combat  flight.</p>

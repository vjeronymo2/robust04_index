			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> CARRIER RESIGNS OVER UNDELIVERED MAIL  </P> <P> A part-time letter carrier known as a fast worker resigned from his job this  week after postal inspectors found more than 3,600 pieces of undelivered mail  in his car. Roy Castillo, 24, a South Natomas relief rural carrier associated  with the U.S. Postal Service since May, resigned Wednesday after allowing  postal investigators to search his car, postal spokeswoman Pat Locke said  Friday.  </P> <P> Under the front seat and in the trunk were 3,618 pieces of undelivered mail,  some carrying postmarks three weeks old, Locke said. "The (postal) supervisor  discovered he was not delivering what we call bulk business mail -- what some  people refer to as junk mail," Locke said. In addition to 2,200 advertising  circulars, Castillo had failed to deliver nearly 100 first-class letters,  including 81 greeting cards; 160 magazines, and more than 1,000 third-class  political mailers, she said.  </P></p>

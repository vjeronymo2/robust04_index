			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: SAS to axe 2,900 jobs in shake-up Scandinavian Airlines System intends to cut 2,900 full-time jobs, one in seven of its workforce, as part of an intensified cost-cutting drive. The aim is to slash costs by almost SKr3bn (Dollars 374m) by the middle of next year to restore profitability and meet increased competition. The airline, which has made a loss in each of the past four years, also plans to streamline group organisation, close routes and reduce the number of aircraft types operated. Two models, the Boeing 737 and Saab 340, will disappear from its fleet. SAS said the moves would assist future expansion plans and allow it to enter alliances or co-operation agreements with other airlines. SAS is looking to save SKr2.02bn by the end of 1994 and a further SKr894m in the first half of next year. This expands the programme announced last November when the airline signalled savings of up to SKr2.5bn. It has already sold six Boeing 767s for a SKr800m capital gain and disposed of a 42 per cent stake in the Chilean carrier, LanChile. 'This is an ambitious and necessary action programme, on which I and my successor, Jan Stenberg, completely agree,' said Mr Jan Reinas, SAS interim president. Mr Stenberg takes over as SAS president on April 1.</p>

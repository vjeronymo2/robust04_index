			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Dow and Amoco agree swap THE Canadian subsidiaries of Dow Chemical and Amoco have agreed to a vast swap of interests in oil and gas properties, paving the way for the creation of a leading, publicly-traded energy company. The exchange involves about 5,000 properties in western Canada valued at over CDollars 1bn (USDollars 854.7m), and also includes Encor, an ailing Calgary-based oil and gas producer which had a partial interest in many of the properties. As a result of the exchange, Amoco will have sole ownership of 2,500 properties, while Encor will own 1,100. The remainder will be owned by Maligne Resources, a subsidiary of Dow Chemical. Amoco and Maligne plan a further rationalisation in which many of the properties will be placed in Crestar Energy, a new company which is expected to be taken public by 1994. The formation of Crestar will allow Dow to withdraw from the oil and gas business by spinning off Maligne. Dow became involved in the oil and gas sector in the 1970s. The company hoped to use the business as a lever to expand its interests in petrochemicals, notably ethylene. The properties that Amoco will contribute to Crestar are mostly those that it bought as part of its CDollars 5.2bn takeover of Dome Petroleum in 1988. In the process, Amoco will be able to fulfil a promise to the Canadian government at the time of the Dome Petroleum acquisition to spin off part of its business to the Canadian public. NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and chemicals conglomerate, suffered a sharp fall in operating profit last year to FIM2.7bn from the FIM4.1bn in 1990, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. The company blamed the decline on the performance of its chemicals business. Net sales, however, rose by 11 per cent to FM51.9bn, with the biggest increase coming in the group's oil trading activities and sales of crude oil.</p>

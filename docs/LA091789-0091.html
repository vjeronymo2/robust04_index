			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Algerian Prime Minister Mouloud Hamrouche, appointed a week ago to speed  democratic reforms, replaced all but three ministers in forming a new Cabinet,  the official news agency APS said. Former Finance Minister Sid Ahmed Ghezali  was named foreign minister, replacing Boualem Bessaieh, the Algerian member of  an Arab League committee that has been attempting to forge a peace plan to end  Lebanon's 14-year civil war. Meanwhile, in a step toward multi-party democracy,  the government legalized an Islamic fundamentalist party, the Islamic Salvation  Front, which political observers expect to become the second-largest party in  the country after the ruling National Liberation Front.  </P></p>

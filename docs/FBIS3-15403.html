The note followed a session of the Romanian Senate on  Thursday which focused on the results of the parliamentary  elections in Moldova and allowed itself a number of tactless  statements concerning Moldova.    The document stipulates that "speaking about romanofobia [as  received] and anti-Romanian sentiments in Moldova, the Romanian  Senate actually questions Moldova's statehood and the legality  of its borders."    "We are far from considering the elections to the Moldovan  parliament as perfect. However, we maintain that the upper  chamber of Romanian parliament made tendentious and absolutely  inequitable attacks capable of affecting the good-neighborly  relations between Romania and Moldova," the note concludes.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Books: The losers' champion STOLEN CONTINENTS: THE INDIAN STORY by Roland Wright John Murray Pounds 19.95, 424 pages 'FOR FIVE centuries,' writes Roland Wright, 'we have listened only to the history of the winners.' Stolen Continents redresses the balance by portraying the European 'discovery' of the continents of North and South America from a 'native' perspective. In selecting the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, Iroquois and Cherokee, he has focused on the most complex societies for whom the greatest source material is available. 'The five I have chosen must therefore stand for the many who will never tell their stories because they are extinct. The silence of the Caribbean Taino, the Newfoundland Beothuk, and the Ona of Tierra del Fuego is the most terrible eloquence of all.' Wright portrays the history of these five groupings during three phases: invasion, resistance, rebirth. The book is timely, not just because this year marks the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage across the Atlantic, but because Wright follows the story through to the vociferous nationalism of today. His account is passionate and moving. Through reconstruction of wide-ranging primary sources the reader can relive the agonies of the original inhabitants at the hands of the invaders. But whereas we may be accustomed to the devrecounted in the sixteenth-century Florentine Code, the continued persecution of the indigenous population comes as a surprise. The memoirs of the Guatemalan Mayan activist Rigoberta Menchu, written in 1982, are so horrific that Wright admits some people may not believe that such horrors really happened. Wright sees the superior European attitude towards the 'primitive' natives as almost laughable were the consequences not so tragic. The 'Requirement' read by the sixteenth-century Spaniards to the local people at each encounter demanded they submit to God, the Pope and the Church. 'And if you do not do this . . . with the help of God I shall come mightily against you, and I shall make war on you everywhere . . . and I shall do all the evil and damage to you that I am able. And insist that the deaths and destruction that result from this will be your fault.' This 'shabby document', as Wright points out, was a symbolic necessity to justify outright plunder. The Indians understood neither its meaning nor its intent. Apologists for the European 'invasion' rightly point out that what decimated the local people was not so much warfare but European diseases. But Wright stresses the consequences of Lord Jeffrey Amherst's command against the Iroquois in 1762. 'Infect the Indians with sheets upon which smallpox patients have been lying or by any other means which may serve to exterminate this accursed race.' The epidemic raged all summer, says Wright. 'One by one the leaders who survived it were compelled to sue for peace.' Whether he is talking about the Incas, Aztecs, Mayas, of South and Mesoamerica, or the Cherokee and Iroquois of North America, the 'Indian story' is a tawdry one of misunderstanding and betrayal. Time and again the new arrivals in North America reneged on their treaty obligations with the original inhabitants who had once made them welcome. There never was any expectation that the 'white' and 'Indian' cultures might coexist. Thousands of books of Mayan hieroglyphs were destroyed because the Spaniards could not understand them. When finally the remaining few were deciphered, they revealed advanced astronomical information. In their attempt to eradicate the Inca culture, the Spaniards banned Ouecha song, music and theatre. Even well-meant reforms backfired. Although the title of the book indicates that the continents of North and South America have been 'stolen' from their pre-Columbian inhabitants, the reader is left in no doubt that 500 years later the 'theft' is still being contested by those who have not lost sight of their ancient culture or language. 'If Guatemala really had majority rule, it would be a Maya republic,' says Wright. In the Andes 12m people speak the Inca language. There are more Iroquois living in North America than there have been for three and a half centuries. And the eastern Cherokees have managed to remain in the Great Smoky mountains where they lived in pre-Columbian times.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Malaysia deals 'worth Pounds 1bn' BRITISH COMPANIES are negotiating contracts worth up to Pounds 1bn in Malaysia which could secure 25,000 jobs in the UK, Mr John Major announced yesterday. Speaking in Kuala Lumpur before flying to Monte Carlo, the prime minister said British companies had won a number of multi-million pound projects, ranging from airport construction to bus manufacturing, and were involved in 'potentially hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts'. During visits to Japan and Malaysia Mr Major had been unable to escape domestic political concerns, and it was with obvious relief that he was able to announce substantial overseas contracts for British companies. British Gas and Genting Sanyen of Malaysia are to build a 720MW power station under the country's electricity privatisation programme. The total cost of the project is put at Pounds 550m. British Gas will take a 20 per cent equity stake in the project. An Anglo-Japanese consortium made up of Trafalgar House, Balfour Beatty, Gammon, G-Mats (part of GEC) and Marubeni of Japan have signed a memorandum of understanding for the development and project management of a new international airport for Kuala Lumpur. The total cost of the project is put at MDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 3.5bn). Those involved say British companies are well placed to win hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts for work on the airport. Trafalgar House is also to invest about Pounds 13m in a steel fabrication plant in Malaysia. The engineering company John Brown, part of the Trafalgar House group, has won a Pounds 120m turnkey contract to build a 330MW power station on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. John Brown is already involved in the construction of a 220MW power plant in the south of Malaysia. Dennis, the British heavy vehicle and bus manufacturer, is forming a joint venture to manufacture its vehicles in Malaysia. Lord Prior, GEC chairman and the head of a British trade delegation that accompanied Mr Major in Malaysia, said he felt the prime minster had underestimated the potential gain for British companies from the contracts.</p>

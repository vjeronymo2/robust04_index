			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. led a parade through the Johnson  Space Center in Houston, the city whose name was the first word ever spoken on  the moon two decades ago. "On July 20, 1969, men first stepped on the moon and  made more than footprints in history," Aldrin told space fans at a rally beside  what would have been Apollo 18, the giant Saturn 5 rocket whose mission was  scuttled because of the costs of the war in Vietnam. Aldrin, minus his fellow  moon walker of 20 years ago, Neil A. Armstrong, was one of 14 Apollo astronauts  who attended the events commemorating the successful 1969 mission and other  past accomplishments and looking ahead to an expanded program of space  exploration. When the Apollo 11 crew first landed on the moon, Armstrong had  said: "Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed."  </P></p>

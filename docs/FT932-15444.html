			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Risk and Reward: Investment managers are tempted by some exotic options WHILE corporate treasurers are users of interest rate and currency derivatives, fund managers are just starting to dabble in over-the-counter equity options. However, this potentially vast market has attracted the advances of investment bankers. They are designing increasingly complex options, known as exotic options, to win over investment managers. Equity fund managers, however, remain reluctant to use derivatives, except for the purpose of asset allocation. One of their main objections is cost. Specially designed equity options remain expensive, partly because they are still part of a small and immature market and are difficult to hedge. To counter these objections, some investment banks are offering options which, if not cheaper, do not require such heavy upfront premiums. The concept of knock-in and knock-out options, developed in the currency derivatives market, has been applied in the equities market. A fund manager buys a knock-out option if he wants to take a view that the market is going up, but is prepared to lose the option if the market falls below a certain level. Because the option is destroyed if the index falls below that level, the option costs less. A knock-in option works in a similar way. If the investor has bought a call at, say, 3,000 on the FT-SE 100 index, the option does not knock in - that is, cannot be exercised - until the index reaches, say, 3,500. Another structure being offered to investors is the contingent or trigger option, where the option is triggered by something other than the underlying asset of the option. A contingent option may offer a call on the market at 2,000, but it is only valid if interest rates are below 7 per cent. The writer of such an option - that is, the investment bank - has to assume a correlation between, in this case, interest rates and stock prices. While this correlation does exist, it is much more difficult to hedge such exposure. Investors have been offered so-called correlation or performance options, which give the best-performing of two assets or asset-classes. For example, an investor who is not sure whether to buy Glaxo or Wellcome could buy a correlation option which would give the stronger of the two shares. The concept can be applied to sectors. For example, the better performer of the pharmaceuticals or construction sectors, or indices, or different asset classes. Such performance options have been used mainly for expressing broader investment views, as a form of asset allocation. Although UK fund managers are still reluctant to use some of these more complex products, the growing sophistication of OTC equity products is being reflected in the more complex products, using embedded derivatives, now available to UK retail investors. For example, some recent guaranteed return bonds offered to UK retail investors have incorporated lock-in or ladder options. A recent Save &amp; Proser Guaranteed Equity bond, which offered the bulk of the rise of the FT-SE 100 Index over five years, or return of the original capital, allowed investors to choose between 98 per cent of the rise of the index, or 90 per cent of the rise, with lock-in facilities when the market rises 20 per cent and 40 per cent. A guaranteed product from Northern Rock offered the rise in the FT-SE over five years, or 15 per cent gross, with a 50 per cent index rise locked in. Typically, the hedging of the embedded derivatives is done by an investment bank, rather than the building society or insurance company which markets the retail product. Most investment banks continue to invest heavily in equity derivatives business, keen to win a share of the lucrative market which they expect to develop in the course of the decade. 'The majority of business being done in the equity derivatives market is still plain-vanilla options, to suit a particular client's needs,' said one head of derivatives at an investment bank. 'But that business is growing quite slowly.' Fund managers remain reluctant to become more active in equity derivatives, partly because they are cynical about the benefits in relation to the costs, and partly because they may be nervous of using more complex instruments.</p>

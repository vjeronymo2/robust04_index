			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Central Bankers' Verdict on Europe's Economy: Burden of debt holds back UK economy THE 'less healthy' state of household finances in Britain compared with other European nations has put the UK at an economic disdvantage. This conclusion emerges from the annual report of the governors of the 12 European central banks. It says interest payments as a proportion of income rose threefold in the UK during the 1980s, significantly more than in other major EC nations. In 1990 interest payments were at least twice as high in the UK, relative to income, as in other large European nations. 'It appears that efforts by households in the UK to strengthen their balance sheets by restraining expenditures and reducing debt have contributed to the weakness of (recent UK economic) activity,' the report says. According to the report, people's interest payments as a proportion of income in the UK came to about 10.5 per cent in 1990, up from 3.5 per cent in 1979. Ireland showed the next biggest rise in such payments, which rose from about 1 per cent to 2 per cent of income. In Germany, the equivalent ratio rose from 2 per cent to 3 per cent during the same period, while in France it went up from 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent. In Italy the ratio came down from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent. The EC nation with the next highest payments level after Britain in 1990 was Spain with a ratio of personal sector interest payments to income of about 4 per cent. The level of indebtedness by UK citizens, together with the prevalence in Britain of lending according to variable rather than fixed interest rates, 'suggests that household expenditures are likely to be relatively more responsive in the UK to changes in (official) interest rates,' the governors say.</p>

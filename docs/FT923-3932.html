			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold group warns low price may force closures ANGLO AMERICAN Corporation of South Africa will have to start closing down some of its marginal gold mining capacity in four months time unless the local price of gold - now at its lowest level for five years - improves, according to Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division. So far Anglo, widely believed to be among the most efficient South African gold producers, has avoided cutting output. However, its gold mining workforce fell from 210,000 to 170,000 over the past four years. Mr Sunter said yesterday that if the present gold price of R30,000 a kilogram (about Dollars 340 a troy ounce) persisted for a year, many more marginal South African mines would be forced to close. Anglo believed that a gold price of Dollars 500 an ounce was needed to keep South Africa's output stable while at Dollars 400 the country's annual production would drop by 100 tonnes over the next ten years from about 600 tonnes. A price of Dollars 600 an ounce was needed if South African production was to increase, he told the Association of Mining Analysts in London. Mr Sunter suggested gold 'is no longer the doomsday metal', or a hedge against world disasters, but an industrial metal which would move up in price as economies in the industrialised countries improved next year. 'And we genuinely believe the gold price will improve next year.' He said the industry would be better off promoting gold jewellery sales rather than shutting capacity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Professor Lech Falandysz, deputy head of the  Presidential Chancellery, has said in the "Puls Dnia" television  program that, for President Lech Walesa, the matter of the  candidacy of Dariusz Rosati for the post of deputy prime  minister and minister of finance is closed and that the  president expects a new candidate from the government coalition  for these posts.    [Begin recording] [Falandysz] The Small Constitution remains  in force. A way out must be found.    [Unidentified correspondent] Which means?    [Falandysz] The president states that the decision is a  final  one. It is necessary to seek....    [Correspondent, interrupting] Does that mean that the  president is waiting for a new candidate on the part of the  coalition?    [Falandysz] There is no other way out. [end recording]    The causes for the rejection of this candidate were  presented  by Belweder press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski. [passage omitted]    Dariusz Rosati said in the evening that he is amazed at the  arguments of the president.    [Begin Rosati recording] It is necessary to say that the  causes cited by Mr. Drzycimski fill me with the greatest  amazement. The first cause--that I have spent the past two and  a half years abroad--is incomprehensible to me, if only because  of the fact that, altogether, I have been concerned solely with  the Polish economy for the past 20 years. And, for the past two  years also, working for the United Nations, I have been  concerned with the Polish economy and that of the countries of  Central-Eastern Europe. I have permanent contact with the  country; I read the press; I am in the country six or seven  times a year. And, and, I have the impression that--I write, in  any case, I have written and published a lot--I have the  impression that I am quite well oriented with what is taking  place in the Polish economy. [end recording]    The Democratic Left Alliance-Polish Peasant Party [SLD-PSL]  coalition and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak continue to  maintain the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati. The prime minister's  press office has reported that the prime minister has received  reports from the prosecutor general and the head of the State  Protection Office that there are no good reasons for Rosati not  to assume important state posts. SLD leader Aleksander  Kwasniewski has expressed the view that President Lech Walesa is  not concerned that there be stabilization in the country. SLD  Deputy Chairman Marek Borowski has suggested that it is  appropriate to consider the limitation of the constitutional  prerogatives of the president if Lech Walesa maintains his  decision on the rejection of the candidacy of Rosati.    [Begin Borowski recording] If the president decides on this  type of war--and I stress that the war in this case is being  called forth by the president, not by the coalition--well, then,  it will be necessary to consider whether the prerogatives of the  president are not, quite simply, too great in this situation.  There are no regulations that cannot be changed, including  constitutional ones. Certainly, the Small Constitution says  that the president may reject a candidacy, but there must really  be exceptionally important reasons. I judge this to be,  nonetheless, an attempt to drive a wedge between the coalition  partners and, well, a certain propensity of the president to  foment. [end recording]    Belweder spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski, who is with President  Walesa in Gdansk, said yesterday that it is not precluded that  on Monday there will be a follow-up meeting between the  president and the prime minister. The prime minister will  receive written justification for the rejection of the candidacy  of Dariusz Rosati for the post of deputy prime minister and  minister of finance.</p>

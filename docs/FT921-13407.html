			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Multi-party state likely in Tanzania LEADERS of Tanzania's ruling Revolutionary Party have backed a proposal to introduce a multi-party system, according to the state-owned Daily News, Reuter reports from Dar es Salaam. The party would officially endorse the switch to pluralism at a special conference on February 18, said a statement issued by the 117-strong executive committee in the inland capital of Dodoma late on Monday. 'We agree with one voice to present to the national conference the proposal  .that a multi-party system should be established in Tanzania.' The announcement came at the end of a four-day party meeting to discuss a report ordered by President Ali Hassan Mwinyi 10 months ago on whether to end 30 years of one-party rule. Mr Mwinyi is thought likely to call elections later this year after pluralism was officially approved by early March.</p>

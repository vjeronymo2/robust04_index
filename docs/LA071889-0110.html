			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY GETS JARUZELSKI VIEW ON PRESIDENCY  </P> <P> Communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski met with Solidarity lawmakers Monday in an  apparent effort to broaden support for him as a presidential candidate.  </P> <P> Although Gen. Jaruzelski announced June 30 that he would not be a candidate for  the presidency, the Communist Party has asked him to reconsider. In recent days  he has won the support of his own party and one of its Communist allies, the  United Peasants' Party.  </P> <P> The president is to be chosen by majority vote of the National Assembly (Sejm)  and the newly created Senate in an election expected Wednesday.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski withdrew after the Communists' allies in Parliament, the Peasants  and the Democratic Party, hesitated to give him their support. Although the  Peasants voted last week to support him, the Democrats have remained on the  fence.  </P> <P> Solidarity, the independent trade union movement, has 259 votes (46% of the  total) and could assure Jaruzelski's election, but it is not likely to endorse  him. Still, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, noting that Poland's internal and  international situation requires a Communist president, said last week that he  would cooperate with Jaruzelski if he is elected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Solidarity's Reluctant Support  </P> <P> Walesa's quasi-endorsement suggested that Solidarity lawmakers, however  reluctantly, might cast just enough votes to ensure Jaruzelski's election if  the ill-disciplined Communist coalition fails to hold together.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski has not officially revoked his withdrawal announcement, but he is  clearly campaigning for the post.  </P> <P> The meeting with the Solidarity lawmakers was closed, but some of the members  indicated they were not impressed.  </P> <P> "It's the same thing he's been saying for years," said Jozef Lisz, a leader of  Farmers' Solidarity and a deputy Speaker of the Senate.  </P> <P> Solidarity lawmakers have said in recent weeks that a vote for Jaruzelski would  be difficult for them to explain to an electorate that blames Jaruzelski for  the imposition of martial law in 1981 and the suppression of Solidarity.  </P></p>

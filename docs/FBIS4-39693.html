			<p>BFN     [Text] The Indonesian Foreign Ministry's Public Affairs  Director (Abid) said in an interview with ITAR-TASS on 9 June  that, as the chair state of the nonaligned movement, Indonesia  is making quiet diplomatic efforts to peacefully resolve the  serious nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. Indonesia is  relying on the dispatch of special envoys to countries directly  concerned of the dispute, including the DPRK, the United States,  the PRC, and Japan, and the contact with the International  Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. These are aimed at peacefully  solving all the problems, he said.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out that the nuclear  issue of the Korean peninsula had been discussed in depth during  the meeting of the foreign ministers of nonaligned countries  held in Cairo some time ago. The participants agreed that  problems concerning the Korean peninsula should be solved  through peaceful means and that contacts between all parties  concerned should continue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the  Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] are not averse to  concluding an agreement on the mutual withdrawal of  parliamentary candidates at a local level. This was stated by a  leader of the KDNP in reply to a question from Hungarian radio.  Tamas Isepy affirmed that he conducted election coordinating  discussions yesterday with the SZDSZ's candidate for prime  minister [Gabor Kuncze]. He also denied the NEPSZABADSAG report  that Gabor Kuncze has rejected any local cooperation.    Candidates from the KDNP are in second place, while SZDSZ  candidates are third -- or the reverse is true -- in several  constituencies. This is why both parties have an interest in  possibly withdrawing in favor of the other in the second round  of the elections, the Christian Democratic politician said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New Delhi today renewed its offer to have a dialogue  with Islamabad at various levels to resolve bilateral  differences. It has, however, rejected the suggestion for  allowing any fact-finding team of the Islamic Conference  Organization [ICO] to visit Jammu and Kashmir. The external  affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, and his deputy Mr. Salman  Khurshid have expressed the hope that Pakistan will now return  to bilateral dialogue following its setback in Geneva. Mr.  Dinesh Singh told reporters that New Delhi is waiting to hear  from Pakistan about the resumption of the foreign  secretary-level talks.    On the outcome of the UN Human Rights Commission meeting,  the  external affairs minister said India has been able to convince  international community about the false propaganda on alleged  human rights violations in Kashmir. He said Iran, China, and  the European Union, besides the United States, had advised  Pakistan against pressing its resolution.    Replying to a question, Mr. Singh regretted Saudi Arabia's  decision to cosponsor Pakistan's resolution. He made it clear  that the help of China and Iran at the Geneva meet to India does  not imply that a new axis is emerging in the region.    The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Khurshid,  who  returned from Geneva last night, also denied entering into a  tripartite deal with Iran and China to enable the withdrawal of  the Pakistan-sponsored resolution. While ruling out any  fact-finding mission of the ICO to Kashmir, he said India has  invited ICO permanent representative in Geneva to visit New  Delhi for discussions. He said it is wrong on the part of  Pakistan to say that its resolution has been deferred to the  next meeting. In fact, the resolution has lapsed, he said.  Replying to a question, he said the leader of the opposition,  Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, leading the Indian delegation, sent a  clear signal that all sides in India speak with one voice on the  Kashmir issue.    Talking to newsmen, Mr. Vajpayee asked the government to  consolidate the gains of the Geneva meet by taking concrete  steps to restore normalcy in the Kashmir valley. He brushed  aside Pakistan's claim that its resolution is yet alive and  termed it as preposterous. Mr. Vajpayee said for the first  time, the international community has come to know in full  detail about the terrorist atrocities in Kashmir. Nongovernment  agencies of the valley have also ably presented the correct  picture to the delegates of the Geneva meet, Mr. Vajpayee added.    The Congress-I Working Committee has congratulated the prime  minister on the country's success in thwarting Pakistan's  resolution on Kashmir in Geneva. The party spokesman, Mr. V.N.  Gadgil, told newsmen that the Congress-I has decided to launch a  public awareness campaign on Dunkel proposals to counter the  opposition propaganda. He said a five-member action committee is  being set up to revamp its electoral machinery for the  forthcoming assembly elections. Mr. Gadgil disclosed that the  next session of the AICC [All India Congress-I Committee] will  be held in Gujarat. He said the reports of the Karunakaran  Committee and the Janardhan Committee on last assembly elections  were discussed in detail.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Brazil steel group sale postponed The sale of Cosipa, Brazil's third largest steel firm, has been postponed from July 13 to August 4, Bill Hinchberger writes from Sao Paulo. The delay will allow the government time to cut Cosipa's debt and restructure the sell-off so that it retains a number of non-voting shares. The Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange has also cancelled the sale of the government's 35 per cent share in Petrocoque, a petrochemical company. Its three private sector partners declined to raise their participation, and no other bidders were found for the shares, valued at Dollars 20m. The Petrocoque shares will now be sold along with Petroquimica Uniao (PQU), the anchor of the Sao Paulo petrochemical complex, on August 20.</p>

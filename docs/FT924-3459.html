			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Court highlights danger of default - European Court Irish fishing rules containing residence and nationality conditions were declared unlawful last week by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in a judgment which clarified the extent to which an EC state may be liable to individuals for breaches of obligations under Community law. Although the Irish rules were revoked nine months before the judgment, the ECJ ruled that there was still an interest in pursuing the action in order to establish the basis of liability which could be incurred by a member state which was in default of its obligations either towards the community, another member state or private parties. C-280/89: Commission v Ireland, ECJ FC, December 2 1992. Implementation date crucial for direct effect EC citizens can only rely on provisions in Community directives in cases before their national courts once the date for their implementation has passed, the ECJ ruled last week. The case involved the 1980 directive on protection for salaried workers against the insolvency of their employers which did not have to be implemented by member states until October 23 1983. Italy failed to implement the provisions of the directive in time. The applicants all left their jobs due to non-payment of their salaries. Their employers were all subsequently declared to be insolvent but at dates before October 23 1983. The applicants sought to rely on the provisions of the directive for protection of their rights. The ECJ held that as the relevant acts of insolvency all took place before the directive had to be implemented, the provisions of the directive could not be relied on by the applicants. Joined cases C-140/91, C-141/91, C-278/91 and C-279/91: Suffritti, Fiori, Giacometti, Dal Pane and Balletti v Instituto Nazionale della Providenza Sociale, ECJ 1CH, December 3 1992. Milk quota decisions. The ECJ was asked in two cases to decide issues arising out of the Community rules relating to milk quotas. In the first, an Irish farmer had agreed not to market milk for five years. Some years after the expiry of this undertaking, he increased the amount of land he farmed. He then asked for a milk quota from the Irish authorities. A quota was awarded to him, but based on the amount of land he had operated at the end of the five-year marketing ban. He brought an action against this decision, claiming to be entitled to a quota based on all the production units operated by him, including those on new land. The ECJ held the relevant Community provisions allowed for account to be taken of production units added to a holding after the end of a non-marketing undertaking and before the provisional decision of the authorities, provided that the original holding operated at the time when the undertaking was entered into was still being operated in whole or in part by the producer concerned. In the second case, a German farmer who had been granted a milk quota sought to have it increased on the grounds that he had bought more land. At the time of purchase, the land had been subject to an undertaking to convert from dairy cows to cattle, but which now could be used for dairy production. The German authorities disallowed this request on the grounds that he already had a quota. The ECJ held that the Community rules which disallowed an ordinary quota producer from benefiting from the special quota rules applicable to conversion undertakings were unlawful in that they breached the legitimate expectations of the producer concerned. C-86/90: O'Brien v Ireland, the attorney-General and the minister for agriculture and food, ECJ 3CH, December 3 1992. C-264/90: Wehrs v Haupzollamt Luneburg, ECJ 3CH, December 3 1992. Other cases A national decision could not be the subject of judicial review under the Rome Treaty rules, the ECJ held. The correct forum in which such a decision should be investigated was the national court. C-97/91: Oleificio Borelli Spa v Commission, ECJ 5CH, December 3 1992. The Rome Treaty rules of non-contractual liability covered acts of the European Investment Bank, as well as the other EC institutions.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporters Lao Hung-kai (0525 7703 6946) and Yang </F> Fan (2799 1581) and trainee reporter Chang Chun (1728 6511):  "Ningxia Succeeds in Harnessing Huang He, Realizes Grain  Self-Sufficiency"]    [Text] Yinchuan, 15 Jun (WEN WEI PO)--When being  interviewed by WEN WEI PO, Huang Huang, member of the CPC  Central Committee and secretary of the CPC Committee of Ningxia  Autonomous Region, said: The interior region has been pursuing  the strategy of "Ningxia -- coastal areas--overseas areas" in  the process of expanding its opening and economic development  since the beginning of this year. The autonomous region, which  is neither a coastal area nor a border area, is actively  improving its investment environment, and has established  economic and trade relations with more than 60 countries and  regions. Two years ago, there were no foreign-funded  enterprises in Ningxia; at present, however, there are more than  310, and they have brought over $1 billion of external  investment to Ningxia from 23 countries and regions. Huang  Huang, who was transferred from Jiangxi to the top post of  Ningxia, said that during his tenure of office in Ningxia, his  objective is to enhance the Ningxia people's living standards  and bring the whole region to the level of being comparatively  well-off by the year 2000.    Ningxia is located in the central valley of the Huang He in  Northwest China. Secretary Huang Huang said: The river flows  397 kilometers inside Ningxia, and the area of the river valley  accounts for over 90 percent of the whole region's area. Since  the beginning of reform and opening, cadres and masses in  Ningxia have made great efforts to utilize the Huang He. The  river has been basically harnessed, and the natural environment  of the river valley has been improved. The irrigated area has  been enlarged, and the economies of the mountainous areas  developed. The state and the autonomous region invested 500  million yuan in water pumping projects from Guyuan to Haiyuan  and from Yanchi to Huanxian and Dingbian. The water of the  Huang He is now being channeled up to the mountainous areas, and  the two projects increased the irrigated area by nearly 800,000  mu. In addition, a hydropower project is being launched in  Daliushu; after completion, its power generation capacity will  reach 7.8 billion kilowatt-hours. The reservoir will also  irrigate 20 million mu of farmland in Ningxia, Inner Mongolia,  Shaanxi, and Gansu.    Huang Huang said: The situation of agricultural production  in Ningxia this year is very good, and the whole region will be  self-sufficient in food grain. Although the mountainous area in  the southern part of the region faces serious drought, the total  grain output of Ningxia may still reach or even exceed last  year's level. He said that the whole region is making efforts to  fight the drought. Bai Lichen, chairman of the regional  government, is guiding the work of fighting drought and sowing  autumn crops in the southern area of the region.    Secretary Huang Huang also told reporters that the eight  counties in the southern part of Ningxia are inhabited by people  of the Hui nationality. That area is called the poorest of the  poor areas in China. In the early 1980's, some 70 percent of  the peasant households there could not get enough food and  clothing. In the last 10 years, with the state's support,  Ningxia allocated 30 million yuan every year to help the poor  area, and allocated over 70 million yuan to develop  manufacturing industries there in order to increase the local  people's wealth. Financial resources were concentrated to  improve production conditions and the ecological environment and  to build terraced fields at an average of two or three mu per  person and raise the per mu grain output to 500 jin. Thus, the  peasants will have sufficient food.    At the same time, through resettlement arrangements, 150,000  people have been moved from the poor mountainous areas to the  plain areas, and they became rich two or three years after being  resettled. So far, 85 percent of the peasants in southern  Ningxia have sufficient food and clothing; and 10 percent of  them have become comparatively well-off.    When talking about the investment environment, Secretary  Huang Huang said: Ningxia has started a number of major  transportation projects. The 280-km electrified railway line  between Baoji and Zhongwei was completed and put to operation on  9 June. A new airport 19 kilometers east of Yinchuan is under  construction. Adding to the two old airports around Yinchuan,  the capital city of the autonomous region will have air links to  all major cities of the country and also to the Middle East,  Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. In the field of  telecommunications, 18 cities and counties of Ningxia have  realized telephone dialing automation. This year, Yinchuan  added 70,000 program-controlled telephone lines to its  communications network, and direct diald to all major cities in  the world is available.    Secretary Huang Huang also said that harmonious relations  were being maintained among all religious groups in Ningxia.</p>

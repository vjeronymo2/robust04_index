			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (25): Showing a darker side to Victorian values WHITE-COLLAR CRIME IN MODERN ENGLAND, 1845-1929 by George Robb Cambridge Pounds 29.95, 250 pages HANDBOOK OF CORPORATE FRAUD by Jack Bologna Butterworth-Heinemann Pounds 55, 308 pages IF THERE were any lingering doubts about the amorality of business life in Victorian Britain, George Robb's deft history should put paid to them. Victorian commercial enterprise, with figures such as George Hudson - the 'Railway King' who 'misappropriated securities worth thousands of pounds from the railways he managed during the 1840s but was never prosecuted' - was not just shabby in itself. It has also coloured the business ethics of contemporary society. The best historiography raises contemporary questions. Robb revisits familiar territory but he also inserts doubts concerning today's business practices. For once, the past really does serve as a guide to future performance. Robb unearths the close links between government and business in a previous age. Given that Britain has been ruled by effectively the same administration for 14 years, his book inevitably suggests comparisons with today. The temptation for those with political power to abuse it is no less present in Britain today than it was in 1912, when the Marconi Affair was neatly swept under the carpet by a parliamentary select committee. In that incident, 'the Attorney General, Rufus Isaacs, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, and the Postmaster General, Herbert Samuel, all purchased shares in the American Marconi Company at the time in which Asquith's Liberal government was negotiating a lucrative contract with the subsidiary British Marconi Company' whose chairman, Godfrey Isaacs, was the attorney general's brother. Never mind; no abuse happened, according to other politicians waiting in the wings for their own rewards. What guarantees have we that ethical standards of government are any better today? It strongly emerges from Robb's account of previous malpractices that we cannot be entirely certain, so long as no regulatory divisions exist between politics and commerce. One constitutional reform to the benefit of all - except politicians - would be to prohibit all former and serving politicians from ever holding any company directorships. Robb argues that little has altered since Victorian times: 'Bankers, brokers, solicitors, accountants and company directors continued to operate in a world that was alien and inscrutable to the general public. It was still difficult (and remains so to this day) to distinguish between fraud, incompetence, carelessness and misfortune. The rules of the game can be narrowed, but cheating does not disappear.' He digs out some surprising support. Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and Samuel Johnson loathed the parvenus who used paper-proliferation to rob fools. Johnson defined a stock jobber as 'a low wretch who makes money by buying and selling shares in the funds' in his dictionary. At the start of this century, says Robb, 'the obscurity of most published company accounts ensured that shareholders would remain in the dark regarding a company's poor financial performance or a director's financial indiscretions. Even many honest directors believed that shareholders, like children, should know no more than is good for them, and, like children, should be deceived for their own good.' What has changed? The Handbook on Corporate Fraud is aimed more at a US audience, with long sections on relevant US law and a useful - if depressing - chunk on big fraud cases, mostly in the US, between 1985-90. It is estimated that economic crime cost US consumers and businesses Dollars 114bn in 1990, or 2 per cent of GDP. A further Dollars 52bn is annually spent in combating crime and business frauds. In spite of its US-inclined content, the book has some universally useful passages; a checklist of characteristics of fraud-prone organisations, profiles of embezzlers, tips on fraud auditing and so forth. Bologna - involved in fraud auditing techniques for many years - says that 'you can prevent white-collar crime by becoming more informed about it and by applying rules of self-protection . . . be wary of employees who never take vacations, live beyond their means, or suffer from mood swings.' Not every chief executive officer can be on the take, surely?</p>

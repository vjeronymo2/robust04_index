			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries make solid gains after rally by dollar A rally by the dollar helped US Treasury bonds post solid gains yesterday despite initial jitters over an ambiguous economic reading. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/16 higher at 84 23/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.55 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.193 per cent. Bonds across the spectrum came under early pressure after the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment benefit last week fell by 59,000 to 331,000, the lowest since March 26. Analysts, however, attributed the decline to technical factors and discounted the raw data as an accurate indication of the economy's strength. The benign interpretation allowed Treasuries to climb back into positive territory, although the approach of today's preliminary estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product held bonds in check during the morning. Today's report should provide a clue to the timing of the Federal Reserve's next move to lift short-term interest rates. Economists were predicting second-quarter growth of 3.9 per cent, up from 3.4 per cent in the first three months of the year. A reading that exceeds the consensus forecast could cause prices to tumble. As traders sought to square their positions ahead of the data, the dollar staged an impressive afternoon rally in the foreign exchange markets. The development eased the way for dealers seeking to distribute new two-year and five-year notes auctioned by the Treasury earlier in the week, bringing a measure of confidence to the market going into the GDP announcement. In the absence of significant fundamental news, European government bonds spent another day drifting sideways on low volume. However, volatility remained high due to thin market conditions. Gilts had another roller-coaster session: falling at the opening in the aftermath of Wednesday's sell-off, recovering on investor buying and easing back in late trade on worries about a rise in UK interest rates. The September long gilt futures contract closed at 101 9/32 , up  5/32 on the day. Continuing worries about the possibility of an imminent rate increase, which pushed three-month rates to their year's high yesterday, continued to weigh on the market. 'Most people have been expecting rates to rise eventually, but now there's increasing talk that we'll see a pre-emptive rate hike sooner than expected,' said a senior gilt trader. Nervousness ahead of today's second-quarter US GDP data also overhung the market. 'Going into the data, people aren't willing to take any sizeable positions either way,' said Mr Ifty Islam of Merrill Lynch. Still, traders reported some investor buying of medium and long-dated stock, which helped gilts recoup their losses during the day. Switching into gilts from neighbouring markets was also reported, helping gilts' 10-year yield spread over bunds to narrow to around 183 basis points from Wednesday's high of 195 basis points. Trading in the German bond market was technical and futures-driven, with retail investors said to be sidelined. The late breach of key support levels on the September bund future gave scope for further falls in the contract and, according to Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest Markets in Frankfurt, it could test 92.20 in the coming days. However, he said he does not expect it to revisit its recent low of just below 90.00. The contract ended at 92.82 on Germany's DTB, down 0.48 points on the day. French bonds fell in line with bunds, ignoring the Bank of France's widely expected 10 basis point cut in its intervention rate to 5 per cent. The September notional bond contract on Matif ended the day at 116.84, down 0.34 points on the day. Italian bonds took a breather after the recent sell-off, closing only slightly weaker. However, sentiment remains weak given the fragile political background, and the market is expected to remain volatile as the corruption probe continues into Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's holding company Fininvest.</p>

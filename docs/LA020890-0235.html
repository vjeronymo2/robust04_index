			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SWEDISH ECONOMY 'FALLING APART'  </P> <P> Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson today said the economy is "falling  apart" and his government will resign unless Parliament bans strikes and  imposes a wage-price freeze for two years.  </P> <P> The plan that Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt outlined in Parliament would  also put a two-year freeze on local taxes, rents and stock dividends.  </P> <P> Collective bargaining is a pillar of the Swedish welfare system, which has  eliminated poverty and guaranteed health care and education for everyone. The  Swedish mix of socialism and capitalism became a model for the industrial  welfare state.  </P> <P> "What was known as the Swedish Model is, on the whole, gone, and this is just  another sign," bank economist Nils Lundgren said on Swedish radio.  </P></p>

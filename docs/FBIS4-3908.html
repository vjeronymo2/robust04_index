			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- China said today  that it will take further steps to reform the country's fiscal  and tax systems, the financial sector, foreign trade, investment  and the state-owned enterprises.    Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China,  China's central bank, said here today that introduction of a new  tax system and the unification of exchanges rates early this  year have proved "satisfactory".    "The Chinese Government is well aware that many problems in  the areas of macroeconomic management and the industrial  structure remain unsolved," Chen said at the 42nd meeting of the  Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).    Chen said budgetary revenue of China increased by 21.4  percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the  same period last year, and the exchange rate of renminbi,  China's currency, has remained stable.    "The Chinese Government is fully confident that in pushing  ahead with reforms it will achieve its objectives while  maintaining macroeconomic stability," Chen stressed.</p>

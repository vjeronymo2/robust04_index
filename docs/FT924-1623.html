			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MP cautious over sale of Parcelforce THE GOVERNMENT is running into fresh difficulties in its attempts to privatise Parcelforce because it may not be able to transfer any surplus in the parcel deliverer's pension fund to a private-sector buyer, a Labour MP will tell the Commons today. Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, will use a debate on the future of postal services in rural areas to argue that present trust deeds would prevent such a transfer - a contention that is believed to be supported by professional advice in the hands of the Post Office, Parcelforce's current owner. Mr Hain will put the current level of surplus in the Post Office's pension fund, accumulated over four years, at Pounds 311m and will estimate that Parcelforce's share of this could amount to some Pounds 20m. He is also expected to return to the question of Parcelforce's exemption from value added tax, which it is expected to lose once it ceases to be part of the Post Office. Parcelforce has a 34 per cent share - the largest in the market - of ordinary parcel deliveries but only 2 per cent of the premium 'next-day' market. Earlier this week it was disclosed that the division had cut its first-half losses from Pounds 27m to Pounds 21m. Sir Bryan Nicholson, Post Office chairman, said Parcelforce hoped to break even by the end of its financial year. Government moves to strengthen the voice of passengers in the regions after rail privatisation were endorsed by Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, last night. 'The current system of consumer representation by the consultative committees works well and we are committed to ensuring that none of the benefits are lost,' he said.</p>

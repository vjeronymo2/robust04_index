			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> JUDGE REFUSES TO CUT ADULT STORE'S HOURS  </P> <P> An Orange County Superior Court judge on Friday refused to limit the operating  hours of a 24-hour adult bookstore and video arcade that city officials say is  a magnet for crime, noise and litter.  </P> <P> Judge John C. Wooley denied the city's attempt to force A-Z Books on Garden  Grove Boulevard to limit its hours to between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Wooley did grant City Atty.  </P> <P> Stuart B. Scudder's request that lacy curtains placed in peep-show booth  doorways -- allegedly in violation of a city ordinance -- be removed. The judge  gave A-Z operator W. Randall Welty until 4 p.m. Friday to do so.  </P> <P> In arguing for limiting the store's hours, Scudder said A-Z is responsible for  lewd conduct, automobile noise, discarded condoms and other problems reported  by area residents.  </P> <P> Wooley said the city lacks the evidence to restrict the store's hours but that  the curtains are in violation of one of his previous orders that doors be  removed from the booths.  </P> <P> A trial on alleged violations of the city's peep show ordinance is set for  April 9.

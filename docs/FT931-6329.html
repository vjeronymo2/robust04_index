			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas One begins to wonder why Sir James McKinnon is so determined to conduct the debate about the future of British Gas in public. Traditionally, participants respect the confidentiality of submissions to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But the director-general of Ofgas has aired his views in the manner of someone who suspects that the argument is not going his way. If Sir James is merely trying to apply extra pressure to ensure he triumphs, then he is playing with fire. Besides, the latest Ofgas document does not adequately address many of the thorny issues raised by the break up of British Gas. Should the proposed regional marketing companies have a local monopoly, and, if not, who should assume the obligation to supply customers with gas? Will the government accept that low-usage domestic customers should pay more? Does the cheap interruptable gas market have a future, and is it economically efficient for companies such as ICI to be supplied with gas at marginal prices? Whether British Gas is dismembered or not, the most important factor for valuing the company is the rate of return earned on its pipelines. Here the gap between Ofgas's recommendations and British Gas's requests is still vast. Privatisation has produced several poorly thought-out structures. Now that gas is justifiably getting a second look, both customers and investors deserve more than yet another half-baked publicity stunt.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Restructuring pays off as IRI sees sharp reduction in losses IRI, the Italian state holding company, yesterday forecast a large reduction in losses during 1994, to L1,360bn (Dollars 864m) from more than L10,230bn. The improved performance was predicted by Mr Romano Prodi, the outgoing chairman who resigned a month ago. It reflects the broad restructuring led by Mr Prodi during the past year, and includes revenue from privatisation. The main losses, totalling L4,668bn, were blamed on restructuring at the Ilva steel group and at Iritecna, the civil engineering and construction subsidiary. The IRI annual meeting also confirmed the holding's total debt had reached L79,783bn, equivalent to almost 5 per cent of Italy's GDP. The much-expected announcement of a replacement for Mr Prodi failed to materialise yesterday, indicating continuing problems within the Berlusconi government on the nomination. A compromise being discussed is that Mr Enrico Michele, the current managing director, take over in the role of chief executive.</p>

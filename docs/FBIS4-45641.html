			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the rubric "It Is Official": </F> "Deputy Prime Minister Zaveryukha's Opinion: No Improvement"]    [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha,  whose duties in the Russian Federation government Include  environmental protection oversight, noted that despite the  stoppage of many hazardous enterprises in industry, the  ecological situation in the country has not improved and still  leaves a lot to be desired.    According to data of the Rosgidromet [Russian Federal  Service  on Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control] Main Geophysical  Observatory, the air basin over a considerable number of cities  (observations were made in 247 Russian cities) remains  unhealthy. In the 44 cities with the most polluted air basin  (the so-called priority list), it increased considerably between  1988 and 1992. Pollution by certain ingredients increased  somewhat in 15 cities. Only in 18 cities has it practically not  changed or declined slightly because of the drop in production.  For instance, in Irkutsk, Krasnodar, and Saratov the average  concentration of formaldehyde increased severalfold and exceeded  the MAC [maximum allowable concentration] by a factor of six to  seven. In Kemerovo the average concentration of carbon bisulfide  reached six MAC (a sixfold increase); in Krasnodar the  concentration of phenol in the air increased from two to three  MAC. The nitrogen oxide, dust, and phenol concentration  increased in Lipetsk (to 1.5-2.9 MAC); nitrogen dioxide and  ammonia concentration in Saratov--to 2.0-2.9 MAC; and in  Cherepovets the concentration of carbon bisulfide increased from  3.2 to five MAC in Bratsk and from 2.4 to 3.8 MAC. The degree of  air pollution in the capital remains very high; the  concentration of phenol did decrease, but at the same time there  was an increase in the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (mainly  because of increased automotive traffic).    The hygienic state of air basins over the cities on the  priority list has changed to a different extent over the past  five years. For instance, the concentration of ammonia,  formaldehyde, and nitrogen oxides increased in St. Petersburg;  of carbon oxide, formaldehyde, and carbon bisulfide--in Barnaul;  of carbon oxide, formaldehyde, and carbon bisulfide--in  Orenburg; of phenol and nitrogen oxides--in Ryazan; and of  phenol, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides--in Kazan. The air quality  has not changed perceptibly in Perm, Kaliningrad, Groznyy.  Samara, Ivanovo, and Vyatka.    Water reservoirs. Observations of dry land surface water  pollution are conducted at 1,341 reservoirs in 2,624 ranges. At  851 of these ranges (32 percent) the average annual  concentration of at least one pollutant exceeds the MAC by a  factor of 10 or more. This ratio has not changed perceptibly  over the past few years.    According to official data, in 1992 as compared to the  preceding year in water reservoirs with a high degree of  pollution the quality of water improved at 35 ranges,  deteriorated at 99 ranges, and remained basically unchanged at  717 ranges.    Overall, the level of pollution of water reservoirs on the  territory of Russia remains high.    There has been a serious deterioration in the water quality  in the largest Siberian rivers--the Ob, Irtysh, Vakh, Taz, and  their numerous tributaries, where the concentration of petroleum  products increased from five-10 MAC in the early 1980's to 10-60  MAC in the early 1990's, and of phenols--from three-eight to  10-45 MAC, respectively. This is a result of the low efficiency  of environmental protection measures of oil- and gas-producing  enterprises and river transport.    The level of pollution of Volga water reservoirs remains  high--the content of many pollutants in them, including  petroleum products, phenol, copper, and nitrogen nitrite  measures five-15 MAC. The eutrophication process there continues  to progress at a faster rate.    There has been a substantial deterioration in the condition  of rivers in Tula Oblast, where in the upper reaches of the Don,  Shatskiy reservoir, and Ula river the concentration of phenol  and nitrogen compounds increased from two-eight to 20-35 MAC--a  result of operations of Novomoskovsk industrial complex chemical  enterprises; the situation also deteriorated in Stavropol Kray  rivers. Here, because of the unsatisfactory work of city  purification systems the concentration of petroleum products  increased from four-five to 20-50 MAC; of suspended  particles--from 150 to 950 mg per liter, and of organic  substances--from 50 to 100-300 mgO2 per liter.    Over the past four years the Moscow river has unfailingly  made it to the priority list of the most polluted water  reservoirs in the country; the average annual content of phenol  and nitrogen compounds in it measures 10-15 MAC, with a trend  toward an increasing level of pollution.    Monitoring data on dry land surface waters for 1992 showed  practically no change in the trends of pollution levels at water  reservoirs in Russia: the Kola Peninsula rivers, the Oka and Ob  basins, and rivers in the Urals industrial region remain the  most polluted water reservoirs.    The results of the 1993 monitoring are currently being  processed; the work will be finished in February.</p>

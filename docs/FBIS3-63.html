			<p>Possibly  seeking to avoid simultaneous disputes on auto trade  with both Washington and Brussels, Japan and the European Union,  as announced on 19 March, concluded an agreement raising the  quota for Japanese auto exports to the EU.  Under the new  arrangement, the Japanese quota will rise by 0.4 percent in 1994  (KYODO, 19 March) and the Japanese will be allowed to ship up to  an estimated 984,000 vehicles to the EU -- an increase of 4,000  units over the 980,000 permitted in 1993 (Nikkei Weekly, 21  March).  This agreement came after earlier negotiations in  February had broken down because of disagreement over projected  European auto market demand in 1994.  According to a Kyodo report  at the time, the EU had argued that demand would remain flat,  while the Japanese maintained that it would increase slightly (25  February).     Suggesting that Japan has been eager to conclude the auto trade  talks with the EU, a 14 March KYODO report quoted Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) Vice Minister Hideaki  Kumano in remarks at a press conference that day as urging both  sides to "agree as early as possible on setting a ceiling for  European-bound Japanese car exports for 1994."  Kumano also  reportedly stressed that the new ceiling should be agreed upon  before the start of the next Japanese fiscal year, beginning  April 1.  (AUTHOR:  COHEN.

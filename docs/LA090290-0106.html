			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEGOTIATIONS TO SETTLE MIDEAST CRISIS  </P> <P> The crisis in the Persian Gulf has raised the United Nations to a new level of  effectiveness, and long after the immediate effects of the crisis have  dissipated, history may reveal that the world has taken a step forward toward  the U.N. dream of peace and security.  </P> <P> It is also worth noting that our ambassador at the U.N. is a proven diplomat.  On occasions, we have named distinguished citizens to that post who had limited  experience in diplomacy and international relations. Let us hope that future  presidents will select our most competent and prestigious diplomats to that  strategically important post.  </P> <P> T.J. LIGGETT  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

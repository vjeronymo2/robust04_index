			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher warns on borrowing MRS Margaret Thatcher last night gave a stern warning of the consequences of imprudent government borrowing as she urged voters to support Mr John Major's Conservatives in order to prevent Labour undoing the policies of the past 13 years. In a robust address to the Finchley faithful, the former prime minister all but disregarded the 54,000 words of manifesto pledges unveiled by the leading parties this week - 29,000 of which were produced by the Conservatives. These were 'so detailed' it was difficult to see the broader general issues, she said. But broader issues were the ones that mattered. In a lengthy passage dedicated to the importance of 'sound finance', Mrs Thatcher - who is known to be privately dismayed by the sharp increase in government borrowing - argued that this was crucial to a country's standing overseas. 'People won't listen to you unless you demonstrate you can handle the economic affairs and finances of your country,' she said in remarks presumably intended to reach the ears of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. What sound finance meant was 'living within your means'. Using the plain language for which she was renowned when in office, she said that one consequence of this was 'having to say no to some public expenditure if it takes you over your top limit. 'Believe you me, no is a very useful word in government. It keeps your finances sound so that we were able actually to reduce our debt.' Mrs Thatcher's wide-ranging speech returned to the theme of Europe, which loomed so large in her downfall, haranguing 'socialist Delors' social charter' and warning against the consequences of a single European currency. She urged voters not to settle for a hung parliament. 'Coalitions are not decisive; majorities are, have been and will continue to be.' On a personal note, she said it was 'very strange' not to be addressing her largely elderly audience as a parliamentary candidate and that it was 'quite a wrench' to stand down. The meeting was convened to adopt Mr Hartley Booth, a former special adviser at Number 10, as her successor in the constituency.</p>

Defense  Ministry Threatens Loss of `Control Over the Armed Forces'"]    [Text] The Armed Forces' chiefs believe that the 1994  budget proposed by the government will bring about a catastrophe  unless defense expenditures are approved according to the  existing official draft. At a recent (not expanded and  closed-door) government meeting, First Deputy Defense Minister  Andrey Kokoshin said "at the request of the defense minister and  the ministry's collegium" that "neither the country's defense  capability nor the maintenance of the defense industry will be  possible at this level of financing. Clearly, the trend is  toward the loss of control over the Armed Forces."    In 1993, the defense budget was 7.1. trillion rubles [R]  (taking into account repeated indexations), but actual military  expenditures were greater, so by year's end the Defense Ministry  owed suppliers and its own staffers R2.2 trillion. Defense  Ministry representatives think that if the current inflation  rate (around 1,000 percent a year) holds on, at least R80  trillion will have to be spent on the maintenance of the Armed  Forces.    The new budget earmarks R37.1 trillion rubles for defense,  which accounts for approximately 20 percent of the budget  expenditures. Andrey Kokoshin claims that this amounts to a more  than two-fold decrease in actual expenditures. In 1992, when  market reform began, the government slashed its defense orders  by 67 percent. At the time, the government assured the Defense  Ministry, however, that there would be no new drastic cuts, and  that the level of defense appropriations would remain unchanged  until 1995. Now the plans for military reform, personnel and  arms procurement cuts that were drawn up in view of a certain  amount of financing are in jeopardy.    Government orders for arms procurements in 1994 have already  been approved, but Defense Ministry specialists estimate that  its implementation will cost R28.3 trillion, whereas the draft  budget calls for only R5.5 trillion. The Defense Ministry is  drawing up an official letter to the government demanding that:  first, that the cessation of armaments production in Russia be  openly declared; second, that the 1994 government defense orders  be canceled; and third, that contracts with enterprises for the  supply of weapons be abrogated.    Andrey Kokoshin believes that the implementation of the  draft  budget will result in the closure of over 3,000  military-industrial enterprises; as a consequence, around 4  million people will be out of work, 15 million of their family  members will be left without a living, and many Russian  "defense" cities will turn into social disaster areas.  Moreover, the army will have to fully stop signing up soldiers  under contracts, and also urgently to discharge from service  400,000 servicemen (over 20 percent of the entire strength).  Half of them are officers and warrant officers, who will have to  be discharged without legitimate service benefits and  accommodation.    The struggle for the budget continues, and each department,  according to an old Soviet tradition, is trying to grab as much  as it can. The Defense Ministry is currently losing to more  influential sectoral lobbyists. But the Armed Forces have yet  another, last argument in store. SEGODNYA has learned that the  president has written on General Grachev's letter stating the  army's budget arguments: "I share the defense minister's  concern. I ask you to weigh everything one more time. A  solution should be sought without detriment to Russia's defense  capability."</p>

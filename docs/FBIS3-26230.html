			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "Foreign Enterprises Set To Boom This Year"] </F>   [Text] Foreign-funded enterprises, which reached a total  of more than 140,000 last year, will continue to play a key role  in boosting China's foreign trade this year, according to  official sources.    But the growth of their imports led to a record trade  deficit  of $12.18 billion last year.    And this trend is expected to continue this year with a  sharp  increase in joint-venture imports, Chinese customs officials  predicted yesterday.    The foreign-funded firms' trade volume is predicted to hit a  record high of $94 billion this year, accounting for about 40  per cent of the country's total expected trade. This compares  with 34 per cent last year.    Equipment imported by the overseas ventures totalled a  record  $16.6 billion in 1993 and became the most important factor in  China's trade deficit.    And equipment imports are likely to double this year to  somewhere in excess of $34 billion, the Beijing-based General  Administration of Customs (GAC) said yesterday.    The officials made it clear that the rate of overseas  investment will increase now that China has unified its foreign  exchange rate this year.    Investment will be cushioned against financial risk of the  old market where hard currrency was sold at the low official  rate sometimes and bought on the foreign exchange at the high  swap market rate.    Meanwhile, overseas firms' exports are expected to grow more  than 35 per cent this year to reach a total value of over $34  billion.    But the increase of the overseas ventures' imports and  exports will impose a major strain on China's efforts to improve  its balance of payments this year.    And China's foreign exchange market, which is still weak  because supply and demand are the same, is likely to be affected  .    And the net import of funds over the last few years will  swing round to a net export this year. The sharp increase in  accumulated foreign business investment will mean an increase in  the amount of hard currencies used by them to repay capital with  interest.    Efforts to balance supply and demand in the foreign exchange  market will be further impaired by the increasingly large  remittances which will be sent abroad by overseas ventures this  year.</p>

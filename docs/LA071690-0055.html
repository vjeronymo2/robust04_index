			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MAJ. GEN. JOHN BRUCE; HEAD OF UNMANNED SPACE UNIT  </P> <P> Former Maj. Gen. John Bruce Medaris, the military director of the nation's  unmanned space program who after a seemingly miraculous recovery from cancer  devoted his remaining years to the Episcopal priesthood, has died of the  disease, it was learned Sunday.  </P> <P> Medaris was 88 when he died Wednesday at his summer home in Highlands, N.C.,  after a long struggle against bone and lung cancer. The announcement was made  by friends in Florida and reported by United Press International.  </P> <P> He had commanded the Army's early space program, the Army Ballistic Missile  Agency, when it orbited America's first satellite on Jan. 31, 1958. The program  was soon turned over to the civilian control of the new National Aeronautics  and Space Administration.  </P> <P> Col. Pat Patterson of Maitland, Fla., a friend of Medaris' for 47 years, said  the former general had picked the nation's first team of space scientists, both  military and civilian, "and I have never seen a team surpass that one."  </P> <P> The historic team that built those first missiles was headed by German  scientist Wernher Von Braun, father of the Saturn V rocket that was to send  Americans to the moon and a pioneer in the development of Germany's wartime V-2  rocket. Kurt H. Debus, the Kennedy Space Center's first director, was another  team member.  </P> <P> The expatriated German scientists that included Von Braun had been sent after  the war to Ft. Bliss, Tex., and later transferred to the small north Alabama  cotton town of Huntsville where Medaris became their commander.  </P> <P> There was little sense of urgency about the nation's embryonic space program  until the Korean War broke out in 1950. Then seven years later, on Oct. 4,  1957, the Soviet Union launched the 184-pound Sputnik I, the world's first  orbiting satellite.  </P> <P> On Dec. 6, Medaris' team tried to respond by sending a three-pound satellite  into orbit, but the Vanguard rocket which was to have propelled it rose two  feet off its Cape Canaveral launch pad and exploded into a giant fireball.  </P> <P> America finally got into space Jan. 31 when a Jupiter C booster hurled the  31-pound Explorer I into orbit. The satellite discovered the Van Allen  Radiation Belt.  </P> <P> Medaris was born in Milford, Ohio, and at 16 lied about his age to get into the  Marines. After a couple of years, he resigned and tried his hand at business,  where he made but then lost a fortune.  </P> <P> Medaris entered the Army as a second lieutenant and came through 300 days of  World War II combat unscathed.  </P> <P> An ordnance expert, he served as chief of the first Army contingent to  Argentina from 1949 to 1952, and in 1955 was named commander of the Ballistic  Missile Agency.  </P> <P> He became known as an aggressive, often arrogant commander who would roll over  anyone in his way. He even carried a swagger stick for emphasis.  </P> <P> But in 1964, four years after retiring from the service, he was stricken with  bone cancer and told he had only 18 months to live. Eighteen months later he  was not only still alive, but the cancer somehow had gone into remission.  </P> <P> "The thought had sometimes crossed my mind that perhaps a power, or whatever it  was, was keeping me intact because there was some important job that I was  destined to do," he said in a 1970 interview.  </P> <P> He told the Los Angeles Times in a 1982 interview from Cape Canaveral, where he  had gone as an honored guest to watch the launch of the space shuttle Columbia,  that he decided to repay the debt by service to his church.  </P> <P> He said he originally intended to become only an Episcopal deacon but "soon I  found myself irresistibly forced into (other) situations." He thus became the  Very Rev. John B. Medaris, rector of Anglican churches in Maitland and Orlando,  Fla.  </P> <P> In recent years, the International Aerospace Hall of Fame made Medaris a  fellow, its highest award. The Army awarded him the first Medaris Award to Army  Space Pioneers.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the cancer resurfaced in 1970 but again went into remission,  returning only recently.  </P> <P> Although he had become a man of God, he did not lose the aggressiveness that  had marked his military days and remained particularly critical of the  decisions made many years earlier that separated military and civilian space  objectives.  </P> <P> "It's one of the greatest mistakes we ever made."  </P></p>

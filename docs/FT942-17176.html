			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Barco lifted by sales expansion in Asia Expanding sales in the Asia Pacific market helped Barco, the Belgian electronics group, push profits 22.7 per cent higher last year, writes Gillian Tett in Brussels. Profits after tax for 1993 were BFr1.1bn (Dollars 30.5m), up from BFr900m the year before, and BFr600m in 1991. Total turnover rose by 4.1 per cent to BFr10.5bn, up from BFr10.1bn in 1992. Turnover in Asia Pacific rose by 21 per cent partly due to a 44 per cent growth in the sales of data and graphics projectors, which form a core part of Barco's business. However, conditions elsewhere had been harder, the group said, with an 11 per cent growth in turnover in the US market and 4 per cent fall in Europe. Although the climate for investment remained weak in Europe, prospects in Asia and South and North America were 'exceptionally' encouraging, the company said. It added that it expected to record a similar level of growth next year.</p>

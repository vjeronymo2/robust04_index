			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Abu Dhabi in talks to improve returns for BCCI creditors The government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, is considering an agreement with the liquidators that would provide a greater return to hundreds of thousands of creditors around the world. Mr Ghanim Faris Al Mazrui, chairman of the working group on BCCI for the majority shareholder, said that he wanted to see creditors receive more money to compensate them for delays in any payout since the bank was closed by regulators in July 1991. It has also emerged that a predecessor firm of Ernst &amp; Young, who were principal auditors to BCCI until 1986, highlighted serious concerns at the bank with audit verification, internal auditing and the need for a single worldwide auditor in 1979. Abu Dhabi has held intense negotiations with the liquidators to BCCI in the last few weeks following the rejection by the Luxembourg appeal court last October of a previous agreement. Abu Dhabi would prefer to reach a negotiated settlement rather than pursue lengthy legal actions against BCCI and its liquidators which could drag on for many years and sustain prolonged and politically embarrassing coverage of the case. 'We are a nation not a corporation,' said Mr Mazrui. 'Things have changed . . . we have waited for two years, corporations have suffered, families are not eating steak any more. There should be some compensation. We are flexible on that score. We like to have friends not enemies. We don't want to leave any bad feelings.' Mr Mazrui, who sat on the boards of BCCI companies from 1981, maintained Abu Dhabi's position that it was unaware of the fraud at the bank until April 1990 when Mr Swaleh Navqi, BCCI's chief executive, made the first of a series of confessions. 'I can say from now till the Day of Judgment from what I can see no one on the board knew about the fraud. We never, never suspected,' he said. A new agreement is unlikely to involve Abu Dhabi providing additional money to creditors. Instead, it is believed to be considering waiving and restructuring some of its claims. These include a Dollars 2.2bn investment portfolio managed by BCCI which was stolen to stem losses generated within the bank, Dollars 400m in deposits from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the assets of BCCI's operations in the United Arab Emirates.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The MMD [Movement for Multiparty Democracy] national  chairman, Elias Chipimo, today refuted reports that he will soon  quit his party post. In an interview with ZNBC [Zambia National  Broadcasting Corporation] in Lusaka, Mr. Chipimo said that he is  not yet ready to quit his party post. He said that reports  (?which) have quoted him as saying that he will soon quit his  post are false [words indistinct] to the conference, said he has  never said anything about quitting his party post and that  reports attributed to him were misinterpretations of his  intentions.</p>

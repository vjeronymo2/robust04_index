			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> MILITARY TO WEIGH BARGAIN-SHOPPING  </P> <P> Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood promised a Senate subcommittee today to  take a closer look at buying the Pentagon more "off-the-shelf" products to save  money.  </P> <P> Atwood, who was General Motors' No. 3 official before accepting the No. 2  Defense Department post, told the Government Affairs Committee's oversight  subcommittee that he "strongly favors increased use of commercial products  throughout the Department of Defense."  </P> <P> Challenged by subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) to meet with private  business leaders to review why some of them are declining to bid on government  contracts, Atwood said, "I accept that . . . (although) a year ago I'd have  been on the other side of the table" protesting that contract bidding  requirements were too stringent and made it impossible to do business with the  government.  </P></p>

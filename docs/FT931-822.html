			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: BAT's scrip deal looks a winner - Small shareholders will benefit BAT INDUSTRIES announced this week that it wants to offer a scrip dividend worth 50 per cent more than the 22.6p final cash dividend which the tobacco and financial services group had already announced on March 10. RTZ Corporation, the mining group, also plans to offer a scrip dividend 50 per cent higher than its recently announced cash dividend of 13.5p. Other companies are considering enhancing their scrip, but only a few are likely to find this an appropriate way of rewarding shareholders. BAT has taken this course partly because its large overseas earnings give it a problem with unrelieved advance corporation tax. ACT is not payable on scrip issues, and this scheme - depending on the level of take-up - could save the company Pounds 100m in ACT and Pounds 330m in dividends. BAT shareholders who still want cash can sell their scrip, worth 33.9p a share, for 32.2p. Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, BAT's joint broker, will not charge dealing costs: the 5 per cent discount is to cover BZW's market risk in underwriting the deal. Although institutions such as pension funds traditionally are wary of scrip issues, the best advice for small shareholders is clear: vote for and then take the enhanced scrip, assuming the scheme is approved by the necessary 75 per cent majority at BAT's annual general meeting in May. Those wanting cash should also take advantage of BZW's dealing offer. The accompanying graph shows that all small shareholders will benefit from taking the scrip. The biggest gainers will be basic-rate taxpayers who have not used their annual capital gains tax allowance, while the smallest will be higher-rate taxpayers who pay CGT. The bottom of each column shows the value of the cash dividend; the top shows the value of the scrip for those who pay just tax and those who pay both tax and CGT. Gross funds - institutions such as pension funds which pay no tax - dislike scrip dividends because they are unable to reclaim an ACT credit on them. Normally, however, scrip issues are set at the same level as the cash dividend. BAT believes it can afford to tempt institutions by enhancing the scrip because its lucrative tobacco business is hungry for cash, and the group is confident it can get a sufficiently high return on the cash saved. Scrip issues normally are dilutive, by expanding the share base, but BAT estimates this scheme will end up enhancing both net asset value and earnings per share. The group is confident it will achieve the necessary majority from its institutional investors, partly because it promised it will not repeat the exercise. BZW worked for 18 months on this scheme and said it had nothing to do with last week's Budget changes in ACT. Indeed, by promising to address the problem of unrelieved ACT next year, the chancellor limited the period in which this novel manoeuvre can be promoted.</p>

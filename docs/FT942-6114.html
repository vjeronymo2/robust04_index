			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Independents fail to secure review of British Gas assets Independent gas marketers have failed to persuade Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, to order a root-and-branch revaluation of the assets of British Gas's transportation and storage system. The independents believe the current valuation of the assets is too high, and have lobbied strongly for Ofgas to reappraise it in its forthcoming consultation paper on transportation and storage charges. British Gas will charge the independents for use of the transportation and storage system, but its earnings from this will be limited by applying a permitted maximum rate of return to the value of the assets. If, as the marketers believe, the assets are valued too high, British Gas will be able to justify higher charges. That would limit the ability of the independents to offer cheaper prices to customers once the phased opening of the domestic market begins in 1996. Ofgas officials say there is no time to launch such an extensive exercise in the run-up to competition. They will instead rely on the assumptions used in 1992, when they devised the present tariff formula, which is presently set at retail price index minus 4 percentage points. At that time, Ofgas commissioned an independent assessment, which valued British Gas's transportation and storage assets at about Pounds 17bn, a figure with which British Gas broadly agrees but which some independent marketers say is 'hopelessly inflated' because the system has been built to too high specifications. The marketers have also questioned whether British Gas needs all the assets it has placed in transportation and storage. Ofgas plans a full review of the transportation and storage and tariff formulas before 1997, when the present tariff formula ends. The transportation and storage consultation paper will include details of the formula that will govern the price British Gas can charge over the next three years for its transportation and storage facilities, now known as TransCo. The new system is expected to be working by October. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission last year recommended a rate of return for existing TransCo assets of 4 per cent-4.5 per cent, and 6.5 per cent-7.5 per cent for new assets. Ofgas officials say they would need a good reason to do anything other than what the MMC recommended. Some independent shippers have asked that a tariff of RPI -10 be set to ensure that British Gas slashes what they consider to be an extravagant cost base. But Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, recently warned that it needs a 'return which will enable us to maintain a viable and safe pipeline system and encourage new investment'.</p>

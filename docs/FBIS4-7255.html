			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Yi Han-tong, floor  leader of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], was  extremely upset Thursday as the main opposition Democratic Party  [DP] insisted on calling 51 witnesses for the parliamentary  investigation of the Sangmudae scam.    "Do they think they are some kind of commanders of occupying  forces?" Yi said in a meeting with reporters Thursday, the last  day of the National Assembly's current extraordinary session.    "Right now, the opposition party is making its demands as  though the ruling party hasn't got any choice but to surrender,"  Yi said bitterly.    "How could there be compromises with an opponent like that?"  the agitated floor leader asked rhetorically.    Commenting on the hardline taken by the opposition party, Yi  theorized that it probably resulted from the power struggle  between Chairman Yi Ki-taek and Rep. Kim Won-ki.    -- The presidential office at Chongwadae appeared to heave a  sigh of relief as the opposition Democratic Party showed signs  of retracting its demand that all cabinet ministers step down.    However, Chongwadae officials acted nonchalantly, asking,  "isn't it a matter of course?"    One official was more cautious: "We have to keep watching  the  opposition party's attitude until the end."    The DP had been critical of President Kim Yong-sam when the  chief executive forced Yi Hoe-chang to resign as prime minister  for challenging the president's authority.    The opposition party has been tabling a kind of  no-confidence  vote against the cabinet.    But realizing that under the current constitution and the  presidential form of government, the National Assembly has no  right to file a no-confidence vote against the cabinet, the DP  decided to seek the resignation of each and every cabinet member.    Then in a tricky parliamentary maneuver, the DP is demanding  that all cabinet members be listed on one ballot slip with  voting in one motion, in effect a no-confidence vote.    -- The ruling Democratic Liberal Party held a meeting of  senior party postholders and renewed its determination to handle  the three issues pending before the National Assembly Thursday,  the last day of the extraordinary session.    DLP Spokesman Ha Sun-pong called on the opposition  Democratic  Party to cooperate in resolving the three issues based on the  spirit of the constitution and parliamentary democracy.    --Over at the Democratic Party headquarters, the DP also  held  a meeting of the Supreme Council and reaffirmed that it would  demand that the National Assembly call all 51 witnesses  including former and current presidents for its investigation of  the Sangmudae scam.    The issue of calling the 51 witnesses had been the main  stumbling block in the current impasse over the DP's demand to  investigate the Sangmudae scam. The legislation and judicial  subcommittee agreed Wednesday night to conduct a parliamentary  investigation for 20 days from Thursday.</p>

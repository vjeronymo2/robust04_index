			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London robusta coffee prices sank to contract lows. Dealers said possible fund selling added to the pressure on an over-supplied market. London cocoa prices fell as Ivory Coast arrivals continued to be higher than previously forecast. News that an international cocoa agreement based on a withholding system was to be formally proposed by consumers at the ICCO talks had no apparent impact. London's freight futures market moved into free fall in afternoon trading after a limit fall of 50 points in the morning. A 16-point fall in the Baltic Freight Index to 1,299 sent further bearish signals. Compiled from Reuters</p>

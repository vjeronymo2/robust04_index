			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Continuing economic weakness seen INTERNATIONAL sluggishness, a high savings ratio and tight monetary policy in Germany suggest a weak UK economic outlook for this year, according to the London Business School. The economy will start to recover in the second quarter, thanks to some relaxation of monetary and fiscal policy, but it will be next year before output regains a growth rate of 2.5 per cent, by which time unemployment will have reached 2 3/4 m, says the school. In their latest economic forecast, built on the assumption that the Conservatives will win the general election, authors Mr Geoffrey Dicks and Professor David Currie say that output will grow by 1.2 per cent this year and by 0.8 per cent in manufacturing. The report says there is no sign that consumer borrowing is about to recover. The authors have reversed an earlier forecast that the savings ratio - currently 11 per cent - would fall this year in response to lower inflation and the fall in interest rates. Instead, they argue, it is likely to stay at around 10.4 per cent - which they predict it fell to in the fourth quarter of last year - because of the poor state of the housing market and the keenness of consumers to reduce debts. This implies that consumption will rise in line with real incomes - 1.5 per cent this year, and then between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent a year. Assuming a 1p Budget cut in the basic rate of income tax, the authors forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 22bn in 1992-93. They repudiate the suggestion that the UK recession was the product of an international downturn. However, they say it has been prolonged by international sluggishness. They argue that German monetary policy will remain tight, hindering the scope for UK interest rate cuts. The forecast singles out North Sea oil, energy and water as bright spots over the next few months. Economic Outlook 1991-1995.

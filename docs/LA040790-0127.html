			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Jury Upholds Genentech Patents: In an important decision for biotechnology  giant Genentech Inc., the company said a federal district court jury in  Delaware upheld the validity of three patents for its heart drug, TPA.  Genentech had sued Wellcome PLC subsidiaries and Genetics Institute Inc. in  June, 1988, for patent infringement of the clot-dissolving drug it markets  under the name Activase and for the process used to make it. Genentech lost a  similar case in London in November, 1988, when Britain's Appeals Court ruled  Genentech's TPA patent did not cover Wellcome's version of the drug.  </P></p>

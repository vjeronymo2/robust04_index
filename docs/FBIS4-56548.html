			<p>BFN     [Text] As soon as he returned from Uberaba, Brazil,  President Juan Carlos Wasmosy met with his ministers to evaluate  the 2 May workers strike.    [Begin Wasmosy recording, in progress] ...all the  information  to be able to make a general evaluation.    [Unidentified reporter] What can you tell us about the  killing?    [Wasmosy] I very much regret it. It is the tragic note of  the day.    [Reporter] Many people hold your government responsible for  it.    [Wasmosy] I am sure of it. I am held responsible for  everything that occurs in the streets, but I can assure you that  all appropriate investigations are under way and everything will  be placed in the hands of the courts. The courts will decide  and we will respect their decision.    [Reporter] Does the government still maintain what it said  yesterday when it characterized the strike as a failure?    [Wasmosy] I would like to be a little above those comments.  I think this will teach us to be a bit more mature. I never  shut the doors to dialogue. I have always been open to  dialogue. I will continue to wait for them to approach us.  This is the best way to reach an agreement. You are all aware  of the results of force.    [Reporter] Will the government convene a new meeting with  workers to negotiate?    [Wasmosy] Of course. The government has repeatedly made that  call. The negotiating table is open.    [Reporter] Do you think the result of the strike was  negative?    [Wasmosy] You have already commented on the strike enough  through the press. [end recording]</p>

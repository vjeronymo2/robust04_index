			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Chemicals chief warns of harsh competition Dr Manfred Schneider, chief executive of Bayer, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, has warned that European politicians did not understand how cut-throat international competition in the chemicals industry was becoming. Asian-Pacific chemicals companies were already making their presence felt in Europe, he said. But European competitiveness was being handicapped by high labour and social security costs as well as state intervention in environmental affairs. Slow approval for new products and processes was also taking its toll. The warning came as Dr Schneider announced his company intended to invest more than DM1bn (Pounds 400m) in the Asia-Pacific region by the end of the decade. The forecast underlines the increasing interest of European and American chemicals and drugs companies in the region. Dr Schneider, who was speaking at the Chemical Week Asia-Pacific Conference in Singapore, said demand for chemicals was growing rapidly in the region. He added the chemicals industry's leading customers - the textiles, electronics, automotive and engineering sectors - were all enjoying high growth. Imperial Chemical Industries, which today opens a CFC replacement plant in Japan, estimates the Asia Pacific market will grow from Dollars 280bn (Pounds 188m) to Dollars 460bn by the year 2000. Bayer, which had sales of about DM5.6bn in the Far East last year, welcomed the increasing industrialisation of the area, Dr Schneider said. The group aimed to increase sales in the region, but needed to expand its production base. See UK Company News</p>

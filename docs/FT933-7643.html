			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Management: A source of best practice The best companies in Europe have already achieved a 10-12 per cent reduction in their material costs, according to a survey on strategic sourcing by the consulting firm Booz. Allen &amp; Hamilton. The survey, conducted among 238 companies in the automotive, chemicals, consumer goods, electrical and electronics, heavy equipment and industrial products sectors, shows that the majority of businesses are now managing to contain material price inflation to between zero and 5 per cent a year. Purchased materials represent at least 40 per cent of turnover for more than two-thirds of the companies in the sample; in some cases the figure was as high as 80 per cent. Among the characteristics of those businesses which have done most to reduce costs and increase quality are: the commitment of top management to the purchasing process, the involvement of different departments in decision making and the separation of sourcing strategy from day-to-day execution. The research, among companies in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, confirms that the traditional 'arm's length' supplier relationship is declining in favour of greater interaction. Sixty per cent of those interviewed now insist on a regular presence at their suppliers, compared with 40 per cent five years ago. That trend is expected to continue over the next five years, so that the occasional visitors to suppliers will only represent about 25 per cent. Companies are reducing their supplier base at more than 3 per cent a year - a figure which Booz says is likely to double. The majority of the worst performing companies still use individual purchase orders, while the best performers are moving to 'lifetime' agreements or multi-annual contracts. The best also achieve more with fewer resources. In many cases the smaller the purchasing department the more impressive the performance in terms of material costs, material quality and inventory turnover.</p>

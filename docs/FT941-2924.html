			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television Friday is a good night for playing poker or going to the cinema. The rare item on television that looks vaguely interesting can be left to the video recorder. When you return, put the cassette on a shelf and leave for three days. With 99 per cent of programmes no further action will be necessary. One in a hundred cassettes need setting aside 'for watching one day when there's nothing else to do'. These need keeping for 30 days before the tape can be safely re-used. Among the programmes the VCR could handle tonight are A Song For Europe (8.00 BBC1); and this month's 174th programme about teenage sex, Public Eye (8.00 BBC2). Trendiest of topics at present is cars and the way that people use them. In addition to BBC2's regular 'Top Gear' we have had Alexei Sayle presenting 'Drive", and the C4 culture series 'Without Walls' is currently showing 'Carnography'. Now here comes From A To B: Tales Of Modern Motoring which seeks to do for tastes in motoring what 'Signs Of The Times' did for bad taste in the home (9.30 BBC2).</p>

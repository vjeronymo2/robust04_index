			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Equity Issues: Korean stock shortage boosts demand for GDRs DEMAND for global depositary receipts and convertible Eurobonds issued by Korean companies has been boosted by the lack of availability of Korean stocks. Although the Korean stock market has been partially opened to foreign investors, under Korean regulations foreign investors cannot hold more than 10 per cent of the shares in any Korean company, and that limit has already been reached in many cases. Consequently, foreign investors are willing to pay a premium to get hold of paper, which has fuelled issuance of GDRs and convertibles, which are not covered by the rules. Samsung Electronics's Dollars 150m recent issue of global depositary receipts, priced at the end of last week, was five times oversubscribed, according to lead manager Goldman Sachs. As a result, many participants in the deal were disappointed with their small allocations of paper. The lead manager reported an even spread of demand from Europe, the Far East and the US, where the GDRs are being placed under the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission's Rule 144A. The deal was the second GDR issue for Samsung, which is a favourite Korean stock, along with others in the electronics sector. The new GDRs were priced at Dollars 29.50, compared with Dollars 30.25 for the outstanding GDRs, and at a premium of 23 per cent (compared with 25 per cent, the current premium of the original GDR issue, with which the new GDRs become fungible early next year). Given the strong demand for the paper, a number of other Korean companies are also eyeing the market. Ssangyong Oil, the private-sector oil company, is contemplating a Dollars 150m convertible issue, while Jinro, a drinks manufacturer, may launch a Dollars 30m issue of convertible bonds.</p>

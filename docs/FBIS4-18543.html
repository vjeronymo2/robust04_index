			<p>BFN     [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, we will now read government  spokesman Evangelos Venizelos' reaction to the EU [European  Union] Commission's decision: Today's decision by the EU  Commission is inappropriate and contradictory. While it  recognizes the primary political character of the Skopje [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM] issue and the  Greek measures of 16 February, in principle, it chooses the  legal route to deal with the problem. Within this framework, we  should note: First, the EU Commission is holding back until 13  April. Second, the EU Commission is officially calling on  Skopje to amend its Constitution and flag. The Greek Government  expresses its regret, because this contradictory position by the  EU Commission does not take into account the recent report from  the UN secretary general to the Security Council or the  mediation of Cyrus Vance. The relevant political initiatives by  the European Union, which the Commission sees moving in parallel  with Vance's work, and the mission of Matthew Nimetz [U.S.  President Bill Clinton's special envoy on FYROM] are being  jeopardized. And there is the additional danger that the EU  Commission's decision today will encourage the intransigence of  the Skopjean Government, which, due to its stance, should be on  the receiving end of the international community's pressure.  The possibility of the EU Commission appealing to the European  Court is of secondary importance. In the final analysis, such a  development will provide the opportunity for Greece's rich and  strong legal arguments to unfold, arguments that complement the  political base of the Greek positions.    The government spokesman's statement concludes: The Greek  Government hopes that by 13 April and given that Vance has  already issued his invitation for 11 April, the EU Commission  can reach a more specific position that will aim to safeguard  peace and stability in the region and reinforce the EU's common  foreign policy.</p>

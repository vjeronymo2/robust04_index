			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Newcastle's monument to shopping THE GEORDIE shopping phenomenon entered a new phase yesterday with the opening of a 50-unit retail mall in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne. The Monument Mall, adjoining Eldon Square - which claims to be Europe's largest city-centre shopping complex - will strengthen Newcastle's hand in competing against the MetroCentre, Europe's largest out-of-town shopping and leisure centre, just across the River Tyne in Gateshead. The Monument Mall is the only retail scheme to be opened in Britain this year by St Martins Property Corporation, which has reined back development because of the recession. Construction of Monument Mall cost Pounds 23m; the scheme's total value including its site and shop outfitting will be about Pounds 70m. Although only part of the second floor was ready to start trading for yesterday's low-key opening, 15,500 shoppers visited the mall in the first four hours. Quite why Tyneside, the centre of an area with Britain's highest regional unemployment rate, should be such a mecca for shopping is constantly debated. One big factor is relatively low mortgages compared with the south-east giving good levels of disposable income for those in work.</p>

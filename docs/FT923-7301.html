			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Czechoslovak steel sales to EC curbed THE European Commission has authorised Germany, France and Italy to restrict some steel imports from Czechoslovakia after they complained about a big rise in cheap shipments, Reuter reports from Brussels. The Commission released the text of decisions setting 1992 quotas for Czechoslovak steel tube exports to Germany and recommending national quotas for exports of other steel products to Germany, France and Italy. The Bonn authorities complained that Czechoslovak exports of unwelded steel tubes to Germany had reached 37,377 tonnes in the first four months, compared with 7,226 tonnes in the same period of 1991. Czechoslovak sales were undercutting EC market prices by 20-30 per cent, they said.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Black gold from the Atlantic, who benefits? - Oil / Robert Corzine reports on development plans for Foinaven, the UK's first deep-sea field A new 'oil bonanza' was how some newspapers reported this week's announcement that the government had given the go-ahead for British Petroleum and partner Shell to develop Foinaven, the UK's first oilfield in the deep waters west of the Shetland islands. But will this herald a new British oil boom? And who is likely to benefit? Foinaven, named after a Scottish mountain, lies in 1,300ft to 2,000ft of water about 120 miles west of Shetland. Oil companies have long suspected the area could have oil but interest in the area was limited until recently because of the high risks and costs of operating in the open ocean. The risks have been reduced by recent advances in seismic and production technology. And companies, under pressure from relatively low oil prices, have slashed their capital and operating costs over the past few years by as much as 30 per cent. All this has made such frontier projects as Foinaven more viable. A study by 10 companies suggests the area, also known as the Atlantic Frontier, could contain 3.5bn barrels of oil. Full development of the 11 possible fields identified so far would cost about Pounds 9.5bn between 1995 and 2010. Government officials say full production from the area could represent about a third of present North Sea output. That would make it a 'world class' oil province, although well short of being a 'bonanza' of the type experienced when North Sea oil was discovered. Part of the reason for this is an industry perception that prices are likely to stay relatively low for some years. With the benchmark Brent Blend hovering between Dollars 15 to Dollars 18 a barrel, companies are reluctant to start expansive capital spending projects with long pay-back periods. The preference for projects with early production and equally early cash flows contrasts sharply with the heyday of the North Sea when oil prices were above Dollars 30 a barrel and there were forecasts that prices in the 1990s could reach Dollars 100 a barrel or more. There will, however, be some beneficiaries of even a mini-boom. These include the drilling contractors which own the 30 or so rigs in the world capable of operating with safety in such deep and turbulent water. Then, too, there are the specialised engineering companies which make the complex sub-sea wells that sit on the ocean floor and are connected by flexible pipes to production and storage ships on the surface. The jobs outlook is not quite so optimistic. Although some new ones may be created in the mainly Scottish-based offshore support industry, it is more likely that existing jobs will be secured. As for the companies, BP is clearly the biggest beneficiary so far - and its risk-taking is likely to be rewarded by the government in the form of new exploration licences in the area. But others which are active west of Shetland include Amerada Hess, a US concern which has expanded rapidly in the UK in recent years, Texaco, Total, Conoco, Mobil and Amoco. Will the average Briton see any benefits? The government says yes, given the important role played by oil in supporting UK industrial production and balance of payments. Others disagree. Robert Mabro, head of the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies, says the government's view is 'just crazy'. He claims the decision not to charge companies a royalty on oil is tantamount to giving them a national resource without charge. Mabro adds: 'It's as if the government handed out buildings rent-free to businesses and simply charged them corporation tax on their profits.'</p>

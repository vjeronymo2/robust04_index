			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ransomes in the black with Pounds 900,000 BETTER GRASS growing conditions helped Ransomes, the grass cutting machinery maker, return to profitability in 1992. The group, however, remained highly geared. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 900,000 and replaced losses of Pounds 4.6m on turnover 6.7 per cent higher at Pounds 156.6m (Pounds 146.7m). Aggregate turnover at the America and commercial divisions rose to Pounds 112.7m (Pounds 110.7m) and gave an aggregate operating profit ahead 64 per cent, from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 6.9m. The consumer division increased turnover by 22 per cent to Pounds 43.9m (Pounds 36m) giving an operating profit of Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 600,000). Tax more than doubled from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1.3m - an effective charge of 48 per cent of profits before the exceptional item - largely arising out of unrelieved overseas losses. Currency movements contributed to a rise in gearing from 175 per cent to about 250 per cent. Losses per share worked through at 9p, against 17.3p last time. A Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.5m) exceptional charge was provided for the write down of assets on the transfer of the Brouwer operation from Canada to the US.</p>

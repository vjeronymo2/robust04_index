Are they so pathetic that they can't  have a good time without drinking?  </P> <P> Isn't it illegal to drive with an open container? I'll bet officers could  arrest every other driver at the entrance to the parking lot.  </P> <P> I may drink moderately on social occasions, but this extreme dependency is  disgusting and immature, especially in light of the resultant behavior.  </P> <P> JOY JONES  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo  </P></p>

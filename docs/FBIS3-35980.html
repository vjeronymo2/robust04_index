According to him, "relations between the three CIS states  will be implemented within the framework of the strategy and  political course determined during the meetings of leaders of  the Commonwealth and in bilateral agreements."    If Belarus adopts a position toward Russia that differs from  that under Stanislav Shuskevich, "the appropriate reaction from  Russia will follow, too. And the same applies to Ukraine,"  Sergey Krasavchenko noted.    The advent to power of Yuriy Meshkov, president of Crimea,  who is a radical supporter of the peninsula becoming a sovereign  entity "may complicate relations between Russia and Ukraine, if  certain forces strive to draw Russia into the nascent conflict."  However, he stressed, "there are normal, civilized, political  methods" that may help avert confrontation. Recalling the  statement by Yuriy Meshkov that he does not intend to seek  Crimea's immediate departure from Ukraine and its annexation to  Russia, Sergey Krasavchenko noted that "no major grounds for  tension should arise."</p>

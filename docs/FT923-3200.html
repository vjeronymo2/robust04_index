			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Sterling still faces hurdles THE FULL impact on sterling of yesterday's realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism will only be known after the results of today's special meeting of the Bundesbank council. In the weeks before the realignment, foreign exchange dealers had assumed that a unilateral devaluation of the lira would put renewed pressure on the British pound. Their assumption was that devaluation of the Italian currency would undermine investor confidence in sterling, which is widely regarded as the second most vulnerable currency in the system. That vulnerability has not gone away despite last night's events. 'Now that the lira has been devalued, sterling is the most exposed currency in the system,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London . However, a cut in German interest rates would remove what has been the biggest pressure on sterling until now. With short-term interest rates in Germany at 9.75 per cent, the Bank of England's policy of keeping base rate at 10 per cent has provided currency speculators with too small a return on their investment until now. 'We could get a German cut of 50 basis points or even 100 basis points,' said Mr Lyons. But, he added that the size of the reduction was less important than the move itself. Until now, investors had been anxious that the next move in German interest rates could be up rather than down. A cut in rates today would be the first official cut in Germany since 1988, when the Bundesbank raised the discount rate from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent. However, even if there is a one percentage point cut in Germany's Lombard rate today, sterling will still face a number of hurdles. The first problem would be new signs that the UK economy is in the grip of recession. The outlook for the economy remains weak, with many analysts assuming that there will be negative growth in the UK this year followed by only a modest recovery in 1993. Thursday's monthly unemployment figures for August are almost certain to show a rise in the number of people out of work, and may check any surge in confidence that appears today. Another problem for sterling will be France's referendum on the Maastricht treaty on Sunday. Until recently, currency investors had bought weaker EMS currencies such as sterling and the lira because they assumed that both the UK and Italy would have to rein in their annual public sector borrowing requirements in order to meet the convergence criteria set out in the Maastricht treaty. If the French vote No on Sunday, the markets could assume that European Monetary Union is dead and will unwind their earlier investments. 'If the French reject Maastricht, then this realignment will have done little to stabilise the tensions in the EMS,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London. As they tried to absorb last night's dramatic events, some analysts were confident that the immediate outlook for the pound was promising. 'Sterling will rally on Monday morning, but it is not yet clear by much,' said Mr John Shepperd, an economics analyst at S G Warburg in London. 'The domestic money markets were discounting a rise in UK base rates. 'If the Bundesbank cuts rates, there will be hectic trading as the money markets shift their position radically. The equity market could rise too.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   CENTRAL RATE CHANGES WITHIN THE EMS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Date             Currencies                            % realignment  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 13/3/79          Start of EMS 24/9/79          D-Mark                                +2                  Danish krone                          -2.9 3/12/79          Danish krone                          -4.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 23/3/81          Lira                                  -6 5/10/81          D-Mark, guilder                       +5.5                  Lira, French franc                    -3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 22/2/82          Belgian franc                         -8.5                  Danish krone                          -3 14/6/82          D-Mark, guilder                       +4.25                  Lira                                  -2.75                  French franc                          -5.75  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 22/3/83          D-Mark                                +5.5                  Guilder                               +3                  Danish krone                          +2.5                  Belgian franc                         +1.5                  Lira, French franc                    -2.5                  Punt                                  -3.5 22/7/85          Belgian franc, punt                   +2                  D-Mark, guilder                       +2                  French franc                          +2                  Danish krone                          +2                  Lira                                  -6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 7/4/86           D-Mark, guilder                       +3                  Belgian franc                         +1                  Danish krone                          +1                  French franc                          -3 4/8/86           Punt                                  -8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 12/1/87          D-Mark, guilder                       +3                  Belgian franc                         +2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 8/1/90           Lira (adoption of                     -3.7                  narrow band)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 14/9/92          All except lira                       +3.5                  Lira                                  -3.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

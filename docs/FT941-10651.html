			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minerals sector needs to woo foreign capital - Most of the existing mining industry is in a pitiful state Opening the school of mines in St Petersburg in 1719, Peter the Great proclaimed: 'Our Russian state, in comparison with many other foreign countries, is blessed with all necessary metals and minerals'. This perception of Russia as a treasure house of minerals persisted until recently. It was encouraged both by a communist regime that saw self-sufficiency in raw materials as an important element in the nation's capacity for self-determination and by conservative hawks in the West who used the notion to dramatise the dangers of Soviet infiltration in other mineral-rich parts of the world, notably southern Africa. Since the opening up of Russia to the West the existence of substantial economic deposits of oil and gas has been confirmed. For metals, however, the evidence is far less clear. Moreover, some of the resources that do exist are in remote eastern regions that lack the infrastructure to permit the establishment of viable mining activities. What is clear is that most of the existing mining industry is in a pitiful state. Grades at copper, lead and zinc mines are well below those in the West; the mineral from which aluminium is produced is of a quality that would not be used elsewhere; and the alluvial gold deposits of the far eastern region, long the mainstay of Soviet production, are largely worked out. Nickel alone appears to be mined from a deposit of genuine world class, that at Norilsk, in the far north. Throughout the industry under-investment has left operations with inadequate equipment, very low productivity and primitive environment protection practices. These problems are being added to daily by increases in energy and transport costs and by a breakdown in the payments system. In consequence, between 1989 and 1993 the country's production of copper fell by about 22 per cent, of zinc by 27 per cent and of nickel by 48 per cent. One option available to Russia is to focus its reconstruction efforts on downstream manufacturing activities. But this would be unwise for three reasons: first, bad as the condition of of the mining industry is, the sad fact is that this is one of the healthier industrial sectors; second, metals are important export items (second only to oil and gas) and for the foreseeable future Russia will have precious little else to sell. And finally, attempts to compete in manufacturing will pitch Russia into direct competition with the low-wage economies of the Far East and the more strategically located countries of Europe. To develop Russia's mining industry will require capital, and capital is one thing Russia does not have. One answer is to turn to foreign investors. But although in their public statements the Russian authorities appear favourable to foreign investment, in practice they are more ambivalent. There remains a deep-rooted suspicion of the motives of foreigners and a fear of under-selling the country's mineral wealth. To the extent that a role is seen for foreign companies, it is frequently in the development of deposits of too low a grade of too complex for local companies. The successes of the nationalists in the December parliamentary elections can only reinforce these tendencies. No country is obliged to accept foreign investors on its soil, but if Russia really is interested in involving foreign capital in major mining development there are issues that it needs to address: Greater openness is needed. Before all else, western companies have to be convinced that there is something worth investing in. At present, however, they are only able to visit selected sites by invitation or work from lists containing limited detail. Clarification is required on how jurisdiction over mineral resources is to be divided between the centre and the regions. While Moscow was preoccupied with the battle between President Yeltsin and the parliament, many regions took the opportunity to assert sovereignty over resources within their borders. The new constitution appears to reverse this tendency, but the need for clarification remains. Finally, greater realism needs to be displayed in the legal and fiscal conditions for foreign investment. Western mining companies will need to be able to assure their shareholders that they will see a return on their money. Much Russian legislation on resources has been framed with oil and gas in mind and is inappropriate for hard minerals. For instance, the typical demand for a 20 per cent royalty on revenue from gold mining in addition to a 35 per cent tax on profits, could easily translate into and effective tax rate of over 100 per cent of profits. Russia has been edging towards a new role in a competitive world economy. In this economy, countries wanting inward investment have to compete for it, just as companies have to compete for good investment opportunities. Unfortunately, years of isolation have left Russia without an adequate basis for international comparison and have permitted the perpetuation of myths about its mineral wealth. Russia is not a special case. It may have extensive mineral deposits, but these are of little value without the capital to get them out. In the world that Russia is joining, capital does not come without capitalists. David Humphreys is deputy chief economist at the RTZ Corporation.

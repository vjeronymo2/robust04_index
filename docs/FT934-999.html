			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Shipyards win aid extension The European Commission has extended the system for providing subsidies to European Union shipbuilders for another year, and called on non-EU governments to make greater efforts to cut anti-competitive practices before the end of next year. The Commission agreed to maintain production aid for new ships at 9 per cent of the value of contracts after January 1 1994. Aid for ship conversions and the building of small ships will be limited to 4.5 per cent. The EU had hoped to eliminate all shipbuilding subsidies in the Union by the end of this year, but it was decided in May that the deteriorating economic position of EU shipbuilders made that politically impossible. In a statement, the Commission said the EU was looking to end subsidies by January 1 1995, but only if other parties eliminated all their trade distorting measures and regulations such as injurious pricing, home credit schemes and domestic-build requirements. The Commission singled out the US, Japan and Korea for particular criticism, and also attacked 'high aid levels' available in certain Efta countries. Swan Hunter lifeline, Page 4</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand will invite Burma to attend the ASEAN  foreign ministers' meeting scheduled for July in Bangkok.  Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri told reporters  at a briefing about his discussions with the Philippines foreign  minister at the Sukhothai Hotel this morning. He said the  Philippines foreign minister reported about his visit to Burma  and meeting with high-level Burmese leaders. The Philippines  minister noted a considerable change in Burma. He told Prasong  that the Philippines had no objection to Thailand's plan to  invite Burma to attend the coming ASEAN foreign ministers'  meeting in July.    [Begin Prasong recording] He has visited Burma and I have  just been back from Laos, so we made an appointment to meet this  morning. He told me about his visit to Burma. He believes Burma  has changed a lot. He said he met high-level Burmese leaders  who informed him of changes in Burma and their determination to  solve internal economic, social, and political problems. Burma  hoped its constitution drafting would be completed soon and a  general election be held. The Philippines minister also told me  that his country had no objection to Thailand's plan to invite  Burma to attend the ASEAN meeting in Bangkok in July. We also  exchanged views on Cambodia. I briefed the Philippines about  the general situation, and I also told him about our refugee  policy, which is that we have no policy to take in more of them.  [end recording]</p>

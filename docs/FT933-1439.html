			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Bosnia given a different path to peace: New negotiating tactics LORD OWEN and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators shuttling between Balkan capitals, insist that a peace agreement on Bosnia 'is closer than ever before'. The phrase is familiar and as the Bosnian parliament prepares to discuss the latest peace plan on Tuesday, objections by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, could still puncture their hopes. But the negotiating tactics are different this time. Lord Owen's sudden optimism is not entirely disingenuous. In recent weeks, there have been some significant shifts in the mediators' approach which could yet push the sides into signing a deal. On the one hand, knowing that western governments are anxious for a swift peace, regardless of what kind of rump Bosnian state remains for the Moslems, the mediators have stepped up political and psychological pressure on the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government to accept the 30 per cent now on offer. Deprived by the international community of any muscle to reverse Serb and Croat military gains in Bosnia, the mediators have been using secret meetings as their main weapon - a tactic that has left them shuttling among the Balkan capitals. They could be sipping wine with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade one evening, leaving at dawn to investigate Adriatic ports, before meeting Croatian President Franjo Tudjman the next day. The second shift has been in the mediators' ambitions. Instead of aiming for a final land deal, they have been pushing the sides to sign an overall peace agreement first, leaving some thorny territorial details, such as Sarajevo, or the boundaries of the Moslem enclaves in the east, to be disentangled later through joint working groups. The approach seems to owe much to the Middle East negotiations - negotiations which Mr Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian foreign minister, initially participated in. 'There has been a shift,' admits one diplomat closely involved in the negotiation, who says that, as in the Middle East, some territorial issues are easier sorted out when the fighting has stopped. 'It is easier to leave the details to a time when people have stopped fighting each other,' he says. It is a tactic that seems, on the surface, not without risks. As Mr John Mills, spokesman for the negotiators, admitted several weeks ago, the devil in the discussions so far has been in the detail. And after 18 months of bloodshed, in which bitter battles have been fought for tiny chunks of land, leaving territorial issues open will leave some local commanders hoping to settle the uncertainties with force later. But as the envoys themselves repeatedly stress, winter is approaching. In spite of the recent flare up in fighting, all three sides seem militarily exhausted. And, more significantly, both the Serbs and Croats now have considerable motives to sue for peace. Since the Bosnian Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen plan for Bosnia, they have improved their position considerably, and Mr Milosevic is anxious to reach a deal to lift the sanctions on Serbia. In spite of ceding partial sea access to the Moslems last week, control over the Croat-dominated regions of western Hercegovina will also leave the Croat leadership achieving most of their territorial aims in Bosnia. 'Milosevic and Tudjman are hurrying to make their conquests official. We are not hurrying to make a general agreement,' says Mr Muhamed Filipovic, a Moslem opposition politician. Although Mr Izetbegovic has responded to mediators' optimistic outbursts by demanding more concessions - demands which gained him an extra 0.5 per cent of territory earlier this week - he has little reason to believe that he will succeed in negotiating a favourable settlement later. It seems unlikely that Mr Izetbegovic can postpone his endorsement of the partition plan for much longer. But for a broad peace deal to stick - and the territorial 'details' to be resolved - the mediators will need to ensure a rapid deployment of peacekeeping troops. Although it seems that Nato is preparing for deployment, with US President Bill Clinton's commitment still unclear and many in the alliance uncertain about who will pay for the force, ensuring whether the troops will be able to get there fast enough remains yet another great uncertainty.</p>

Kizer announced the plan Thursday  during a tour of Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> /Drew Medical Center in Watts, one of four hospitals statewide that will share  a grant of $1.3 million to expand prenatal services to black women.  </P> <P> The infant mortality rate statewide is 8.6 babies for every 1,000; the rate  among blacks is 15.8 per 1,000.  </P> <P> Kizer said that, beginning Wednesday, the state will make sickle-cell anemia  screening available to each of the estimated 525,000 infants born in California  each year. The $365,000 set aside for King will go toward a collaborative  effort with the Watts Health Foundations to expand maternal services in Compton  and South Los Angeles. The state also awarded grants to the West Oakland Health  Council, the East Bay Perinatal Council and San Joaquin General Hospital.  </P></p>

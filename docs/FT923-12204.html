			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Battle on beaches for Maastricht THE sun-loving French will not be allowed to escape weighty political matters of the day during their normally sacred August break. The ruling pro-European Socialist party and the extreme right-wing anti-European Front National (FN) have decided to take the battle over European union to the beaches over the coming month. The FN's youth section has hired two caravans to tour the Mediterranean coast and the southern Atlantic beaches in the first half of August. Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the FN's leader will launch the crusade on August 1 at Menton, an unattractive resort near Monte Carlo. Sunbathers will have no chance to turn over and go back to sleep once their ears have been bent by Mr Le Pen's rhetoric. The same beaches will be invaded in the second half of August by the Socialist party youth section's pro-European caravan campaign. Neither will holidaymakers be safe inland. The Socialist party has asked local politicians to sally forth with speeches, pro-Maastricht posters, badges and T-shirts. The FN and the Socialists have a lot to fight for. The French public is still pro-European, but the balance in favour is shifting, from nearly 70 per cent in the spring to around 60 per cent at the start of this month.</p>

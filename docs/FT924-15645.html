			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work (1): Users want information, not just systems THERE are three main topics in this issue of Software at Work, the sixth in the FT's series of quarterly software reviews. Europeanisation: the hot topic, deals with issues facing both user companies and software suppliers in catering for a Europe without trade barriers, but with the considerations of language, currency and cultural differences. Human resources: information systems evolved from the first preserve of data processing, payroll and personnel systems. Database marketing: the use of database techniques to find out more about customers and address them more cost-effectively by telecanvassing or direct mail. As always, Software at Work gives users the chance to explain how they implemented software products to solve business problems. The point of our research among users is not to find 'the best product.' Generally there is no such thing in the area of software products. However, there is usually a 'best fit', and a right way of going about the choice of a solution and its implementation. Our selection of case studies is designed to illustrate the process of choosing software. The aim is to highlight issues in both management and technology, passing on the benefit of experience to readers about to embark on the same journey. The stories are presented either as case studies (a minimum of one per product) or as site visits. The case studies generally carry associated details on the product and supplier, with 'pros and cons' contributed by interviewees who chose (or rejected) that particular solution. The site visits provide an opportunity to examine in more detail some strategies for information technology (IT) in these areas. Alongside the story, site reports carry a snapshot on the subject company, plus a system profile of the technology and services in use. The consultant's critique highlights the lessons to be learnt from the site, assessing the effectiveness of the chosen solution. To check that today's success story is not tomorrow's disaster, we occasionally return to chosen sites to update the story. A list of buzzword definitions is included to help those readers who grapple with the obscure terms and acronymns adopted by IT experts. The next issue: telling more tales In the next issue we will be seeking user stories in the areas of CAD-CAM, (computer aided design and manufacturing) and online database services. If you are a user with a tale to tell of how such a system has benefitted your company, we would be delighted to hear from you direct. Vendors of software and services wishing to contribute should note that pre-warned user contacts are a pre-requisite. Both user details and supplier details must be submitted in a particular format. To be sent the relevant forms, suppliers wishing to contribute should contact the Financial Times Surveys Department - in writing only, please - stating which topic is of interest. User details are requested by October 16 to allow time for telephone interviews. Please contact: Software At Work, Surveys Department Secretary, Financial Times, Number One, Southwark Bridge, London, SE1 9HL.</p>

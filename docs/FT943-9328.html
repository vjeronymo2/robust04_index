			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Diplomat tells of Saudi dissidents Mr Mohammed Khilewi, a senior Saudi diplomat trying to defect to the US, said this week he is part of a underground organisation of more than 75 dissidents working toward democracy in Saudi Arabia. 'We have one ministerial official and more than five ambassadors, all well-educated people working with us,' the former second-in-command of Saudi Arabia's diplomatic mission to the United Nations said in a telephone interview. Mr Khilewi said the underground group wanted to topple the Saudi regime, which he has accused of being financially corrupt and guilty of countless human rights violations. 'Human rights is a small goal compared with the democracy,' he said. 'We are seeking to have a democracy and a civilised society.' In addition to human rights abuses, Mr Khilewi, who filed for political asylum in June, alleges his country gives financial backing to international terrorists - including the radical Moslem group Hamas, which opposes Arab-Israeli peace - and ordered its diplomatic missions to spy on US Jewish groups. He also said the Saudi government was attempting to acquire nuclear weapons. Mr Khilewi further alleges Saudi officials in the US secretly diverted government funds to their own pockets. He says he has 14,000 documents - some of them classified - in his possession that prove his claims, but few have been released to the media. In a meeting on Capitol Hill two weeks ago, Mr Khilewi briefed an unnamed member of the House of Representatives on the charges he has levelled against the Saudi government. 'Members of Congress have approached us to meet with them in an effort to expose the blatant human rights violations that are occurring in Saudi Arabia,' Mr Michael Wildes, Mr Khilewi's attorney, said. 'We have been asked to testify before Congress and Mr Khilewi has been asked formally by a member of the House of Representatives to come forward and collaborate all the information that has been provided thus far.' Mr Khilewi, who has been in hiding since June, is worried he will be refused asylum because the US does not want to damage its close ties to the Saudis, Mr Wildes said. Mr Wildes said he was contacted on July 22 by special agents from the the Federal Bureau of Investigations who said there was an 'imminent' threat to kidnap Mr Khilewi and take him back to Saudi Arabia reported by a 'credible' FBI source. But the FBI has not offered Mr Khilewi protection, Mr Wildes said.</p>

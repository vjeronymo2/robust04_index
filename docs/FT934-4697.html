			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Chemicals stake pushes Seagram into the red Seagram, the international drinks group, was pushed into the red in the third quarter by losses stemming from its stake in Du Pont, the US chemicals producer. The net loss for the three months to October 31 was USDollars 100m, or 27 cents a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 166m, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest figure includes a Dollars 239m loss, equal to 64 cents a share, resulting from non-recurring charges taken by Du Pont, in which Seagram has a 24 per cent interest. Revenues dipped to Dollars 1.41bn from Dollars 1.45bn, due to a Dollars 85m foreign exchange loss, while operating income was virtually unchanged at Dollars 197m, compared to Dollars 195m. Income of the wine and spirits group, accounting for over 90 per cent of the total, was unchanged. Weak sales in Europe, Seagram's biggest single market, were offset by a strong performance by Chivas Regal whisky and Martell cognac in south-east Asia and Latin America. Tropicana, the fruit juice maker, boosted operating income by 14 per cent to Dollars 25m, due to higher market share in the US orange juice market and improved international results. Earnings for the first nine months, excluding accounting changes, fell to Dollars 232m, or 62 cents a share, from Dollars 428m, or Dollars 1.14 a share. Pepsi-Cola Canada will cut prices in a corporate strategy that the company described as 'an all-out assault', AP-DJ reports from Toronto. Pepsi Canada said it would continue to streamline operations and administrative procedures and 'enhance its competitiveness by eliminating activities which do not directly add value to its products, consumers and retail customers'.</p>

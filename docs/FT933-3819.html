			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: PSB satisfies bid panel regarding stake in ICD A BREACH of takeover rules by a group of investors who recently bought into International Communications and Data has been rectified, the Takeover Panel said yesterday. The Panel ruled that the holding in ICD belonging to the investors led by PSB Group, a direct marketing company, breached its substantial acquisition rules. The group had acquired voting rights representing 23 per cent of ICD's equity. Under rules brought in to ensure that all shareholders can benefit from takeover activity, the Panel's rules require investors to wait seven days between purchases of 15 per cent tranches. It therefore ruled that PSB must dispose of voting rights on 4.24m shares, 8 per cent of the equity, and could not vote them in the meantime. This ruling had now been satisfied, the Panel said. ICD expects to announce a pre-tax loss for the year to May 31 of Pounds 5m in the next two weeks following a reorganisation. It is opposed to the group, in which Mr John Porter, son of Dame Shirley, the former leader of the City of Westminster Conservatives, is a 5 per cent shareholder. Mr David Cicurel, ICD's chairman, said: 'They have a lot of votes for very little money risk and I would jolly well hope they have the interests of all shareholders at heart.'</p>

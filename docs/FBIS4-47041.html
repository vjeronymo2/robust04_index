			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Foreign Capital Survives"] </F>   [Text] According to figures from the St. Petersburg joint  ventures association, there are about 8,000 joint ventures  registered in the city (according to the new terminology they  are called AOZT [private joint-stock companies] in the form of a  joint venture). No more than 10-12 percent of these engage in  production. The rest conduct commercial activity or exist purely  on paper--so that they can be "on hand" in case the tax climate  in Russia warms up. Under the current conditions foreign  investors do not see any point in creating any productions of  any kind in St. Petersburg. Promises from the federal government  to grant exemptions to enterprises in which foreign capital  participates have not been kept. But the number of joint  ventures, including of a production profile, is growing. For  example, a joint venture has been created for construction of a  plant for producing mini-electric power plants and a plant for  producing cigarettes under licenses. They will begin to work if  the tax burden is lightened.    At the same time it is expected that there will be a  reduction of the activity and possibly the elimination of a  number of joint ventures of a trade profile engaging in the  delivery of imported food. The new customs payments introduced  effective 1 July (announced in the spring) will make food  deliveries disadvantageous since even the least expensive  foreign products, taking customs payments into account, will be  priced too high for the city's rank-and-file residents.</p>

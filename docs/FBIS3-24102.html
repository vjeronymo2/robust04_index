			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kaj Skaaning: "Danish Help for Russian Oil </F> Industry"]    [Text] Energy Minister Jann Sjursen (Christian People's  Party) and DONG [Danish Oil and Natural Gas (Consortium)]  Chairman Holger Lavesen have begun talks with Russia's energy  minister on using Danish expertise in the race for the enormous  oil and gas reserves in Russia.    The Russians are interested in attracting Danish know-how.  Up  to 40 percent of the world reserves of natural gas are found in  Russia.    In connection with the just-completed visit to Moscow,  discussions were initiated among Sjursen, DONG Chairman Lavesen,  and Russian Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik.    "Among other subjects brought up were the possibilities for  employing Danish expertise with respect to geological  explorations and legislation dealing with the underground area,"  said Sjursen.    "In the area of gas and oil, there may also be interest in  cooperating with regard to know-how, exporting, organizational  issues, and tariff systems, as well as to training and  management programs."    A number of enterprises and organizations from the Danish  energy sector participated in the trip to Moscow, where at a  seminar in the Russian energy ministry they had opportunity to  present Danish technology and know-how in a number of  energy-related fields, such as electricity and heat generating,  district heating, renewable energy, oil and gas, as well as  metering of consumer use.    "In the conversations with Shafranik I received a very  current briefing on the enormous problems plaguing the Russian  energy sector. Among other ways, these are revealed in falling  energy production and in the serious debt crisis experienced in  many Russian energy companies," continued Sjursen.    A cooperation agreement, which had been under preparation  over a long period, was signed by the two ministers during the  visit.</p>

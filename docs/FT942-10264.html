			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mobile phones lift Ericsson Pre-tax profits at Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, almost doubled in the first quarter, rising to SKr813m (Dollars 105.58m) from SKr428m with booming sales of mobile phone equipment. But the figures disappointed a market already concerned by the group's loss of a big Saudi Arabian contract to AT&amp;T. The group's B shares fell SKr7 to close at SKr340. Mr Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson chief executive, said income and sales showed a 'clearly positive trend . . . in a market that is anything but easy.' He said the group was standing by its forecast that earnings for the full year would exceed last year's SKr3.1bn, in spite of increasingly fierce competition. Mr Ramqvist said the market was characterised by 'lower investments, depressed prices, politicising and financing problems.' In an oblique reference to AT&amp;T's Saudi Arabian success, he said there was 'increased political involvement in negotiations for major telecommunications projects.' Group net sales were 24 per cent ahead at SKr16.0bn. The best area was the group's radio communications division, which includes cellular operations, where sales rose 51.6 per cent to SKr7.2bn from SKr4.7bn. Public telecommunications sales climbed by only 6 per cent to SKr5.33bn. Orders were 23 per cent higher at SKr21.5bn. Ericsson's orders have risen for ten consecutive quarters, with a successful expansion in mobile phone systems. By contrast, public communications orders were lower. The group said this was because it benefited from big orders in the UK and Thailand in the first quarter of 1993.</p>

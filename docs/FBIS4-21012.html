			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, March 25 (CTK) -- The anti-drug squad  seized 24 kilograms of heroin worth 20 million crowns ($670,000)  on Thursday [24 March], Jiri Komorous, a police officer, told  CTK today.    Two Czech nationals were apprehended when trying to smuggle  the drug abroad, he added.    The drug was hidden in a van which the police were following  ever since the men had received the drug until they reached the  Varnsdorf, north Bohemia, border crossing.    There the van was dismantled and the drug confiscated,  Komorous reported.    The anti-drug squad has completed 16 operations of this sort  this year in which 24 persons were detained and accused of 34  criminal acts, he added.</p>

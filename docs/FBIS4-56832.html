			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares by </F> correspondent Veronica Duran; place and date not given; from the  "CMI Newscast" -- recorded]    [Text] [Perez Balladares] Torrijos always said we had two  countries with which we sleep every day: Colombia and Costa  Rica. Of course, they are our neighbors, and we want to have  very close, cordial, and helpful relations with them.    [Duran] What will be your position vis-a-vis the United  States?    [Perez Balladares] One of respect. I believe the  Torrijos-Carter Treaties are our best references. We, as well  as the United States, know that respect is the best way to  ensure good relations and that the implementation of and  compliance with those treaties are fundamental to positive  relations between our countries.    [Duran] Is it true that Panama is a U.S. puppet?    [Perez Balladares] No, God forbid. We, however, do have many  joint interests in the Panama Canal enterprise. Those interests  will continue, but with the difference that the Canal will now  be managed entirely by Panamanians. No, Panama is not a U.S.  puppet.    [Duran] Does the United States influence the government in  any way?    [Perez Balladares] The current government?    [Duran] Yes.    [Perez Balladares] Well, you will have to ask the president  that question. In my administration, there will be a great deal  of respect and consideration, but no influence.    [Duran] Do you see any political future for [presidential  candidate Ruben] Blades?    [Perez Balladares] I believe that, in addition to youth,  some  political experience is required, and Ruben, who is my friend  and whose music I enjoy, does not have it. I, of course, offer  him the opportunity to acquire this experience during my  government.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / S African parties agree deadline for all-race elections SOUTH AFRICA'S main political parties yesterday agreed that the country's first all-race elections would take place within 12 months, a significant breakthrough in constitutional talks. The 26 parties to multi-party talks near Johannesburg agreed to set an exact date for elections within four weeks and that the poll would be held no later than April next year. The decision amounts to a commitment to seek rapid agreement on a constitution to govern South Africa in the transition to full democracy, as well as on the basics of a final constitution. 'It's a monumental and gigantic step for millions of people looking for a signal of success in the negotiation process,' the African National Congress chief delegate, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, told journalists. But large differences remain on constitutional issues, and delegates admitted it would be difficult to resolve them in four weeks. Still, the news will boost public confidence in the negotiations which had become bogged down over procedural issues. Public frustration at the pace of talks has fuelled much recent violence. Mr Joe Slovo, chief negotiator for the South African Communist party, said the aim was to send a signal to South Africans that 'we are on the last mile'. He hoped it would 'put a fire under us, a deserved fire, to get the process moving with greater urgency'. The rightwing Conservative party and the government of the black homeland of Ciskei objected to the election date, but did not vote against it. The Inkatha Freedom Party supported the deal, which it had previously opposed on the grounds that no date could be set so quickly while vital constitutional issues remain unresolved. Conference delegates cautioned that Inkatha's support for the agreement did not mean the party was ready to accept the outline constitutional deal proposed by the ANC and government. That outline, agreed early this year, involves a multi-party government of national unity to rule until the end of the century, with limited devolution of power to regions, rather than the autonomy demanded by Inkatha. But the conference made a substantial concession to Inkatha when it agreed to consider setting up a technical committee to discuss the powers and functions of regions. In a move aimed at pressing the conference to concede 'self-determination' for Afrikaners, 18 rightwing groups said they had formed a united Afrikaner front, which would leave constitutional talks if the principle of self-determination was not agreed.</p>

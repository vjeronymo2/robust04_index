			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Partial reprieve for owl THE US administration yesterday gave a partial reprieve to the northern spotted owl, but proposed sharp reductions in the conservation areas set aside for the threatened species, writes George Graham in Washington. It also agreed to allow logging in a portion of the ancient Oregon forest that provides the bird's habitat. The Endangered Species Committee agreed to let the federal Bureau of Land Management sell timber on 13 parcels of land, although logging there might jeopardise the owl's existence. Only once, in 1979, had the committee by-passed the Endangered Species Act by granting such an exemption. The Interior Secretary proposed a plan to cut the federal land set aside for the birds from 5.4m to 2.8m acres.</p>

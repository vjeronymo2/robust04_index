			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Junk bonds The revival in junk bonds over the past year suggests that market memories are indeed short. Falling US deposit rates have forced investors away from the relative security of the banks towards bond and equity markets. Lacklustre performance there has tempted the brave back into high yield paper. There is a case to be made for the move. Many of the junk bonds currently being issued are on much more conservative terms than in the heyday of 1987-89. Earnings are bottoming out rather than peaking. The risks of corporate failure are undoubtedly lower. Yet the substantial risks may not have been fully considered by buyers disinclined to be fussy. Interest cover of two times on new leveraged buy-outs is hardly generous. A rise in short rates would both tempt money out of the junk market and put pressure on bond yields. Valuation criteria for junk have been notoriously elastic. With little firm notion of good value, prices could thus fall rapidly if sentiment changed. Mr Michael Milken made a career and a fortune from the proposition that junk bonds were mis-priced. Others lost vast amounts on the same notion. The clear winners in junk were those companies which retired cheap equity in the late 1980s with high yield bonds, survived, and are now buying back that junk cheaply with more expensive shares. Investors who now regard junk as a double-digit coupon bank deposit can expect little sympathy if it all turns sour.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-S&amp;L REGULATOR EYES CURRENT CRISIS AND SAYS 'I TOLD YOU SO'  </P> <P> From his balmy perch in south Florida, Edwin J. Gray is basking in the glow of  favorable publicity about his efforts to warn the nation of the impending  thrift industry crisis.  </P> <P> Gray's tenure as the nation's chief federal regulator for thrifts from 1983 to  1987 was a tumultuous one, marred by staff upheaval, travel expense scandals  and unending complaints about Gray's alleged inconsistency and incompetence as  a regulator.  </P> <P> But as time passes, Gray is starting to look like a prophet in his own time for  his repeated public warnings about the approaching dangers that eventually  overwhelmed the industry and threatened its future.  </P> <P> "It is not only conceivable, but in my view very possible, that at some point  in the future, massive infusions from the U.S. Treasury -- and hence the  American taxpayers -- may well be necessary to shore up the system," Gray told  a gathering of savings and loan executives in Washington in 1984.  </P> <P> Gray's dire warnings have proved unerringly correct. Hundreds of thrift  failures, brought on by imprudent lending, have bankrupted the Federal Savings  and Loan Insurance Corp. and forced the Bush Administration to come up with a  taxpayer-assisted bailout proposal that is expected to cost at least $90  billion.  </P> <P> Once excoriated by some members of Congress, Gray now encounters lavish praise.  Rep. James Leach (R-Iowa) recently called Gray "one of the great martyrs in  this crisis" who "found out what the problem was and acted like any honest,  prudent man should have acted."  </P> <P> Gray's past admonitions prompted Barron's magazine to compare him to William  Mitchell, the Air Force general who was ultimately court-martialed for  insubordination in his fight to prove the superiority of air power some seven  decades ago. Mitchell sought to show the vulnerability of ships to air attack.  </P> <P> "In many ways, Ed Gray . . . is a latter-day Billy Mitchell," the magazine  said. "Though, unlike Mitchell, Gray has lived to see his dire predictions come  true."  </P> <P> Now president of a savings and loan in Miami, Gray has labored tirelessly to  remind lawmakers and reporters about his public statements.  </P> <P> He has compiled and distributed thick papers showing excerpts of his warnings  going back to 1983.  </P> <P> Using typically colorful rhetoric in a letter last year to The Times, Gray  said: "The world was on notice. Red lights were flashing. I was the messenger.  The FSLIC crisis didn't happen overnight, or in a vacuum. . . . Where was  everybody when I was ringing the alarm bells?"  </P> <P> To be sure, Gray still has many critics, who say he was extremely difficult to  deal with and a poor administrator with little executive experience. Gray is an  erstwhile public relations man who worked for former President Ronald Reagan in  both Sacramento and Washington before taking the regulatory job.  </P> <P> His warnings notwithstanding, detractors say it was Gray who failed to rein in  fast-growing thrifts that later failed. "He's rewriting history," said  California thrift executive Herbert M. Sandler.  </P> <P> In the end, history's verdict on Gray is likely to be neither white nor black.  As longtime thrift industry analyst Jonathan Gray put it: "The guy has been  vindicated. It's unfortunate that he was not adept politically."  </P></p>

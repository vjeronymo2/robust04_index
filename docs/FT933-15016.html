			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Motoring: Be a VIP for just Pounds 15 NEXT YEAR'S British international motor show will be held once again at the National Exhibition Centre near Birmingham. Public days will be October 22-30, which will catch the half-term school holidays. This is crucial if there is to be a good attendance at what is being promoted as a family occasion. If you are prepared to pay Pounds 15 to enter instead of the normal Pounds 8, you will be able to call yourself a VIP and go to the preview day on October 21. The last show, in October 1992, broke a tradition of nearly 80 years by linking itself with the Daily Mail Midlands autumn ideal home exhibition; one ticket bought admission to both events. While the combination was not entirely popular, it will be tried again in 1994; the Mail's Pounds 2.5m contribution must be a powerful argument. Despite its imposing title and great size, the show is really a regional event; most of the public attendance comes from the Midlands. But London - which is where many, if not most, of the car-makers and importers would like the international exhibition to be held - will have its own motor show from October 21-31 this year at Earl's Court. It will not be run in tandem with any other event but, even more than Birmingham, is pitched at the whole motoring family. The London motor show, held in the years when there is no international exhibition at Birmingham, started life in the 1980s as Motorfair. At first, there was opposition from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which has always operated the 'official' show. But it refused to be killed off and, in recent years, has been run jointly by the SMMT and Earl's Court. Next year, the international show will pay the former Motorfair - which has always encouraged retail sales - a compliment. For the first time, the SMMT will use the National Exhibition Centre Pavilion to stage what is being billed as 'the largest motoring retail shop in the world.' New or used cars will not be on sale - but just about everything else concerned with motoring will.</p>

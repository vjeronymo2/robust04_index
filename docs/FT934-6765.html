			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Two US hotel chains enter contest for Ciga Two US hotel groups yesterday declared an interest in the Italian-based Ciga luxury hotel group, which last month announced it was negotiating a deal with Forte of the UK. ITT Sheraton and Host Marriott said they were interested in the highly-indebted chain, which is the subject of a restructuring plan organised by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank. Forte said last month it would take over the management of Ciga's 35 hotels in Italy, Austria, France, Greece, the Netherlands and Spain. In return, it would pay Pounds 33m (Dollars 48.6m) and insert some of its own luxury hotels, with a value of about Pounds 125m, into an Italy operating company. Forte is carrying out a due diligence examination of the chain. The Forte plan has, however, had a mixed reception among Ciga's banks, many of which have not received interest on the group's net debts of more than L1,000bn (Dollars 595.6m) for months. Ciga's Italian bankers have kept a low profile, in spite of frustration at delays in presenting the Mediobanca rescue plan. While concern not to offend Mediobanca has probably been the main cause of their inaction, the apparent lack of alternatives has been the other. Foreign banks have been more assertive in voicing their dissatisfaction. Matters have been made more difficult by Ciga's complex ownership structure. The company, which is listed on the Milan bourse, is controlled by Fimpar, the quoted financial holding company majority-owned by the Aga Khan. A group of lenders to Fimpar have taken legal action to freeze its Ciga stake. They have argued that any Ciga rescue package should take their interests into account. They have sought representation in the negotiations. Only one foreign bank, Barclays, has lent to both Ciga and Fimpar, and it is by far the most vociferous of the dissidents. Last month, it indicated opposition to the Mediobanca plan and criticised the bank for not examining alternative offers. Mediobanca, which traditionally refuses to talk to the press, could not be reached for comment yesterday. Host Marriott confirmed yesterday it was in discussions over the possible acquisition of Ciga. It said Marriott International, its sister company, could operate some or all of the hotels. ITT Sheraton said it was looking for properties to complement its business and a bid for Ciga was 'under preliminary review'. Forte countered yesterday that its luxury hotels made it more compatible with Ciga than the other two groups. It said, however, that it would not overpay for the chain.</p>

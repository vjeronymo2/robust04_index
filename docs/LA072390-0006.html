			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS;  </P> <P> ON BLACKS IN THE INDUSTRY  </P> <P> Brown tells us that African-Americans' will to survive in the entertainment  industry "is molded in dependency and the need for white approval." I find it  difficult to believe that Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy or any other  African-American struggling to be part of the entertainment industry spend much  time thinking about gaining white approval -- they're probably thinking about  how to entertain and (hopefully) enlighten their audience and how to make the  greatest amount of money doing it.  </P> <P> Brown's practice of hiring only "qualified black people" at Indigo Productions  in 1983 sounds just as racist as a company hiring only Jews or Koreans.  </P> <P> The problem with many of today's premier African-American stars is not that  they haven't led the way to "black collective economic power," as Jim Brown  would have us believe, but that they have been abusing their power and  squandering their talent in the last few years by producing what is largely  uninspiring, unfunny drivel. I am thinking primarily of Murphy ("The Golden  Child," "Raw," "Another 48 HRS."); Pryor ("The Toy," "See No Evil"), and Cosby  ("Leonard Part 6," "Ghost Dad").  </P> <P> And Michael Jackson is not nearly as well-known these days for his artistry as  for his success in selling his face and his songs to the highest corporate  bidder.  </P> <P> HARVEY COHEN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

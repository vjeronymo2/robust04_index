			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Period of strong growth enhanced by Quantum leap - Hanson Hanson's full year figures on Thursday are expected to show a modest increase in pre-tax profits to around Pounds 1bn, before disposal gains of more than Pounds 300m. Underlying earnings per share are forecast to show little change at 14p. Strong growth at the operating level will have continued in the fourth quarter with trading profits rising by almost a third in the year. But the impact will have been largely offset by a Pounds 250m swing in the interest bill. This stems from the increase in US debt following the Pounds 2.1bn acquisition of Quantum Chemical at the start of the year combined with lower income on Hanson's sterling deposits. The figures should confirm that the Quantum deal was very well timed. Quantum made little more than Pounds 35m before interest and tax in the year to September 1993. But ethylene and polyethylene prices have since risen strongly, and analysts believe Quantum could have made almost Pounds 180m last year. After interest its contribution will have been around Pounds 100m. Profits from Hanson's other cyclical business, particularly construction related, have also picked up strongly and US coal profits have recovered following the long and expensive strike at Peabody. Hanson's other chemicals business, SCM, has been slower to turn and is expected to report lower profits. But its prices have also hardened and it should move ahead again this year. Thanks to disposals, such as the flotation of Beazer's housing operations, debt will have been reduced from Pounds 3.4bn to about Pounds 2.5bn over the year cutting gearing from 86 per cent to around 55 per cent. Hanson has already signalled that it will pay a fourth quarterly dividend of 3p, making a total for the year to 11.7p, a rise of 2.6 per cent.</p>

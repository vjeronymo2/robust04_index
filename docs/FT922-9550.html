			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (4): Maturity may point to gilts - Investment strategy THERE WAS a phenomenal change in the investment strategy of UK pension funds during the 1980s. Back in 1982, Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps) found that the average pension fund had 19 per cent of its portfolio in UK fixed-interest securities and 10 per cent in property; by the end of 1991, those proportions had dropped to 3 and 2 per cent respectively. The cult of the equity appears to have triumphed, with combined UK and overseas equity holdings rising from 65 per cent in 1982 to 83 per cent at the end of 1991. But could those statistics be about to change? Many might argue that the prospects of a low-inflation low-growth decade in the 1990s means that bonds will offer attractive returns. A shift may be inevitable. The Conservative government's efforts to reduce the budget deficit in the 1980s (which succeeded in creating a budget surplus in the latter part of the decade) meant that the supply of gilt issues dried up. There were few gilts for pension funds to buy. Now that the budget deficit is back and the government is issuing around Pounds 2bn of gilts a month - a figure which may increase in future financial years - UK pension funds will have plenty of gilts to choose from. There is a further point. Pension funds need to match their assets to their liabilities. If a large proportion of members of the fund are receiving pensions, then the fund is described in industry jargon as 'mature'. Mature funds need to place a greater emphasis on income than capital growth, and therefore tend to invest a greater proportion of their funds in gilts. According to John Clamp, of Caps, UK pension funds are more mature than they were in 1982, so one would logically expect a greater proportion of gilts in pension funds. Part of the reason for the low proportions of gilt investment may be the memories of the 1970s, when inflation, and a soaring budget deficit, savaged the returns for those managers who invested in gilts. But for those who bought fixed-interest securities in the 1980s, the returns were pretty respectable. Caps figures show that the cumulative annual return on gilts over the 10 years to the end of 1991 was 14.7 per cent. That was behind the return available from UK equities (19.6 per cent) and overseas shares (16.9 per cent), but was well ahead of both retail price and average earnings growth. Some would argue that, in the 1990s, there will be lower nominal returns across all the investment categories, and that the gap between bond and equities will be much smaller than in the recent past. Whether pension funds will re-discover their enthusiasm for property is a more thorny question. The well-publicised problems of many property companies, plus the apparent over-supply of office space in the City, might discourage many funds from increasing their exposure to this area. (Some, of course, will see this as the low point of the cycle and therefore the time to buy). But property has recorded only an average annual return of 9 per cent over the 10 years to end 1991; well behind the 11.9 per cent earned on sterling cash. If there is going to be a shift away from equity investment in the 1990s, there was no sign of it in 1991. Caps found that new money invested by pension funds last year was largely placed in the UK and overseas equities sectors. Cash levels fell substantially from the figures at the start of 1991. Overall, Caps figures show that the average fund at the end of 1991 was invested in the following proportions (all per cent): UK equities (58.6); Europe (9.4); US (5.9); overseas bonds (5.5); sterling cash (4.3); UK fixed interest (3.2); Japan (5.3); property (1.9); Pacific (ex Japan) (2.8); index-linked gilts (1.9); other overseas (0.7); other assets (0.5). The 1990s could see a shift in the balance of the equity element of the average pension fund portfolio. As the UK gradually becomes used to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, the currency risk in holding continental assets will gradually diminish. If a single currency were instituted then, of course, currency risk would vanish altogether. At least in foreign exchange terms, there would be no reason to differentiate between UK and European assets. A pension fund which kept all its equity assets in the UK would be akin to a Norwich-based fund confining its investments to Norfolk. There may be practical difficulties, however. Many continental markets are less liquid than in the UK. And by comparison with Britain, publicly quoted companies play a relatively small part in other big European economies. So there may be good technical reasons for funds to retain a UK bias. It is also possible to gain some measure of exposure to European economies by investing in one of the UK companies with continental subsidiaries. However, the scope for doing so is limited by the fact that the US has traditionally been the main area for overseas investment by UK companies, partly for cultural reasons and partly because the US has been far more open to acquisitions than Europe. While complete integration of UK and European assets may not occur, it seems likely that pension funds will own may more European equities by the end of the decade. Given that the proportion of UK equities in the average portfolio is currently six times bigger than that in European shares, there is plenty of scope for a shift.</p>

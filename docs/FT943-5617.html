			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities futures and options trading Concern over inflation continued to dominate the derivatives sector leading to a sharp decline in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 3,262, early buying attributed to SG Warburg pushed the September contract on the FT-SE 100 to a high of 3,265 within the first hour of trading. But with little follow-through buying, the contract drifted lower on continued worries on inflation. The decision by the Bundesbank to leave interest rates unchanged also caused some concern. In the afternoon it was the US purchasing managers' figures that once again raised fears on inflation bringing a further retreat in the September contract which fell to the day's low of 3,244, to test the 3,240 support level. Bargain-hunting in the last hour brought some recovery in the September contract. It closed at 3,221, down 42 on its previous close, and at parity with its fair value premium to cash of about 5 points. Volume was 15,056 lots. Rolls-Royce, which reported interim figures at the bottom of expectations was the outstanding feature in the traded options sector as it traded 5,420 contracts. It was followed by Vodafone Group, among the stock options. Total volume in the sector was 34,233 lots with the FT-SE 100 option trading 15,014 lots and 4,375 in the Euro FT-SE option.</p>

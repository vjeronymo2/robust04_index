			<p>BFN     [Text] On 2 June, GRANMA published an article by reporter  Luis Vaies Delgado entitled Public Letter to a President, in  which he responds to William Clinton's message of 20 May,  supposedly for the people of Cuba.    If we have gotten to where we are now and we are still here,  it is because we have learned never to make the slightest  compromise regarding sovereignty and independence. Vaies points  out that 20 May 1902 is not Cuban Independence Day; it is the  day that the crime of seizing the independence that the Cuban  people had fought for for over a third of a century  pseudojudicially took place. He adds further on in the article:  We arrived at 20 May 1902 through the cunning and greed of a  nation that coveted Cuba for a century. After analyzing a number  of historic events that prove this, Luis Vais responds, clearly  and precisely, to several of the U.S. President's statements  regarding our people and his government. In this manner, the  deceit in those statements is exposed.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / 20,000 staff vote for pay cut to save jobs: Sheffield council agreement will save Pounds 6m on wage bill NEARLY 20,000 Sheffield council workers have voted to take a 3.25 per cent pay cut in exchange for shorter working hours to stop the city council making 1,400 of them redundant to balance next year's budget. The deal, which leaders at the Labour-run council believe is the first of its kind in Britain, will boost government hopes that the fight to keep inflation low is beginning to yield dividends in public sector pay where it is endeavouring to confine rises to a maximum of 1.5 per cent. Yesterday's landmark agreement will also help the council get its budget below a Pounds 366m ceiling imposed by the government. Local authorities all over Britain are facing up to 90,000 job losses as the government tries to peg public spending. In exchange for the pay cut, the employees will be able to work one hour less a week or take seven extra days' holiday. The move will take nearly Pounds 6m off Sheffield's wages bill. The council should be able to agree a legal budget next week if it can now make Pounds 1.3m savings in the works department and another Pounds 1.5m on education. About 2,000 works staff refused the deal, while 4,000 teachers could not be balloted because they are employed by school governors and their pay levels are decided by the government. The council said it would be discussing with teachers ways in which they could improve productivity and so make the required savings. It was suggested that one area it might look into could be the use made of training days. All town hall unions at Sheffield have held ballots, but works department shop stewards substituted their own ballot question and campaigned against the deal. Talks have started again with the shop stewards. The council's chief officers have not yet balloted, and neither have about 200 youth and print workers. The deal will be imposed on all sections that voted for it, including non-union staff who did not take part in the ballot. 'The cut will be treated the same way as a pay rise would - it will apply to everyone,' the council said. The only exceptions will be low-paid workers earning less than Pounds 90 a week, which means part-timers. Mr Mike Bower, leader of the Labour-controlled council, said: 'Employees have shown a remarkable degree of commitment both to their colleagues and the community. Nobody is happy we have been put in this situation but the alternative - a destructive cut in services and hundreds of sackings - would have been much worse.' The deal also makes 1993-94 annual pay increases conditional on finding the money to meet them from productivity improvements.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Job cuts claim at Swans rejected Receivers at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, last night rejected a statement from union officials that a further 490 jobs at the yard would be shed in May. The possibility of the job losses had been discussed earlier this week at a meeting of full-time union officials and staff of Price Waterhouse, the receivers. Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said: 'Nobody is denying there is the risk of these job losses, which is why they formed the basis of the discussion with the unions but by no means is it definite.' The receivers will seek meetings with union officials today to clarify the situation. The reason for the potential cut of 380 blue-collar jobs and 110 staff posts is the handing over on May 12 of HMS Northumberland, one of three Type 23 frigates that Swan Hunter was fitting out when it went into receivership in May. This leaves only one frigate in the yard, providing too little work for the workforce of 1,038 - down from 2,500 when the receiver was called in. Yesterday Swan Hunter submitted to the Ministry of Defence its tender for the 18-month refit of the Sir Bedivere landing ship, a contract crucial to the yard's survival. But even if it wins this work, for which it faces competition from four other UK yards, it faces a gap of some months in which it has much too little work to sustain the present workforce. The receivers have described the remaining employees as the 'golden nugget' which underpinned the yard's saleability as a going concern. A near-halving of this number would raise questions about Swan Hunter's potential to survive as a large shipbuilder. Mr Horsfield said job sharing, layoffs, subcontracting and the possibility of finding other work were among the avenues being explored in the hope of averting the 490 losses. Negotiations between French-owned Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie and the receivers, which began in London on Wednesday, continued yesterday. CMN had hoped to make a firm bid for Swan Hunter, conditional on the company winning the Sir Bedivere order, before the tender for the refit was submitted yesterday. But last night, Price Waterhouse said there were 'loose ends' still to be sorted out and it was likely to take two to three weeks to reach any contractual commitment with CMN.</p>

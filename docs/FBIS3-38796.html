			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The various moves and activities of New  Democracy (ND) leader Miltiadhis Evert are the subject of  commentary in the Greek press.  <H5>  On Minorities </H5>   According to the 19 January Athens daily TA NEA, Evert  recently traveled to Thraki and visited various cities and  institutions. One of them was a minority elementary school,  where conditions were "not good." He then visited a "typical"  elementary school in the same area. He found conditions in the  second school "very satisfactory." As a result, he stated to  the Christian teachers that "it is our duty to build as good a  school for the Muslims, too."  <H5>  Agreement With Stefanopoulos </H5>   The 9 January Athens Sunday newspaper O TIPOS TIS KIRIAKIS  reports that a rapprochement between Evert and Democratic  Renewal (DhIANA) leader Kostis Stefanopoulos is expected soon to  enable the latter to be included in the ND's European elections  list. "If everything goes well," Stefanopoulos will probably  head the list. In another development, EC Commissioner Ioannis  Palaiokrassas will not be a candidate, for he has concluded that  he would be more useful by staying in Brussels for all of 1994,  the paper reports. New Commission members will be appointed on 1  January 1995.  <H5>  Hardline Vs. Low-Key Policy </H5>   The 9 January TIPOS TIS KIRIAKIS comments that the ND  leadership is faced with a dilemma. Privately conducted polls  show that 55 percent of ND sympathizers want a more hardline  opposition, while 90 percent of center-right voters and those  wavering between parties wish for a "gentler and dignified"  opposition. Evert is attempting to conciliate the two views  without disappointing either side, the newspaper notes. It adds,  however, that the new year is ushering in a period in which the  ND, besides reorganizing its own structures, will "intensify"  its monitoring and criticism of government action "on all  fronts" to gain the initiative in political developments.    The 11 January TA NEA quotes Evert as stating on 1O January  at a meeting of ND trade unionists that "if you elected me your  leader just to overthrow PASOK tomorrow, you made a mistake.  PASOK is following its course. My goal is to finally create in  this country a modern political discourse that will make us more  mature and ready to succeed when we come to power."</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Delian Lloyd's trust aims to raise Pounds 50m DELIAN LLOYD'S Investment Trust yesterday became the seventh new Lloyd's investment company to publish a pathfinder prospectus. Delian is seeking a full listing through a placing by Hill Samuel, writes Richard Lapper. Delian aims to raise Pounds 50m, allowing it to provide up to Pounds 100m in capacity to between 40 and 50 syndicates. RF Kershaw, the independent members' agent, will act as a licensed Lloyd's adviser, while the investment portfolio will be managed by Foreign &amp; Colonial Management. 'We have deliberately chosen a Lloyd's adviser which is independent of the agents who manage syndicates, in order to avoid conflicts of interest that are otherwise inevitable,' said Lord Stewartby, chairman. Earlier this week SG Warburg and Samuel Montagu also published pathfinder prospectuses for new trusts. The London Insurance Market Investment Trust, the biggest trust announced to date, is seeking to raise Pounds 280m. Applications for shares in Limit will be for a minimum of 1,000 shares at an offer price of 100p per share.</p>

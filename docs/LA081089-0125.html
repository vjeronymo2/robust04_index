			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> CAMP GOES WAY OF LEATHER HELMET  </P> <P> The rite of training camp and, more important, training camp stories, will soon  be nothing more than clip-file memories of football's lost generation.  </P> <P> The Rams are spending only 13 days in the dormitories of Cal State Fullerton  this year, marking the dawn of an era, in which the concept of communal living  becomes as extinct as the drop-kick.  </P> <P> Most NFL teams have been clinging to the tradition for tradition's sake. "This  is all kind of ritualistic," Coach John Robinson said. "It's like, 'We'll all  go away for the weekend and we'll all get a lot closer.' Does a team become  closer having gone through training camp?"  </P> <P> For the most part, training camp and its tedium of two-a-day practices has  become anachronistic. There was a time, in the days when players enjoyed true  off-seasons, that six weeks of intensive training were needed to bring a team  together. But today's players work year-round. The Rams, for instance, extended  mini-camp through the month of May.  </P> <P> The decision of the league's owners last spring to limit rosters to 80 players  a team was but another dagger through the heart of training camp. Teams that  once invited 100 or more players to camp now risk injuries to starters if they  choose to practice twice daily.  </P> <P> "I think there's a point of diminishing returns," Robinson said. "We're out  there twice, but we don't have any collisions at our practices. We don't go  100%.  </P> <P> "Thirty of the 80 (players) you coach, you're going to fire. Some of these  teams that have 150, you really put in a lot of time on people who are not  going to make it."  </P> <P> The Rams have signed a contract with UC Irvine to use its facilities next  summer while construction begins on a new sports complex at the Fullerton  campus.  </P> <P> It's not inconceivable that in two years, training camp will be held at Rams  Park in Anaheim on a regular work schedule.  </P> <P> But what of the companionship lost with the abolishment of camp? The bonding of  men? Perhaps the lack of training camp will only cut into valuable book  material.  </P> <P> "Back when I was with the Raiders, for some of those guys training camp started  at 9 p.m. and went till 4," Robinson said.  </P> <P> Football of the future promises that players will be home for dinner every  night, like it or not.  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Gaston Green, Buford McGee and Jerry Gray missed practice Wednesday to attend a  memorial service for Stacey Toran, the Raider safety who was killed in an  automobile accident Saturday night. . . . Coach John Robinson said he was  hoping holdout tight end Damone Johnson would show up in the next few days,  although he might have been speaking more from his heart than his head. Richard  Ashe has a leg injury, so the team has practiced this week with one healthy  tight end, free agent Gary Knudson.  </P></p>

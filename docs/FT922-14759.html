			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: All my worldly gifts I DRAW my state pension plus an allowance for my wife, who is not yet 60, and not working. When the taxation of married women was altered some years ago, I assumed that the allowance I got for her would be allowable against her tax allowance, and suggested this to the Inland Revenue, which altered my tax code but did not comment. I have been claiming this off her tax allowance for three years, but only after reminding the IR of it each year. With my 1992-93 tax code I received a booklet on tax; it says that any allowance paid to the husband for his wife is taxable to the husband. Is this correct in my case? My tax office is far from here, so I cannot discuss the matter with them. If a mistake was made, could I be advised to accept things as they are, in case the IR demand repayment for past years? The allowance in respect of your dependent wife is payable to you (not to your wife), and is consequently your own income (not hers). There is nothing in the tax legislation that deems this part of your income to be your wife's, so we are puzzled why you thought that it should be reported as part of your wife's income. It looks as though you have misled the tax office as to whose income it was (and is), so you may have made yourself liable to penalties, as well as interest payable. On the bare facts outlined, we recommend that you report the correct facts to your tax office at once, before it finds out for itself and contacts you for an explanation. If, however, you consider that your tax office has at all times been in possession of the full facts, and you wish to dispute its right to reopen past years, you should write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB, and ask for a copy of SP8/9l (Discovery assessments). That statement of practice (SP) does not cover cases where there may have been negligence by the taxpayer, so you have to decide whether you think that they could reasonably regard your correspondence as having been based upon negligence in not checking the tax rules first. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

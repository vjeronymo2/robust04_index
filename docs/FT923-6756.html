			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pressure on dollar and sterling DEALERS IN the City of London said the dollar and sterling were on the verge of a crisis yesterday, as the D-Mark pushed both currencies towards important new lows, writes James Blitz. The dollar almost touched its all-time low of DM1.4430 in late US trading, as dealers wondered when the Federal Reserve might intervene to support the currency. The Fed may have waited to see what effect President Bush's speech at the Republican convention would have on the currency markets. But there is not much room for the Fed to manoeuvre in: the dollar risks going into a free-fall if it breaches the historic low. Dollar/D-Mark trading was not affected by economic indicators yesterday. The slight dip in July's M3 monetary growth in Germany, from an annualised 8.7 per cent to 8.6 per cent, was interpreted as positive by some analysts, since it does not yet reflect the recent 0.75 of a percentage point rise in the Bundesbank's discount rate. But the figure is clearly outside the Bank's target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent of annual M3 growth, keeping a firm bottom to the Lombard rate. Instead, the US currency fell victim to a creeping sentiment in favour of the D-Mark that was felt across the major crosses. The dollar ended at DM1.4485 in Europe and sterling at DM2.8075, the latter's lowest finish since Britain joined the ERM in October 1990. Both were about 1/2 pfennig below Wednesday's close. The lira weakened to L761.0 per D-Mark from L759.6. In New York the dollar finished at DM1.4475. If central banks were refraining from intervention yesterday, it was because they have to wait for the dollar to fall to a point at which the operation will work. Trading in both the dollar and sterling remained thin yesterday and the markets are still not short of either currency - both key requirements if the market is to turn. However, Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, said sterling 'could be in the throes of a crisis that is more fundamental than the dollar's'. In his view, the pound's problem is that it is being buffeted by external factors, namely the weakness of the dollar and of the UK economy. He believes it is increasingly difficult for the UK government to support the currency at these levels. The pound's intrinsic weakness was underlined when it crossed 75 percentage points of divergence against its central Ecu rate. When the ERM was formed in 1979, there was a presumption that when a currency crossed this point its central bank should support it either through intervention or raising interest rates. The rule has not been adhered to since 1985, but dealers see it as a turning point for a currency.</p>

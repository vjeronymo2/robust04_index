			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Protests scupper Bolivian mine investment strategy - Chris Philipsborn on what may prove to be a Pyrrhic victory for the country's militant miners THE PLIGHT of the British coal miners now facing redundancy is a sadly familiar one to the Bolivian mining industry. Seven years ago Comibol, the state mining corporation, had to lay off more than 28,000 tin miners following the market crash caused by the collapse of the International Tin Council's buffer stock operation. This in a country with just 6.3m inhabitants. 'For us, the free market fails to offer three fundamental things,' says Mr Victor Lopez, executive secretary of the Federation of Bolivian Mine Workers (FSTMB), the largest and most influential mining union in the country. 'It pays no attention to the plight of the poor; there is no interest in long term planning; and no attention is paid to the national interests.' Bolivian miners' spirits are now high, however, following a notable victory over their government. Mining unions recently voted to occupy Comibol's mines in protest at the drive to open up the corporation to joint venture and leasing contracts with private companies. Mr Lopez reminded politicians that his members had confronted both the military and the police in the past and assured them that his members - 7,000 in the public sector and 5,000 in the private sector - were prepared to do so again, even if loss of life resulted. The message struck home. In a dramatic climbdown, the Bolivian government has now suspended all joint venture contracts. By caving in so comprehensively it has effectively halted the joint venture process, soured any interest foreign investors might have had in the public sector and could well have waved goodbye to a Dollars 35m mining development credit from the World Bank. Since the concept of joint ventures first saw the light of day last year, only two have been signed, though leasing deals are fairly common. The two joint ventures involved operations at the Tasna and Catavi mining centres. The private companies concerned, Cominesa, a subsidiary of Specialty Metals of the US and Mineracao Taboca, a subsidiary of Brazil's Parapanema, were, however, unable to start up operations because of industrial action backed by Mr Lopez's union. On the face of it, however, Mr Lopez would seem to be indulging in an ego trip which may ultimately prove devastating to his members. The Tasna mine for instance is currently closed and supports a skeleton staff of just 21 workers. Cominesa has repeatedly said it wanted to invest Dollars 4m in the mine and employ some 300 miners. Tasna, though, was an important symbol for the unions. As Mr Fernando Urquidi, a long time observer of the Bolivian mining scene explains: 'If the mining unions had allowed the government to retake Tasna, they would have lost the fight against joint ventures'. Yet Mr Lopez and his union executive must realise that Bolivia, with legal export earnings of just Dollars 800m and a looming trade deficit, is not in a position to invest even in productive mines. Comibol itself will probably make a loss of more than Dollars 10m this year. The corporation's total losses between 1981 and 1991 were in the region of Dollars 662m. The corporation has a new president, Marcelo Perez. Mr Perez has the right free market credentials but no mining experience. He is poorly regarded by unions, and performs his greatest exertions when attempting to avoid questions from the press. Mr Perez's assertion that despite the government's decision, Comibol '. . . remains firmly wedded to the belief that joint ventures are the only way to reactivate mining centres', has a hollow ring to it. According to industry officials, it is fairly certain that joint venture contracts will now be shelved, at least until the general election next year. To be fair it must be said that the very concept of joint ventures negates the last 40 years of Bolivian history. As Comibol general manager Mr Jose Zambrana explains: 'The miners have had great influence because they were the ones who took up arms during the 1952 revolution. They were in on the birth of Comibol, which for the past 40 years has been run by the state. The workers have had the right of veto in decisions and participated in management. It is not easy for them to renounce these privileges'. The government never really backed the joint venture process sufficiently. Inevitable conflict was put off for so long that it seemed far easier to give in altogether, rather than initiate a potentially bloody confrontation just eight months away from the polls. Meanwhile, mines like Tasna which in the hands of the private sector could be providing much needed employment and export earnings, remain idle indefinitely.</p>

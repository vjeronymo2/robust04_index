			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Eduardo Frei outside La Moneda Palace </F> in Santiago -- live]    [Text] Chileans: I want to start this brief speech by  voicing my gratitude to all of those who have given me your  support and affection, which I want and hope to return with my  great dedication to the hopes of all our fellow countrymen, and  especially the most modest, the have-nots. [applause]    Our government will take into account the dreams and  ambitions of Chilean men, women, and children. I also want to  greet those students who passed their university entry exams  with flying colors, who are with us now as special guests.  [applause]    We are aware of our responsibilities and the difficulties of  the task we are undertaking today. But, as I have repeatedly  stated during the recent presidential campaign, I firmly believe  this generation can wipe out extreme poverty from our country;  that we can renew and expand our infrastructure; that we will  substantially increase the GDP and our exports, change the  structure of our education system, grow in a sustained manner,  improve the peoples' living standards, and solve the peoples'  concrete problems.    After these four years of socioeconomic growth and  restoration of democracy we have an excellent opportunity, which  we will not miss. This is an equal opportunity for all Chileans.  This afternoon I also want to greet President Patricio Aylwin,  who has bequeathed us a great legacy from his years in  government. [applause]    The new times have started. It is not just a plan; it is a  new phase in Chilean development. We must reorganize government  in face of all the changes we are currently witnessing; we need  to implement changes in the distribution of political power at  the district, regional, and national level; we must bring about  changes in the relationship between the public and private  sectors, and changes in the role we play in the international  arena. In sum, this is the beginning of a new historical phase,  which we know, now that it is starting, will conclude when each  and every Chilean decides to make an effort for the well-being  of all Chileans. [applause]    Tomorrow afternoon, here in Constitution Square, I will  announce the style of my government.    The La Moneda Palace building, where I arrived today in my  capacity as president of the Chilean people, is witness to the  history of our institutions, the strength of their servants, and  the righteousness of our politicians.    From this site I humbly ask God to keep us on this path of  service and effort.    With faith in Chile, in its people, and its future, deeply  moved and thankful, I greet you all.    The men who governed Chile from here with effort,  dedication,  and love for the fatherland are responsible for the Chile we  have today. We will continue to work with national awareness.  With your support and that of all Chileans, we are going to  bring politics and the people and their daily problems together.  We are going to work hard every day to be with you, to solve  the daily problems of millions of Chileans, and we are going to  do this observing the high moral and ethical political standards  that are necessary for the times we are experiencing. [applause]    I urge the Chilean people and, through you, the millions and  millions of Chileans that have given us their support, to help  me, to help carry out this beautiful task of building a unified  country. I urge them to accompany me in this beautiful task,  because the task of building and dreaming of the future, the  task of building and dreaming of a developed and unified country  at the threshold of the 21st century, is a task that concerns  all Chileans. I am going to head this task, and with your  support we will be successful; we are going to enter the 21st  century as a unified, progressive country in which each and  every Chilean feels part of a human country, feels that he has  an opportunity. Let us walk with confidence and optimism, with  faith in Chile's future. Let us go ahead. Long live Chile.  [applause]</p>

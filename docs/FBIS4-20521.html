			<p>for     1994   <F P=102> BR2402114194 Bonn TECHNOLOGIE-NACHRICHTEN  MANAGEMENT-INFORMATIONEN in German 27 Dec 93 pp 2-3 </F>  <F P=103> BR2402114194 </F> <F P=104>  Bonn TECHNOLOGIE-NACHRICHTEN  MANAGEMENT-INFORMATIONEN </F>  <F P=105>  German </F> BFN     [Text] The SPD [German Social Democratic Party]  parliamentary group presented its research and technology plan  for the 1994 government program to the public on 10 December.  Its research spokesman Josef Vosen described the three most  important political measures of the coming years as follows:    -- The government and industry must provide more funds again  for research and technology;    -- All the legal and administrative obstacles in the Federal  Republic of Germany must be removed in order to facilitate  innovation, and    -- A broad, consensus-oriented dialog among industry,  scientific organizations, unions and government must be promoted  concerning the future trend of technological developments and  the specific measures to be taken.    "We must also put research and technology to the service of  ecological renewal," emphasized Vosen. The SPD intends to  target the following areas:  <H5>  Ecological Renewal </H5>   This should extend to research for new environment  technologies, energy saving and renewable energies, for reactor  safety, and the safe handling of radioactive wastes. Research  into improving the safety of nuclear technology must be  safeguarded and continued.    The main objective must be to achieve a general reduction in  emissions and a kind of recycle economy. Ecological renewal  will also strengthen competitiveness considerably and act as a  precautionary measure.  <H5>  Improving Competitiveness </H5>   The SPD intends to improve the competitiveness of German  industry and of medium-sized firms in particular, by targeting  funds on key technologies of the 21st century, such as  information and communications technology, production  engineering and manufacturing, transportation (water, ground,  air, space), biotechnology and genetic engineering, materials  research including superconductors, and laser technology.    They expect a major commitment from industry in this  respect.  <H5>  New Methods </H5>   A dialog on technology policy should be developed, in which  important representatives from industry, scientific  organizations, unions, and other social groups make proposals to  parliament as to the common steps that must lead to the future.    Technology transfer from basic research to the application  stage will be improved by new methods.    Moreover, tax procedures related to research promotion will  be introduced.    The research capacities in the new German laender will  rapidly be brought in line with those which are customary in the  old laender.    A structure committee will be engaged to prepare a report on  the current tasks, organization, and funding of major research  establishments.  <H5>  Strengthening Preventive Measures </H5>   The SPD intends to resume research into ways of making  working life more humane. The opportunities opened up by  biotechnology and genetic engineering for new drugs and  high-yield useful plants will be utilized by increased funding.  The risks of biotechnology and genetic engineering will be  monitored carefully.    In the field of preventive health, the SPD intends to try to  reduce the risks presented by Aids, rheumatism, cancer, and  heart and circulatory diseases by taking new research  initiatives.  <H5>  Safeguarding the Advance of Knowledge </H5>   The scope and funds for basic research will be safeguarded,  and the evaluation of the consequences of technology will be  extended.  <H5>  Filling in the Funding Gaps </H5>   The SPD intends to make good the substantial deficit in the  research budget that has been incurred in recent years by  providing DM1 billion for all these measures. It also aims to  provide better funding in the Fourth European Framework Program  for Research and Technological Development.

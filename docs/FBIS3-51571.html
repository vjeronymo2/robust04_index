This morning, there was violence in the small city of  Ocumare  del Tuy, 70 km to the south, and Villa de Cura, 100 km to the  west. Last night there were riots in the streets of Caracas.  There also were riots in the industrial city of Valencia, which  is 80 km to the west of Caracas; in the twin cities of Barcelona  and Puerto La Cruz, 220 km to the east; and in Punto Fijo, 368  km to the northwest. Vehicles were set on fire in these cities,  and there was looting in some cities in the interior. In  Barcelona, an 85-year-old woman was shot dead, six people were  injured, three stores were looted, and one grocery distribution  truck was robbed.    Calm was restored in Barcelona and Maturin on Thursday, but  the regional authorities ordered that both cities be placed  under military control. Army troops and militarized national  guardsmen were posted in the streets. In Punto Fijo, some 20  stores were looted, other shops were attacked with stones, and  there was general panic.    The disturbances began last week over a hike in  transportation rates and a sales tax that was suspended, which  ultimately led to speculation that prices would rise by as much  as 300 percent. The riots first started in Barcelona and Puerto  la Cruz, and from there they spread on Tuesday to Cumana and  Maturin.</p>

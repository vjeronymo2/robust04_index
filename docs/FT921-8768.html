			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES year-end flurry THE BUSINESS Expansion Scheme is diversifying again. The end of the tax year has produced a flurry of issues and some show a return to the scheme's original philosophy of encouraging 'risk capital' for small companies. Meanwhile, another established City firm is expected to enter the market for low-risk covenanted 'buy-back' BES companies next week. But Steven Rowe, chief executive of BES Monitoring, has doused some of the optimism. He said: 'Many assured tenancy issues will turn out well - but there has already been one 'guaranteed' issue, sponsored by Raphael Zorn Hemsley, where the 'guarantor', Fairbriar, has since entered administrative receivership - and one does not have to go back too far in the BES's history to find 'secured' contracting schemes - which were anything but secure. You might still consider the following new issues: Airways Assured Growth has a buy-back agreement to pay Pounds 1.40 back in five years' time for every Pounds 1 spent now. It will build accommodation for the British Airways Housing Association in Berkshire, and is backed by a deposit. The Black Sheep Brewery, sponsored by Wise Speke, will invest in a brewery in Masham, north Yorkshire, which will make 'traditional' draught ales. Ridings Assured Growth, sponsored by Capital for Companies, is raising Pounds 10m to buy properties from Tay and Persimmon - buy-back covenantof Pounds 1.38 for every Pounds 1. The Mercedes-Benz Dealer Fund, sponsored by Capital Ventures, is a rarity these days - a series of trading companies which will invest in Mercedes-Benz dealerships. WISH (Worthy Investment In Social Housing) is raising Pounds 10m for the South London Family and South Wight housing associations - covenant Pounds 1.35.</p>

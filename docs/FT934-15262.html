			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Australian budget block ends THE Australian government finally got a break over its stalled budget proposals, when one of the two minority parties, which hold the balance of power in the Senate, said it would not support an Opposition plan to block all sales and fuel tax rises unless the government withdrew its threat to delay tax cuts. The promised cuts are due to take effect next month. Ms Cheryl Kernot, Australian Democrats' leader, said the Opposition plan, outlined to the minority parties by the Opposition's Treasury spokesman, Mr Alexander Downer, did not consider the possible effects on the economy. 'The suggestions contained in Mr Downer's letter are cute, but flawed and irresponsible,' Ms Kernot said. The Democrats believed the government had the right to get the core of its budget passed. Two elements in the budget package were voted down by the Senate last week: the proposed increased wine tax, where the Democrats joined forces with the Opposition to block the measure, and a second round of sales tax rises, due to come into effect in 1995, where the vital vote was cast by Mr Brian Harradine, an independent senator. The government has threatened to delay implementing proposed income tax cuts, which have been approved, unless all its revenue-raising measures are passed. Yesterday, the Australian dollar jumped more than a third of a US cent, breaking through US cents 66, after the Democrats' decision.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH METHODS;  </P> <P> HE STARS AS PROTECTOR OF CELEBRITIES  </P> <P> In December, 1942, 27-year-old Frank Sinatra stood on stage at New York's  Paramount Theater, embraced his microphone, fixed his blue eyes on the  bobby-soxers in the front row and crooned, sending his audience of teen-age  girls into a shrieking, hair-tearing swoon.  </P> <P> That was the birth of a superstar.  </P> <P> And as Gavin de Becker sees it, it was the advent of the age of celebrities as  targets. Targets of lovesick men and women. Targets of fans with benign, mildly  amusing delusions. Targets of crazed people intent on stalking and killing  stars.  </P> <P> At 34, de Becker is himself a star in the field of celebrity protection, relied  on by many of Hollywood's biggest names and other high-visibility figures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Redford Among Clients  </P> <P> His clients past and present include Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Cher,  Robert Redford, Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda, Joan Rivers, Victoria Principal,  Brooke Shields, Olivia Newton-John, Tina Turner and John Travolta.  </P> <P> But de Becker is not a bodyguard, nor does he simply provide that service. He  does not wish to be even remotely identified with that trade, which he  dismisses as work for rent-a-hulks and overweight, one-time rock 'n' roll  roadies.  </P> <P> Instead, de Becker and his staff of 31 offer a unique refinement in the  celebrity security business, using state-of-the-art computers and psychological  profiling to help protect clients, some of whom pay as much as $475,000 a year  for the peace of mind.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Glimpse Into Minds  </P> <P> His special approach also has allowed de Becker to obtain a rare glimpse into  the troubled minds of the sometimes harmless but often twisted individuals who  focus attention on themselves by sending "inappropriate" messages to his  celebrity clients.  </P> <P> Along with the Secret Service and the Capitol Police, who guard members of  Congress, Gavin de Becker Inc. of Los Angeles has the "best-kept centralized  files of threatening communications in the country," said Dr. Park Dietz of  Newport Beach, prosecution psychiatrist at the trial of John Hinckley,  President Reagan's would-be assassin.  </P> <P> De Becker's business "is a counterpart of what we do in the FBI," to protect  government figures, said agent Robert Ressler of the Behavioral Sciences Unit  of the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va. "Unfortunately, we do not live in safe  times. His type of business really fills a void. The government cannot protect  everyone."  </P> <P> And former Los Angeles County Sheriff Peter Pitchess said: "Gavin is one of the  best. . . . He has been very, very helpful to us (and) I have recommended him  to many people."  </P> <P> De Becker will discuss cases but won't name names; a partial list of his  100-plus clients, most of whom live in California but some of whom are in New  York, Washington and Nashville, the country music capital, was gleaned from  other sources.  </P> <P> "Sinatra and Sylvester Stallone are not clients," he said, adding that almost  every other top Hollywood star is.  </P> <P> To many, celebrities are magnets, and the crazed, some of whom have come to  California from as far away as Saudi Arabia believing that they have been  directed by a deity, have been undeterred by barbed wire or attack dogs. Some  have taken telephone company jobs to gain access to unlisted numbers. They see  special signs and signals for themselves in such everyday objects as license  plates.  </P> <P> They have mailed de Becker's clients a dead coyote, dead fish, blood, hair,  teeth, human and animal fecal matter and bullets.  </P> <P> Typically, though, they begin acting out fixations -- some directed at  Hollywood stars, others aimed at well-known corporate CEOs -- by writing  astonishing letters, in which they display obsessive love, hate or other  threatening desires.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Targeted an Executive  </P> <P> There was a consumer, for example, who targeted a corporate executive,  convinced that the company's toothpaste had caused his voice to change. There  was a woman who turned to a toll-free 800 number to seek revenge at the  corporate board level, blaming a cake mix as culprit: She had put her cake in  the oven and her child's hair fell out.  </P> <P> De Becker's printouts show that his firm has profiled 5,400 people, all but  about 1,000 of them in still-active cases; the firm in its research has  compiled 200,000 pieces of communication, a library of sorts that experts such  as Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist and professor-on-leave of law and psychiatry  at University of Virginia, have begun to study.  </P> <P> The threats are sorted by de Becker into three categories: R-1s are fans whose  craziness poses no danger to a celebrity, for example, the man who insisted  that a star inform a network television audience of his kidnaping by Martians;  R-2s are individuals considered a serious threat and who require monitoring;  R-3s, roughly 40% of de Becker's current cases, are individuals who have  threatened and are seeking an encounter with a celebrity.  </P> <P> Last year, 25% of the R-3s actually showed up, though the number of celebrity  attacks that succeed are "quite low," de Becker said. "But the incidence of  near-attacks and severe safety hazards is much higher" than ever, he added,  noting that at any given time, a major media figure "might have 50 or 60  (threats) that are very bad. It's just astounding."  </P> <P> And though the media widely publicize incidents involving threats and attacks  against celebrities, corporate VIPs and other high-visibility people,  psychiatrist Dietz noted that "the press never learns about the vast majority"  of threats against the prominent.  </P> <P> For example, a recently reported blitz of threatening letters to actor Michael  J. Fox (a de Becker client) by a female fan upset by the actor's recent  marriage was "perfectly normal" abnormal behavior, Dietz said. "There are  thousands of people right now in Los Angeles writing those letters."  </P> <P> Why are modern fans so maniacal? De Becker theorized that the frenzy  accompanying Sinatra's rise became socially acceptable behavior and "our  relationship to well-known people changed forever. If, in 1850, someone had  stood up in an audience and screamed at the top of their lungs and pulled out  their hair, they'd have gone off to an asylum."  </P> <P> The magic of modern sound systems has created more problems, he noted, by  making it possible for performers to communicate with audiences in so  "intimate" a way that even fans in the third balcony believe that the message  is just for them.  </P> <P> "Idolatry in America is normal," but "what's a mild drug for most people is a  poison for some people," de Becker said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Obsessive Interest  </P> <P> He argued that the '80s are a time in which there has been an "explosion in  degrees of famousness," with celebrities subject to obsessive interest by fans  and the media. "There's bound to be someone out there who thinks you're  representing the devil" or who is convinced "that little wink you gave before  you left the stage was for him," he said.  </P> <P> Further, the globally ubiquitous presence of television gives fans "a presumed  intimacy" with their idols, and the medium gives schizophrenics "an excuse to  be all alone," to fantasize about what they will do with or to a chosen  celebrity, he said. TV airs a drama about a person who gets blown up while  turning on the lights; a client soon receives a similar threat.  </P> <P> Psychiatrist Dietz put it this way: "It's one thing to sit in a theater with a  couple of hundred people and watch Bogie. It's quite another to have him in  one's bedroom."  </P> <P> Dietz is directing a three-year U.S. Justice Department study on violence  against public figures; de Becker is consulting. Dietz has studied 500 crank  letters, half from de Becker's files, and found that the writers sent to  targets, in order of frequency: a photo of themselves, poetry and photos of  other people or objects, among them a dog and a deodorant ad.  </P> <P> Those who target public figures most often fancy themselves celebrity  spouses-to-be; others believe that they are a celebrity's child. Though 2% in  his study had money motives, the thing most craved was contact with the  celebrity -- a personal reply, at the very least, marriage, at the very most  (15%). Dietz said he has found "more cases of erotomania (an obsession with a  non-existent love relationship) in Gavin's files than have been reported in the  entire world psychiatric literature."  </P> <P> Dr. Mark J. Mills, a forensic psychiatrist who is president of Forensic  Sciences Medical Group in Santa Monica and a professor of psychiatry at UCLA,  said that to his knowledge the data compiled by Dietz with de Becker "has not  been replicated." Corroborative research is needed to be "absolutely certain"  about the conclusions, he said, but he considers de Becker's observations  "intuitive."  </P> <P> Mills said he believes that one reason for the escalating number of celebrity  harassment cases is simply that, "like child sexual abuse issues," more are  being reported. But he agreed with de Becker that television is a major factor:  "People have the fantasy they really know a celebrity if they see him or her  regularly on TV."  </P> <P> He said he sees harassment of celebrities as "a peculiarly American issue. We  are a nation that gives rise to and authenticates virtually unlimited  expectations. . . . We are taught to feel if we work hard enough we can do  anything and be anything. And very few people want to be ordinary."  </P> <P> As a result, he said, some people will "do anything to be recognized. It's part  of the American myth that anybody can be unique and remarkable and important."  </P> <P> People who threaten celebrities represent "a wide range of both personality  disorders and mental disorders," he said. "You're going to see some people who  are crazy, like Lynette (Squeaky) Fromm (the woman who tried to assassinate  President Ford), and some people who are merely grandiose or narcissistic or  troubled."  </P> <P> In his experience, de Becker said, the kinds of productions celebrities star in  can play a role in the type of threats they receive, with science fiction shows  "very attractive to crazy people at the age of greatest dangerousness, 28 to  32."  </P> <P> A male sci-fi film viewer contacted a female celebrity with urgent news: "He  and my client were the only people in the world who had a particular blood type  that would allow them to mate and save the world," de Becker said. The man was  "very dedicated" to getting to the star and was convinced that they were being  kept apart by Vulcans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Violence Attracts Violent People  </P> <P> Violent people are also attracted to actors who portray violent people, said  Dietz, who noted that Hinckley did not see "Taxi Driver" 16 times because he  was a pacifist; he was thinking about assassinations before he ever saw it.  "But it did him no good to keep watching it," he said.  </P> <P> Some material de Becker sees is the stuff of probably harmless flights of fancy  -- "I'm sorry I cannot accept an offer to appear in a film with you." Then, he  said, there is "the person who is setting the table every night with a place  for my client. Those aren't so funny." He also encounters many cases of  erotomania.  </P> <P> Overall, it is mental disorder, not criminal intent, that motivates the vast  majority of those who pen the sick mail. And though they may be mentally ill,  they are not fools, de Becker said: "The people we have under assessment are  smarter than the general population. At least these people write letters."  </P> <P> After receiving the crank correspondence from clients, de Becker and his staff  tap into their computer bank to identify and locate the source and learn if, or  when, those troubled individuals might visit Los Angeles. If they do, agents  frequently are able to monitor their every move.  </P> <P> Offenders usually help on that score. "Most people write (using) their real  names," said de Becker, who considers the author profile an essential step in  evaluating his threat.  </P> <P> Is there a criminal history? A history of mental illness? If the writer is  under psychiatric care, a psychiatrist is notified. If the writer is in a  mental hospital, the institution might be advised to detain him.  </P> <P> Because of quirks in the law, many of those who send crank correspondence may  not have violated any statutes and do not fall under law enforcement  jurisdiction. One of de Becker's tasks is to differentiate between intimidation  and threats.  </P> <P> Intimidation, he said, is a scare tactic, "the man who says he is Jesus and  will cause Mt. St. Helens to erupt again," if a chosen star does not act as  demanded. "My favorite kind of threat -- we know he can't deliver," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I'm Going to Kill You'  </P> <P> A real threat, he explained, is unconditional: "Get your affairs in order. I'm  going to kill you on Thursday. Those we get. Those are real."  </P> <P> Though Dietz disagrees based on his work, de Becker's figures show women are  less apt to be violent -- perhaps only 10% of his offenders have been female.  "They don't show up at the residence," de Becker said, "or climb the gate at 2  in the morning."  </P> <P> Twisted fans bent on having star encounters do employ all manner of sneaky  means. Consider the man who, convinced that a celebrity had injected chemicals  into his brain to control him, sought a job with that star under an assumed  name; de Becker thwarted that plan.  </P> <P> Violent fans get themselves hired as security guards for their stars' concerts.  If detected, they will be monitored or reassigned to low-risk areas of arenas.  If a suspect simply has bought a concert ticket, "We often occupy the seats  next to him," de Becker said.  </P> <P> He and his agents are not above their own deceptions. "We have been the limo  service that meets (suspects) at the airport" in Los Angeles, he said.  </P> <P> If intervention is indicated, timing is all-important, de Becker said, adding  that he believes in acting only when "the fuse is lit." That might mean letting  a person come to Los Angeles, then "following him to the gun store."  </P> <P> Left alone, de Becker has found, "most of them won't act. You screw around with  them and then they act."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Guns Not Always Necessary  </P> <P> Sometimes, de Becker said, his agents are armed, sometimes not. "Firearms are  not as relevant to protective work as people think they are" in an  American-style attack, he noted.  </P> <P> Last year, his firm made about 60 citizen's arrests, most for violation of  probation or of a restraining order, or for trespassing. All of those arrested,  he said, were "mentally ill people." It is rare for him to file a police report  on routine threats, he said, because "we know there's nothing they can do about  it."  </P> <P> "Even on a death threat," he said, "the restrictions under law are amazing."  Prosecuting the Michael J. Fox case, the district attorney's office relied on a  section of the penal code dealing with terrorist threats, de Becker said,  adding: "That's what it ultimately is, it's terrorism."  </P> <P> His interest in protecting public figures dates to President John F. Kennedy's  1963 assassination, which he said "was the first world event that had any  impact on me personally." As a teen-ager, de Becker was a "gopher" for comedian  Stan Freberg, who worked to get the Kennedy investigation reopened. "I devoured  all that," he said.  </P> <P> Not long after graduating from Beverly Hills High, de Becker was recommended by  Dean Martin's then-wife, Jeannie, whose daughter was a friend, for a job  helping to protect Taylor and Burton as they trotted around the globe. At 19,  that was a job "I was in no way qualified" for, de Becker conceded, but he  added, "I had moxie, and some ability."  </P> <P> Since then, business has burgeoned. He has consulted on the Tylenol poisonings  investigation and with Domino's Pizza, allegedly targeted recently by Kenneth  Noid, 22. Police said Noid, irked by Domino's "Avoid the Noid" commercials,  held two Domino's employees hostage at a Georgia outlet for five hours, then  ordered and ate a pizza before surrendering.  </P> <P> To de Becker, the rise in disturbed fans has meant increasing revenues.  Top-of-the-line clients pay $475,000 a year for his services, which in addition  to threat analysis pays for around-the-clock protection with trimmings,  including an armored car and escorts for tours. "A very common figure is  $225,000," he said. "That gets you 24-hour coverage."  </P> <P> Every 60 days, clients on retainer also receive advisories with dates and sites  they should be concerned about. And though de Becker -- an articulate,  soft-spoken, coat-and-tie man -- conceded that he "wouldn't last 10 minutes  with fame," one of his client services is to "raise their tolerance" to living  with threats. His message: "You don't have to change your life when you get a  dead chicken" in the mail.  </P> <P> Even with the dangers, de Becker understands why celebrities -- some of whom  receive as many as 4,000 letters a month, a share of those harassing or  threatening -- do not trade fame for tranquility. He said simply: "They've got  a cultural ethic built into them," a gnawing need to be "the biggest star."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> EX-MARINE ORDERED TO CLEAN MEMORIAL  </P> <P> A former Marine convicted of vandalizing the California Vietnam Veterans  Memorial was ordered to scrub it clean every weekend for one year.  </P> <P> "If somebody asks you what you're doing and why you're doing that, tell them  you did something bad to the memorial and you're paying for it," Municipal  Judge R. G. Vonasek told Stanley Del La Cruz. A jury convicted the 33-year-old  landscaper of misdemeanor vandalism in breaking a six-inch piece off a  life-size M-16 bronze rifle on the monument in February, 1989. Del La Cruz  contended that the barrel accidentally broke off when he grabbed it to pull  himself to his feet from a kneeling position after praying for "the soldiers  and their mothers."  </P></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Letter: 'Spousal equivalents' benefits Sir, Nikki Tait's account of 'spousal equivalents' being treated as spouses in a few American employee benefit plans was interesting and informative (Management, January 24). The reference, however, to '. . . a handful of public sector employers, such as Manhattan's Montefiore Hospital' is thrice wrong: it's the Montefiore Medical Center; it's in the Bronx, not in Manhattan; and it's a private-sector (non-profit) institution, not in the public sector. Ms Tait also might have noted that the reason for the low take-up of the Lotus scheme by its homosexual employees probably lies in the pattern for health benefits generally. Partners most likely are also working, making them eligible for their own employer-furnished benefits. Very commonly, American workers are required to contribute to the cost of health insurance for their spouses. If either a spouse or an equivalent is already covered through his or her own employment, why pay for another coverage which is secondary?

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Oliver reduces first half loss to Pounds 1.65m Oliver Group, the shoe retailer now trading from 335 branches, cut its losses from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 1.65m for the six months to July 2. The group made a Pounds 244,000 full-year profit; however 'footwear, like most other forms of retailing, is heavily dependent on the peak Christmas trading period for a profitable outcome for the year,' said Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman. Turnover was down at Pounds 32.2m (Pounds 33.2m), but this was achieved from 43 fewer branches than in the first half of 1993. Losses per share were 6.55p (8.86p).</p>

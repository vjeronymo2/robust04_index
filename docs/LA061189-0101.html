			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S TIME TO RESTORE THE VISION OF A DOWNTOWN BAYFRONT PARK  </P> <P> John Nolen, a turn-of-the-century urban planner, envisioned bringing San  Diego's two premier natural attractions, Balboa Park and the sea, into "direct  and pleasant relation." He suggested parks, gardens, a museum and an aquarium  at the bay and an inland civic center, all connected to Balboa Park by a  "suitable" parkway or boulevard.  </P> <P> Time passed Nolen's creative idea by. But San Diego City Councilman Ron  Roberts, an architect by trade, thinks it's time to fulfill Nolen's dream.  </P> <P> Roberts recently called for a 16-acre park at the foot of Broadway, to form a  ceremonial entrance to the city. The park would have an amphitheater facing the  bay and would be surrounded by museums on the ground floors of adjacent  buildings.  </P> <P> The bayfront park, which Roberts calls Paseo Park, would be "linked" to Balboa  Park by landscaping along Broadway to the planned civic center at 12th Avenue  and then up Park Boulevard.  </P> <P> Roberts' plan is just conceptual, and the details will need full debate. But  overall, it's very promising. Open space is virtually nonexistent downtown. And  what better place for a downtown park than along the waterfront, which is in  danger of being walled off with high-rises?  </P> <P> Establishing museum space around the park also makes good sense. It would be an  intelligent complement to Balboa Park, which cannot accommodate all of the  museums and cultural institutions vying for space there. A bayfront museum  complex would also reinforce the link between the park and the water.  </P> <P> But a waterfront park will take a good deal of cooperation among the city, the  San Diego Unified Port District and the Navy, because the park would occupy  Navy and Port District land.  </P> <P> Louis Wolfsheimer, chairman of the Board of Port Commissioners, has expressed  enthusiastic support for the plan. But the Navy has been hesitant.  </P> <P> The Navy has plans for a large office-and-hotel complex on its property just  south of Broadway, and Paseo Park would displace one of the high-rises in its  plan, costing the Navy millions of dollars it proposes to use to pay for its  headquarters.  </P> <P> In deference to Nolen's vision, the Navy plan also includes a park, although it  would cover only 5 acres. And the Navy has already scaled back its plans once,  to address city concerns. So its reluctance to endorse Roberts' proposal may be  understandable.  </P> <P> But Roberts' proposal for a 16-acre park is an improvement on the Navy's plan,  and we hope that, together, the Navy, the Port District and the city can come  up with a compromise to help compensate the Navy.  </P> <P> This will take flexibility by all the parties. But the result could be a  waterfront that the Navy and the city will be proud to call home.  </P></p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: RJB Mining takes over Young's UK businesses RJB Mining, which wants to reopen several mines closed recently by British Coal, is to buy the main UK businesses of the Young Group, including opencast and drift pits. The consideration is Pounds 1.45m plus the assumption of Pounds 3.65m debt. The total value of Young's contracted work in hand is about Pounds 60m, similar in size to RJB's existing contracts. The majority of the contracts involve the sale of coal for power generation. RJB will increase its gearing to about 50 per cent to fund the acquisition. Mr Richard Budge, chairman, said he was comfortable with that level and there were no plans for a rights issue. It is thought that gearing will not be increased further if RJB is successful in licensing and leasing British Coal pits, because it will not have to pay any money up front. In the year ending November 30 1992 Young Group businesses had an aggregate turnover of Pounds 34.6m and operating profits of Pounds 201,000, but reported a loss before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 384,000. The net asset value of the company at that date was Pounds 1.82m. Although the figures also include Venezuelan businesses which RJB is not buying, Mr Budge said these were a relatively small part of the total. Young operates one opencast site on behalf of British Coal, two licensed opencast sites and four underground drift mines. RJB is acquiring approximately 5m tonnes of coal reserve, of which 1.2m have planning permission and 600,000 have coaling licences. RJB already operates sites with a total of 6.5m tonnes of coal reserves. Mr Budge said the acquisition would help secure RJB's plant fleet over the next four years. The acquisition would also reduce transport costs and optimise coal blending opportunities for the whole group. The Young businesses employ about 300 people in the UK, although it is likely that rationalisation will reduce the total.</p>

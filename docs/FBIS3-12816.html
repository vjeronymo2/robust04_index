			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Information Department Head Yasir </F> 'Abd-Rabbuh by unidentified reporter in Paris on 4 March --  recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO  Information Department, following the Hebron massacre and within  the framework of the PLO campaign to explain its demands for  resuming the negotiations with Israel, you are now visiting  Paris, and you met with officials here. What topics were  discussed and what stands were expressed?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] Today, a meeting was held with the French  foreign and defense ministers. At this meeting, we explained  the stand of the Palestinian command, emphasizing the need to  provide all security guarantees for the Palestinian citizens in  the occupied territories as a necessary step before the peace  process is resumed. At the forefront of these demands is the  issue of ending settlement activities, the armed presence of the  settlers, and some settlement centers that are a real obstacle  and a time bomb threatening any peace arrangements that could be  reached. At the same time, we must not forget the importance of  the presence of international forces in the occupied territories  with full authorization from the UN Security Council to carry  out their role of safeguarding security and monitoring Israeli  respect for the security of the Palestinian people and their  rights. I can say that the French and Palestinian stands on  these points are in agreement, and that France is playing its  role as the current UN Security Council president by issuing a  UN Security Council resolution that will help us start  implementing such arrangements and measures.    [Reporter] Has France agreed to send international forces to  the occupied territories?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] France today said that it agrees to an  effective international presence in the occupied territories  authorized by the UN Security Council and the United Nations,  and that this international presence should have a practical  role in preventing any violations against the Palestinian  people, particularly after the massacre that was committed in  Hebron one week ago.    [Reporter] What capitals will you visit after France?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] Today, we will also meet with the EC  leadership  in Brussels, and with the Belgian foreign minister. We will  explain the Palestinian stand within the framework of common  action with Europe and all other forces eager to preserve the  peace process and have it proceed without impediments and  without any mines being laid on the road, such as the presence  of the Israeli terrorists, the settlers, and the extremist  forces that support them.    [Reporter] The international envoys that have traveled to  Tunis to meet with the Palestinians and to Israel, including the  Russian envoy and the Greek envoy, whose country chairs the EC,  have urged the Palestinian and Israeli sides to resume the  negotiations. When do you expect the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations will resume?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] We seek to resume the negotiations as soon as  possible. However, the resumption of the negotiations calls for  real guarantees. The question is not one of sitting around a  table only. The question is to reach, on the ground, a secure  and sound state of affairs with respect to the Palestinian  citizens, a situation that does not expose them to the Israeli  terrorism at any moment.    [Reporter] Are you satisfied with the development of the  international stand in this respect?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] We believe that most of those who represent  the  international stand are sympathetic and understand the realism  of the Palestinian stand and Palestinian demands, as well as the  Palestinian side's concern over the peace process and its  continuation. The international stand now completely  understands that the obstacles placed by the terrorist settlers  and others should be completely removed so that the peace  process may be resumed, and so that steps and measures can be  taken on the road to implementing the peace agreement and not  only to sit at the table of negotiations.    [Reporter] Reports from Israel speak of a serious dialogue  between the Rabin government and the extremist right-wing party  Tzomet to have it join the coalition government. Tzomet's  stands are known to be against the autonomy agreement and to  support the presence of the settlements, not to mention the  other extremist stands. What do the Palestinians think about  this development?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] Of course, this is a negative development. The  strange thing is that Rabin's government, which claims it is  against extremism, seeks to deal with extremism by resorting to  more extremism. We are closely watching this issue, especially  since the differences between Eytan, Kahane, and the other  extremist gangs are minor. They all agree on the same platform  -- on adopting a racist stand against the Palestinians.</p>

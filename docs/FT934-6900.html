			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / BR casts doubt on EU safety directive A senior British Rail official yesterday accused the European Union of basing its rules on working hours on received wisdom instead of facts. Large parts of the EU's working time directive, which will be passed today in Brussels, were not based on actual research about the effects of night work and long shifts, said Mr Gareth Hadley, head of employee relations at BR. Revealing the results of BR research into 7,500 safety incidents, Mr Hadley said there was no evidence of an increase in safety risks from working shifts up to 12 hours, or working high weekly hours. The BR research, covering more than 50m train-driver hours, found that the eighth to 12th hours of shifts were lower-risk than earlier hours and that the peak risk period was in the second to fourth hours. The research found no link between lack of breaks and accidents. It says there is some evidence to suggest that the highest risk of an accident comes soon after a break. The EU working time directive imposes conditions on working more than 48 hours a week, requires breaks after six hours' continuous working, and also limits night shifts to eight hours. But it does not apply to the transport sector. The BR research found there were no greater risks from working at night, but did establish that 'the highest risk of the more severe safety accidents was at midnight'. This, however, was not linked to hours-into-shift fatigue. Elsewhere the arrival of the working time directive - which does not become law for three years - was welcomed. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: 'This directive means employers will no longer be able to deny workers three weeks' paid holiday a year.' By 1999 three weeks' statutory holiday will rise to four weeks, but it is not clear whether that will apply pro rata to part-time workers or whether it will apply at all to people working only a few hours a week. In the UK 2.2m employees have no paid holiday, but fewer than 20 per cent of these work 16 hours or more per week and have at least one year's continuous service with an employer. But even if most of those 2.2m are excluded from the directive, nearly a quarter of full-time UK employees still have less than four weeks' holiday, say employment department figures.</p>

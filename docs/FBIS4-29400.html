			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["YONHAP from Vienna"] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has  welcomed President Kim Il-song's promise to allow IAEA  inspectors to stay in North Korea, but it has indicated that it  is too early to assess if North Korea fulfills obligations of  the Nuclear Safeguards Accord.    In an interview with an Austrian radio station today, IAEA  spokesman David Kyd stressed that it is important to confirm if  IAEA inspectors would have access to North Korea's seven  declared nuclear facilities and that at present no details have  been disclosed regarding it. He also said that details must be  disclosed within a few days.    Regarding North Korea's announcement that it will observe  obligations of the Nuclear Safeguards Accord, a Vienna-based  diplomatic source said that such a proposal by North Korea  cannot be a breakthrough in resolving the nuclear issue and  stressed: To find a breakthrough, North Korea should announce  that it would allow the IAEA team to inspect their seven  declared facilities. Actually, the nuclear inspections should  be carried out in North Korea.</p>

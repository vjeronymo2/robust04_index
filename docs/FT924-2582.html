			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Procter &amp; Gamble in review of world operations PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the Cincinnati-based consumer products company, has told employees it is reviewing operations worldwide in an effort to make the group more efficient and competitive. Employees were told on Wednesday that P&amp;G was implementing a 'worldwide project to review work processes and organisational structure'. The company claims the overview is necessary because of a steady flow of acquisitions - over 40 during the past decade - and geographical expansion moves. 'We believe this is the right time to step back and . . . assure that the organisational structure is matched to the needs of the marketplace,' it says. The company added that, although unable to predict the results of the study, it does not expect 'broad-scale layoffs'. It suggested that, if job cuts were found to be necessary, they could be 'handled primarily through reassignment, normal attrition and retirements'. P&amp;G is setting up a steering committee, which will first analyse the group's structure and then draw up detailed recommendations.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Manila to speed poll count The Philippines authorities yesterday agreed to speed up the lengthy vote counting in the presidential election, Reuter reports from Manila. Since beginning the official vote count last Thursday, the legislature has tabulated results from only 12 of the country's 73 provinces and from only one of 21 cities. An estimated 25m people voted in the election. 'We're getting to be very impatient,' said Mr Raul Goco, lawyer for former defence secretary and self-declared winner, Mr Fidel Ramos. Anti-corruption crusader, Mrs Miriam Santiago, leads in the official count with 445,767 votes followed by a business tycoon, Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, with 401,932. Mr Ramos is in third place with 330,251 votes.</p>

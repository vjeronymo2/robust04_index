			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / ICI warns of risk to chlorine business IMPERIAL Chemical Industries has warned that its high energy-consuming chlorine businesses have been made uncompetitive by a 30 per cent rise in electricity prices since April last year. The company has attacked the pricing policies and profits of Britain's electricity producers and those of the regional electricity companies, warning that its chlorine plants required immediate price cuts if they were to survive against foreign competition. Energy represents about 70 per cent of chlorine raw materials costs. ICI's chlorine businesses are the second largest in Europe, employing 7,000 people in the UK and contributing Pounds 1.5bn to the balance of payments, according to the company. The warning follows campaigns by the Chemical Industries Association and the Major Energy Users Council about the high cost of electricity following privatisation. The users council has asked for the two large electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. ICI said it had had lengthy discussions with the electricity generators but had been unable to gain better prices. Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI Chemicals and Polymers said: 'We have worked hard to keep all our other costs competitive and an immediate cut on electricity price is crucial if we are to maintain the jobs in the industry. Given the huge price increases suddenly imposed on us we were not surprised by the massive profit increases recently recorded by the electricity producers and the figures now being unveiled by the regional distribution companies.' In February, ICI said it might have to shut its chloralkali plant at Hillhouse, Lancashire, because of falling demand and rising electricity costs.</p>

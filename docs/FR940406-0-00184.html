			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, the percentage of imported oil purchased from OPEC sources, which peaked at 70 percent in 1977, and declined to a low of 36 percent in 1985, has been steadily rising since then, and has been over 50 percent every year since 1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average cost of crude oil imports jumped from $4.08 per barrel in 1973 to $12.52 in 1974 as a result of the oil embargo against selected countries, including the United States, by Arab members of OPEC. Additional increases in the cost of oil occurred in 1979&hyph;80, due to unrest in Iran (which eliminated a substantial portion of that country's oil output), and in 1980&hyph;81, when the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war reduced supply from the area. In 1981, the United States adopted a policy of reliance on market forces and decontrolled the price of oil. Since 1981, prices have fallen as conservation efforts continue. In 1990&hyph;91, petroleum prices were affected by the conflict in the Persian Gulf. In the beginning of 1992, the continued worldwide economic recession and high levels of crude oil production by OPEC member countries together held down oil prices. The average refiner acquisition cost of imported crude oil in 1992 was $17.75 per barrel, which was 4.2 percent below the average 1991 level (in 1992 dollars).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current energy situation and emerging trends point to the continued importance of oil conservation. The United States now imports a higher percentage of its oil needs than it did during 1975, the year EPCA was passed, and the percentage of its oil supplied by OPEC is similar to that of 1975. Oil continues to account for over 40 percent of all energy used in the United States, and 97 percent of the energy consumed in the transportation sector. Despite legislation such as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and California's strict ``clean fuel'' and emissions standards, gasoline will likely remain the predominant fuel in the transportation sector. Domestic oil production has declined steadily since reaching a peak of 10.6 million barrels per day in 1985 and dropping to 9.0 million barrels per day in 1992. Domestic production is expected to continue declining by roughly 200,000 barrels per day each year through the year 2000. While the United States is currently the world's second largest oil producer, it contains only about three percent of the world's known oil reserves. Persian Gulf countries contain 63 percent of known world reserves, and former communist countries contain 9 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Long-term projections of petroleum prices, supply, and demand are now influenced by a wide range of uncertainties associated with sweeping economic and political changes in the former U.S.S.R. and in Eastern Europe, environmental issues, and the role of Middle East countries in determining the world's future oil supplies and prices, and future energy demands in populous developing countries. The Department of Energy projects that oil prices will be between $14 and $30 (1992 dollars) per barrel in the year 2000, and will rise to between $19 and $39 per barrel by 2010. DOE projects a continuing decline in domestic oil production to between 3.54 and 6.73 million barrels per day in 2010, with imports rising to between 52 percent and 72 percent of total use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The level of petroleum imports is only one aspect of the total energy conservation picture. Under EPCA and NEPA, for example, national security, energy independence, resource conservation, and environmental protection must all be considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In March 1987, the Department of Energy submitted a report to the President entitled ``Energy Security.'' NHTSA believes that the following quotation from that report continues to represent a useful summary of the national security and energy independence aspects of the current energy situation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Aid promised to Mozambique International donors yesterday promised Mozambique Dollars 760m (Pounds 500m) in aid for its long-term reconstruction programme and indicated that more would be offered at a peace conference in Rome next week, Reuter reports from Paris. The World Bank said the Dollars 760m included around Dollars 137m in food aid, with the rest intended for various economic and social projects plus import support. Mr Eneas Comiche, Mozambique's finance minister, said he was hoping for total external support, including a Paris Club debt rescheduling, of around Dollars 1.2bn in 1993.</p>

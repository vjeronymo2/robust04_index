			<p>BFN     [Text] Although some sectors have reached an agreement with  the government, the Bolivian Labor Federation [COB] says that  there are still several pending issues.    The COB's nationwide meeting was supposed to continue today  with the purpose of assessing the government's last salary  increase offer, among other issues. However, at the request of  the miners' confederation, who want to negotiate their demands  with the government first, the meeting was postponed until  tomorrow.    This morning the COB leaders said the agreement signed  between the government and the coca growers does not mean that  everything has been solved. The blockades have been lifted, but  the hunger strikers continue their measures. Still pending are  11 missing peasants, two deaths, 20 rural teachers under arrest,  the miners' demands, and the request for a salary hike.    The COB has still not answered the latest offer by the  government of a 9 percent salary increase. [recorded passage  indistinct]    Although some sectors have accepted the government's offer,  such as the health workers, the COB, during its meeting  tomorrow, will continue to assess the 9 percent salary hike  offered by the government.    La Paz teachers have organized a protest rally for this  afternoon to demand the release of the 20 rural teachers under  arrest.</p>

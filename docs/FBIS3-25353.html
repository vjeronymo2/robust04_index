The dispute has been going on for nearly three years  now. Yesterday evening, the head of state received the two  delegations separately. Each audience lasted about one hour.  Today, the Burkinabe envoys are pursuing their discussions with  the two delegations in order to establish a working program  likely to bring everyone around the same table. Radio Burkina  contacted the leaders of the two delegations who showed optimism  about the effective takeoff of these trilateral consultations.    Kriska, of the Coordination of Armed Resistance, which  includes all the Tuareg movements, says this slowdown is caused  by technical problems. A few modifications need to be made,  however that these are not necessarily preconditions. As for  the head of the government delegation, Abdourahamane Hama, who  is Niger's foreign affairs and cooperation minister, the  consultations remain informal because this enables them to  proceed prudently. Both claim that a joint meeting is probable  either this evening or tomorrow morning.</p>

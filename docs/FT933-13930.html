			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hampson dips by 7% to Pounds 3.8m and cuts dividend HAMPSON Industries, the industrial group, increased sales by 8 per cent but suffered a profit reduction of 7 per cent in the year to March 31. Following a cut in the interim dividend, the final is lowered to 1.2p for a total of 1.6p, against 2.373p. Earnings per share came to 3.13p (3.62p). Turnover was Pounds 79m (Pounds 73m) while pre-tax profit worked through at Pounds 3.76m (Pounds 4.06m). The group's activities take in aluminium refining, precision engineering, home improvements, furniture manufacture, and cleaning. Mr Ray Ward, chairman, said many of the operations had significant prospects for organic growth over the next three years. A reasonable proportion of profit and cash flow would be retained - the final dividend carries a scrip alternative - to strengthen the balance sheet and achieve by the end of the period average borrowings significantly below 40 per cent of shareholders' funds. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 833,000), covering the loan and guarantee written off to Warmshield and a provision against certain property values. Warmshield is in the home improvements market but in receivership. The bulk of the commitment was made in 1989 in return for an option to purchase 80 per cent of the capital for Pounds 1.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Everything in the garden is not so rosy - Wall Street THE White House was forced to issue a denial this week that President George Bush had suffered a heart attack. A spokesman quickly allayed the fears of financial markets by describing the scene in front of him: Bush enjoying a stroll around the White House rose garden. Anyone looking for similar comforting words on the health of the stock market would have been disappointed. The first full week since the Dow broke the 3,000 barrier proved anything but an enjoyable stroll around a rose garden. Under the weight of a wave of computerised sell programs and investor profit-taking, the Dow, Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite posted significant losses during the first four days of trading. By midday yesterday, there was little sign of a recovery, with the leading indices all marginally lower. Volume also declined sharply this week, down 20 per cent from the previous week's average to around 166m shares a day. Confirmation of Wall Street's depressed mood could be seen in the market's 'breadth' - the difference between the number of shares that rise and fall during each day. Declining stocks outnumbered rising stocks by the substantial margin of three-to-one on Monday, and two-to-one on Thursday. Yesterday, the margin was running at almost two-to-one by noon. The sense of disappointment among dealers and investors was tangible all week - disappointment at the failure of the Dow to hold above 3,000, but above all at the Federal Reserve's refusal to cut interest rates. Although the impressive rally in share prices since mid-January was fuelled by a myriad of factors - the success in the Gulf war, hopes of an economic turnaround, large infusions of individual and institutional liquidity - the steady decline of US interest rates was always the most powerful force. The perception that interest rates are now stuck at their present levels (6 per cent for the fed funds and discount rates, 9 per cent for bank prime rates) has struck the biggest blow to investor confidence. The Fed has gone out of its way to signal its resolve to keep rates steady, regularly intervening in the credit markets to push the fed funds rate back up to its 6 per cent target. If this message was not clear enough, comments from Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, hammered it home. Greenspan was asked why the discount rate is higher now than it was in 1986, a year when the economy was not in recession, and therefore not in need of stimulation from low interest rates. His answer - inflation is much more of a threat to the economy now than it was in 1986 - left the markets in doubt as to where the Fed's priorities lie. The market could not even draw comfort from economic news this week. Figures released on Tuesday showed that factory orders for durable goods during March fell by 6.2 per cent, a decline in excess of analysts' forecasts. The next day the nation's car manufacturers unveiled disappointing mid-April sales totals, again in defiance of expectations. Then yesterday the latest quarterly gross national product figures provided official confirmation of the existence of the recession. Real GNP fell 2.8 per cent in the first three months of 1991, making it the second consecutive quarter of negative growth and thus, by the only measurement accepted by the US government, evidence of a full-blown recession. The GNP numbers were bad enough but not unexpected. What was worrying - and it spells more bad news for stock prices - was the big jump in the GNP implicit price deflator, a widely used alternative measure of inflation which tracks domestically generated price rises. The deflator was 5.5 per cent in the quarter, well up on the 2.8 per cent reported in the last quarter of 1990. The only bright news of the week came from a smattering of good quarterly figures. There was yet more cheer from Wall Street securities houses, with Salomon and Morgan Stanley proudly displaying handsome increases in first quarter income. The nation's big oil producers also shone. The benefits of Occidental's restructuring following the death of Armand Hammer, the former chairman, began to show, with first quarter profit up 30 per cent. Mobil reported a 78 per cent rise in earnings to Dollars 710m, while Exxon announced a 75 per cent improvement in profits to a whopping Dollars 2.2bn. RJR Nabisco appears to have turned the corner at last, reporting its first quarterly profit since it was taken over in a Dollars 25bn leveraged buyout in early 1989. Admittedly, after-tax income was a meagre Dollars 5m on sales of almost Dollars 3.5bn, but in the current climate the stock market has to be thankful for such small mercies.  ------------------------------ Monday      2927.72    -37.87 Tuesday     2930.45     +2.73 Wednesday   2949.51    +19.06 Thursday    2921.04    -28.46 Friday      2912.38     -8.66  ------------------------------</p>

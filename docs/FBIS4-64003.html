			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report under the "Situation in the </F> Former Yugoslavia" rubric: "Vitaliy Churkin: The World Has  Seen Russia's Objectivity"]    [Text] Yesterday, talks on a Bosnian settlement began in  France between representatives of the contact group (including  Russia, the United States, the EC, and the UN) and the parties  to the Bosnian conflict. The talks are held according to a  decision by the great powers' foreign ministers that was reached  in Geneva two weeks ago. There is every reason to hope that  this time an agreement on halting hostilities in Bosnia will be  reached. This is what Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy  Churkin said in an exclusive interview for KOMMERSANT-DAILY  observer Sergey Tsekhmistrenko.    According to Vitaliy Churkin, Russian diplomacy has  conducted  intensive work since Geneva, primarily to convince the Bosnian  Serbs to sit down at the negotiating table. Presently one can  state that their attitude to the Geneva documents is on the  whole fairly positive. This conclusion can be drawn at least  from the fact that the Serbs, who control over 70 percent of  Bosnia, calmly reacted to the Geneva plan of Bosnia's  territorial partition that gives 51 percent to the Muslim-Croat  federation and 49 percent to the Serbs. At the negotiations that  have just begun the Bosnian Serbs are represented by Momcilo  Kraisnik, "the chief specialist on work with maps," who has  already established fairly good contacts with Muslim Prime  Minister Haris Silaidzic. The Serbs have also refrained from  escalating hostilities, something for which the Geneva  communique also called.    Unfortunately, the Russian diplomat observed, the  Muslim-Croat side has so far not shown any desire to conduct a  constructive dialogue. Mr. Churkin emphasized in particular  that this conclusion should not be interpreted as "Moscow's  pro-Serb stance:" Russia is holding an objective stance  regarding all parties to the conflict, which was confirmed by  events in Gorazde. At present, representatives of the newly  created federation (where the Muslims call the shots) question  many provisions of the Geneva plan, including the principles of  territorial partition and the cessation of hostilities for four  months. One is getting the impression that the Muslims are also  deliberately trying to delay the settlement in Gorazde by  refusing to sign a special agreement with UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] (the Serbs have already signed it) so as to  have an excuse to avoid halting combat operations in all of  Bosnia.    To all appearances, Mr. Churkin said, the opinion seems to  be  still holding sway in the Muslim leadership that much more could  be gained on the battlefield than by dialogue. However, there  are more than sufficient reasons to hope for success at the  current negotiations. This, in turn, will pave the way to a new  meeting of the great powers' foreign ministers, which could also  be held in Geneva (but this time in the Russian mission, not the  U.S. one -- there should be parity after all!) in mid-May.    Events in Bosnia have somehow relegated to the back burner  other hot spots in the former Yugoslavia, including the  situation around Croatian Serb Kraina. Mr. Churkin did not hide  his disappointment with the fact that, having started their  dialogue with signing a cease-fire agreement, the sides have  gotten bogged down in matters of procedure, for instance arguing  over the venue of their next meeting. Changes in the leadership  of Serb Kraina have also played a part. As a matter of fact,  when at his first meeting with Milan Martic, the new president  of Serb Krajina, Mr. Churkin said that Moscow's attitude to  Krajina leaders would largely depend on how they cooperate in  the investigation of the circumstances accompanying the murder  of two Russian citizens, journalists Viktor Nogin and Gennadiy  Kurennoy.    In that regard IZVESTIYA's hint in its 24 May issue that the  Foreign Ministry has allegedly prevented publication of the  results of the investigation by a commission of Supreme Soviet  deputies under Vladimir Mukusev was not correct, Mr. Churkin  said -- "no Russian diplomat has ever thought of interfering in  an investigation proceeding from political considerations,  either major or minor, at least in the two years that I have  been holding the post of deputy minister."</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Bentsen man of action on domestic front ONE way or another, President Bill Clinton was going to have to deal with Mr Lloyd Bentsen in order to get his economic programme through Congress. He has chosen to do it with the senator from Texas on board his administration as Treasury secretary rather than offshore as chairman of the Senate finance committee. Though generally described as middle-of-the-road, or, by Democratic party standards, conservative, Mr Bentsen is not associated with any pronounced economic philosophy. A lawyer by training, his reputation in Congress is built mostly on an ability to compromise, detailed knowledge of the budget and the tax code, and an inclination to favour business interests. He is known to believe that the US does not save enough and favours a big extension of personal pensions as one way to tackle this problem. His business connections make him more inclined to promote economic growth than to sit hard on inflation, which, broadly, is Mr Clinton's conviction. He has, however, been sceptical about some aspects of health care reform, which is high on the incoming president's agenda and important in bringing the budget deficit under control. Mr Bentsen's international experience is limited, much as was Mr James Baker's when he took over the Treasury in President Ronald Reagan's second term. In the mid-1980s, Mr Bentsen was in favour of a managed depreciation of the dollar, but that was at a time when the US currency was under great pressure, and he is a supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Beyond that, he has had little to say about the debt problem, assistance to the former Soviet Union and co-ordinated international growth strategy and is not well known by the senior bureaucrats of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington. But Mr Clinton has named him principally to get things done domestically. On that Mr Bentsen has a proven track record. See Observer</p>

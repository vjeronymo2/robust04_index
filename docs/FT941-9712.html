			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: Sweat and hope at the Kirov - Max Loppert visits the Rimsky-Korsakov festival in St Petersburg and marvels at the energy and enthusiasm shown amid the saddening decay in Russia Miracle - it is an ill-advised term of praise for any performing arts company, however fine: human sweat, not divine intervention, is invariably the source of artistic excellence. Nevertheless, there does seem something miraculous about the ability of the Kirov Opera of St Petersburg to flourish, and extend itself in bold new projects, at exactly the time when all around it - in the nobly handsome, often deeply saddening Baltic city itself, in Russia as a whole - decay is plentifully in evidence. Down the road from the Maryinsky Theatre stands the blue-painted, gilt-domed church of St Nicholas, a splendid sight in the distance - and a distressing one in closeup, with its cracked stucco and peeling walls. During a seven-day St Petersburg sojourn for the Kirov's Rimsky-Korsakov in the 20th Century Festival, images of physical decay were transmitted from almost all of the city's main monuments and cultural institutions. In sharp contrast, the Maryinsky building presents a reasonably sound aspect; and what goes on inside the wonderfully beautiful 144-year-old house demonstrates no hint of collapse, nor even of heads-just-above-water. The theatre's long and glorious operatic tradition acts not as the straitjacket of Soviet eras past but the source of fresh inspiration. The company is abundantly stocked with notable voices and personalities, a youthfully exuberant orchestra, and a repertory of productions by no means backward-looking. The engine-room of the Kirov's miraculous vitality and profusion of operatic activity (reflected by first-rate Kirov records and videos now pouring out on the Philips label) is the extraordinary Valery Gergiev, who became the company's artistic director and principal conductor in September 1988, at the age of only 35. Gergiev is now a known quantity in all the world's main musical centres. But to see him in action during the festival - conducting every one of its four Rimsky operas and five Rimsky-pivoted concerts, keeping up a punishing schedule of rehearsal, administration, recording and meeting-the-press the while - was to appreciate just how crucial he is to the Kirov's existence, and it to his: how completely his 'human sweat', and vision, motivate its ethos. Not every event was equally polished - certain concert works emerged plainly under-prepared - yet the fire of Gergiev's artistic imagination warmed all of them equally, leaving the lucky festival-visitor at the end with the enlarged horizons always looked for, seldom attained in such enterprises. I shall focus on the subject of conductor and company in a second article; for the moment my brief is to describe, albeit summarily, the excitements of the Kirov Rimsky-Korsakov experience - in a theatre where most of his operas were first given, across the square from the conservatory where he taught, and in the 150th anniversary year of his birth. This was the third of Gergiev's single-figure festivals - following his Mussorgsky (1989) and Prokofiev (1992) - and, for a Westerner, probably the most ear-and eye-opening of the three. Rimsky-Korsakov exists on the margins of our opera-house repertories; whenever he is briefly moved to a more central position (such as by the ENO's recent Christmas Eve), problems of performance style tend to weigh heavily on the resultant impression. In such circumstances, received opinion about the ephemeral charms of his glittery, fantastic sound-world and the psychological and emotional flatness of his characterising powers proves hard to put to any really vigorous test. Gergiev's choice of festival operas covered the span of Rimsky's creation, from the first, The Maid of Pskov (premiered 1873, later much revised), to the penultimate, The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh (1907), with the 'fable-opera' Sadko (1898) and the fairy-tale one-acter Kashchey the Immortal (1902) in between. All four were tuned to a high pitch of communicativeness by Gergiev's particular conductor's gift, which is the maintenance of an intensely vital lyrical sonority across broad, unhurried dramatic sequences. The 'basics' of natively idiomatic timbre and accent, of that ability to be folkily amusing without straying into kitsch or whimsy, are the common virtues of Russian Rimsky interpretation. These opera performances, given uncut on Gergiev's insistence, went far beyond those basics. The big revelation, for me, came with Sadko: a series of picturesque tableaux, earthly and supernatural, submarine and terrestrial, which were threaded into one long enchantment. The missionary purpose of the staging was to revive the early-1920s Sadko designs of the artist Konstantin Korovin, whose brilliant colours and picturebook patterns were melded into the musical detail. The work's French Grand Opera inheritance - a big 'public' scene in the middle, a vital infusion of dance elements (exquisitely done by the Kirov Ballet) - seemed not at all mere Meyerbeerian machinery, but a prime reason for the work's captivating many-sidedness. High hopes had been pinned on Kitezh, the festival's single brand-new production. Known in the trade as 'the Russian Parsifal', this is an altogether harder task than either Sadko or the youthfully surefire Maid of Pskov, with its elements of historical drama (Ivan the Terrible's confrontation with the city of Pskov) thrillingly resonant with sharp-cut contrasts and Boris-like bell-tollings. The late work's elevated fusion of antique and Christian legend (the reason for the scarcity of Kitezh performances in Soviet times) lacks 'animal' dramatic energy. Luminous, rarefied beauties of sound and spirit may abound on every page but tedium is not always kept at bay - at least not by a production crudely lit, and excessively reliant on fuzzy projection, gauze front-cloths and sugar-iced costumes. Apart from Gergiev and his orchestra, the sustaining compensation was the solo singing, which highlighted the Kirov's envy-inducing individual strengths as much as its ensemble ones. Here is a shortlist of memorable names, notables of more than one evening's cast, who would grace any international stage (and in several cases have already done so): the strong lyric tenor Yury Marusin, vocally much more exactly-tuned than when he was Glyndebourne's unforgettable Spades Hermann; the ringing spinto tenor Vladimir Galuzin; the smooth, lustrous mezzo Larissa Dyadkova; the basses Vladimir Ognovenko and Gennady Bezzubenkov; the baritone Alexander Gergalov, newest in a distinguished Kirov line; the warm-toned soprano Valentina Tsedipova. Galina Gorchakova, possibly the world's richest young soprano talent, played Fevroniya in Kitezh and the Pskov title role. The tender-hearted simplicity of her demeanour and the velour, radiance and house-filling amplitude of her vocal line properly warrant paragraphs of enthusiasm. As current Kirov prima donna she seems to sum up everything that is finest and most inspiring about the whole company.</p>

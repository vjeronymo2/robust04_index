			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jose Meirelles Passos] </F>   [Text] Washington -- General Barry McCaffrey, new commander  of the U.S. Southern Command, who is responsible for all U.S.  military activities in Latin America and for the implementation  of President Bill Clinton's security strategy in the region,  will arrive in Brazil on 15 March on a five-day visit to our  country. Diplomatic circles consider his having chosen Brazil  for his first visit to Latin America to be a significant  political gesture. McCaffrey yesterday said his objective is to  "improve the strong professional relationship" between the  servicemen of the two countries.    In truth, this is the beginning of a relaxation in the  relationship between the Brazilian and U.S. Armed Forces, which  have recently experienced difficulties due to the training of  U.S. troops on the Brazilian border, without the participation  of the Brazilian Armed Forces.    During a recent visit to Washington, Foreign Minister Celso  Amorim said that "the relationship deteriorated recently because  there was the feeling that the United States was granting other  Latin American countries more cooperation. The fact that the  United States considered that the Brazilian military should  fight drug trafficking also caused unrest in our barracks. We  need to reverse that climate."    Since then, Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso  Flecha de Lima has been in frequent contact with the Pentagon,  seeking to smooth the creases. He, for example, was the only  Latin American ambassador to attend General McCaffrey's  swearing-in as commander of the Southern Command on 17 February.    Flecha de Lima revealed that one of the main obstacles in  the  relationship between the Brazilian Armed Forces and the Pentagon  began to be removed a few days ago. The ambassador explained  that the problem was caused by a curious technical problem: No  Brazilian military representative in Washington had ever been  invited to Pentagon briefings (meeting during which the  Pentagon's official reports are distributed) because Brazil,  instead of having a defense minister as in other countries, has  three military ministers. There are therefore three military  attaches in the Brazilian Embassy in Washington. As the United  States only invites one military representative from each  country, it did not know which of the three Brazilian military  representatives to invite -- because to privilege one branch  could give the impression that the other two were being ignored.  This has been diplomatically settled using the seniority  criteria: the most senior military representative will represent  Brazil.    General McCaffrey will be welcomed in Brasilia by General  Geise Ferrari, commander of the Army's land operations.</p>

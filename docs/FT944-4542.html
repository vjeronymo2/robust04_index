			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Referendum for Quebec planned Mr Jacques Parizeau, Quebec's premier and head of the separatist Parti Quebecois, says he will ask voters in next year's referendum to vote yes or no to Quebec becoming a sovereign state in economic association with Canada, Robert Gibbens writes from Montreal. Mr Parizeau's government on Tuesday introduced a draft bill in the National Assembly in Quebec City outlining the deal it says it will negotiate with the federal government. The bill says Quebec is a sovereign country and it intends to remain in economic association with Canada, keeping the same boundaries as now and retaining the Canadian dollar. It would fully accept all international obligations and its legal and public pension systems would remain mainly unchanged, the bill said. The laws of Canada would continue to apply until well after the referendum and negotiations with Ottawa are under way.</p>

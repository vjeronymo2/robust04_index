The final EIS and Record of Decision were released in March 1994 (Notice of Availability date is March 25, 1994, 59 FR 14162). After a lighting storm in July 1994, a fire began in the Copper Butte area. This fire burned over 133 acres of prepared timber sale harvest units in the East Curlew Creek Area timber sales while damaging or killing timber within a 10,670 acre area. The area damaged by fire is partially within and adjacent to the original analysis area. This significant new circumstance has dictated substantial changes that must be reanalyzed as a supplement to the existing analysis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Submit written comments and questions about this Supplement to Republic Ranger District, Colville National Forest, 180 North Jefferson, P.O. Box 468, Republic, Washington 99166, Phone: (509) 775&hyph;3305. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Pat Egan, Republic District Ranger, Colville National Forest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The original decision was to have two timber sales_Alec Timber Sale and Santim Timber Sale. The Alec Timber sale was to harvest 3.8 million board feet (MMBF) of timber from approximately 771 acres without any road construction. The Santim Timber Sale was to harvest 4.2 MMBF of timber from approximately 754 acres while constructing 2.3 miles of road. The original analysis area was approximately 29,600 acres and included a portion of the Profanity Roadless Area which was considered, but not selected for Wilderness designation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 27, 1994, the Regional Forester signed a Decision Notice for the Continuation of the Interim Management Direction Establishing Riparian, Ecosystem and Wildlife Standards for Timber Sales (also known as screening direction). These Interim Direction changes were made to the East Curlew Area Timber Sales Record of Decision to conform to this Interim Direction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The July fire and Regional Interim Direction have resulted in new circumstances and substantial changes to the original decision for East Curlew Creek Area Timber Sales. The proposed action begin considered in this Supplement is as follows: (1) A Copper Salvage Sale, which would harvest approximately 5.0 MMBF from 750 acres with no road construction, (2) Santim Timber Sale, which would harvest approximately 2.6 MMBF from 346 acres with no road construction; and (3) no change in the Alec timber sale. No road construction is planned within the Profanity Roadless Area. The draft Supplement will be tiered to the final EIS for the Colville National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (December, 1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Supplement will be prepared, circulated and filed in the same fashion (exclusive of scoping), as a draft and final environmental statement (40 CFR 1502.9). The draft Supplement is expected to be filed in January 1995 and available for public comment and review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment period on the draft Supplement to the final EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability appears in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of a draft Supplement to final EIS must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 435 U.S. 519, 533 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft Supplement stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final Supplement may be waived or dismissed by the courts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Angoon  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 803 F.2d. 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final Supplement to the final EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft Supplement to the final EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft Supplement, comments may also address the adequacy of the draft Supplement to the final EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewer may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environment Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the 45 day comment period ends on the draft Supplement to the final EIS, the comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in preparing the final Supplement to the final EIS. The final Supplement is scheduled to be completed by March 1995. In the final Supplement to the Final EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond to the comments received (40 CFR 1503.4). Edward L. Schultz, Forest Supervisor, Responsible Official will consider the comments, responses, environmental consequences discussed in the Supplement to the EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies in making a decision regarding this proposal. The Responsible Official will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to review under 36 CFR 215. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Edward L.

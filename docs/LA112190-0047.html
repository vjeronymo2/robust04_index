			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: GUARDIAN OF THE KING'S ENGLISH SLAPS GRAMMAR INTO THE  GUILTY  </P> <P> R. Peter Mitchell of La Jolla heard Tina Turner hawking Chryslers on television  by saying something about "who said you don't get no respect?"  </P> <P> He gave Chrysler Corp. a SLAP.  </P> <P> He read about the Disney movie "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." SLAP.  </P> <P> He heard McDonald's doing a commercial tie-in with "Honey . . . " SLAP. (And  one to San Diego's Joan Kroc, too).  </P> <P> He heard a San Diego car dealer say "it don't make no difference." And he read  a headline in the San Diego County Edition of The Times: "Geography Teacher  Shows Where It's At."  </P> <P> SLAP. SLAP.  </P> <P> Mitchell, 69, a retired mechanical engineer from General Dynamics/Convair, is  the guiding spirit of Stop Lingual Abuse, Please.  </P> <P> When he hears or sees a particularly egregious violation of the mother tongue,  he dashes off a ("Yours for better grammar.") letter awarding the perpetrator a  SLAP.  </P> <P> He does not see himself as some linguistic Pecksniff mercilessly policing even  minor infractions. He accepts an occasional bit of pronoun confusion or  subject-verb disagreement.  </P> <P> But he draws the line -- and awards a SLAP -- for errors inflicted as  attention-getters, particularly those that are likely to assault the eyes and  ears of children.  </P> <P> His experience running a stamp and coin shop convinced him that the youth of  America is being rendered unintelligible by poor use of language.  </P> <P> "Many of the children couldn't explain themselves, couldn't phrase questions  and answers correctly," Mitchell said. "We're abusing our children by teaching  them to mimic erroneous speech."  </P> <P> So far, none of the corporate recipients of a SLAP has responded.  </P> <P> Undaunted, Mitchell branched out to give a SLAP to Nabisco for its Jell-O  advertisement suggesting that children eat the slippery stuff with their hands.  </P> <P> "Cultural abuse," he explained.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeking a Steady Income  </P> <P> Money everywhere.  </P> <P> * Return to sender.  </P> <P> A scamster snatched a U.S. Mail deposit box, painted it silver, and plunked it  down in front of the Great American Bank in Lemon Grove.  </P> <P> Plus a sign saying the bank's night-deposit slot is broken so just put your  money in here.  </P> <P> But, before the scamster could return to reap his ill-gotten gains, the box  drew the attention of a sharp-eyed cop.  </P> <P> Two deposits have now been returned to their rightful owners. Postal  inspectors, unamused at the misuse of federal property, are on the case.  </P> <P> * The check is in the mail.  </P> <P> Refunds are arriving for people who put down a $50 deposit last year toward  season tickets when, and if, former Harlem Globetrotter Mannie Jackson could  get a National Basketball Assn. franchise for San Diego.  </P> <P> The dream died quietly. No letter, no explanation, just the check.  </P> <P> * Read my lips.  </P> <P> Among the attorneys suing Milli Vanilli is San Diego's class-action specialist  William S. Lerach, whose past targets include SDG&amp;E, Imperial Savings &amp;  Loan, Rancho Bernardo's Oak Industries and assorted high tech firms.  </P> <P> Lerach alleges that the "vocal non-performance" of Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan  inflicted pain and suffering on millions of duped teen-agers and subteens.  </P> <P> He wants all profits from Milli's albums and concerts seized.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coast-to-Coast Unity  </P> <P> It's news to me.  </P> <P> * To show solidarity with strikers at the New York Daily News, members of the  San Diego Newspaper Guild picketed Tuesday outside the (Escondido)  Times-Advocate.  </P> <P> The tie: both the T-A and Daily News are owned by the Chicago Tribune.  </P> <P> * Kate Callen is resigning as United Press International bureau chief in San  Diego to head the public information office at the University of San Diego.  </P> <P> She leaves just as the struggling wire service imposes a 30% pay cut.  </P></p>

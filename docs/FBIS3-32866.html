			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Luis Miro Quesada G.: "Cover-Up Also a Crime"] </F>   [Text] A reading of the well-documented report written by  Ernesto de la Jara Basombrio and published by IDEELE magazine,  on events that began on the fateful morning of 18 July 1992,  when nine students and a professor at La Cantuta University were  kidnapped, and later murdered, cannot but leave the reader  stricken as deeply by the savagery of the murders and treatment  of the remains as by the significance of the ensuing acts of  suppression, of dilatory judicial proceedings, of obstructive  tactics, and finally, even of cover-up of such a despicable  crime, at the military, judicial, and political levels. The  following is based on information taken from the IDEELE article.    The events having taken place as they did, it was obvious,  as  the CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] Committee's report  later indicated, that the raid had been of a paramilitary  nature. The university campus was guarded by the military and  was under curfew at the time. And the raid itself--the type of  weapons used, the silencers, the subordination of the military  personnel stationed there, the secrecy of identities, the  existence of a previously prepared list, etc.--all indicated  this to be the case. Instead of launching an investigation, the  military authorities limited themselves to denying the  detentions. For months, while the victims' families fought to no  avail in the courts--in a quest for justice, as we will see  further on--the military command took no action in the matter  until April 1993 when, as a result of an anonymous document  received by Congressman Pease and read by him on the floor of  the Congress, it agreed to appoint an investigating committee.    According to the anonymous document, Vladimiro Montesino is  said to have coordinated the carrying out of the raid designated  "Kidnap," with the participation of the chief of the  Intelligence Directorate and the chief of the Special Forces  Division, both of whom, in turn, allegedly coordinated the  operation with the commanding officer of the siege of La  Cantuta, and with the commanding officer of Headquarters  Battalion 19. The document alleges that the Army Commander in  Chief was informed, and that he ordered that no mistakes be  made. "The document certainly did not constitute proof of  anything, but it definitely pointed to allegations requiring  investigation." In view of this, the Investigating Committee  summoned General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza to testify on the  subject. The high military official twice postponed his  testimony, and during the intervening days, in consideration of  two disclosures on his part, a judicial proceeding was  instituted within the military jurisdiction, that thus far, nine  months later, has served more to stifle justice than to shed  light on the facts.    The chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff declined to testify  before the Committee because the case was before the Supreme  Council of Military Justice and, according to this Council, "no  authority may take over cases pending before the mentioned  military jurisdictional body, nor interfere in the exercise of  its functions." As is public knowledge, General Hermoza Rios  stated that it was all a political maneuver by left-wing members  of Congress to slander the Army. Then, in a move ostensibly  aimed at intimidation, he ordered the tanks out into the  streets, as high-ranking military officials read a supporting  statement, characterizing Congress's action as "A base attempt  to implicate the Peruvian Army in an alleged violation of human  rights, maliciously using for that purpose spurious documents  forged by a small group of opposition congressmen...."    Thus, naively or maliciously, an investigative proceeding  was  transformed into an incrimination of the Armed Forces; and a  parliamentary investigation was thwarted.    On 29 April, General Robles, a political refugee in the  United States Embassy, issued a public statement in which he  indicated that the La Cantuta crime had been perpetrated by a  special detail of the SIN [National Intelligence Service], in  collaboration with the SIE [Army Intelligence Service], and with  the Intelligence Directorate of the EMGE [Army General Staff].  General Robles detailed the names of officers and subordinates  who had participated; and stated that the mentioned special  detail operated under the orders of Vladimiro Montesino with the  knowledge of the chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.    Serious though the accusation is, equally serious are the  actions that have been taken to silence it. According to  Robles's public statement, when he learned of these occurrences  of utmost gravity, he requested a talk with General Jose Picon  Alcalde, president of the Military Tribunal, informed him of  what he had learned, and urged that the Tribunal proceed  accordingly. The answer was: "Look, friend, the General  Inspectorate of the Army has concluded that neither the Army nor  any of its members had anything to do with this case....  Therefore, I am going to drag it out until the people forget  about the matter." The allegation is a grave one indeed,  implicating as it does the very president of the Military  Tribunal, but a conversation between two persons is the word of  one against that of the other.    What makes the account credible in this case is the fact  that, the day after, Robles was summoned by General Hermoza  Rios, to receive the Supreme Decision signed that day  transferring him to the IADB [Inter-American Defense Board] to  which post he was to travel most urgently. In this ugly story,  which is seemingly on the verge of being substantiated, there  is, concerning the La Cantuta affair, an accusation and an  attempt at silencing.    With the discovery of the graves at Cieneguilla and  Huachipa,  the affair acquired so much notoriety that the chief of the 16th  Provincial Office of the Public Prosecutor, Doctor Victor Cubas  Villanueva, finally instituted proceedings against those whose  names appear in the cited incriminatory documents, and, having  requested arraignment of the detained officers, summoned them to  appear in court. They have not appeared, in contempt of the  writ, and the Supreme Council of Military Justice has instituted  a conflict of jurisdiction proceeding, that if settled in its  favor would make it very difficult, in view of the history of  this case thus far, to arrive at a total clarification of the  events, and full punishment of those responsible.    The intent to not investigate has been no less evident at  the  judicial level. The writ of Habeas Corpus filed by the president  of La Cantuta University at the end of July, was declared  contrary to law for lack of substantiating evidence. The Habeas  Corpus filed by the mother of one of the victims, after being  bounced back and forth, was declared contrary to law, with the  incredible argument that "the material kidnapping of the 10  persons was not proven." Finally, the 6th Criminal Branch of the  Court confirmed the ruling denying the Habeas Corpus, with the  equally incredible argument that "neither has the physical  existence of the citizens been verified."    The Public Prosecutor's Office, because of the university  president's report, knew of the case as of 1 August, but there  as well, action to investigate and prefer charges was delayed.  And in the end, that office instituted no proceedings whatever,  opting for disqualifying itself and forwarding the matter to the  Superior Council of Military Justice, notwithstanding the  existence of a record that the 8th District Public Prosecutor's  Office had reported to the nation's Attorney General that it was  clear that the high command of the Peruvian Army "are  concealing" the said information.    And procrastinations and postponements continue. Instead of  ruling on the question of the courts' jurisdictions submitted to  him by Judge Flores Chacon, Public Prosecutor Cubas Villanueva  is contending that he cannot rule until the question of that  judge's recusation is resolved; as if judicial rulings on the  jurisdictions of the courts depended upon this or that person.    At the political level, in government circles, the same line  of conduct has been followed for many months: that of acting not  to clarify the facts, but on the contrary to impede their  clarification. The best proof of this is that, in the face of  determined pressure by the CCD's Investigating Committee to  obtain the testimony of the implicated military personnel, the  CCD opted to approve, by majority vote, the opposing motion,  which provided that the military personnel summoned by the  Committee not be present in person, but be represented by their  chiefs.    Clumsily wrought, this device implemented a policy if not of  cover-up, certainly one of not uncovering the truth. Statements  by the ministers of state and by the president himself have been  purely rhetorical, platitudinous utterances of principle but, de  facto, neither reproving nor intending to correct such an  obvious process of cover-up. A process reaching such extremes as  the contention by Congressmen Sigra and Freundt, in their  minority report as members of the Investigating Committee, that:  "Voluntary disappearance is probable, considering that, from the  information at the disposal of the Committee, it is clear that  there are many cases of persons reported as disappeared who,  later, have been located in other places, to which they have  moved so as not to be identified, and thus engage in terrorist  activities." The remains at Cieneguilla and Huachipa are  accusatory attestations to the contrary.</p>

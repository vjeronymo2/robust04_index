			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / W European new car sales fall by 9 1/2 %: UK the November exception in steepest post-war decline New car sales in west Europe fell by 9.5 per cent in November to 875,000 from 966,000 a year ago, the 11th monthly decline in succession. According to industry estimates new car sales in the first 11 months of the year fell by 14.7 per cent to 10.7m, the steepest decline in the post-war period. Around 1.8m fewer new cars have been sold in west Europe in the 11 months compared to the corresponding period a year ago. The steep decline in sales has plunged much of the industry into loss, as carmakers have been forced to take drastic action to reduce production and cut jobs. The outlook remains depressed for next year, and sales are forecast to stage only a weak recovery. According to the French automobile makers' association, new car sales next year in west Europe will rise by only 0.8 per cent to 11.5m from 11.4m in 1993. New car sales in November were lower than a year ago in 11 of 17 markets across west Europe, with demand growing only in the UK, Scandinavia and Switzerland. In the first 11 months of the year sales were lower than a year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe, with demand growing only in the UK, and marginally in Norway. There were signs last month of the recession easing in some of the large volume markets, however, and demand in the UK is continuing to grow strongly. New car sales in Germany fell by an estimated 17.1 per cent in November compared with the decline of 18.3 per cent in the first 11 months. In Italy sales fell by only 7.8 per cent in November compared with a decline of 21.1 per cent in the first 11 months of the year, while in Spain a decline of 17.1 per cent in November compared with a drop of 24.5 per cent in the first 11 months. The pace of decline in France slowed to a drop of 11.7 per cent year-on-year in November from the decline of 16.7 per cent in the first 11 months. The UK remains the only significant market in west Europe where new car sales are rising - albeit from a depressed level - with an increase year-on-year of 19.4 per cent in November and of 12.6 per cent in the first 11 months. The rate of decline in new car demand across west Europe is expected to accelerate again this month. Demand a year ago was boosted artificially by a series of special factors, which pulled sales ahead from January. Many carmakers were forced to register cars not equipped with catalytic converters ahead of changes in legislation, while sales were also boosted ahead of tax increases in several countries.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                          January-November 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Volume    Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                            (Units) Change (%)  Jan-Nov 93  Jan-Nov 92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET           10,686,000    -14.7       100.0        100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group        1,745,000    -20.1        16.3         17.4  -Volkswagen            1,154,000    -20.5        10.8         11.6  -Audi                    298,000    -23.2         2.8          3.1  -Seat                    246,000    -18.4         2.3          2.4  -Skoda*                   48,000     +5.2         0.4          0.4 General Motors****      1,387,000    -10.9        13.0         12.4  -Opel/Vauxhall         1,334,000    -10.5        12.5         11.9  -Saab**                   38,000    -20.0         0.4          0.4 PSA Peugeot Citroen     1,303,000    -14.1        12.2         12.1  -Peugeot                 788,000    -14.6         7.4          7.4  -Citroen                 516,000    -13.3         4.8          4.8 Ford****                1,242,000    -13.1        11.6         11.4  -Ford Europe           1,231,000    -13.1        11.5         11.3  -Jaguar                   10,000     -1.1         0.1          0.1 Fiat group********      1,191,000    -20.2        11.1         11.9  -Fiat                    894,000    -19.5         8.4          8.9  -Lancia                  168,000    -22.0         1.6          1.7  -Alfa Romeo              117,000    -24.3         1.1          1.2 Renault *****           1,122,000    -15.5        10.5         10.6 Nissan                    375,000     -7.2         3.5          3.2 BMW                       345,000    -16.7         3.2          3.3 Rover***                  334,000    +12.0         3.1          2.4 Mercedes-Benz             325,000    -14.5         3.0          3.0 Toyota                    299,000     -5.2         2.8          2.5 Mazda                     185,000    -26.7         1.7          2.0 Volvo *****               158,000    -15.3         1.5          1.5 Honda***                  151,000     -8.8         1.4          1.3 Mitsubishi                133,000    -12.7         1.2          1.2 Total Japanese          1,312,000    -11.7        12.3         11.9 MARKETS: Germany                 2,972,000    -18.3        27.8         29.0 Italy                   1,757,000    -21.1        16.4         17.8 United Kingdom          1,705,000    +12.6        15.9         12.1 France                  1,570,000    -16.7        14.7         15.1 Spain                     675,000    -24.5         6.3          7.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *         VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ****      Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **        GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab           Automobile. *****     Renault and Volvo are linked through minority           cross-shareholdings. ********  Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari           and Maserati. ***       Honda holds a 20 per cent stake in Rover vehicle operations.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: industry estimates  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

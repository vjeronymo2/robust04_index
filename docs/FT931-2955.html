			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / GE to recapitalise Hungarian group GENERAL ELECTRIC of the US yesterday moved to inject Ft17bn (Pounds 130m) of fresh capital into Tungsram, its troubled Hungarian lighting joint venture, in the wake of losses which wiped out the company's equity. The infusion will take GE's investment in Hungary over Dollars 500m (Pounds 352m) - far more than the US company envisaged when in 1990 it paid Dollars 150m for an initial 50 per cent stake in Tungsram. The decision on recapitalisation was taken at an extraordinary general meeting of the company yesterday. GE, which owns 75 per cent of the group, forced through the recapitalisation against the objections of Hungarian Credit Bank, a state-owned bank, which controls 24.4 per cent of Tungsram's capital. The recapitalisation comes a week after Tungsram announced losses of Ft9bn in 1992, 70 per cent more than the year before. Mr Charles Pieper, chief executive of GE Lighting Europe and Tungsram itself, blamed cost inflation, the strength of the Hungarian currency and restructuring charges. But Hungarian Credit Bank said yesterday that it could not understand the extent of the losses. The bank has hired Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the international accountants, to conduct an independent audit of Tungsram's results. The bank said that it had voted against the GE proposals because it was 'absolutely unhappy' with the value given to its shares in Tungsram. An executive said that the interests of minority shareholders had been neglected. GE for its part described the restatement of Tungsram's capital as 'realistic'. GE said: 'We have lost the equity value of the company.' But both sides agreed that some kind of recapitalisation was essential. GE said that it was necessary to pay down external debts of Dollars 200m and make new investments. Hungarian Credit Bank retains the option of maintaining its shareholding by taking up part of the capital increase. GE said it hoped that the minority shareholders would participate. But Hungarian Credit Bank, which has been hit by large bad loans and is in the process of being privatised, is unlikely to commit further funds to Tungsram, a government official said.

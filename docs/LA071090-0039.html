			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICS / LOUISIANNA LEGISLATURE;  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS CHART THEIR OWN COURSE;  </P> <P> IMAGE TAKES A BEATING, BUT SOME SAY IT'S ALL A SIGN OF A STATEHOUSE ON THE  MEND.  </P> <P> This state's Legislature may be on the wildest ride in its history.  </P> <P> Louisiana, one of the most backward and depressed states in the country, now  finds itself at center stage, due almost completely to the bills introduced in  the Legislature during the last several months.  </P> <P> First, there is the much-talked-about anti-abortion bill, which was passed by  both houses of the Legislature, vetoed by Gov. Buddy Roemer, then passed again  in revised form. The measure is the stiffest in the country and calls for a  prison sentence of up to 10 years for anyone performing an abortion, except in  the case of pregnancies caused by rape or incest, or to save the mother's life.  </P> <P> As an example of how wild things have been, Rep. Carl Gunter -- during debate  on the abortion bill -- went so far as to argue that there may be some merit to  incest.  </P> <P> "When I got to thinking, the way we get thoroughbred horses and thoroughbred  dogs is through inbreeding," he said. "Maybe we would get a super-sharp kid."  </P> <P> Then there is the matter of the flag burning measure. This one sought to change  the law so that anyone found guilty of beating up a flag burner could be fined  no more than $25. It was dropped at the last minute as the Legislature raced  the abortion bill through.  </P> <P> A third piece of legislation was a bill introduced by  klansman-turned-legislator David Duke that would have weakened the state's  affirmative action statutes. Another bill, passed last week, created the  strictist anti-obscenity record-labeling law in the country.  </P> <P> The Atlanta Constitution, in a recent editorial, suggested the state "appears  to be doing just about everything possible to cultivate a reputation for being  racist, sexist, backward and oppressive."  </P> <P> Not the best of images for this state, already crippled by the oil bust and  known as a place that has for generations tolerated corruption as a way of  life. The Legislature's actions have brought on threats of boycotts and  convention cancellations from a number of quarters and has apparently damaged  New Orleans' chances of wooing the 1992 Democratic National Convention.  </P> <P> There may, however, be a plausible explanation for this chaotic scene. Some  observers here argue that the state's lawmaking body is merely in the midst of  growing pains. "We are in the process of transition from a banana republic to  an infant democracy," said political analyst and publisher John Maginnis. "I  would take a situation like this over one in which the governor controls  everything.  </P> <P> For decades, Louisiana's governor ran the state like a feudal lord, passing out  favors in exchange for loyalty. All that changed with the election of the  reform-minded Roemer, whose no-nonsense personality grated on legislators  accustomed to the backslapping ways of the past.  </P> <P> In addition, Roemer tried to order them around when he had little by way of  patronage to hand out. As a result, lawmakers long accustomed to doing what  they were told began striking back, sometimes in ways that seemed odd to  outsiders. Add to that mixture the election of Duke last year from a white New  Orleans suburb.  </P> <P> "Some crazy things started to happen," said state Rep. Mitch Landrieux. Some of  them, however, are not as peculiar as they might first appear.  </P> <P> In the abortion issue, Landrieux and others contend that Louisiana, with its  large Roman Catholic population, is a natural place for the passage of such a  strict measure.  </P> <P> Duke's affirmative action bill passed the House only because the vote came  immediately after a bloc of black representatives withdrew their support for a  state lottery, thus enraging white lawmakers. The bill was dead on arrival in  the Senate. Despite the attention accorded him, Duke has yet to have a bill he  introduced signed into law.  </P> <P> Maginnis makes the case that while things may still be bad in Louisiana, they  are not nearly as bad as they were before Roemer took office nearly three years  ago. While legislators may look somewhat foolish at times, the word "corrupt"  is no longer the adjective of choice to describe the state.  </P> <P> "At least now when our politicians make the national news, it's for something  they did wide out in the open," he said.  </P></p>

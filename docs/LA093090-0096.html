			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PROGRESSIVE DUTCH PRISONS TRY HUMANE PUNISHMENT  </P> <P> A brightly painted blue door opens, revealing a clean, narrow room with a bed  along one wall. A radio is fixed into the opposite wall above bookshelves and  there is a toilet in the corner.  </P> <P> Sunshine streams through a window, which has no bars even though the room is a  cell. The room houses one of 230 inmates at a remand prison in this town west  of Amsterdam.  </P> <P> "People go to prison as a punishment, but we try to ensure that being here  doesn't cause any more harm than is necessary," prison warden John van Putten  said.  </P> <P> Built in the last century, "De Koepel" (The Dome) -- the name comes from its  distinctive glass roof -- has just been refurbished for $20 million with work  and recreation areas updated and visiting rooms improved.  </P> <P> It typifies the relaxed Dutch penal system, which guarantees each prisoner his  own cell -- for which he can rent a television and where perks can include  private conjugal visits.  </P> <P> The Justice Ministry puts the prison population at just 7,000, out of nearly 15  million people in the Netherlands. That is less than half the number per capita  of Belgium, France and Britain.  </P> <P> De Koepel, near Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, houses inmates from up to 50  nationalities. They include many drug couriers who were attracted by the  country's renowned liberal approach to drugs.  </P> <P> Possession of soft drugs has effectively been decriminalized in the Netherlands  but cocaine and heroin smugglers face lengthy jail sentences if caught.  </P> <P> Van Putten estimates that some 40% of his prisoners are dependent on hard  drugs.  </P> <P> "Drugs are a growing problem and it also cannot be denied that prisoners are  getting more violent, but compared to other countries we can't really  complain," he said.  </P> <P> Like many of his colleagues, he is loath to contemplate a stricter regime for  violent inmates.  </P> <P> "Why punish everybody for one bad apple? If you make things tougher, you only  create a vicious circle of violence," he said.  </P> <P> De Koepel's inmates are free to dress as they please and can spend large chunks  of the day out of their cells.  </P> <P> "Prisoners can work a half day. If they don't want to work, they stay in their  cells. It's up to them," Van Putten said.  </P> <P> In the afternoons they choose from activities including sports, educational  courses or painting and pottery courses.  </P> <P> The system is not cheap. It can cost more than $115 a day to keep a prisoner,  and the ratio of staff to inmates is high.  </P> <P> Van Putten's total staff of 160 includes 100 guards. He emphasizes the care  taken to select and train guards.  </P> <P> "If we want to hire people, we have an open day and they come and talk to me  and other officers. In the end, out of 100 applicants, we maybe end up taking  three," he said.  </P> <P> Young recruits are given time off to study alongside nurses and care workers  for a professional qualification.  </P> <P> Van Putten also avoids over-reliance on young officers.  </P> <P> "With young men you tend to create a macho culture," he said. "If you hire  older people who've worked elsewhere, then maybe the prisoners look up to them  more."  </P> <P> Communication is seen as vital, with inmates represented on committees to raise  complaints with prison authorities.  </P> <P> Van Putten sees a lack of communication as one of the main failings in other  penal systems, such as in Britain, where earlier this year there were riots at  Manchester's Strangeways prison and inmate protests at several others.  </P> <P> "I spent a day in Strangeways and saw prisoners cleaning a wing. The warders  didn't speak to them all day," he said.  </P> <P> Van Putten also said he believes prison disturbances are symptomatic of a  violent strain in British society, which has also spawned race riots and soccer  hooliganism over the last decade.  </P> <P> For him the Dutch approach is vastly preferable, although he remains doubtful  about the chances of prison improving people.  </P> <P> "If you believe we are here to improve people, then I think we fail," he said.  "But if people want to improve, they have the chance."  </P></p>

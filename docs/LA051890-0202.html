			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> LARRY CSONKA TRIES TO ORGANIZE A NEW UNION FOR NFL PLAYERS  </P> <P> Hall of Fame running back Larry Csonka is trying to organize a new union for  NFL players and part of his platform is a promise of a collective bargaining  agreement within 90 days.  </P> <P> NFL players have been without a contract since a five-year agreement expired in  1987.  </P> <P> The NFL Players Assn., involved in a number of lawsuits against management,  decertified as a union last November.  </P> <P> "I believe the climate is right for the players to get a contract now," said  Csonka, who has mailed authorization cards to the players.  </P> <P> Csonka sent a three-page letter to the players, emphasizing mistakes he  believes the Players Assn. has made. "With decertification, the NFLPA is  totally powerless to negotiate a new contract," the letter said. "Therefore,  you have no say in your wages or working conditions."  </P> <P> The letter urges the players to sign union authorization cards that are  included in the packets Csonka sent out. He promises a contract within 90 days.  </P> <P> Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFLPA, predicted that the effort would  fail as at least two other organizing efforts have since 1987.  </P> <P> "The players aren't that stupid," Upshaw said. "They understand what's going  on. The players realize that salaries are going up, that they took in 60% of  the gross revenues last year. The lawsuit we filed forced the Plan B (free  agency) move and the players now realize what free agency can mean."  </P></p>

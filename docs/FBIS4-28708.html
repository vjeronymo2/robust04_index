			<p>BFN     [Text] Mrs. Mutsuko Miki, widow of the late former Prime  Minister Takeo Miki, will visit the DPRK (North Korea) on a  week-long stay. She is one of the women who have called for the  establishment of a Japan-ROK-DPRK women's organization called  "Peace in Asia and the Role of Women" which holds seminars to  discuss such issues as the resolution of the conflict between  the ROK and the DPRK and Japan's postwar settlements. When she  attended a seminar held in Pyongyang in 1992, she received a  direct invitation from DPRK President Kim Il-song to visit North  Korea together with her family. She said she accepted the  invitation, in the hope that it might "help contribute to the  promotion of Japan-DPRK exchanges."    In connection with the DPRK nuclear issue, there is a rush  of  visits to the DPRK by Japanese politicians. For example, the  Social Democratic Party of Japan has already sent a delegation,  and House of Representatives members Taku Yamazaki and Yoichi  Tani of the Liberal Democratic Party are scheduled to visit on  14 June. Amid the flurry of political visits, Mrs. Miki said:  "I have been making preparations since late last year. There  are no plans for me to meet government officials (in connection  with the nuclear issue). It is purely a family trip."</p>

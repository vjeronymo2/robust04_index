			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vladimir Malyshev, ITAR-TASS correspondent in  Athens, reports that Yannis Yannikos, the Greek owner of the  PRAVDA newspaper, has denied the statement by its editor in  chief Viktor Linnik alleging that the former organ of the CPSU  Central Committee had allegedly severed relations with him, had  suspended publication, and intends henceforth to rely only on  the support of Russian business circles.    In an interview in the Athens newspaper TA NEA, Yannikos  recalled that PRAVDA INTERNATIONAL, which he heads, possesses 55  percent of the newspaper's shares and does not intend to  cooperate with Russian businessmen.    The Greek Communist publisher said that the newspaper has no  economic problems as he has sufficient funds to continue its  publication. In the view of Yannikos, Linnik's statement does  not reflect the view of the PRAVDA editorial staff, many of whom  oppose the editor.    In Athens it is said that the interview given by the Greek  owner of PRAVDA testifies to the serious split within its  management connected with the newspaper's crisis and the sharp  drop in the number of copies being printed. The local press  recalls in this connection the storm that blew up in 1992 when  the Athens publisher, who was known to few people in the Greek  capital, unexpectedly became the owner of what had once been one  of the most authoritative Russian newspapers. Assumptions were  voiced that the funds used for publishing PRAVDA were certainly  not the personal funds of Yannikos, but rather CPSU money that  had earlier been transferred abroad. He flatly denied this but  was quite unable to explain where he got the millions of dollars  to support this publication.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / West Germany's GDP could fall by 1.5% WEST Germany's GDP could fall by 1.5 per cent in 1993 because of the continuing international recession, a relatively strong D-Mark and persistent high domestic costs, the Cologne-based Institute for German Economy (IW) said yesterday. The report said the current recession could only be overcome if prospects for investment and profits improved and the Bundesbank obtained more room for lowering interest rates. But it warned that unless domestic costs and price pressure are dampened, economic recovery would not begin in 1993. The report came out as figures released by the federal statistics office showed West Germany's wholesale prices in March increasing by 0.2 per cent against the previous month. This follows a similar rise in February and a 0.7 per cent increase in January. In mid-March, West Germany's consumer prices were 0.3 per cent higher than in mid-February, bringing the inflation rate to 4.2 per cent. In east Germany, consumer prices rose in mid-March by 0.2 per cent to 8.8 per cent. In its yearly spring report, the IW said investment in machinery and equipment will fall by 9 per cent in 1993. Only the construction sector shows an upward trend, increasing by another 1 per cent this year. The gloomy forecast was partially offset by brighter prospects in the east where an 'autonomous investment prospect had started.' Real GDP in eastern Germany can be expected to rise by 6.5 per cent in 1993, just slightly less than in 1992, the report said. German state governments had a net financing deficit of DM30.3bn (Pounds 12.4bn) last year, DM12.3bn less than had been foreseen, the German Finance Ministry said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Bonn. Mr Jurgen Echternach, parliamentary state secretary, attributed the better-than-expected result to 'the positive economic development in Germany, which continued far into last year.'</p>

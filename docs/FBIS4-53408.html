			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang mass rally  was held at the Pyongyang indoor stadium today to mark the 14th  anniversary of the heroic Kwangju popular uprising.    It was attended by Pak Song-chol, Politburo member of the  C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and  vice president of the DPRK, Kim Yong-sun, secretary of the C.C.,  the WPK, Chang Chol, vice-premier of the Administration Council,  and other senior officials, 10,000 citizens and Koreans from  abroad.    South Korean students and people rose up in a mass uprising  in Kwangju on May 18, 1980, fought "martial law troops" and  armed themselves with the weapons they wrested from the enemy  and completely controlled and defended Kwangju city for more  than ten days. The heroic resistance involved more than a  million students and citizens.    In his speech at the rally, Kang Hyon-su, member of the  C.C.,  the WPK and chief secretary of the Pyongyang Municipal Party  Committee and chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal People's  Committee, said the Kwangju popular uprising was a just  anti-U.S., anti-fascist democratic resistance of the South  Korean people who turned out against the U.S. imperialists'  colonial rule and the extension of the "Yusin" fascist  dictatorship and for the democratization of society and the  reunification of the country and a mass armed uprising in which  the entire citizens of Kwangju waged a death-defying resistance  in the teeth of fascist violence.    The U.S. imperialists transferred 70,000 puppet troops, 150  tanks and armored vehicles under their command to the military  fascists to put down the uprising.    In some ten days, the South Korean military fascist clique  killed more than 5,000 people and injured 14,000.    "Through the Kwangju popular uprising, the South Korean  people clearly learned that U.S. imperialism is the strangler of  independence and democracy and the chieftain of aggression and  murder and gained at the cost of blood the lesson that no  desires could be realised as long as the U.S. imperialist  aggression forces remain in South Korea," said the speaker.    He said that with the traitor Kim Yong-sam left intact, the  bitter grudges of the Kwangju resistance fighters cannot be  settled and there will be nothing but confrontation and war  between fellow countrymen.    The earnest desire of the participants of the Kwangju  uprising for independence, democracy and reunification must be  realised without fail, he added.    The speaker continued:    "As long as the U.S. Forces remain in South Korea and the  U.S. colonial rule continues, no desire of the South Korean  people can be realised.    "The United States must make a bold decision to withdraw its  aggressor troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea in  accordance with the trend of the times and the demand of our  nation and approach the DPRK-USA talks with a sincere attitude  and position for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula.    "It is our unshakable position to answer dialogue with  dialogue and war with war.    "The United States must clearly see the indomitable will and  stamina of our people and stop the campaign over `nuclear issue'  aimed at stifling Korean-style socialism centred on the masses.    "The United States must accede to our proposal for  establishing a new peace arrangement since the Korean Armistice  Agreement has been reduced to a sheet of paper incapable of  preserving peace on the Korean peninsula and the military  armistice commission cannot perform its mission due to her  illegalities.    "The South Korean students and people must wage a powerful  mass struggle in all areas for the abolition of the `National  Security Law' and other fascist laws and all repressive machines  and courageously fight to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet  regime and establish a genuine independent democratic government  of the people."    Representatives of various social strata also took the  floor.    They all stressed that the South Korean people must  undauntedly wage the anti-U.S. struggle for independence to  terminate the colonial rule of the United States, achieve the  independent and peaceful reunification of the country and  realise what the participants of the Kwangju uprising desired.</p>

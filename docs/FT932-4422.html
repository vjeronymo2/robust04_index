			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Nationwide falls 8.6% to Pounds 184.6m - Staff cuts and closure of 60 estate agency branches cost Pounds 52.6m PRE-TAX profits at Nationwide Building Society, the second biggest society by asset size, fell by 8.6 per cent to Pounds 184.6m in the year to April 4 after it raised provisions for bad debts by 40 per cent to cope with falling house prices. Nationwide raised operating profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 566.5m (Pounds 437.8m) before an exceptional restructuring charge of Pounds 52.6m to finance the closure of 60 estate agency branches and 650 redundancies. It reduced management expenses to Pounds 524.5m (Pounds 539.1m), and cut its ratio of costs to income from 55.2 per cent to 48.1 per cent, not including restructuring costs. Provisions for bad debts rose to Pounds 329.3m (Pounds 235.9m), while assets grew by only 2.6 per cent from Pounds 34.1bn to Pounds 34.9bn. The society's ratio of capital to assets strengthened to 6.6 per cent, against 6.2 per cent last year. The past year has been one of difficulty and upheaval but it has ended with Nationwide in better shape to answer critics who regard the Pounds 35bn-asset society as a lumbering giant that had to focus its efforts to survive in a harsher world. The difficulties of the year encompassed personalities and commercial strength. Two of its most senior directors left during the year, while its ability to raise funds cheaply in wholesale money markets were affected by the downgrading of its short-term debt rating by Standard &amp; Poor's. The society also had to trade through one of the most difficult years in the UK housing market, as house prices in the south continued to fall, and interest rates rose. The result was to push 15 per cent of its borrowers into arrears, and at least 100,000 into holding 'negative equity'. However, Nationwide's results depict a society that has finally managed to reduce its cost:income ratio to a respectable level. It also managed to strengthen its capital ratios without recourse to more than a single issue of Pounds 100bn subordinated debt during the year. 'Lots of people used to see Nationwide as a swimmer who was out of sight of the shore, and some doubted whether it could even swim, but it is a lot closer to dry land now,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS, yesterday. It has made progress by concentrating on internal reforms while adopting more cautious lending policies. Assets hardly rose last year - from Pounds 34.1bn to Pounds 34.9bn. It adopted stricter lending criteria, and increased its net interest margin to 2.43 per cent from 2.21 per cent. At the same time, it cut management expenses by reducing staff and closing 60 estate agency branches. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive, argued that the biggest upheaval in its 730-branch network was now over, but further cuts are likely in central administration. Yet while the society shows signs of recovery, there is still some way to go. Although its ratio of tier 1 capital to assets - calculated by UBS - strengthened to 8.97 per cent compared with 8.38 per cent last year, its pre-tax return on capital fell to 11.9 per cent (12.5 per cent).</p>

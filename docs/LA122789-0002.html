			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: YEAR-END LISTS  </P> <P> ManWatchers on the Prowl: For the first time, the women's group ManWatchers  Inc. voted three females -- actress Michele Pfeiffer, First Lady Barbara Bush  and "Today" co-host Jane Pauley -- to their list of the 10 Most Watchable  People of 1989. Why? Because, said president Suzy Mallery, "looks are much less  important than they used to be; accomplishment, creativity, kindness and  manners count much more." Still, the group knows a hunk when it sees one. Actor  Kevin Costner was called "the man for the '90s," because he is "natural,  comfortably masculine and sexy." Costner was named to the list along with Mel  Gibson, Arsenio Hall, Jack Nicholson, Magic Johnson, Ted Koppel and Morgan  Freeman. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAS MASKS PUT BITE ON BEARDS  </P> <P> Israel's chief rabbi has asked religious Jews to carry scissors so they can  remove their beards to accommodate gas masks if Iraq threatens Israel with  chemical weapons.  </P> <P> Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu ruled that Orthodox Jews need not follow a biblical ban  on shaving beards -- if their lives are in danger. Under Jewish law, saving a  life takes precedence over all other requirements.  </P> <P> Some religious scholars believe the Bible meant for beards to distinguish Jews  from non-Jews. But beards could interfere with the seal of the gas masks that  Israel would issue to defend against an Iraqi poison gas attack.  </P></p>

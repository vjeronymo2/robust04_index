			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Worries over inflation following the release of US economic data checked an advance in stock index futures, although dealers reported a positive tone to the sector, writes Joel Kibazo. A firm opening to trading in the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,260 encouraged early buying, especially from independent, or local, traders. Sporadic demand was also seen from some of the leading institutions in the first half. The contract moved steadily forward and reached a peak for the session of 3,284 in the late morning. At this stage the contract was showing a healthy premium to the underlying cash market and dealers used the opportunity to arbitrage between the two markets. Following a bout of inactivity over the lunchtime period, the contract slipped back after the release of a clutch of US economic indicators, which brought back some fears on inflation. September closed at 3,263, unchanged on the day but at a 13-point premium to cash on turnover of 10,145 lots. Good activity in the FT-SE 100 option boosted volume in the traded options. Total turnover at the close stood at 31,697 lots, of which 18,709 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,525 in the Euro FT-SE option. Pilkington was the busiest stock option with 1,250 contracts transacted.</p>

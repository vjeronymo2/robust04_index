			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TEXAS;  </P> <P> LEGISLATURE PASSES TAX HIKE FOR SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Texas state legislators in Austin moved quickly on a $528-million school  financing compromise, raising the sales tax a quarter-cent and passing other  taxes and fee increases to pay for it.  </P> <P> Increases in taxes on cocktails and tobacco, as well as some state fees, were  passed by both houses and sent to Gov. Bill Clements. Democrats in the  Legislature and the Republican governor agreed on the package last week, after  being deadlocked three months over how to meet a state Supreme Court order that  more money be allocated to schools in low-income districts. The legislation  would add money to a $13.5-billion-a-year school system and raise an extra $100  million for financially strapped social service programs.  </P></p>

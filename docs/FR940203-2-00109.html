Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act); and (2) for fiscal years 1995 through 2002, the Departments plan to fund the initiative under the proposed ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1993,'' which was introduced in Congress on August 5, 1993 as H.R. 2884 and S.1361. The funds will be made available through a grants program. The Department of Education and the Department of Labor are jointly designing and providing for the administration of a State grants program, that consists of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Development Grants, that are currently being awarded to each State for developing a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities plan; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Implementation Grants, as described in this notice, awarded competitively to States that can demonstrate substantial ability to begin full-scale operations and implement the statewide plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretaries have reserved approximately $250,000 in fiscal year 1994 funds appropriated under the Job Training Partnership Act, to assist the Territories in developing and implementing School-to-Work Opportunities systems. Specific information regarding the availability of these funds will be announced at a later date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The efforts that take place under both current authority and the proposed legislation are built on a phased-in approach that allows States to ``come on line'' at different points in time, depending on each State's readiness to undertake broad-scale change and on the availability of funds. Development Grants financed from funds requested by the Department of Labor under the Job Training Partnership Act began to be awarded to States during December, 1993 and are continuing to be awarded in January, 1994 to permit States to begin or enhance planning and developmental efforts to create comprehensive statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each Development Grant discussed above is being awarded for a nine-month period. The Secretaries may make additional Development Grants available subsequent to that period to States that do not receive an Implementation Grant under this competition, if those States demonstrate substantial progress towards developing a comprehensive statewide School-to-Work Opportunities plan and if they demonstrate that Federal funds will be used effectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation Grants Competition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By this notice, the Secretaries are reserving a portion of the funds appropriated under the Perkins Act in fiscal year 1994 for grants to States to implement statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems based on State plans. The Secretaries are also establishing selection criteria to be applied in evaluating applications for those funds. The Secretaries are limiting eligibility for implementation grants to States because the Secretaries have concluded that, for this competition, the purposes of 34 CFR 426.4(b)(2) can best be achieved by awarding grants only to State level applicants. Implementation Grants will be funded for up to a five-year period. The Secretaries anticipate that continuation awards will be funded under the School-to-Work Opportunities legislation, once it is enacted. Although there may be certain differences between requirements under the legislation as eventually enacted and grant requirements under this notice, the Secretaries do not expect these to be fundamental.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grantees under this competition will be required to fund local partnerships to carry out activities under the School-to-Work Opportunities program. The Secretaries intend grantees to fund local partnerships through subgrants, as authorized by the fiscal year 1994 Department of Education Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;112).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

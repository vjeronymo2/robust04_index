			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: CIBA-GEIGY PLANS TO SELL STAKE IN 3D SYSTEMS INC.  </P> <P> Ciba-Geigy, a major Swiss corporation, said it plans to sell its 37% stake in  3D Systems Inc. in Valencia as part of a restructuring program.  </P> <P> Ciba-Geigy bought its interest in 3D Systems in July, 1988, for $30 million. 3D  Systems makes a machine that uses lasers, chemicals and a computer to rapidly  produce models of parts, consumer packages and other products for  manufacturers.  </P> <P> Initially, it appeared that Ciba-Geigy would complement 3D Systems' need for  lasers and chemicals because it also owns Spectra-Physics, a San Jose company  that is the biggest U.S. laser producer. But Ciba-Geigy also announced plans to  sell Spectra-Physics as part of its effort to cut its electronics-related  businesses and focus on chemicals, drugs and agricultural products.  </P></p>

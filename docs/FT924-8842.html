			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hard look in the 'right direction' - Allied-Lyons'quest to squeeze more growth out of its many assets ALLIED-LYONS' decision to sell Chateau Latour, one of the four leading Bordeaux vineyards, reflects the new hard-headed management strategy designed to restore City confidence in the drinks, food, and retailing group, after the Pounds 147m currency trading debacle early last year. Just a year ago, Mr Michael Jackaman, newly-installed as chairman, described Latour as 'the jewel in the crown' of Allied's brands, suffusing the group's entire drinks portfolio with its reputation for quality. But Latour's prestige value has now been weighed against the 3-4 per cent return on the capital tied up in the Medoc estate and found wanting. When the market spotlight turned on Allied after the currency loss, it was widely seen as a group with strong but underperforming assets. It had one of the best-balanced portfolios in the international drinks industry; dominant niche positions in the food industry; a solid base in UK brewing; and large scale retailing operations. Yet since the late 1980s, growth in earnings per share and return on assets had failed to keep pace with the progress of rivals Guinness and Grand Metropolitan. The City looked to the new management team in July last year for a strategy that would improve operating performance and prise more cash out of the business. Mr Jackaman, and Mr Tony Hales, chief executive, promptly set out to achieve those objectives by narrowing the focus of the group's operations, cutting costs and concentrating resources on brands with international growth potential and strong market positions. Eighteen months on, Allied's progress has been sufficiently promising to persuade most industry analysts to predict that the group's profit growth over the next three years will outperform the rest of the drinks sector. Its shares are generally rated a strong hold or buy. Allied has brought new blood into the boardroom - Peter Macfarlane, finance director, from Rolls Royce; and non-executive directors, John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, and Miles Rivett-Carnac, deputy chairman of Barings. The group has been restructured into four divisions to sharpen operational focus: spirits and wine, retailing, brewing and wholesaling, and food manufacturing. In each sector, peripheral businesses have been sold and acquisitions made to strengthen core operations. The biggest changes are taking place in brewing with the Pounds 510m merger of Allied's breweries with Carlsberg's UK lager business. The deal, still awaiting final approval from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after 13 months, will form the third largest brewing group in the UK with a turnover of Pounds 1.1bn and about 18 per cent of the market. When it goes through, the merger will also remove Pounds 135m of debt from Allied's books. The wines and spirits division, which accounts for 50 per cent of group trading profits, has sold one of the founding businesses, Showerings cider and VPW British wine, to a management buy-out group for Pounds 140m, and disposed of several local whisky brands. Allied exchanged its Centenario Spanish brandy business for more shares in Domecq, a joint venture partner which has helped to build its business in Spain and will be important to future growth in Mexico and South America. Acquisition of a 24 per cent stake in Champagne Lanson strengthened the international brands portfolio; and investments have been made in the European distribution network. Retailing in the UK has had to contend with the MMC-enforced disposal of pubs in the midst of a recession. Allied has sold 1,350 pubs and leased another 950, including 734 to Brent Walker. Its tied estate, in which it has invested Pounds 615m in the past four years and which contributed 25 per cent of profits last year, now comprises 4,400 outlets. Acquisitions have extended the Victoria Wine chain to 950 outlets. The expansion of international franchise operations has been driven hard. Dunkin' Donuts now has 2,900 outlets, and Baskin Robbins, with 3,500 ice-cream stores, is building factories in Russia, Korea and Thailand. The food division, accounting for 13 per cent of profits last year, sold Lyons Maid ice-cream in the UK and Sapori confectionery in Italy; but reinforced its bakery and ingredients operations in the US and Europe with add-on acquisitions. Tetley's round teabags have been pushed into more overseas markets. Across the entire group, the search for cost savings and efficiency gains has been vigorously pursued. Last year, Allied's workforce was reduced by 6,000 and operating profit per employee rose 8 per cent. Productivity in the brewing business improved by 9 per cent. All this intense activity has begun to establish a solid platform from which the bid for higher growth can be launched. Marketing expenditure, which last year totalled Pounds 366m, has been increased and is being concentrated behind fewer brands: international spirits such as Ballantine's Scotch whisky, Beefeater gin, and Courvoisier cognac; Tetley tea; Tetley beer and Castlemaine lager; and Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins. Regional councils have been set up to ensure that synergies across the range of businesses are exploited and opportunities for growth identified in world markets. With 57 per cent of its profits earned in the UK, and 23 per cent in North America, Allied is targeting the markets of the Pacific Rim and Central and South America. Extra impetus is being given to its alliances with Suntory and Domecq, and its 48 other joint ventures around the world. Not until hard numbers emerge can the success of the group's aggressive drive be judged; but the market agrees it is going in the right direction. Some industry observers suggest that, if Allied is to maintain long-term momentum, it will have to make significant acquisitions to its spirits and food operations. Allied's cash resources are likely to be tight - 'but if the opportunity for a major acquisition arises,' says Mr Jackaman, 'we shall not be frightened to go and ask our shareholders for the money.'</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CASE THAT KEEPS HAUNTING VAN DE KAMP;  </P> <P> POLITICS: DEUKMEJIAN'S NEXT SUPREME COURT CHOICE COULD BE A PERSON WHO WOULD  REMIND MANY OF AN UNCOMFORTABLE CHAPTER IN ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CAREER.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's choice to replace retiring Justice Marcus M. Kaufman  will not much change the state Supreme Court's conservative direction. It  could, however, prove to be a political embarrassment for a Democrat who wants  to be governor. Deukmejian backs Sen. Pete Wilson, the likely GOP nominee, for  governor.  </P> <P> In the past, Deukmejian has dutifully consulted lists of candidates who failed  to win the nomination of the moment. And, true to form, he says he will  consider three judges who were talked up to replace retiring Justice John  Arguelles earlier this year: state Court of Appeals Justices Patricia D. Benke  of San Diego, Walter Croskey of Los Angeles and Fred W. Marler Jr. of  Sacramento.  </P> <P> But the governor's list includes three new names submitted to the State Bar for  review: Court of Appeals Justices Armand Arabian and Ronald M. George, both of  Los Angeles, and Carl West Anderson of San Francisco. Some court analysts  believe that this trio constitutes the "A" list.  </P> <P> Should Deukmejian choose George, Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, the likely  Democratic gubernatorial nominee, will probably wince. In 1981, George vaulted  into national prominence when he, as a Los Angeles County Superior Court trial  judge, issued a blistering 36-page opinion arguing that "Hillside Strangler"  suspect Angelo Buono be tried on 10 murder charges. In so doing, he dismissed a  petition from then-Los Angeles County District Atty. Van de Kamp, who sought to  drop the charges because of insufficient evidence.  </P> <P> Under pressure, Van de Kamp eventually kicked the case upstairs to then-Atty.  Gen. Deukmejian, whose office tried Buono and convicted him on nine murder  counts. Van de Kamp subsequently admitted that he'd made a mistake in dropping  the charges.  </P> <P> Even before Kaufman announced his retirement plans, political observers  expected Wilson to try to make the Hillside Strangler case a campaign issue. If  Deukmejian taps the judge who, in effect, dressed down Van de Kamp for his  handling of the case, voters can't help but get the point: Van de Kamp's  anti-crime credentials are suspect.  </P> <P> The state Commission on Judicial Appointments, on which Van de Kamp sits, will  vote on Deukmejian's nominee in March, or possibly April, just when the  gubernatorial race will be heating up. If Deukmejian chooses George, Van de  Kamp would be in an awkward political situation: Will he vote to elevate his  former legal nemesis or will he recuse himself? It'll be a big story either  way.  </P> <P> A showdown over who will have the support of women activists in the Democratic  gubernatorial primary looms. What makes it interesting is that one of the  candidates, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, is the first woman  affiliated with a major party seeking the state's top political job.  </P> <P> In a first test, the National Organization for Women's California board found  "no consensus" for an endorsement. That failure, subject to review, represents  a small but important psychological victory for Van de Kamp. The reason is that  Feinstein has targeted women in her stump speeches and direct-mail fund-raising  appeals. Van de Kamp has countered with an impressive list of feminist  endorsements.  </P> <P> But Feinstein has the edge among national feminist leaders. Last month, she  addressed a pro-choice rally in Washington at the invitation of NOW President  Molly Yard and Fund for the Feminist Majority President Eleanor Smeal.  </P> <P> L.A. whispers. Former Rep. Daniel Lungren (R-Long Beach) finally got his reward  for helping President Ronald Reagan get his 1984 comprehensive crime bill  passed. Reagan ended a Century City speech last week touting Wilson for  governor by unexpectedly pushing Lungren's bid for state attorney general. . .  . State agricultural interests weigh their options about launching a November,  1990, "food safety" initiative to counter part of an environmental protection  initiative keying on clean food, clean oceans and clean air -- a cornerstone of  Van de Kamp's campaign.  </P></p>

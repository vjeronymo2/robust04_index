			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Politician" rubric: </F> "Gavriil Popov Content With Government Reshuffle and Ready To  Cooperate With Everyone"]    [Text] Gavriil Popov, leader of the Russian Democratic  Reform Movement, held a news conference devoted to the  movement's upcoming congress. Speaking to journalists, Mr.  Popov analyzed the reasons for the RDRM's failure in the  elections to the Federal Assembly and gave an assessment of the  current political situation.    Mr. Popov believes that the next two years should be devoted  to restoring social stability and drawing up a new economic  reform program. To this end, it is essential to "lend weight to  the parliament" and to let the government work in peace, Popov  said. He expressed his astonishment at the "uproar" raised by  the press over the latest government reshuffles. In the RDRM  leader's opinion, the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov and the  change in economic policy are rather positive developments,  because "it is necessary to clear the country of the extremes of  pro-Western reform," Popov noted.    Analyzing the RDRM's electoral platform, Mr. Popov pointed  to  a number of tactical mistakes made by chiefs of the RDRM  electoral association that caused the movement's fiasco. They  include lengthy, albeit inconclusive talks about setting up a  bloc; an inadequate fund-raising campaign; and a lack of party  structures that could be tasked with performing organizational  work, collecting signatures, and campaigning. This is why the  RDRM, which initially drew support from 6-7 percent of the  voters, did not enter the State Duma.    The RDRM leader expressed his intention to cooperate with  all  politicians and parties that support the stabilization of the  political situation with words and deeds. For the RDRM to be  able to cooperate with "Russia's Choice," however, Yegor Gaydar  and his followers should back away from the "pro-Western reform  model," Popov said.</p>

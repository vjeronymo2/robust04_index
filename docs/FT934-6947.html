			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Italy's political earthquake swallows up the centre ground: Voters take revenge on corrupt politicians; Post-war ruling parties humiliated The spectacular collapse of the Christian Democrats in Sunday's municipal elections has created a huge vacuum in the centre-ground of Italian politics. Local elections have traditionally mirrored closely voter loyalties in general elections in Italy. There is nothing to suggest that Sunday's poll, covering a quarter of the electorate in 428 cities and towns, might be an exception. Voters have swung in almost equal proportions to leftist coalitions and individual right-wing parties. Every party associated with running the country in the post-war era has been humiliated. The outcome, clearly predicted by opinion polls, was scarcely surprising given the discredit heaped on the ruling parties after 18 months of non-stop revelations of monumental political corruption. Indeed, it is remarkable the corruption scandals should have taken so long to eat into traditional electoral habits, especially in the centre and south of Italy. In local elections in June, the Christian Democrats nationwide held on to over 20 per cent of the vote against 29 per cent in the April 1992 general elections. This time the Christian Democrat vote has fallen to around 10 per cent nationwide and it controls no major city administration. Their Socialist allies along with their two other minor partners in the coalition supporting the Ciampi government are close to extinction. The speed of change is perhaps best measured against the minimal fluctuations in party votes in the 30 years up to 1993. The Christian Democrat vote never moved more than six percentage points. Significantly, the polls over the past month have recorded a steady increase in the polarisation of the vote away from the Christian Democrats, and this trend seems to have been accentuated on polling day. On the left, if such ideological labels still carry meaning, the formerly communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) has proved it has both the organisation and the appeal to forge successful alliances up and down the country. The PDS is also reaping the benefit of having been the first of the traditional parties to reform itself, rejecting the Communist Party name in 1991 in favour of a Social Democratic image. The PDS has relied in most cities on linking up with the Green and Radical parties, and sometimes the referendum reformist movement of Mr Mario Segni, as well as dissident Christian Democrats, as in Trieste, and hardline ideological rivals, Reconstructed Communism, as in Taranto. These alliances have been able to muster on average 40 to 45 per cent of the vote. On the right, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi has demonstrated convincingly that it can obtain 30 per cent of the vote throughout the north and be the largest party. The party has also begun to push down towards the centre, doing well in a key city like Genoa - even if the League is unlikely to wrest the prize of the mayor's seat in the December 5 run-off. Because all other parties 'ganged up' against the League, it may not be able to obtain as much municipal power as it would like. Nevertheless, the League should benefit considerably from the new laws for national electoral laws introducing a first past the post system. And although regionally based, it can claim around 20 per cent of the national vote and rivals the PDS for the role of largest national party. Just as the League has benefited from the discrediting of traditional parties in the north, the neo-fascist MSI has proved it can do the same in the centre and south. The MSI has done extraordinarily well in Rome and Naples, gaining over a third of the vote and becoming the largest single party. The MSI has since the fifties been strong in southern Italy, running second or third behind the Christian Democrats and Socialists. But the sudden increase in its support is seen entirely as a protest vote to humble the former Christian Democrat and Socialist potentates. The confused ideas of the MSI, which look with nostalgia to Mussolini for inspiration, have played little role in its new appeal. Quite simply, if voters did not wish to endorse the PDS ticket in cities such as Rome out of visceral mistrust of the communists, the MSI on Sunday was about the only alternative. Moreover, it has not been smeared by corruption, largely one suspects because it has been excluded from power by the traditional parties. If translated into a general election, Sunday's result would cut the share of the vote of the four-party coalition supporting the government from 47 per cent to below 15 per cent. This makes the composition of parliament even more out of tune with electoral opinion and complicates the task of the Ciampi government. It makes early elections inevitable. However, the full impact of the local elections will not be felt until after December 5 when the municipal run-off elections take place. This will be a key test for the PDS to demonstrate as in Turin in June that it can appeal beyond the Left and attract a centre vote. If it can, the party will be well placed to claim to lead the next coalition government - on Sunday's poll there would be no alternative combination. But the collapse of the traditional centre also leaves room for someone like Mr Segni, the former Christian Democrat, to step in and pick up the pieces - and retrieve votes from the MSI and League.</p>

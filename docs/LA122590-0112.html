			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: TES WHITLOCK  </P> <P> School: Loara High  </P> <P> Sport: Basketball  </P> <P> Position: Guard  </P> <P> Class: Senior  </P> <P> Mark Wulfemeyer, Tom Lewis and Cherokee Parks are big names in the history of  Orange County high school basketball, but none of them have broken the county's  80-year-old single-game scoring record, which Whitlock shattered Saturday.  Whitlock scored 68 points -- including 40 in the first half -- in Loara's  112-102 victory over Saddleback in a consolation game in the Irvine World News  Tournament. Whitlock surpassed the record of Art Worthy, who scored 58 points  in a game for Huntington Beach High in 1910. Whitlock, whose previous high was  a 54 points against Los Alamitos last season, is averaging 37.7 points, 8.5  rebounds and 5.5 assists this season. Loara Coach Ed Prange said Whitlock  didn't need to be selfish to break the record. "He could have definitely scored  more, but he was looking for his teammates," Prange said. "He passed up several  shots." Prange continued: "I think the legend will grow and everyone is going  to say, 'I was there.' I've already had two people come to me and say they were  at the game and it was great. But I know they weren't because there were only  30 people in the gym and I knew everyone."  </P> <P> Other top performers:  </P> <P> * Thomas Barraza, who scored 28 points for Western in a 56-48 victory over  Cerritos in the championship of the Fullerton tournament. Barraza averaged 21  points in the three tournament games.  </P> <P> * Brandon Stott, who averaged 26 points in three games and led Brethren  Christian to the championship of the La Sierra Academy tournament. Stott scored  26 Thursday in Brethren's 67-58 victory over Maranatha in the championship  game.  </P> <P> * Mike Tsarnas, who scored two goals for Anaheim in the Colonists' 2-0 victory  over Orange, the No. 1-ranked team in the county, Saturday in the Orange  tournament finals. Tsarnas also scored a goal Wednesday in a 2-0 victory over  La Habra.  </P></p>

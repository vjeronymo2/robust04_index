			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Plan to cut cost of 'pay and file' - Self-assessment for corporation tax This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. THE CHANCELLOR unveiled proposals for reducing the cost to companies of taking part in the government's new 'Pay and File' system of self-assessment for corporation tax - which comes into force in October. The Inland Revenue said the most important change was to allow companies to authorise people other than their company secretaries to sign documents for tax purposes. Other changes relate to the transitional periods which straddle the changeover date from the old system; the circumstances in which claims to relief may be made by members of groups; and the payment of interest or repayment supplement where losses or advance corporation tax are carried back to earlier years. The penalty for failing to give notice of chargeability under Pay and File is based on the amount of corporation tax unpaid after giving credit for income tax deducted at source. The credit is to be limited to the income tax which can be set off against the corporation tax liability and will exclude other income tax payable. Additional claims to reliefs may be submitted in certain circumstances where assessments are made outside the normal time limits for such claims. This is to be extended to include assessments which are made to recover excess group relief under Pay and File. The rules for making returns which apply to periods of account before Pay and File is introduced are to be adjusted so that they do not inadvertently prevent the Revenue from raising an assessment or collecting tax until after the normal due date for the accounting period. The rules for carrying back losses which do more than simply discharge part of a Corporation Tax liability but result in a reworking of charges or set-offs in the computation are to be adjusted to ensure that interest is charged on the original liability up to the due date for the later period in which the set-off or loss arose. The rules for charging an automatic penalty if a company fails to deliver a return within 18 months of the end of the return period are to be adjusted to ensure that a penalty will not arise unless there has been a failure to submit a return, but that a tax-geared penalty will always be due when there has been a failure.' The Revenue said a number of representative bodies had expressed concern about the signature of returns and other documents required from companies under the Taxes Acts. It proposes 'to allow companies to act through any authorised person, except where the company is in liquidation in which case the company will, as now, be able to act only through the liquidator.</p>

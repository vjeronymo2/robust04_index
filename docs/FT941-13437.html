			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Lira crisis leaves Ciller's policies in tatters: How the collapse of the Turkish currency has undermined the PM's low interest rate strategy Turkey's currency crisis intensified yesterday as the lira slipped further on the foreign exchanges. It fell to 17,900 to the US dollar, a drop of 4 per cent since Monday's close. Yesterday's fall followed a run on the currency last week and was another rebuff to the government of Mrs Tansu Ciller. Since she came to office last summer, Mrs Ciller has been driven by an unorthodox belief that lower interest rates were the cure for the country's ills. Lower rates, she argued, would result in lower debt servicing costs, a lower budget deficit and thus lower inflation. The policy is today in tatters with the central bank having been forced to raise inter-bank rates, as high as 200 per cent at one point, to restore confidence in the lira. The initial trigger for currency crisis that began last week was the announcement that US rating agencies - Moodys and Standard &amp; Poor's - were downgrading Turkey's credit rating. Seeking a rating was always going to be a double-edged sword. It presupposed that Turkey would, if not improve on, at least maintain its current economic performance. That has not happened. Turkey's public finances are in a shambles. Privatisation has been blocked by political and legal wrangling. The public sector deficit is expected to have been about 16 per cent of gross national product in 1993. The target for 1994, at 14 per cent, is hardly more encouraging. For Mrs Ciller and her technocrats the whole episode has been a salutary reminder that after a decade of reform, the Turkish economy is that much more vulnerable to policy error. A faster depreciation of the lira may help the trade account, by making exports more competitive. But the resulting increase in import costs will fuel inflation. Turkey is in the midst of an import-led consumer boom, with the economy growing by close to 8 per cent in 1993. As a result the deficit on the current account for 1993 reached close to Dollars 5bn and is officially projected at Dollars 4.4bn in the current year. It is against such a fragile background that the currency crisis has occurred. Heavy central bank advances to the Treasury coupled with the recent salary pay-out to civil servants created an excess of lira in the market last week. Traders also reported tight supplies of foreign exchange when tourist receipts and workers remittances traditionally slow down. Another contributing factor is that many Turks now choose to keep their savings in hard currency accounts, a measure of just how far Turkey's 70 per cent inflation rate has taken its toll. In the end, what might have started as a minor shake, became a full-scale currency quake. The immediate fall-out is hard to gauge. The international banks that lend to Turkey will be looking for reassurances that it can continue to service its foreign debt. After record borrowings in 1993, Turkey's external public and private debt, already Dollars 59bn by the end of September, is estimated to have reached Treasury, needing at least Dollars 2bn just to refinance existing debt, is expected to seek an early return to the Samurai market, the Japanese bond market for foreign issuers, perhaps next month, in order to re-establish its presence in the market. Paradoxically, the foray into international debt markets had been one of the successes of 1993, with the Treasury skilfully tapping the international appetite for Turkish paper. As one Japanese banker put it, 'Turkey is a little like Yugoslavia used to be - high risk, offering a good yield, and (on top of that it is) an OECD member.' Moreover the availability of foreign debt enabled the government to restructure its domestic borrowings. It managed to reduce the amounts borrowed as well as extending the maturities. One western economist estimated that Turkey may have saved as much as Dollars 1bn in 1993 by shifting its domestic borrowing strategy from short-term to longer-term issues. For this reason, Moody's and S&amp;P's decision is that much more critical. In the short term, the higher than projected domestic interest rates will add to the budget deficit. Higher borrowing costs will stifle private sector investment at a time when Turkish firms need to prepare themselves for the competition which will follow on Turkey's completion of a customs union with the European Union, now set for 1995. The central bank has so far declined to issue any instruction to the private banks. However, some economists believe another, perhaps more dramatic, one-way currency movement could precipitate a full-scale foreign exchange crisis. They point out the banking sector's overall short position - the difference between banks' foreign exchange liabilities and domestic lira assets - is close to Dollars 6bn. In the end, what happens will depend as much on political as economic developments with all the parties now eyeing the outcome of the forthcoming municipal elections. And as one Turkish observer pointed out, the recent interest rate rise will have been particularly severe for the small traders and artisans, who traditionally have supported Mrs Ciller's True Path party DYP.</p>

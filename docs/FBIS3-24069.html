Kosterev, first deputy chairman of the </F> Primorgeolkom (Maritime Kray Geological Committee): "Stores of  Mineral Resources Are Being Depleted Rapidly; Geological Service  Today Is on the Brink of Collapse; Urgent Measures Are Needed To  Retain Highly Qualified Personnel"]    [Text] Does Russia need a geological service? This question  is being asked more and more often by specialists who have  dedicated their entire life to a difficult profession. The  economic crisis has dealt a powerful blow to very important  industries. But only time-servers can be indifferent to the  curtailment in prospecting work. Because geology is fundamental  to the mineral-raw material base of any industrial power.  Therefore, it has always enjoyed the support of the state.    Let us look at history. In the period of the origin of  capitalism in Russia, the tsarist government organized a central  geological institution--the Geological Committee--to supply  developing industry with mineral raw materials. The committee  was instructed to conduct general geological study of the  territory all the way to the Pacific Ocean. The work of the  Geolkom [Geological Committee] was participated in by prominent  geologist-scientists A.P. Karpinskiy and V.A. Obruchev, and E.E.  Anert, a mineral prospector of the Far East, especially Maritime  Kray. By 1914 the principles of knowledge of the geological  structure of Russia had been laid and many deposits of mineral  resources discovered.    After the civil war, in order to restore the destroyed  economy, once again it was mineral fuels (coal, peat, oil) that  were needed most of all, but also iron, nonferrous metals, and  precious metals. Life raised the question of creating a  multicomponent mineral-raw material base for the country. But  there were not enough specialists. Geological VUZ's [higher  educational institutions] and faculties began to be established  in many cities of Russia, including Vladivostok.    The network of industrial geological organizations was  expanding. Numerous trusts were established in place of the  geological committee. One of them appeared in Vladivostok. As a  result, in two decades of development of geological work, the  powerful mineral-raw materials base of the Soviet Union was  established. It provided the industry of our country with all  that was necessary by the start of the Great Patriotic War.    During the war years geological exploration, although cut  back, did not stop. Many specialists, despite the enormous human  losses at the front, were not drafted into the regular army for  the sake of new discoveries of minerals. Immediately after the  war prospecting work began to gather even more steam--especially  in Siberia and the Far East.    Practically in the postwar period a mineral base was created  in the Far East and Transbaykal region for the mining of tin,  tungsten, polymetals, fluor-spar, boron, uranium, rare metals,  gold, and building materials. On the whole in the country  thousands of deposits of minerals needed by industry and  agriculture were discovered and prospected.    But only dilettantes could have been complacent when they  decided that the large backlog of stores of all minerals was  more than they could cope with and, consequently, searches and  prospecting for new deposits could be cut back for many years  (or entirely stopped). It must not be forgotten that after the  October Revolution we used discoveries acquired at the end of  the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. At the present  time we are using the results of geological prospecting of  recent decades.    It must be remembered that mineral resources are not  limitless and that they are being irretrievably depleted. New  discoveries of deposits are being made more and more frequently  at great depths and in sparsely populated rayons. Often decades  are spent prospecting and assimilating deposits. It is necessary  to know that approximately 75 percent of the raw materials for  the national economy are taken from the earth's depths. That is  why it is necessary to have systematic and continuous production  of all types of geological prospecting operations. It should not  be forgotten that with the dissolution of the Union, Russia was  left without chromium, manganese, uranium, and titanium. The  current generation is obliged to create a mineral-raw material  reserve in mineral resources for subsequent generations, as was  done for us by our fathers and grandfathers.    Central television recently reported the information that  revealed reserves of gold in the interior of Russia were enough  for 35 years of exploitation. As a specialist, I will say  something else--gold-mining will come to a halt within three to  five years if gold prospecting operations are stopped.    Nevertheless, Russia's powerful geological service has been  virtually destroyed. At the present time about 10 percent of the  volume of work it had 10 years ago remains. Hundreds of  qualified geologists, drilling technicians, and geophysicists in  Maritime Kray, like in all of Russia, are being forced to look  for other work.    A further reduction is expected this year in centralized  appropriations. The state is planning to finance geological work  in a small volume on the scale of 1:200000, monitoring of the  geological environment, and predicting earthquakes. A geological  service is being established for this.    It is planned to conduct search and prospecting for deposits  at the expense of the resources of the mineral users. At the  present time a federal tax is collected from enterprises that  are exploiting deposits for supplying the mineral-raw material  base. More specifically, for the conduct of geological  prospecting work. In the next year or two this tax will in all  probability be eliminated, which will lead to a further cut in  the volume of exploring and prospecting for minerals.    We are already planning not to go into the field this year.  Available resources are being directed at curtailing and  eliminating labor collectives of geological prospectors. The  state has practically abandoned financing the geology industry.  Therefore, several ways of reorganizing state geological  organizations in the future are being examined: The shift of  former expeditions to the staff of mining enterprises, the  establishment of integrated geological exploitation enterprises,  fully reprofiled geological organizations, or their elimination.  The remaining enterprises will be converted into joint-stock  companies and privatized.    But geological personnel will be cut under any  reorganization. The mining enterprises of Russia that need the  work of geologists cannot finance them in full measure, because  they themselves are living through great difficulties. Even gold  mining has been reduced.    Counting on foreign investments in the Russian mining  industry is very illusory. After all, the world mineral raw  material market was formed without taking the potential of the  former USSR and Russia into account, and is saturated with raw  materials at the present time, as indicated by the continuous  drop in prices. Only diamonds, gold, oil, and gas are enjoying  increased demand.    In addition, many foreign deposits surpass ours in quality  of  ores and mining conditions for geological exploitation. The cost  of the development of a number of deposits in Russia is more  expensive than in countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  Foreign investors are also frightened off by our economic  disarray and political instability.    Inasmuch as Russian, including Maritime, geologists have  high  qualifications and a lot of practical experience, they could  work effectively in any foreign country. In previous years  Soviet geologists (including Maritime geologists) were used  successfully in dozens of countries of the world and on all  continents except Australia.    Under conditions of a developing market, geology in Russia  has been placed in a situation of having to fight for its own  survival. That is, not waiting for encouraging decisions and  handouts from the top, but determining its own fate  independently. The main thing for us now is to preserve the  qualified pool of personnel. For we have no doubt: The country's  need to intensify geological work will rise in the next few  years.</p>

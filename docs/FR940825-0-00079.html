			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revised subpart C, Post-Award Requirements, sets forth the rules for financial and program management, property and procurement standards, reports and records, and the termination of awards and enforcement of their terms. Sections 74.15, 74.17 and 74.18 of the current subpart C, Bonding and Insurance, are removed as modified by the Circular to the revised subpart C, &sect;&sect;74.21 (c) through (e), Standards for financial management systems. The provisions which appear at the current &sect;74.16, Construction and facility improvement, are removed as modified by the Circular to the revised &sect;74.48, Contract provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised subpart D, After-The-Award Requirements, sets out the procedures for closing out awards, including taking any disallowances or making any adjustments. Sections 74.20 through 74.25 of the current subpart D, Retention and Access Requirements for Records, are removed as modified by the Circular to the revised subpart C, &sect;74.53, Retention and access requirements for records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised subpart E, Special Provisions For Awards To Commercial Organizations, contains the special additional provisions governing awards to commercial organizations that are contained currently in subpart AA. The provisions of the current subpart E, Waiver of Single State Agency Requirements, are eliminated based on a determination that the general statement of award administration rules is an inappropriate locus for this type of a rule. Such a rule is better located in the regulations promulgated to implement the particular federal program(s) in question. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised subpart F, Disputes, contains the rules that apply in resolving any formal disputes that may arise between HHS and the recipient of an award, including a provision evidencing HHS's interest in employing alternative dispute mechanisms to attempt to resolve disagreements before the parties resort to formal adjudication processes. The provisions of the current subpart T, Miscellaneous, are removed to the revised subpart F, except that current &sect;74.304(e) is eliminated because it states a vague legal standard that unnecessarily places recipients of awards in jeopardy of filing untimely appeals. HHS awarding agencies are expected to observe the fundamentals of due process by ensuring that their notices of adverse final decisions clearly and adequately inform the recipient of the matter being decided and the reasons for the decision, in keeping with the provisions of the revised &sect;74.90(c), Final decisions in disputes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of &sect;&sect;74.41 and 74.42(a) of the current subpart F, Grant Related Income, are incorporated as modified by the Circular in the revised subpart A, Definitions, &sect;74.2. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  definitions for ``accrued income'' and ``program income'' in the revised &sect;74.2.) The remaining &sect;&sect;74.42(b) through 74.47 are removed as modified by the Circular to the revised subpart C, &sect;74.24, Program Income. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See also <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &sect;74.82 of the revised subpart E regarding commercial organizations, and &sect;&sect;74.30 through 74.37 of the revised subpart C concerning disposition of proceeds from the sale of property acquired with HHS funds.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 74.50 and &sect;&sect;74.52 through 74.57 of the current rules governing cost sharing, which appear at the current subpart G, Cost Sharing or Matching, are removed as modified by the Circular to the revised subpart C, &sect;74.23, Cost sharing or matching. The provisions of &sect;74.51, Definitions, of the current subpart G are incorporated as modified by the Circular in the revised subpart A, Definitions, &sect;74.2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of &sect;&sect;74.60 and 74.61 (b), (c), (g) and (h) of the current subpart H, Standards for Grantee and Subgrantee Financial Management Systems and Audits, are removed as modified by the Circular to the Financial and Program Management provisions of the revised subpart C, &sect;&sect;74.21 through 74.28. The current &sect;74.61(e) is removed as modified by the Circular to the revised &sect;74.22, Payment. The current &sect;74.61(a) is removed as modified by the Circular to the revised &sect;74.52, Financial reporting. The current &sect;74.61(f) is removed as modified by the Circular to the revised &sect;74.27, Allowable costs. The current &sect;74.62 is removed as modified by the Circular to the revised &sect;74.26, Non-federal audits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for &sect;74.71, Definitions, the provisions of the current subpart I, Financial Reporting Requirements, are removed as modified by the Circular to the revised subpart C, &sect;74.52, Financial reporting. Section 74.71 is incorporated as modified by the Circular in the revised subpart A, &sect;74.2, Definitions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Efim executives to be investigated Mr Alberto Predieri, liquidator of the Efim state industrial holding, has requested Milan magistrates to investigate 41 executives linked to companies within Efim, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The move was revealed by Mr Predieri yesterday in evidence to a parliamentary committee. He gave few details, saying the matters to be investigated related to the companies' balance sheets. Efim was placed in voluntary liquidation in July 1992 with outstanding debts of L18,000bn (Dollars 11bn). The rescue operation has already cost the Treasury some L10,000bn and the eventual cost is likely to be close to L18,000bn.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: New York A stronger than expected US employment report on Friday means that the main question facing the US bond market this week is when, and by how much, the Federal Reserve will next tighten monetary policy. The June employment report, showing an economy still growing at a brisk clip, reinforced the market's fears of inflation and meant the yield on the 30-year benchmark Treasury issue broke up out of the trading range of the past three months to close on Friday at 7.69 per cent, its highest since 1992. Even before the job figures, many analysts were forecasting the Fed would tighten at the next meeting of its policy-making Open Market Committee, on August 16. But some now think interest rates could rise much sooner, possibly in the aftermath of this weekend's G7 meeting. Statistical hurdles this week include June's producer and consumer price indices, due on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. The consensus forecast is for a 0.2 per cent rise in the PPI, excluding the volatile food and energy components, and 0.3 per cent for the CPI, on the same basis. June retail sales, due out on Thursday, are expected to show a 1 per cent rise on May, while Friday's industrial production figures could show capacity utilisation rising to around 84 per cent, its highest reading in five years.</p>

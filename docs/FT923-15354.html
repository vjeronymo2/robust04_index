			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Arts: The Trojans - Opera Launching brand new productions of both The Ring and The Trojans within a single season suggests estimable resources and high ambition. The Theatre de la Monnaie in Brussels has done just that: Herbert Wernicke's much praised staging of The Ring last autumn celebrated the end of Gerard Mortier's reign as the house's director, and now the Berlioz has arrived as the first major project of Bernard Foccroulle's stewardship. Evidently keen to establish his post-modern credentials right from the start, Foccroulle gave the German producer Peter Mussbach responsibility for the production; Sylvain Cambreling, the house's musical director, is the conductor. Mussbach's stature continues to grow in Europe; next year he becomes chief producer at the Frankfurt Opera, when Cambreling becomes its director. My own encounters with his operatic work had broken just about even before this - an imaginative, visually arresting realisation of Wolfgang Rihm's new opera in Hamburg last January set off against the absurd version of Idomeneo he made for Amsterdam a year ago - but the new Troyens very definitely left the account on the debit side. While Mussbach does conjure up some passages of keen visual inspiration, they are invariably beside the dramatic point; there is little illumination or even a suggestion that the production has got to grips with the substance of the work itself. The sets by Lucio Fanti are dominated by blood-red pillars which infiltrate every scene; Joachim Herzog's costumes - grey overalls and mob caps for the chorus in the Trojan scenes, the same in orange for Carthage, while the principals wear a timeless mixture of finery  -are uninspired. If the production has a thesis at all, it appears intent on depersonalising the opera, switching the focus from the protagonists to the Trojan and Carthaginian peoples in turn. So in the first part Cassandre, Chorebe and the rest are swallowed up by the chorus, and their own personal problems subsumed into those of the masses, while in the second Didon and Enee are just one more lovesick couple in a people devastated by the same sickness. That Berlioz's music consistently tells us otherwise is a difficulty this concept never quite overcomes. There's also a determination to avoid anything that might seem like an operatic set piece - the chorus admire a Trojan horse standing somewhere in the wings, the Royal Hunt and Storm offers some vaguely suggestive liaisons, and the ballet is illustrated by desultory cross-stage traffic. The chorus spends much of the first half of the opera writhing on the ground and the rest of the time upstaging the principals. Cambreling's conducting was brisk and unfussy, but the orchestral playing was never quite clean and precise enough to make the musical account as invigorating as it should have been, but the singing of the female roles in particular saved the day. The casting of the Cassandre (Francoise Pollet) and Didon (Kathryn Harries) was as good as one has any right to expect, though Harries was far better served by the production than Pollet. This Cassandre has to make her vocal presence felt largely from up stage, and frequently with the massed chorus teeming in front of her. She is not the most compelling stage presence, but her diction is wonderfully clear. Harries was allowed a good deal more space and her movement and gesture delineated the presence still further. Her mastery of this role continues to deepen; it has developed even beyond the level of her performances for Scottish Opera in 1990. There is now a weight of expression in every single phrase, a sense of each element in the portrayal fitted perfectly into place. That she was able to make her singing so affecting in these inhospitable dramatic circumstances was sufficient tribute in itself, and she was supported too by an excellent rich-toned Anna from Elzbieta Ardam. The male characters were not realised with anything like the same intensity. Ronald Hamilton's Enee was short of stature and in his phrasing; both William Stone's Chorebe and Reinhard Hagen's Narbal were out of focus, though there was an interestingly misanthropic Iopas from Barry Banks. The chorus, of whom so much is expected in this production, was efficient if not sonorous, and on its own was never likely to provide the sense of epic so lacking elsewhere.</p>

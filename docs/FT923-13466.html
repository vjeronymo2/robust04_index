			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Wholesale prices show slowdown THE ANNUAL RATE of increase in German wholesale prices slowed further in June, reinforcing expectations of a fall in consumer price inflation in late summer. A month-on-month drop in prices of 0.1 per cent translated into a rise in the wholesale price index of only 1.2 per cent, the federal statistics office said yesterday. This followed increases of 2.3 per cent in April and 1.7 per cent in May. Although welcome, the news failed to override adverse reactions in stock and capital markets to the possibility of further tightening in the Bundesbank's monetary policy later this week. Concern over runaway money supply growth has for the moment replaced inflation as the main talking point in business and financial circles. Mr Friedel Neuber, chairman of the WestLB bank, the biggest public sector bank in Germany, said yesterday that a 'clear statement' from the Bundesbank after its council meeting on Thursday would help to calm markets. He said he was doubtful that the central bank chiefs would decide to tighten monetary policy, although some council members are lobbying strongly for moves to deter demand for credit. The DAX stock market index lost almost 18 points to close at 1,736.50 and the Rex bond index ended the day at 96.51 (96.78). Immediate prospects suggest inflation will fall this month to below 4 per cent, compared with 4.3 per cent in May and the 10-year high of 4.8 per cent recorded in March. The expected drop will result mainly from the effect of higher duties on oil and tobacco, imposed 12 months ago, falling out of the year-on-year prices calculations. However, 'home-made' inflationary pressures are still strong, according to the HWWA economics institute in Hamburg. The main source is high wage settlements in this year's round, which is currently showing through in a 6 per cent rise in the costs of services and repairs. The housing shortage is also forcing up rents at an annual rate of more than 5 per cent, and car running costs are up more than 7 per cent. Main contributors to the downward trend in wholesale price rises were fresh vegetables, 4.2 per cent cheaper than a month earlier, and heavy heating oil (off 3.6 per cent). However, the picture was marred by an 18 per cent rise in the cost of fresh fish and increases in men's clothing and frozen meat.</p>

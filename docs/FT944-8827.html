			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US scales down Thailand watch The US will remove Thailand from its 'priority watch list' of countries threatened with US trade sanctions for violating intellectual property rights, following the recent passage through parliament of Thailand's new copyright law, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said yesterday. Thailand will be moved to the less rigorous 'watch list' under the terms of US trade legislation known as 'Special 301', according to senior US officials. 'We will continue to keep a close eye on Thailand's protection of intellectual property rights,' Mr Christopher told reporters in Bangkok. 'Improved protection of these rights could prevent the loss of over Dollars 150m in annual income to US firms.' Pirated computer software, videos and music cassettes are easily obtainable in Bangkok, but the new Thai law extends copyright protection to software and provides for jail terms of up to four years and fines of up to Bt800,000 (Dollars 32,000). Mr Christopher also said the Thai government had agreed to open its market for the first time to American citrus products. Thailand will offer export insurance facilities starting on November 23 to boost the competitiveness of the country's exporters.</p>

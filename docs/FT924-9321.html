			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Markets sense early realignment in ERM THERE was growing speculation in financial markets yesterday that another realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) will take place before the end of the year, following a number of statements from European governments. Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's finance minister, told the New York Times that a further realignment in the ERM would probably be needed before the end of the year to restore stability to the system. 'We are absolutely open to all changes of parities,' he said. A spokeswoman at the Spanish Finance Ministry said yesterday that Mr Solchaga's comments dated back to an interview given last month and that the arguments for a realignment were now much less clear. However, speculation was boosted later in the day by Ireland's announcement that it will be lifting all its remaining exchange controls by the end of this year. Mr Bertie Ahern, Ireland's finance minister, said: 'We are committed, under existing European Community agreements, to remove all our remaining exchange controls by the end of this year. We will of course fully comply with this obligation.' Analysts said that the abandonment of exchange controls could accompany a devaluation of the Irish punt. The currency is one of the weaker ERM members, but its position in the system would be stabilised by a devaluation.</p>

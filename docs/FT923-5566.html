			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / As They Say In Europe: Royal reports 'THE question is whether the monarchy has the resilience to survive being converted into an object of the morbid tastes of a newly enriched class of shopkeepers.' Manuel Vicent in El Pais was worried about the future of the monarchy now that the entanglements of King Juan Carlos were the subject of public speculation. 'In this country such matters are commonplace. Aristocrats, artists, bankers and politicians parade half naked with their respective mistresses or wives.' Vicent argued that increasing wealth had meant the throwing over of ancient taboos. Once national income reached around Dollars 10,000 per head there was a 'qualitative change' in social mores. Perhaps that is also true if income moves in the reverse direction, hence the parallel phenomenon in Britain. Those two staples of British news, the royal family and the pound, have aroused less interest than might have been expected this week. That may be because of royal fatigue and a general view that sterling 'crises' are old hat. So it was a surprise to find that in Croatia, which surely has other matters to worry about, there is an obsessive concern with the Royal family. Novi Vjesnik of Zagreb carried a piece from its London correspondent, Jasna Zanic-Nardini, headed 'Princezin novi skandal.' (The 'princess' turned out to be a duchess). There were some charming lines about 'Fergie u toplessu' with her 'americki kavalir.' Maybe it seems better in Croat because of the contrast with the surrounding horror stories. A hitherto unremarked difference between Serb and Moslem is that the former is less interested in the doings of British royalty, and this has been aggravated by the oddity that arises when 'Fergie' is transliterated into the Cyrillic alphabet. Leafing through the Belgrade Borba in search of such material, I was struck by a headline nestling between its routine horror stories - 'Don't miss the revenge match of the twentieth century' it read. Serb vs Croat? Serbia vs everybody? It turned out to be about next month's Spassky-Fischer chess series taking place in Belgrade and Montenegro. That provided one of the few lighter moments in a horrible week which saw the Yugoslav madness come to London and the citizens of Rostock provide a re-run of the 1930s. Fortunately the French are still able to display their contempt for others without actually having to commit arson or murder. The Republican convention inspired a considered demolition piece in Monday's Tribune de l'Expansion by Daniele Gervais. 'It really needs very little to reverse the opinion of Middle America: a great media show in the course of which one exalts the superpower of the United States. But what is most disturbing about the speeches at the Republican convention are the diatribes against intelligence. The speakers smugly flattered the most mediocre aspects of their society. That is not what will cure America's ills for these result from the disintegration - orchestrated by the retreat of a demonised state - of the education system, of the infrastructure and of the social safety net. However, without a somersault aimed at reversing the degradation and guaranteeing modernisation, American society greatly risks pursuing the path of dangerous degeneration.' France may now be recovering from the pro-American malaise of the eighties. Boris Yeltsin, always the innovator, has developed a technique that prevents hostile questions at press conferences. He was asked by a Japanese journalist about his solutions for the problem of the northern islands claimed by Japan from Russia. He replied, 'I have 12 alternative approaches.' Nobody pursued the matter. James Morgan is diplomatic correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

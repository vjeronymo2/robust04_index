			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETICS AT USIU IN PERIL;  </P> <P> FINANCIAL WOES: BASKETBALL COACH SAYS HE HASN'T RECEIVED A PAYCHECK IN TWO  WEEKS.  </P> <P> The future of intercollegiate athletics at U.S. International University  appears to be in jeopardy after the school filed for bankruptcy last week in a  desperate move to save itself through economic reorganization.  </P> <P> USIU Athletic Director Al Palmiotto said Monday the fate of the school's 12  Division I sports programs will be determined by the its board of trustees in a  meeting Friday, and the outcome could range from minor adjustments to the total  elimination of sports at USIU.  </P> <P> Palmiotto said he made "several proposals" on restructuring the athletic  department to Kenneth McLennan, the university's acting president, last week.  But he declined to reveal the details of his proposals.  </P> <P> Palmiotto stressed his desire to preserve all of the Gulls' sports programs  while cutting costs in what he described as an already bare-bones athletic  budget. He also expressed concern that the school might not maintain its NCAA  Division I status and that abolition of sports would hurt its marketability  with prospective students.  </P> <P> Any decision Friday by the trustees could affect the cornerstone of USIU  athletics, its men's basketball team, which faces the possibility of becoming  extinct in midseason.  </P> <P> The Gulls are scheduled to play two home games at Golden Hall this week.  Palmiotto said those games will be played. But by Jan. 3, the day Northwestern  State is scheduled to play the Gulls here, USIU basketball could be a thing of  the past.  </P> <P> "I have no idea what (McLennan) is going to do," Palmiotto said. "(But) having  no athletics at an undergraduate institution will definitely put a big, big  problem on the board. Most undergraduates look for those intangibles that you  can't put your finger on. And one of them happens to be athletics."  </P> <P> USIU filed for protection under Chapter 11 Thursday because Mission Federal  Credit Union threatened foreclosure of a 70-acre portion of its 200-acre  campus. The parcel, which would have been collateral on a $3.5-million loan,  included athletic facilities. Now the university will work with a federal court  to develop a plan for solving its long-running financial turmoil.  </P> <P> McLennan, who became the acting interim president in January, said he will  review proposals from all administrators from each department on campus, but  said USIU's athletics and its highly regarded arts curricula would likely be  the first to be cut.  </P> <P> Palmiotto suggested that his programs operate on such a strict budget already  that the only thing left are the programs themselves.  </P> <P> "When you're faced with something like this, you've just got to go straight for  the hard line," he said. "I think the hard line is going through a pared-down  schedule and trying to cut in areas that won't have an impact on the very  essence of safety: food, lodging, things like that.  </P> <P> "My budget is very honest. It's a very honest assessment of what it takes to  run a Division I (program) without all the frills and all the hoopla. I don't  have a marching band. I don't have football. I don't have cheerleaders. We  don't have a gymnasium. Those are big cost items.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we have a little less in cash flow than we need. We have it in  property, but not in cash flow."  </P> <P> Gary Zarecky, the men's basketball coach who has never had a winning season in  five-plus years at USIU, hinted that minimal financial resources might be one  reason.  </P> <P> "We have the smallest men's basketball budget in the country," he said. "And  one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do with coaching is trying to  deal with what's been going on in our athletic department. I've been motivated  for six years at USIU by all the negatives. Now I've been thrown a curve."  </P> <P> Zarecky said he hasn't received a paycheck in two months and that he never was  paid for a previous three-month period of work. He said USIU's move to  bankruptcy became a headline story in Dayton, Ohio, where the Gulls were  competing in the US Air Tournament Friday and Saturday, and that his players  were "devastated" when he broke the news to them shortly before their opener  against Murray State.  </P> <P> The Gulls (1-12) lost both games, by margins of 48 and 42 points.  </P> <P> "My players are not deserting me," Zarecky said. "The team wants to overcome  this. My heart and my feelings go out to my players right now."  </P> <P> Palmiotto said Monday that he felt like he was sitting in a doctor's office  waiting to find out whether he had terminal cancer.  </P> <P> "We don't know which way we're going," he said. "Is he going to come out of the  room saying, 'Bless you, child. You've got another 50 years' or 'I'm sorry to  have to tell you . . .' "  </P> <P> Also at stake are the futures of the following USIU programs: baseball,  softball, women's volleyball, and men's and women's tennis, cross-country,  soccer and golf. The Gulls have competed in Division I since the 1979-1980  school year, and for them to maintain that status on a probationary basis they  must finish the year with eight sports in the program (four men's and four  women's) with at least two competing during spring, fall and winter seasons.  </P> <P> Should the trustees cut any USIU sports, Palmiotto said athletes would retain  their scholarships until the end of the season. He was not clear, however,  about the eligibility status of USIU's basketball players, who have played  nearly half their season. The NCAA normally does not restore a year of  eligibility to an athlete if he or she has played in more than 20% of the  scheduled games.  </P> <P> Palmiotto is not only gravely concerned for the future of athletics at USIU,  but is steadfast in his belief that eliminating them will only add to problems  in the ensuing years.  </P> <P> "I think it's very important to hold some kind of program together," he said.  "I don't think they should just go through and cut just because they can save  $50,000 $100,000, $200,000. I think they have to look at the whole domino  effect. I think it's essential to keep a core of everything they have that  makes the university what it is.  </P> <P> "The only two things that are auxiliary at that university that are truly big  league are the performing arts and athletics. I think if they drop them  totally, it would be a hard hill to climb back up."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mizusawa, Iwate Pref., May 20 KYODO -- The ruling  coalition's political kingpin predicted Friday [20 May] that a  gulf among Japanese political parties over security and tax  policies will force a further reconfiguration of their alliance.    Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], a core party in the coalition, told a lecture meeting  here, "the political community will inevitably undergo another  restructuring due to policy issues." He said this  reconfiguration will be necessitated by sharply conflicting  policies of political parties concerning Japan's tax system  reform and defense policy.    Ozawa was apparently referring to profound gaps among the  parties over a proposed raising of indirect taxes to bolster  state revenues, and Japan's response to the suspected North  Korean nuclear arms program.    Ozawa dismissed the seriousness of the April 26 withdrawal  of  the Social Democratic Party (SDP) from the coalition, which has  left the Hata administration as a fragile, minority government.    "We do not have to get upset" by the pullout, he said. The  rift was triggered by the abrupt formation of a unified  parliamentary bloc in the House of Representatives, excluding  the SDP. He branded as "irrational" ongoing talks between the  Liberal Democratic Party and the SDP toward forming their own  alliance.    "I do not worry about such moves, as I believe that those  who  can think and act reasonably will take a rational course of  action," he said. "Because Japan needs to restore political  stability as quickly as possible, we have to alleviate the  current turmoil and transform the administration into a stable  government by expediting the restructuring of the political  community," Ozawa said.    Ozawa predicted that the next election for the House of  Representatives will be contested under the new single-seat  constituency system which was pushed through the Diet in January.    He made the statement as the administration faces the  possibility that the opposition camp's tabling of a  no-confidence motion against it in the Diet could force Prime  Minister Hata to call the election under the current multiseat  constituency system.    Japan must legislate an electoral redistricting bill that  would split the current multiseat constituencies into 300  single-seat constituencies, if it is to hold the next election  lawfully under the single-seat system. The January legislation,  combined with the redistricting bill, will replace the existing  511 seat multiseat system of elections for the lower chamber  with a mix of 300 single-seat constituencies and proportional  representation, under which the remaining 200 seats would be  allocated.</p>

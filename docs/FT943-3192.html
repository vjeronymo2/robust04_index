			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Arts: The Tempest in Birmingham Is Birmingham our most colourblind and/or multicultural city? No British ballet company makes more of the differing ethnic origins of its dancers than the Birmingham Royal Ballet; and now Bill Alexander, artistic director of the Birmingham Rep, is presenting a new production of The Tempest in which Prospero, his daughter Miranda, his brother Antonio, and his spirit Ariel are all played by black actors, and in which two magical masque sequences are performed by Indian dancers in Indian style. So far so pc; but colourblind casting is also, in this case, poetry-deaf. For Alexander and Jeffery Kissoon, who plays Prospero here, this Tempest is a sequel to last year's Othello, with which Alexander launched his new regime at the Rep and in which Kissoon played the title role. He is a much younger and more potent Prospero than we usually see; fine. But in all five Shakespearian roles I have seen him play he has employed the same barking delivery, the same avoidance of all legato connectiveness, the same false stresses, the same blurrings of syllables, the same sudden shouts. I find this casting insufferable. There is novelty and some freshness in Rakie Ayola's childish, piping, blinking, seemingly stupid Ariel, and in Ginny Holder's quiet but eager Miranda; but neither speaks with any distinction. The best black verse-speaker in the cast, however, is Tony Armatrading as Antonio; he brings a nice cunning to the role. Likewise, there is novelty and freshness in Piali Ray's use of Bharata Natyam style for the spirits' dances; but there is little real pleasure to be had from watching any Indian dance either on a sandy floor or to taped, and partly rock-based music (by Jonathan Goldstein). All this mars what might otherwise be a first-rate production. In all larger matters, Alexander shows how well he understands this play. The initial tempest - an eerie quiet, marked by the huge slow thudding of a heartbeat and an occasional giant thunderclap and the noise of a colossal tidal wave or two - is thrilling. Ruari Murchison's single set is marvellous, one vast circle of sky at the back and another vast circle of white sand in the centre, the rest being composed of black rock in which we see some of Prospero's books sculpted. Costumes are Victorian; there is a feeling of a 19th-century Robinson Crusoe to it all that adds poetry and excitement. Alexander imposes no specious concepts onto the play, and no cerebral ornamentation; even Ariel's magical appearances are simply achieved. I would say that this was a Tempest shaped by a deep and loving knowledge of the text - were it not that the above-mentioned members of the cast too frequently stop me from hearing the text. It is a bore to have to say that the white comic actors make the most successful impression, but it is so. Geoffrey Freshwater as Trinculo and Andy Hockley as Stephano take complete charge of the play on their every appearance. I do not care for the stunted way in which Andy Hockley speaks Caliban's words (proceeding from his line to Prospero 'You taught me language'), but he nonetheless gives Caliban a crude rage that is at once funny and disturbing. This Tempest is on the verge of being vivid, refreshing, and spontaneous. But that phrase 'You taught me language' reminds me that Alexander knows more about the secrets of Shakespearian language than he is teaching his actors. Birmingham Rep until Oct 8.</p>

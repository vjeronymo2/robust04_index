			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> END PCH PARKING FOR SAFETY REASONS  </P> <P> It was "deja vu all over again" as I read your article about removing parking  during the afternoon rush hour in Hermosa Beach (Times, Oct. 14). The pathetic  posturing by the City Council, staff and Caltrans was lame beyond excuse.  </P> <P> As a former member of the Hermosa Beach City Council, a decade ago, we did  remove the parking for several weeks on a trial basis. Accidents did decrease,  driving time did improve, fewer commuters snaked their way through our narrow  residential streets, and the "chicken littles" were proven wrong -- the sky did  not fall on the local businesses. A subsequent City Council reinstituted that  parking, and Caltrans, without a whimper, meekly folded its tent and skulked  into the sunset.  </P> <P> As to the current discussions: Where is the current City Council's concern for  the residents who must confront the daily intrusion of commuter traffic (that  should be on PCH) into our neighborhoods? Should a literal handful of  businesses cloud your vision of the safety and sanity of all Hermosans? To  ignore the proven safety and environmental risks of your "do-nothing" approach  is blatant malfeasance of your public trust.  </P> <P> How many potential customers is the Chamber of Commerce sacrificing by its  position? Do you honestly believe that consumers will stop at a local business  during rush hour when they fear the all-too-frequent sideswipe while trying to  park, or return on the weekend to patronize a business after sweating five days  of absurd gridlock?  </P> <P> Why is the Hermosa School Board's voice mute concerning the safety of our  children trying to return home while competing with irate commuters? With  crossing guards providing safe passage across PCH, why your silence about the  safety of our kids along Valley Drive, Ardmore Avenue, Hermosa Avenue, Prospect  Avenue, etc?  </P> <P> Since Caltrans knows the safety, liability and environmental realities, where's  its guts? Since Hermosa Beach officials and staff lack the fortitude, torque  your own courage and do what needs to be done.  </P> <P> With heads firmly placed in the sand, I fear the current charade will only  continue. Parking along PCH during the afternoon rush hour should be removed,  not because it is the answer to traffic congestion, but because it is a  necessary and reasonable local response to the regional traffic congestion  puzzle and to the peace of mind that we deserve in Hermosa Beach.  </P> <P> LANCE WIDMAN  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / BT board agrees trial for 'video on demand' service The British Telecommunications board has given the go-ahead for a multi-million-pound market trial of its video-on-demand television service. It is the first step in BT's ambitious plan to deliver feature films and other television programmes to consumers' screens in more than 20m UK homes through its telephone network. If the initial experiment is a success BT will move on to a large scale trial involving 250,000 homes and investment in the region of Pounds 50m. BT has already demonstrated sending good quality television pictures down ordinary telephone lines at the same time as the lines are being used for ordinary telephone conversations. The aim is to offer subscribers a wide range of entertainment and information services from data bases for a fee. About 2,500 homes in the Colchester area of Essex will be chosen for the initial commercial trial which will get under way next year. BT engineers believe as many as 90 per cent of the 23m homes connected to its network would be able to receive the digitally compressed pictures. According to potential programme suppliers to the BT service the BT board decided to go ahead with the commercial experiment after a boardroom demonstration of the technology earlier this month. The Independent Television Commission said in September that its legal advice suggested that true video-on-demand, where individual subscribers choose their own programme or service from a database, would probably not need a local delivery, or cable licence, because it was not a broadcast service. If video on demand, which requires a special digital box to receive the pictures, were to take off it could pose competition for video shops and to a lesser extent cable and satellite television.</p>

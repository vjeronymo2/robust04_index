			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE STAYS OUT OF DISPUTE OVER FERGUSON FUND SWITCH  </P> <P> An Orange County Superior Court judge declined Friday to intervene in next  month's special state Senate election, clearing an issue that could have been a  financial setback for two Republican candidates.  </P> <P> Judge William F. Rylaarsdam had been asked to prevent Assemblymen Gil Ferguson  (R-Newport Beach) and Frank Hill (R-Whittier) from using money that they raised  for their Assembly campaigns in the state Senate race.  </P> <P> A complaint was filed earlier this month by another Republican candidate, Ron  Isles, a Brea city councilman.  </P> <P> Attorney David A. Robinson, representing Hill, said the judge noted that the  issue of transferring money between campaign committees is being considered in  a separate federal lawsuit and said that any ruling should be made at that  level.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Rylaarsdam let stand an opinion by the state Fair Political  Practices Commission that permits the transfers. Both Hill and Ferguson said  they obtained approval from the FPPC before they transferred the money.  </P> <P> Hill, Isles and Ferguson are among eight candidates seeking to fill a vacancy  left by the December resignation of state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda  Heights).  </P> <P> The special primary is scheduled for Feb. 6. If none of the candidates receives  more than 51% of the vote, a general election among the top vote-getters in  each party will be held April 10.  </P> <P> The state Senate's 31st District straddles the boundary between Los Angeles and  Orange counties. It stretches from Whittier and West Covina south to Laguna  Beach.  </P></p>

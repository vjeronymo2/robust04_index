			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Fashion: Fashion workshop dates ALL THE many readers who wrote and sent cheques to come along to our Browns/FT Fashion Workshop might like to know that the response was huge - so big in fact that we will be holding another, exactly one week later, on the evening of Tuesday June 15. The first 50 readers whose letters hit my desk on Monday morning will be sent tickets for the evening of June 8. The next 50 will be invited to the workshop on the following Tuesday. Those who cannot make that date will have their cheques returned - except in the case of those many generous readers who attached sweet notes saying that whether they were successful or not the Leukaemia Research Fund could have the money. We are sorry that we will have to disappoint some of you but those who missed out this time might like to know that we will keep a note of their names and addresses and they will be the first to be invited to an autumn workshop. If you want to join the FT Safari 'Among the Elephants' going to Kenya and Tanzania with Iain and Oria Douglas-Hamilton you still have another week to apply. Already letters and cheques are arriving daily but I promised last week that I would allow a full fortnight before I did the draw in order that readers abroad should not be disadvantaged. To recap: The safari runs from September 3 to September 20, it takes in trips to the major elephant areas such as Lake Manyara, Tsavo East National Park and the borders of the Tarangire River. There ought to be a chance to witness the wildebeest migration which normally takes place at this time of year and three days will be spent in the Mahale Mountains on the eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika where Roland Purcell, one of the world's leading experts on primate behaviour, will accompany you to see the largest known group of chimpanzees in the world. The safari ends with three days in the Douglas-Hamilton's own home on the shores of Lake Naivasha. The price is Pounds 5,499 per person and to secure a firm place a deposit of Pounds 1,000 (made out to African Explorations, which has orchestrated the safari, but sent to me here at the Weekend FT, 3rd Floor South, No 1 Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9 HL) is required.</p>

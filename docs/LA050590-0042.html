			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LISA LESLIE SLAM DUNKS SAT ON HER THIRD TRY;  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL: MORNINGSIDE STAR GAINS FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY. ALSO AN HONOR  STUDENT, SHE CALLS TEST 'BIASED.'  </P> <P> For Lisa Leslie, the third try at the Scholastic Aptitude Test proved to be the  charm.  </P> <P> Morningside High's highly recruited center learned last week that after two  failed attempts she scored better than 700 points on the SAT, making her  eligible to play collegiate basketball as a freshman next fall.  </P> <P> But the 6-foot-5 Leslie, an honor student who carries a 3.5 grade-point  average, was still unsatisfied with her 750 score. Echoing what others have  charged, Leslie said the SAT is "biased" against minority students because it  does not cover what they have learned in high school.  </P> <P> "The test is basically biased, as far as I'm concerned," she said. "We should  all learn the same things. It shouldn't differ as to what area you live in. In  a way, it's like segregation. Not everyone is fortunate enough to live in Palos  Verdes."  </P> <P> Asked if her education at Morningside has failed to properly prepare her for  college, Leslie said: "I know I'm not in the worst education situation, but I  know it's not the highest either.  </P> <P> "A lot of what's on the SAT, we haven't covered in our everyday learning. It  might be because of our books. We have books that the school was using years  ago. It's kind of unfair, because we're not all provided with the same  materials."  </P></p>

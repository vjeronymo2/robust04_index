			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Mexico ponders price it must pay for Nafta  -Side accords demanded by the US raise some thorny issues WHEN President Carlos Salinas is asked about the side agreements on labour, the environment and import surges which it is proposed to attach to the North American Free Trade Agreement, he has a stock answer. They must not, he says, be in conflict with the text of the basic accord; violate the sovereignty of the negotiating countries; nor be protectionist. Unfortunately for Mr Salinas (and Canada, which shares most Mexican concerns), many of the proposals raised by the Clinton administration and, above all, by US congressmen look to break all three conditions. The side agreement on import surges would have to conflict with Nafta as the latter already contains safeguards for industries affected by such surges. The proposal to impose trade sanctions on companies that fail to comply with environment and labour laws could expose thousands of Mexican companies to endless complaints, and turn Nafta into a protectionist's charter. The US proposal for trilateral commissions on labour and the environment would, if they had any power, reek of interventionism. However, given the Mexican government's desire to have Nafta passed as quickly as possible by all three legislatures, it is sure to make significant concessions. The question is which conditions are flexible, and which are matters of principle. The government has already accepted, albeit reluctantly, the principle of negotiations on import surges. Indeed, the real aim of insisting side agreements be consistent with the Nafta text was probably to avoid the US administration opening up specific sectoral agreements - such as on sugar or glass, or other areas where US businesses feel hard done by. Such a reopening of Nafta would have delayed ratification, and could have caused the whole treaty to unravel. The question of sovereignty is the most tricky, for non-intervention in other countries' affairs has been the cardinal principal of Mexican foreign policy for 50 years, and a form of intellectual self-defence against US interference. But it is undeniable that Mexico has already sacrificed considerable sovereignty in agreeing to many of the provisions in Nafta. Indeed the attraction of Nafta for many government officials was precisely that it would tie the hands of the current and future governments with respect to tariffs, investment laws, and other parts of economic policy, and thus restrict sovereignty in an area where Mexican governments had been none too successful. Under Nafta, for example, Mexico agrees to abide by the resolutions of trilateral panels in trade disputes - a clear infringement of sovereignty as traditionally defined in Mexico. It agrees not to ease environmental regulations to attract investment; to harmonise norms and standards with the US and Canada; set, in effect, an external sugar tariff equal to that of the US, and so on. As such, common rules on the environment and labour, and trilateral commissions, would not by themselves violate any new principles of sovereignty. Mr Jorge Castaneda, a visiting professor at Princeton University and vocal critic of the Mexican government, says: 'I see no reason why Mexico should abdicate sovereignty on intellectual property rights and investment and not on labour and the environment.' However, there is, as Mr Castaneda himself admits, one important difference: abdicating sovereignty on investment and property rights will attract capital and stimulate growth; abdicating sovereignty on labour and the environment is likely to do the opposite. The government will, in the words of one official, oppose measures that 'do not make economic sense': that is, social regulations so onerous they could limit growth. Direct enforcement of Mexican labour and environmental laws by the US is unlikely to be the main stumbling block. As Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has pointed out, the US could not tolerate Mexico helping enforce US laws, so it could hardly create environment and labour commissions that let Americans enforce Mexican laws. Instead, the three countries will look for mechanisms to force each to comply with labour and environmental conditions in Nafta, according to Mr Luis Miguel Diaz, legal director in Mexico's foreign relations ministry, and a side agreement negotiator. Talks on labour and environment, says Mr Diaz, will follow the same logic as those on the economic text of Nafta - that they will be co-operative agreements which in effect compel each country to adapt domestic laws. 'The limit of the negotiations is that national authorities remain national authorities, but there will be a system to make countries respond to the regulations laid out in Nafta.' The concern for Mexico and Canada is that this 'system' could become protectionist. The US has proposed giving the trilateral panels power to impose trade sanctions against a company that fails to comply with its national environmental and labour laws - sanctions, as it were, that would punish social dumping. This could turn into an excuse for US companies to defend themselves against cheap Mexican exports by claiming the exporting companies did not fully comply with Mexico's labour and environment laws. Such proposals could restrict access to the US market, and undo some of the economic benefits of Nafta for Mexico. US brewer in Mexican deal, Page 23</p>

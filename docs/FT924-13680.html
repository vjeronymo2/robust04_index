			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Department store sales produce slide at Renown RENOWN, Japan's largest clothing maker which acquired UK fashion retailer Aquascutum in 1990, incurred consolidated net losses of Y23.11bn (Dollars 192.58m) for the seven months to July. This compares with profits of Y7.39bn for the previous 12 months. At the pre-tax level, Renown made losses of Y16.7bn exceeding the company's forecast of a Y11bn deficit and compares with losses of Y11.8bn for the previous year. The losses were due to poor sales, particularly at department stores, and a rise in depreciation. Consolidated sales amounted to Y115bn, against Y243.8bn for the previous 12 months. Depreciation of inventories at its sales subsidiaries increased the group's losses. It also wrote off Y2.5bn of its investment in Aquascutum. For the six months to January, Renown expects consolidated pre-tax losses of Y4.7bn on sales of Y130bn. It expects net losses of Y8.3bn. The company has changed its year-end to January, and will start a 12-month accounting year from next February.</p>

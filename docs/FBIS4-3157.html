			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 15 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton today promises to move as quickly as possible to do a  thorough and complete investigation on the helicopter incident  that occurred in Iraq.    Clinton told reporters at the White House that he met for an  hour and a half this morning with his national security advisors  about a variety of issues including the incident.    The President described as "the terrible tragedy" the  incident in which two U.S. helicopters were shot down by two  U.S. warplanes in Northern Iraq yesterday.    "We are going to stay on top of this, work through it, and  make a full report to the American people," Clinton said.    Clinton also said he telephoned British Prime Minister John  Major and French President Francois Mitterrand to extend his  condolences for the losses of their citizens in the incident.    There were 26 persons killed in this incident. They were 15  U.S. personnel, three Turkish officers, one French officer, two  British officers and five Kurdish people.    Asked whether the U.S. should continue the peacekeeping  mission in Northern Iraq, Clinton said that "I very definitely  think so."    He considered the mission as "very successful" and "very  important," adding that "I believe it should continue."    Defense Secretary William Perry told a news briefing today  that an investigative board will work hard to get to the bottom  of what happened.    "We want to take the measures necessary to ensure that a  tragedy such as this does not occur again," Perry said.</p>

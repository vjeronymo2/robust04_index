			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom warns over equity ratio The chairman of Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board said yesterday the company's equity ratio had fallen to 'alarming' levels after it forecast that the company's debts would rise 4.7 per cent to DM122bn (Dollars 81bn) next year, up from DM116.5bn this year. Mr Rolf-Dieter Leister revealed that the equity ratio in 1995 was expected to fall to 19 per cent, down from 20.7 per cent, as the company makes further new investments ahead of its stock market listing in 1996. Turnover next year is expected to rise 8 per cent to DM69bn, up from a forecast DM64bn this year. Gross profits are expected to rise 15.4 per cent to DM6bn but the company will, for the last time, have to pay half of this back to the federal government. A final payment of about DM4bn will have to be made to Postbank and Postdienst, the two other branches of the state-owned operator which have been subsidised by Telekom. All three will be turned into joint stock companies at the beginning of next year. Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive, said investments, especially in eastern Germany, would slowly decrease and that this would allow a gradual reduction of the company's debts. Earnings are expected to improve and the company hopes to raise at least DM10bn when it raises capital through a stock exchange listing early in 1996. About 6,000 jobs will be shed in the coming year by means of a hiring freeze, bringing the workforce down to 224,000 people. DeTeMobil, the Telekom subsidiary which operates the D1 mobile telephone network, is expected to have sales of DM4.6bn next year, up from a forecast DM3.8bn in 1994, and will make a 'very respectable' profit, the group said. The company, which has about 800,000 mobile phone subscribers, is making monthly profits but not enough to offset investments of about DM4bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio has downplayed  rumors that five military bases had risen up in the interior of  the country to topple him. "They are just rumors. I am calm,"  de Leon Carpio said during a long telephone conversation after  the conclusion of a meeting with the economic cabinet to study  the tax reforms package that may be submitted to the Congress on  Thursday.    "I paid no attention to the rumors because they are just  rumors," de Leon Carpio stressed, adding that the army is today  more united than ever and helping provide security to the  people, as was seen last night in the streets of this city.  "Tonight, I reviewed the budget laws with several ministers of  the economic cabinet, so I did not concern myself with those  rumors since the people no longer believe them," the presidend  indicated.    De Leon Carpio told LA REPUBLICA: "I do not care about those  rumors," noting that the military institution has assumed with  responsibility the job it must perform within the democratic  process. "We have constitutional order here in Guatemala," he  affirmed. "Today more than ever, the specter of a coup is far  away because the army officers are behaving professionally  within the process the country is going through," the president  also said.    He indicated that this morning he will continue studying the  package of economic measures, which he could announce tonight to  the people of Guatemala. To conclude, de Leon Carpio said that  on Thursday he will leave "with half the cabinet to resume the  working visits to the interior of the country to see up close  the problems of the people. This shows nothing is happening,  that these are just ill-intended rumors that nobody believes."</p>

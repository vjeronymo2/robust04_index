			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 29 (AFP) -- This is a summary of the  main points of the agreement signed by Israel and the PLO  covering economic relations once Palestinian autonomy begins in  the Gaza Strip and Jericho, as provided by the Israeli  delegation:  <H5>  IMPORT POLICY </H5>   Israel and the Palestinian Authority will have an import  policy basically similar in all respects regarding imports and  customs. Nonetheless, the Palestinian Authority will be able to  import mutually agreed goods at customs rates differing from  those prevailing in Israel, following jointly agreed import  procedures. Moreover, it will be able to import goods from Arab  countries, in agreed, limited quantities. Arrangements will be  made for the two customs authorities to jointly operate the  border crossing in Jericho and Gaza.  <H5>  MONETARY POLICY </H5>   The Palestinian Authority will establish a monetary  authority, whose main functions will be the regulating and  supervision of the banks operating in the Area, the  determination within certain limits of the liquidity ratios on  deposits, the management of foreign exchange reserves and the  supervision of foreign exchange transactions.    The two sides will continue to discuss the possibility of  issuing various alternatives of a Palestinian currency. To  encourage trade, they will mutually allow the opening of bank  branches. Until then, the NIS (Israeli shekel) will continue to  constitute a legal means of payment in the autonomy's areas side  by side with other currencies.  <H5>  DIRECT TAXATION </H5>   The Palestinian Tax Administration will conduct its own  direct tax policy, including income tax on individuals and  corporations, property taxes and municipal rates and fees,  according to the policy and the rates determined by the  Palestinian Authority.    The two parties will collect income taxes on economic  activities conducted in their respective areas. Israel will  transfer to the Palestinian Authority 75 per cent of the  revenues from the income tax collected from Palestinians  employed in Israel.  <H5>  INDIRECT TAXATION </H5>   A VAT [value-added tax] system similar to that operating in  Israel will be operated also by the Palestinian Authority.    The VAT rates of the Palestinian Authority will be between  15  per cent and 16 per cent.  <H5>  LABOR </H5>   Work in Israel is essential for the Palestinians expanding  their employment opportunities; The guiding principle in this  sphere is to enable mutual movement of labor.    The rights of Palestinian workers employed in Israel will be  preserved according to arrangements existing in Israel, a social  security system being established in the meantime by the  Palestinians.  <H5>  AGRICULTURE </H5>   Agriculture produce from the autonomy will enter Israel  freely, except for five goods on which agreed import quotas have  been imposed for five years: tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes,  eggs, and broilers.  <H5>  MANUFACTURING </H5>   There will be free movement of goods manufactured in the  Area.  <H5>  TOURISM </H5>   A Palestinian tourist administration will be set up to  manage  subjects related to tourism in the areas of the Palestinian  Authority. Tourists will move freely between Israel and the  autonomy.    Tourist agencies, touring companies and tourist guides will  be able to operate "on the other side" provided they satisfy the  relevant professional criteria.  <H5>  FUEL </H5>   The price of gasoline in the autonomy will be determined  according to the autonomy's costs in purchasing it, and the  taxes levied on gasoline in the autonomy. The agreement  stipulates that the prices of gasoline will not fall short by  more than 15 per cent of the maximum gasoline price in Israel.  <H5>  INSURANCE </H5>   The agreement deals with two main topics:    a. The full transfer of the licensing and supervision  authority over the insurance business in the areas of the  Palestinian Authority.    b. An agreement for the compulsory insurance of motor  vehicles and the compensation of the victims of road accidents  based on:    - The Palestinian Authority maintain in its area a system of  compulsory insurance of motor vehicles in the form existing in  Israel, but with limited compensation.  - Policies issued by the Palestinian Authority being valid  also in Israel, and victims there being compensated according to  the Israeli laws; and Israeli policies being valid in the areas  of the Palestinian Authority.</p>

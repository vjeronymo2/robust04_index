			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Feud hits Yamatane restructuring THE restructuring of Yamatane Securities, the Japanese broker, has become complicated by a feud within the company's founding family and by an ongoing disagreement with the leading banks supposed to fund the restructuring. Yamatane, which reported a Y25.4bn (Dollars 206.5m) net loss last fiscal year, confirmed yesterday that it would close a Swiss subsidiary specialising in equity-linked bonds, and said it is studying a plan to cut senior management staff by 40 per cent and total employees by 30 per cent. But doubt remains over the fate of the broker's former chairman, Mr Tomiji Yamazaki, who is still on the board and has yet to relinquish his control over the company, in spite of repeated requests from the banks and from his family. The Yamazaki family is at the centre of the unfolding drama that has embarrassed the securities industry. Japanese financial newspapers have provided daily reports on the feud between Tomiji and his brother, Seizo, who runs Yamatane Corporation, a warehouse operator and food distributor. Some of Yamatane's problems are characteristic of those of other second-tier brokers, most of which reported losses last year. The company has been bruised by the fall in stock prices and turnover, and is now regretting its rapid expansion during the 1980s. Yamatane was also investigated by the finance ministry for its role in the 'tobashi' scandal, in which brokers shuffled stocks around client accounts to avoid booking losses. However, some of those clients discovered that they were left holding the losing stocks, leading to at least four legal actions against Yamatane. In an attempt to return to profit this year, the company appealed to its main banks - including Sakura Bank and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking - to provide funds for a restructuring, and hinted that it would otherwise begin offloading its bank stocks. Sakura sent two managers to the company, but found that Tomiji Yamazaki continued to direct management decisions. Mr Tomiji Yamazaki, who says renovating the company is his 'responsibility', also appealed to his brother, Mr Seizo Yamazaki, for assistance, but the latter was dismayed by the scandal that the Yamatane name had attracted. Seizo's company, which has a 6.2 per cent stake in the broker, has its own profit problems, as the economic downturn has hurt the warehousing business and its property interests. The Yamatane group was built by their father, Taneji. He dispatched the sons to separate companies in the belief that they would argue if put together, but they still managed to fall out. The daily twists in the family saga and the broker's tortured relationship with the bankers have left its workers wondering if they will be among the first lay-offs at a leading Japanese company. On Tuesday, Yamatane said that a new agreement was reached for reconstruction and on Wednesday, the pact was said to have fallen through. A Yamatane Securities spokesman said that 'we really don't know what is going on at the top - it's difficult for us to tell from down here'. Sakura Bank, destined to play an important role in overhauling the troubled broker - in which it has a 4.9 per cent stake - said 'negotiations are continuing'.</p>

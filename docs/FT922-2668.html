			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Vibroplant falls 27% to Pounds 4.5m and sees no sign of upturn MR JEREMY PILKINGTON, chairman of Vibroplant, the plant hire group, yesterday warned that construction levels are likely to remain depressed for the rest of the year as he announced a 27 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year end to March. Although turnover remain broadly static at Pounds 76.8m (Pounds 77.9m) the stabilisation of prices at low levels across both sides of the Atlantic resulted in pre-tax profits falling from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 4.5m. While the profit fall was less than in previous results Mr Pilkington admitted to being 'very disappointed' at heavy trading losses at its Baltimore business which was closed. This contributed to the 39 per cent fall in US pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.2m, while sales rose 3 per cent to Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 37.6m). In the UK turnover fell slightly to Pounds 37.9m (Pounds 40.3m) but severe pricing pressures eroded margins and pre-tax profits fell by 21 per cent from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 3.3m. Despite investing Pounds 14m in rental fleet and other assets borrowings were reduced by Pounds 9m to Pounds 37m, representing gearing of 70 per cent. Borrowings fell because of cost cutting which resulted in the loss of 100 staff in both the US and UK and a fall in capital expenditure from Pounds 26m to Pounds 14m. Mr Pilkington said: 'While prices remain at these low levels the business does not warrant new capital investment.' An extraordinary charge of Pounds 83,000 related to the writing-off of goodwill through the profit and loss account from a disposal which had been taken through reserves. Earnings per share fell from 9.84p to 6.55p. The final dividend is maintained at 2.38p per share making an unchanged total of 3.6p.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Baghdad stalls on UN missile ultimatum IRAQ last night delivered an apparently inconclusive reply to the United Nations' ultimatum that it withdraw missile batteries near the no-fly zone in the south of the country by this evening. Mr Nizar Hamdoon, its ambassador to the UN, told western UN representatives in New York that Iraq had the sovereign right to deploy its military on its own territory - a response similar to that given earlier by Mr Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister. There was no clear reaction from the western delegation pending consultation with their governments. Mr Thomas Richardson, the deputy UK representative, said 'the essential question' was whether Iraq removed its missiles from south of the 32nd parallel and not violate the no-fly zone. He added: 'So in a sense the question depends on what happens on the ground.' Mr Hamdoon repeatedly ducked questions about the Soviet-made missiles at issue. He said: 'I have not addressed the question of the missiles per se.' Earlier, the US defence department said it had indications that some were being moved but, with low clouds hampering aerial and satellite surveillance in the region, there was no word later of their whereabouts and some concern that they were merely being relocated in more heavily fortified emplacements. Officials insisted it was 'premature' to suggest that President Saddam Hussein was making a 'positive' response to the 48-hour UN ultimatum handed to Ambassador Hamdoon on Wednesday evening by the US, France, Britain and Russia, threatening military retaliation. They noted that Iraq had frequently used the tactic known as 'cheat and retreat' in testing the resolve of the US and its allies. In what looked like a propaganda ploy, Mr Hamdoon invited a US congressional delegation to visit Iraq 'to see the situation in the no-fly zone and regarding all other disputed issues between the US and Iraq'. This was presumably a reference to western concerns that President Saddam is preparing for a crackdown on the Kurds in northern Iraq. British officials said that unless it was clear the missiles had been moved out of the air exclusion zone allied aircraft would attack military targets in Iraq within hours of the ultimatum expiring. The Soviet-made SA-2 and SA-3 missile batteries were moved adjacent to the 32nd parallel after the downing on December 27 of an Iraqi MiG aircraft by US jets when it violated the UN-proscribed no-fly zone. President George Bush was said to be resolute after a meeting with Republican congressmen. President-elect Bill Clinton's spokesman said he agreed with the policies being pursued by Mr Bush. 'There will be no toleration of any violations of the UN resolutions by Saddam,' Mr George Stephanopoulos said. Mr Aziz denied Iraq was using the impending change of government in Washington as an opportunity to improve its military posture. Britain warned Iraq of 'very serious' consequences if it did not remove the missiles from the no-fly zone. Mr Zuhair Ibrahim, head of the Iraqi interests section at the Jordanian Embassy in London, was summoned to the Foreign Office for a 10 minute meeting. British-Iraqi diplomatic relations were broken off at the start of the Gulf war in 1991. An Australian aid worker was shot and killed and another injured after a village meeting in the UN-controlled Kurdish zone in northern Iraq, the aid agency CARE Australia said early today, Reuter reports from Sydney. It was reported that the UN aid programme in the region was subsequently suspended. Editorial Comment, Page 13 Dangers behind the stand-off with Iraq, Page 3</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Abel Sardina] </F>   [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 16 Jun (PL) -- Cuban President  Fidel Castro today reiterated that the importance of the  Ibero-American summits is based on the fact that this is the  first time the Latin American countries have met without being  summoned to a meeting.    The legendary leader talked at length about this, about the  progress and outlook of Latin America's integration, and the  so-called Summit of the Americas called by the United States for  late 1994, at a meeting with Colombian solidarity with Cuba  organizations and during a meeting with Cuban reporters.    Castro stressed that just being present at the  Ibero-American  summit is very important for Cuba because for the first time, it  was not excluded. Castro added that Mexico, host of the first  summit, and other friendly nations, had much to do with this.    One of the fruits of these summits is that they have created  an awareness for integration, he said, adding that the success  should not be measured by specific achievements, as the  expectations are not always met.    He said that those meetings have contributed to countering  Cuba's isolation, creating greater awareness of the blockade it  faces, teaching the United States a lesson, intensifying Cuban  relations with many countries, and building closer relations  with Latin America.    We are not working for the present, but for the future, he  noted, adding that his country has participated in four summits  and has made contributions on all the subjects discussed, giving  special importance to education, health, and social development  in general.    We have made great efforts to lift the spirit of the  summits,  to give them more meaning, Castro stressed.    With regard to Latin American integration, Castro said that  there is still no real integration awareness in the region, but  these summits contribute to that purpose. He said that the  United States is the main obstacle, because it wants to  disintegrate Latin America, and prevent it from becoming more  independent.    He said that is why Washington is promoting bilateral  agreements because, as it did with the foreign debt, which was  negotiated on a one-to-one basis, it does not want to negotiate  with a united Latin America.    Fidel Castro indicated that the Ibero-American summits are  so  important that our northern enemies became envious and invented  another summit, precisely in Miami, which he said, they want to  turn into Latin America's capital.    He reiterated, however, as he said during his speech at the  Ibero-American summit, which ended here yesterday, that Cuba is  not opposed to that meeting even though it considers its  exclusion a cowardly act because the U.S. leaders are afraid of  words, ideas, and truths and that shows political weakness.    He said that if invited he would go, even though it is held  in Miami, but the organizers have already said it will not  happen, and he explained that he is not opposed to the summit  because he expects the Latin American countries to firmly defend  the interests of the region.    I am pleased to see that the free summits, in which we have  met without anyone's permission, have forced the United States  to convene the one in Miami, and the selection of this site  denotes a political objective, the top leader of the Cuban  Revolution said.    Questioned on the assessment of the final declaration of  this  summit which is permeated by neoliberalism, he said that this  philosophy is currently part of America's reality and that some  have made it their religion; however, others have begun to see  its other side.    These countries no longer talk enthusiastically about  neoliberal policies, whose implementation has reduced inflation  and has attained other achievements by slashing social  expenditures. He added that even the United States is realizing  it is digging its own grave; therefore, it is seeking to make  some changes with regard to this issue.</p>

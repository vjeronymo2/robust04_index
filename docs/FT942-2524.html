			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Thirst for success beats the drought - A company's recovery One dry, hot day in June 1976, Nick Handover and his wife Pauline, plus 16 staff, began on a contract to clean the stone of 52 buildings in Bath, Avon. By the next day the project was dead. 'It was the time of the national drought. We were told in the evening that our task was not an essential use for water and must cease. After eight years hard slog we had developed a system, acceptable to the conservation lobby, for the pressure water cleaning of soft stone and were turning over a healthy Pounds 500,000,' Handover said. 'The next morning the company was effectively finished.' A pick-up truck and trailer, emblazoned with 'Drain Brain', the name Handover had given his company, was permitted to continue essential local authority work. This left the workforce doing very little for 2 1/2 months until he opted for voluntary liquidation. 'Water has been my way of life for 26 years. I love the stuff - even revolting dirty water - but it was water, or the lack of it, that finished off my first venture,' said the 52- year-old English-educated South African. 'My big mistake, after the Bath episode, was being loyal to the workforce and keeping them on. It eventually meant we had to sell our house and buy a much cheaper one and I owed my creditors Pounds 87,000.' It took nine years to pay it back but Handover had succeeded in convincing his creditors that they would be better off if they allowed him to continue trading rather than forcing him into compulsory liquidation. 'We put our heads down and kept going. It was drain cleaning pure and simple  -two of us carrying out an essential service all over the west of England, performing a task nobody liked doing,' he said. By 1979 Handover felt things might be improving when Dyno-Rod tried to buy his company name for Pounds 12,000. He could have done with the money, but he declined. In 1982 he was able to move again to a larger home near Cirencester where he could house his four vehicles in the old stables. By 1986 the fleet had grown to 12 vehicles and the company turnover was Pounds 1.6m. Two years later it had grown to Pounds 1.8m. Handover explained: 'Really, the growth had been much too fast. I didn't have the management expertise to handle this sort of money and I was utterly unsuspecting when a Frenchman rang and asked if he could come and see how our operation worked.' He eventually asked if the company was for sale. Handover said no. The Frenchman returned a few months later, in February 1989, by which time things had changed. 'He asked me if I would sell a share to the company he worked for,' said Handover. 'I said yes. The press seemed to be full of gloom about the impending recession, and we had lost a lot of work from large developers.' In July 1989 Sanitra, the drain cleaning arm of French water company Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, took over 76 per cent of Drain Brain. Handover was given the property he lived in as a gift, as well as a lump sum, and appointed managing director. Soon after, he moved the business to a country site and was keen to build a workshop, a store area and offices on the 2 1/2 acres he had leased from a farmer near Bibury, Gloucestershire. All was fine at first. Handover got on well with his new colleagues and Sanitra willingly financed the Pounds 400,000 building project. However, they were unhappy at the lengthy British planning processes, and especially at the attitude of a neighbour who objected to the development. By 1992 the French had provided more than Pounds 1m for buildings and equipment, but turnover had dropped from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 1.7m. By the time the recession took hold the books were showing a loss - minimal in 1990/91 but Pounds 300,000 the following year. The French switched management and imposed financial restraints. 'It got very fraught,' he said. 'I couldn't stand either of the two new key men.' Eventually, it was Handover who stayed and the French who left, an outcome largely due to the arrival of 27-year-old manager Matthew Byrne. He had worked for Shell for five years and was headhunted by Sanitra, who saw him as the saviour of their English operation. 'I think they thought that with my arrival Nick would give up and go,' said Byrne. Instead, the opposite happened: Handover's practical experience dovetailed with Byrne's efficiency and business sense. After a dreadful 1992, in which the company lost Pounds 280,000, business started to pick up, helped by the North Sea work that Drain Brain, or DB Industrial as the company is known offshore, won because of the equipment bought with Sanitra capital. At the beginning of 1993 - the year DB Industrial went into profit again - Sanitra pulled out. Handover and Byrne bought the company as joint managing directors in March last year. They each put up Pounds 20,000 of their own money and the total company debt of Pounds 400,000 was met by a Pounds 75,000 loan from the Rural Development Commission, Pounds 30,000 from Credit Lyonnais, Pounds 35,000 (interest free) from Sanitra, and Pounds 200,000 set against current debtors. The rest is secured by a bank overdraft. 'It was a phenomenal deal. Said Handover: 'It was probably silly to get involved with the French, but in a funny sort of way they saw us through the recession.' Drain Brain, Meadowlands, Bibury, Cirencester, Glos GL7 5LZ.

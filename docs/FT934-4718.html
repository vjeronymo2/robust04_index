			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition costs cut Cape to Pounds 6.1m Cape, the building products and industrial services company, reported pre-tax profits down by 6 per cent to Pounds 6.1m in the six months to September 30, against Pounds 6.5m. The company blamed interest payments of Pounds 600,000, compared with receivable of Pounds 100,000. Net borrowings at the period end were Pounds 8.5m following the Pounds 8.25m acquisition in January of Darchem Contracting. Group operating profits rose 4.5 per cent to Pounds 6.7m. The figure was after a Pounds 1m loss at Socap, the French insulation business. The loss followed an investigation which discovered that the subsidiary's profits had been overstated. Mr Michael Farebrother, chief executive, said yesterday: 'The management responsible for the problems in the French company have been dismissed.' Socap's activities have been cut and the workforce reduced by 100. The financial mis-statements were corrected by a Pounds 5.9m adjustment to shareholders' funds in the balance sheet to March 31, he added. Socap's poor performance contributed to a 20 per cent decline in operating profits of the industrial services division to Pounds 3.3m. Turnover fell 10 per cent to Pounds 83.6m. The problems were offset by the building and architectural products division, where operating profits rose from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 4.1m and turnover increased Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 35.3m. Cape's results were also held back by a Pounds 200,000 increase to Pounds 800,000 in the compensation provision for former workers suffering from asbestosis. Group turnover declined by 7 per cent to Pounds 118.9m (Pounds 127.9m). The interim dividend is maintained at 3p, payable from earnings per share down from 8.2p to 7.6p.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BENNETT INVESTIGATION  </P> <P> Your story on Bennett's problems with his travel expense account is ironic when  considering his recent action.  </P> <P> Not long ago the board angered a lot of Californians by billing them for sales  tax on the trinkets they brought home from foreign trips. The public cry of  anguish led the board not only to halt the practice, but to order all payments  refunded. Not good enough for Bennett. He went to court and had the board's  action stayed. He hopes the courts permanently prevent the refunds. "Ignorance  of the law is no excuse," he says. I think he tripped himself up.  </P> <P> ROBERT E. RYAN  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

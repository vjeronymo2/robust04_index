			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Banks agree refinancing for William Hill chain The future of Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group, appeared more secure yesterday as its lead bankers agreed to take up the slack on a Pounds 370m refinancing of its betting shop chain, William Hill. The protracted negotiations over a refinancing ended in the early evening as Standard Chartered and Lloyds Bank agreed to take on the Pounds 120m shortfall. This is believed to have left the two banks with total exposure to William Hill of more than Pounds 200m. After including loans to Brent Walker, the banks are thought to be owed more than Pounds 400m. The debt, which was due to be repaid on March 1, will now be extended until 1999. The company said yesterday it had ceased to consider alternatives such as a flotation or sale of William Hill. It had been estimated that either of these two options would raise between Pounds 470m and Pounds 550m. William Hill's management had been thought to prefer either the flotation or sale option which would have given it the freedom increase its capital expenditure. The refinancing will demolish the ring fence which has protected William Hill from Brent Walker's bankers. The leisure group will take on William Hill's debts and have complete control in return. This will leave Brent Walker with borrowings of substantially more than Pounds 1.4bn. Lloyds said the two lead banks would now seek to syndicate the William Hill debt. Although this had proved difficult in recent weeks, the bank said potential investors had been distracted by the possibility of an imminent flotation. It is thought that the banks and Brent Walker are aiming to float William Hill after two years. 'We believe that the value of William Hill will increase significantly during the next few years,' Lloyds said. The proposal to float William Hill before March had proved unpopular with Brent Walker's banks and could have ended the company's chances of survival, according to one insider. The leisure group's refinancing in 1992 had been based on the retention of two cash generative businesses - William Hill and Pubmaster. Without William Hill, the prospect of Brent Walker's banks being repaid appeared uncertain. Brent Walker said it had submitted to its bankers proposals to amend certain terms and conditions of borrowings as agreed in the 1992 refinancing. A circular to shareholders and subordinated loan note holders was expected to be sent out next month.</p>

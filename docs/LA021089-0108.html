In the Pacific 10  Conference, they are in fourth place with a 5-4 record, one game out of third.  </P> <P> UCLA has shot only 36% from the field in its last three games. The leading  scorers are freshman center Molly Tideback (12.7 points) and junior forward  Sandra vanEmbricqs (12.5 points).  </P> <P> USC, which is 3-6 in conference play, is in a three-way tie for sixth. Cherie  Nelson is USC's leading scorer at 25.2 points.  </P> <P> The Bruins beat USC, 76-62, in mid-January. JULIE CART  </P></p>

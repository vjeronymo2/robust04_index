			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AFIELD WITH JERRY SCHAD: POWAY BECKONS THOSE WHO LIKE TO TAKE A HIKE  </P> <P> Looking for a nice place to walk, hike or jog on a cool springtime morning or  lazy afternoon? Then look no farther than Poway, North County's self-pro-  </P> <P> claimed "City in the Country." Nowhere in the county will you find a better-  developed system of trails lacing both suburban neighborhoods and adjoining  open space.  </P> <P> Poway's enlightened approach to community trail development is partly a  reflection of its residents' preoccupation with the outdoors, and partly due to  some savvy planning during the city's infancy in the early 1980s. As soon as  several parcels of surplus public-domain land on the city's edge were deeded  over to the city by the federal Bureau of Land Management, Poway declared them  permanent open space and initiated an aggressive program of trail construction.  </P> <P> Today, 40 miles of trails cover not only these areas, but also many of the  city's residential neighborhoods. According to Poway's riding and hiking trails  plan, an additional 50 miles or so will be completed during the next several  years. The system's peripheral trails are designed to link with trails in other  jurisdictions, possibly as part of a future, countywide system of multiuse  trails.  </P> <P> Poway's most interesting trail of moderate difficulty encircles the 60-acre  surface of Lake Poway, a reservoir (currently full) storing emergency water  supplies. Even if you don't like hiking, visiting the impeccably maintained  recreational area (Poway residents get in free; nonresidents pay a parking fee  of $3 weekdays, $4 weekends) along the lake's west shore might be worth your  while. You can loll on the grass in a 10-acre picnic area; play horseshoes,  volleyball, or softball; or rent a boat to fish or cruise on the lake. The  recreation area is open seven days a week, sunrise to sunset (phone 748-2224  for more information).  </P> <P> The loop trail around the lake features 3 miles of dirt road and switchback  trail, some of the latter steeply pitched. The whole trip takes less than an  hour for joggers and power walkers, and more than two hours for bird watchers  and flower sniffers. Down at the bottom of the trail, in a ravine just below  the rock-fill dam, you might deviate a little from the route to visit the  seldom-used wilderness campground, open only to those on foot or horseback. You  can use one of the picnic tables there to relax, tank up on fluids and admire  the line of oaks, sycamores and willows hugging the nearby creek.  </P> <P> On the east side of the lake another side trip option presents itself. Climb a  short way up the steep Mt. Woodson Trail for a look at some of the  late-blooming spring wildflowers -- Indian pink, scarlet delphinium, and monkey  flower -- along the north-facing slopes.  </P> <P> The Mt. Woodson Trail is your gateway to the rugged area of open space known as  the Clyde Rexrode Wilderness (named in honor of Poway's first mayor). If you're  up to a strenuous hike, pick a cool morning to explore either of the two upper  branches of the trail. One branch forks left and climbs the steep and shaggy  slopes of Woodson Mountain -- or Mt. Woodson, if you prefer the corrupted name.  This 8-mile (round trip) west approach of the mountain involves a non-trivial  2,000 feet of elevation gain and loss, and some easy boulder-hopping near the  top. Wear lug-soled boots or waffle-soled running shoes to ensure good  traction, and bring along plenty of water and high-energy snacks.  </P> <P> The right branch of the trail gyrates wildly up and down, following a course  across the boulder-frosted south flank of Woodson Mountain. Two delightful  picnic spots are passed, where you can sit in the cool shade of a venerable  live oak and survey the rugged terrain around you. This branch of the trail  heads toward California 67, but does not now connect to anything because of the  widening of the highway roadbed. Eventually an extension of this trail will  link up with the Iron Mountain Trail, about 1 mile south. Because of the many  ups and downs, this alternative (9 miles round-trip to California 67) is about  as strenuous as the west approach of Woodson Mountain.  </P> <P> Another way to enjoy the area is to hike the steep, paved service road up along  Woodson Mountain's east slope. The route passes through the county's premier  rock-climbing area, a landscape strewn with smooth and angular boulders shaped  like oversized jelly beans and jelly-bean fragments. If you start the climb to  the top (1,200 feet gain in 1.7 miles) no later than around 6:30 p.m., you'll  enjoy a spectacular sunset from the summit plateau. Return by the light of the  nearly full moon (best July 3-6 or Aug. 30-Sept. 2) or by flashlight. Access to  the mountain is now awkward: you must park across from the fire station along  California 67, quickly cross the highway on foot and walk past the station to  reach the service road.  </P></p>

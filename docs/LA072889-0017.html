			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTHING SURPRISING HERE  </P> <P> President Bush's extension of the "voluntary" restraints on steel imports is  hardly surprising. He had made it a campaign promise as he nailed down support  in the industrial states. He has served notice that this is transitional. All  protections will be terminated in March of 1991. And, in proposing a 30-month  continuation, he has wisely resisted industry pressure for a five-year  extension.  </P> <P> For the moment the restraints will have no practical consequence because  imports are substantially below the 18.4% of market share provided under the  1984 limits which, in turn, will be the base share under the Bush plan. The  international economic slowdown that is being forecast may change that picture,  with the prospect that American steelmakers could again confront a flood of  lower-priced foreign products. A slowdown could compound the problem for major  steel-consuming American enterprises, whose ability to compete in world markets  would be hurt by limits on cheaper imports.  </P> <P> The most constructive element of Bush's action is the incentive to encourage  participation by other nations in a global consensus terminating steel  subsidies. The market share for imports will be increased 1% a year, with the  increased share going first to nations giving up subsidies. The continuation of  government subsidies in a number of competing nations was cited as a major  factor in the President's decision. Admittedly, however, there is no definition  as yet of what constitutes a subsidy. Some American steelmakers, like some of  their foreign competitors, have benefited from indirect and direct subsidies,  although not on the scale used by some nations.  </P> <P> Bush is not saying what he will do in 1991 if he has not been successful in  winning international agreement to do away with subsidies. He could reaffirm  his own commitment to free trade if he were to say, as he sends his proposal to  Congress, that all restrictions would be lifted at that time on those nations  that have dropped subsidies. That would certainly have been a better response  at this time than continuing the universal import restrictions that punish  equally those trading with subsidies and those without.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sevastopol, 28 Jun -- Interviewed by the KRYMSKIYE  IZVESTIYA [CRIMEAN NEWS] newspaper, Serhiy Nikulin, leader of  the Russia grouping at the Supreme Council of Crimea and  chairman of its nation-building, legislation, legality, law and  order standing committee, accused Yuriy Meshkov and Yevhen  Saburov, the autonomy's president and deputy prime minister  respectively, of "attempts to gain absolute power" in Crimea and  "place themselves outside any control by parliament, as happened  in Russia after the shooting at the Supreme Soviet."    Serhiy Nikulin says this began with "the Crimean  presidential  administration and government moving away from the political  forces that ensured Yuriy Meshkov's victory in the presidential  election." He doubts whether the president intends to carry out  his pre-election program.    The Russia bloc, Serhiy Nikulin underlines, "opposes this  Crimean government's unlimited power only in order to be able on  behalf of the people to supervise its actions."</p>

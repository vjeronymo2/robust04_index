			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro sharply ahead at NKr3bn Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly-quoted company, yesterday reported a sharp increase in 1993 profits, helped by lower costs, higher crude oil production and the disposal of the group's 38.3 per cent stake in Freia Marabou, the Norwegian chocolate producer. It also plans to spend between NKr600m and NKr700m on expanding its three PVC plants. If the plan is adopted later this year annual production of the raw material S-PVC will rise to 400,000 tonnes a year over a four-year period, from the current figure of 265,000 tonnes. European capacity is almost 6m tonnes a year, and PVC prices have fared relatively well in a petrochemical sector dogged by overcapacity in Europe. Norsk Hydro's net profits in 1993 advanced to NKr3bn (Dollars 403m) - including a pre-tax gain of NKr2.53bn from the Freia disposal - from NKr1.8bn in 1992. Excluding the gain, net profit was NKr1.2bn. The board proposed lifting the 1993 dividend to NKr3.50 a share from NKr3 in 1992. Group operating profit rose by 37 per cent to NKr4.04bn from NKr3bn as sales increased by NKr4.23n to NKr62.4bn. 'Prices for most of our core products have been very low, but this was largely offset by a higher exchange rate for the US dollar. The improvement was due primarily to lower production costs and higher crude oil production,' Mr Egil Myklebust, president, said. Hydro said the weak international economy and large exports from the former Soviet Union have depressed markets and continue to cause uncertainty, particularly for light metals. Low crude oil prices and continuing structural problems in the European fertiliser industry also represent challenges, it added. Group financial costs last year were cut to NKr1.94bn from NKr2.62bn a year earlier as foreign exchange losses fell sharply to NKr496m from NKr1.4bn. For the group's core business segments, agriculture swung to an operating profit of NKr481m in 1993 from a loss of NKr215m as sales rose by NKr1.5bn to NKr26.9bn. The advance was due to significantly lower costs following two years of restructuring, and higher sales volume in Europe. In 1992 Hydro charged accounts with restructuring costs NKr160m, but since 1991 costs have been cut by NKr922m, far above a goal of NKr800m set by the company. Oil and gas boosted 1993 operating profit by NKr497m to NKr3.15bn as sales rose by NKr1.41bn to NKr14.1bn. Petroleum production increased by 1.1m tonnes of oil equivalent to 9.4m, helped by two new fields being brought on stream. Light metals, the only one of the group's divisions to suffer a setback, saw operating profits fall NKr92m to NKr453m as sales rose NKr69m to NKr16.3bn. Weaker prices for primary aluminium and lower demand for aluminium extrusions were behind the decline.</p>

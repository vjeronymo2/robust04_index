The conference relayed the  guidelines of the national judicial, procuratorial, and court  work conference and the Second (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the  Sixth Municipal Party Committee. It also arranged, according to  the requirements for setting up the socialist market economic  system and quickening the development of the municipality, the  1994 municipal judicial, procuratorial, and court work. The  conference put forward: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the basic line of the party, we should  comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party  congress and the third plenary session of the 14th party Central  Committee; persist in the principle of "taking a two-hand  approach and being sure that both hands are tough"; further  strengthen and reform the judicial, procuratorial, and court  work to suit the requirements of setting up the socialist market  economic system; intensify the functions for exercising people's  democratic dictatorship; forcefully deal blows to various  criminal activities; firmly attend to investigating and handling  major and appalling cases in the course of opposing corruption;  provide legal guarantees and services for the socialist market  economy; safeguard political and social stability; and create a  good social environment for accelerating the municipality's  reform, opening up, and economic development.    Present at the conference were municipal leaders, including  Gao Dezhan, Zhang Lichang, Li Jianguo, Li Shenglin, Liu Jinfeng,  Yang Zhihua, Song Pingshun, Zheng Zhiying, Zhang Baifeng, Zhang  Dequan, and Zhang Guanwen.    Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee,  fully  affirmed the municipality's judicial, procuratorial, and court  work in his speech. He also extended cordial regards and  heartfelt thanks to the vast number of cadres and policemen, the  armed police officers and men, and all comrades who have  diligently been working on the municipal judicial,  procuratorial, and court fronts. He pointed out: 1994 is a key  year to accelerate the municipality's reform, opening up, and  modernization. Therefore, grasping favorable opportunities to  quicken the pace of reform, opening up, and economic development  is the major tasks of this year. There must be a stable social  environment in order to quicken the pace of development. It is  of peculiar importance and urgency to safeguard social and  political stability under the new situation. So, we must put  the safeguarding of stability in an extremely important  position. The more we accelerate reform, opening up, and  economic development, the more we should strengthen judicial,  procuratorial, and court work and try every possible means to  safeguard political and social stability. The party and  government leading cadres at various levels should persist in  the principle of "taking a two-hand approach and being sure that  both hands are tough"; accurately handle the relationship among  reform, development, and stability; conscientiously analyze  various unstable factors at the time of grasping favorable  opportunities to speed up the pace of development; adopt  effective measures to safeguard social and political stability;  and ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and  economic construction.    Gao Dezhan urged: The judicial, procuratorial, and court  fronts should conscientiously do their duties and go all out to  ensure the municipality's political and social stability. We  should realistically expand the extent of sternly dealing blows  to serious criminal activities and strictly and rapidly punish  serious criminal offenders according to the law. We should  persistently and ceaselessly wage the struggle for "wiping out  pornography" and "eliminating six evils" and resolutely uproot  various kinds of social evil phenomena. We should  conscientiously study and accurately handle the contradictions  among the people themselves in the new situation and enhance our  foresight to do our work. We should actively engage ourselves  in the anticorruption struggle and concentrate energy on  investigating and handling major and appalling cases. We should  strengthen the construction of the legal system and strengthen  and improve judicial work, the enforcement of administrative  laws, and supervision over the enforcement of laws. Persistently  in the light of the principle on linking special work with the  mass line, we should mobilize social forces, conscientiously  fulfill our responsibilities, and exert great efforts to  comprehensively improve social order. We should firmly foster  the thinking of relying on the masses to safeguard social and  political stability, further extensively disseminate and  mobilize the masses, truly rely on the masses, do more good and  concrete deeds for the people, and really enjoy the support of  the people. Strictly in line with the principle that "whoever  takes charge should assume responsibility," each level should  attend to and guide the work of each lower level and assume  responsibility for the fulfillment of the work of each lower  level.    Gao Dezhan stressed: The party committees and governments at  various levels should pay attention to the judicial,  procuratorial, and court work and realistically strengthen and  improve the party's leadership over judicial, procuratorial, and  court work. We should support and guide the judicial,  procuratorial, and court departments to persist in the basic  line of the party; eliminate their obstacles and interference;  strictly enforce laws; suit the new situation of setting up the  socialist market economic system; strengthen investigations and  study on judicial, procuratorial, and court work; forcefully  give instructions according to principles and policies; and  elevate the municipality's judicial, procuratorial, and court  work to a new height. It is necessary to realistically  strengthen the construction of the judicial, procuratorial, and  court workers contingents; fill the entire cadres and  policemen's brains with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and upgrade  their awareness of firmly implementing the basic line of the  party. We should achieve training in a well- organized and  well-planned manner so as to upgrade the broad masses of cadres  and policemen's political integrity and professional ability.  We should strictly conduct education, establish strict  demands, strictly strengthen management, further strengthen the  improvement of administrative honesty, and educate cadres and  policemen to be the first in diligently and honestly performing  official duties. The leading bodies of the judicial,  procuratorial, and court departments at various levels should  realistically attend to their self-construction and actually  have perfect political integrity, perfect work style, and  perfect work performances.    Song Pingshun, standing committee member of the  municipality,  vice mayor of the municipality, and secretary of the committee  for political science and law under the municipal party  committee, arranged the municipality's judicial, procuratorial,  and court work. He said: We should adopt effective measures to  safeguard the municipality's political and social stability,  timely alleviate various contradictions and disputes, and  eliminate unstable factors. It is necessary to achieve the  struggle for dealing strict blows to serious criminal offenders  and to upgrade the prestige and quality of the struggle. We  should strictly attack various kinds of serious criminal  activities and continue to especially wage the struggle against  thefts so as to continuously keep the social order stable. We  should resolutely and strictly punish, according to the law,  serious economic criminal activities, carefully organize and  concentrate forces to prominently investigate and handle major  and appalling cases, deepen the struggle against corruption, and  safeguard the socialist market economic order. We should deepen  the overall improvement of social order, conscientiously  implement the system that leaders bear the responsibility for  safeguarding social order, enable the party and government  leaders at various levels to enhance the sense of responsibility  for ensuring that the localities to which they belong should be  safe and sound, enable the broad masses of the people to  participate in the improvement of social order, actually form a  pattern of making concerted efforts to improve social order,  organize all social forces to make key improvements and solve  prominent problems relating to social order, exert great efforts  to improve the social order of rural areas, implement various  measures for comprehensively improving social order, make better  use of legal means to timely and legally regulate various  economic and social relations, and ensure that the socialist  market economy is smoothly operating on the orbit of the legal  system. We should focus on opposing corruption and advocating  administrative honesty to achieve the construction of the  judicial, procuratorial, and court workers contingents; and  provide a forceful organizational guarantee for achieving  judicial, procuratorial, and court work in the new situation.    Responsible comrades of the municipal security bureau, the  municipal people's procuratorate, the municipal higher people's  court, and the municipal judicial bureau respectively made  speeches on achieving 1994 judicial, procuratorial, and court  work tasks. Present at the conference were responsible comrades  of departments committees, offices, districts, counties,  bureaus, and mass organizations, as well as responsible persons  of the committees and departments for political science and law  at the municipal, district, and county levels; security  departments under various bureaus; and some large- and  medium-sized enterprises.</p>

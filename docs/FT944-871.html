			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Rules tightened on financial controls Listed companies will have to make a statement in their accounts next year describing their internal financial controls or face censure by the Stock Exchange. The new rules were published yesterday by a working group on internal control convened at the request of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance. Mr Paul Rutteman, chairman of the group, which includes representatives of the Hundred Group of Finance Directors, said: 'The focus on the effectiveness of a company's system of internal control will add to shareholder confidence in UK listed companies.' The Cadbury committee, which issued its report at the end of 1992, advised companies to provide a statement of internal controls in their accounts, which led to the creation of the working party. Companies are not forced to comply, but any quoted business that does not must note in its accounts that it fails to meet this requirement of the Cadbury code on pain of reprimand from the Stock Exchange. Failures in internal financial controls have been identified as the key element in several corporate failures in recent years. Effective internal controls include regular training in financial instruments, authorisation limits, segregation of duties and the production of accurate and regular business statistics. The guidance requires that directors. State that they are responsible for internal financial controls. Explain that such a system is no guarantee against loss or misstatement. Describe the key procedures of financial control in the company. Confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness of the controls. Comment where weaknesses in systems have resulted in 'material losses, contingencies or uncertainties' which require disclosure. The guidance comes into force from January 1, although there are transitional arrangements which will allow some companies to report on systems in place after July 1.</p>

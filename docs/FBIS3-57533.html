			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The morning proceedings of the Belarusian parliament  session have begun with miscellaneous matters on the agenda.  The people's deputies addressed the problems of the Belarusian  Peasant Party and the Minsk Tractor Factory, and honored the  memory of writer Ales Adamovich by a minute of silence. Then it  was resolved to hold necessary consultations to select  candidates for the post of the Supreme Soviet chairman.  However, even after a two-hour break in the proceedings, during  which the sessions of the Supreme Soviet Presidium and  parliamentary factions took place, the people's deputies deemed  this issue to be unprepared for broad discussion. They decided  to fully devote today's proceedings in commissions and deputy  factions to the nomination of candidates for the post of the  Supreme Soviet chairman. This issue is expected to be discussed  at the plenary session tomorrow.</p>

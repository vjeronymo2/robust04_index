It has been his style since he left the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP), which often made crucial decisions in high-class  Japanese restaurants during its 38-year-old grip on power that  ended last August.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition government  shuns  such posh "ryotei" restaurants and many of them, already hit  hard by the burst of Japan's bubble economy, are going under one  after another.    Policy-makers of the seven-party coalition such as the  51-year-old Ozawa make decisions with help from a handful of  bureaucrats bargaining on crucial issues behind closed doors,  sources said.    Ozawa, co-leader of the Shinseito Party and a faithful  servant of one-time LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru, is a strategist  who has sometimes disappeared from reporters and the public to  persuade Hosokawa to decide on such key issues as a cabinet  change and tax hikes.    During their reign, LDP faction leaders and senior  policy-makers held their "backroom" talks in restaurants and  made bargains on Diet business with leaders of then opposition  parties.    Ozawa is known as a "kuromaku," or mastermind who pulled the  strings from behind the scenes to topple the government of Prime  Minister Kiichi Miyazawa last year, ending the LDP's 38-year  reign of power.    He and dozens of his fellow parliamentarians, once members  of  the LDP's strongest faction led by former Prime Minister Noboru  Takeshita, bolted from the LDP and formed a new party last June.    Ozawa has stepped out of the public eye since Hosokawa  failed  to reshuffle the cabinet on March 2, a move that was chiefly  aimed at removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.  Ozawa was seen as the key person backing the reshuffle, the  sources said.    Ozawa, once dubbed the "prince of the LDP" before leaving  the  party, also temporarily disappeared from reporters in December  after catching the ire of the press with his statement that he  was holding news conferences as a "service."    During that time, Ozawa reportedly demanded that Hosokawa  remove Takemura from his cabinet, sources said. Takemura and  Ozawa hold differing ideas, including about the realignment of  Japanese politics.    In addition, Ozawa also helped fashion a 7 percent national  welfare tax scheme in early February, which was promptly  withdrawn because of strong opposition from both inside and  outside the fragile coalition.    Prime Minister Hosokawa publicly apologized for the welfare  tax and Takemura episodes, but Ozawa managed to avoid bearing  the brunt of the failures.    Ozawa, who in early January ended his two-month-old  self-imposed ban on news conferences, is once again out of sight.    The Japanese public seems to be frustrated because  Hosokawa's  promised "change" has not materialized despite the change of  venues of politicking from "ryotei" restaurants to hotels and  other secluded places.    Will Mr. Ozawa, who has promised to make Japan a credible  world power, please stand up?</p>

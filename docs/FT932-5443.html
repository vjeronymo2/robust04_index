			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Warsaw slows after meteoric advance - But share prices have risen by 175 per cent since Easter Warsaw's Stock Exchange (WSE), which has experienced a spectacular rise since Easter, seemed to be slowing down this week. But many of the 100,000 people who now have accounts with brokers enabling them to buy and sell the 18 quoted stocks are still hoping that the bonanza will continue. The WSE, which was set up in April 1991, is modelled on the French order driven system, with share prices allowed to move by no more than 10 per cent up or down per session. But it only really caught the popular imagination in the past two months as share prices started to rise, sometimes by ten per cent, on each of the three days a week that the exchange is open for trading. Turnover rose, too, from around 30bn zloty per session in the first months of the year to around 350bn zloty in the past few days with a record 414bn zloty (Dollars 24.4m) on Monday when the average share price rose by a mere 3 per cent; this presaged a 2 per cent fall on Tuesday, turnover easing to 354bn zloty. Since Easter the WIG index, the exchange's main indicator, has risen by 175 per cent from 1,350 to Tuesday's 3,710, delighting Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the WSE chairman. But Mr Rozlucki is now urging investors to be prudent out of fear of the damage the exchange could suffer as the result of a crash. The rise in equities has come against a background of a slight dip in bank interest rates which prompted savers to look elsewhere to make their investment. However, as Mr Rozlucki likes to point out, the exchange is still so small that it would take a mere two per cent of people's bank deposits to buy every stock quoted on the exchange. Even now, the exchange's capitalisation has reached no more than Dollars 782m. At the same time the past few months have seen investors from abroad, who now account for 25 per cent of daily turnover, moving in with regular buy orders for each session giving prices their steady upward trend. These include around five investment funds led by Invesco's CEAM, one of the earliest investors on the WSE. In turn, this upward trend has attracted the attention of speculative money, almost literally off the streets with people in the last few weeks buying stocks with scant regard for company prospects, profits or p/e ratios but mesmerised by the fact that a near-30 per cent, untaxed, profit was to be made in some weeks. The scale of 'investor' interest can be measured by the fact that 19,000 new accounts have been opened with brokers since the end of March. The market has tended to favour companies such as Electrim, a telecommunications and power equipment trader, Wedel, which is controlled by PepsiCo, and Mostostal, a building company; all of these are seen as having good prospects. The rise, of course has also lifted price/earnings ratios, from an average of 3 in the early months of this year to around 10 at present. The excitement has spilled over into new issues, with queues forming days ahead of the recent sale of the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which was heavily oversubscribed, and which should give the purchasers a handsome bonus when first quoted on the exchange on June 22. Queues have already formed for two other issues, the Vistula garment factory in Krakow and a meat works in Sokolow Podlaski, which make their debut on June 7, and also promise to be a success. However, companies quoted on the exchange have not taken advantage of the market's mood to raise money through new share issues. Nor, indeed, has the privatisation ministry moved quickly to make new public offers, or private companies decided to go public. Admittedly such procedures take time, but by the time the principals get around to it, the exchange may be on the way down. Part of the reason for the delay is that equity offers oblige ompanies to divulge information about their results and, in some cases, dilute existing management control. Polish companies, and foreign companies operating in Poland remain wary of that.</p>

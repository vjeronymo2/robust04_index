			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (17): A tough negotiator - Profile of Hans Tietmeyer HANS TIETMEYER, vice-president of the German Bundesbank, is the most forceful exponent of the stern monetary lore which now, for better or for worse, guides the European economy. The burly 61-year-old - who between 1982 and end-1989 was the principal state secretary in the Bonn finance ministry  -has been for years a familiar sight on the international economic circuit. He gained a formidable reputation as a tough-minded negotiator and a hard-working proponent of Germany's 'stability first' financial policies. In terms of time spent on the job, Mr Tietmeyer was able to slip into slightly lower gear when he took up a seat on the Bundesbank's directorate at the beginning of 1990. But his international and domestic policy-making role has become more important - for three reasons. First, as the result of the resignation of Mr Karl Otto Pohl the then president, Mr Tietmeyer moved up abruptly in August 1991 to the post of vice-president. He has maintained his responsibilities for the Bundesbank's international monetary business. Mr Tietmeyer is Chancellor Helmut Kohl's choice to take over as president next summer when Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank chief, retires. Barring accidents, Mr Tietmeyer thus looks likely to become the third Bundesbank president (the other two were Mr Pohl and his predecessor, Mr Otmar Emminger) to take over the top job after a thorough grooming in international monetary affairs. Second, the Bundesbank's direct responsibilities now extend across a larger Germany. As a confidant of Mr Kohl, Mr Tietmeyer played a powerful part in spring 1990 in deciding the monetary aspects of the German unification process. Third, Mr Tietmeyer has been given additional prominence by the long-running debate over European economic and monetary union (Emu). He drafted the Bundesbank's policy statements on the issue - notably its declarations in September 1990 and in February 1992.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / NHS accused of race discrimination THE NATIONAL Health Service has been accused by the Commission for Racial Equality of discriminating against ethnic-minority nurses by putting them on lower pay grades than other NHS workers. At the same time, the CRE has announced it is to investigate whether ethnic-minority doctors get the same opportunities when they apply for top NHS jobs as their white colleagues. A shake-up of pay for all nurses, midwives and health visitors with clinical responsibilities took place in 1988. All jobs were evaluated and new grades were drawn up. More than 137,000 nurses - a quarter of the workforce - have lodged appeals against the grades awarded to them. When the regrading exercise was launched, no one in the health service considered the possibility of racial discrimination and no attempt was made to monitor by ethnic origin, the results of regrading the CRE said. Yet the nature of the regrading meant that 'there was ample opportunity for local managers to treat staff unfavourably on racial grounds'. Those in nurse management were relatively inexperienced in their personnel functions and key staff were given very little training in job evaluation, the CRE found. It reports union allegations that many nursing auxiliaries and enrolled nurses - among whom ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented - were automatically placed in the lowest grades, without any attempt to assess the work they were doing. The CRE said it was impossible to gauge how many nurses had suffered discrimination during the regrading - 20 race complaints had been registered with industrial tribunals - but that was likely to be only the surface of the problem, it said. On top jobs for doctors, the commission said there had been several successful complaints by ethnic minority doctors to industrial tribunals. The Health Department was unable to comment.</p>

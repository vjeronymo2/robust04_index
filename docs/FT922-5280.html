			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Ceasefire in Sarajevo as sanctions take effect: Demonstrators against war in Bosnia march through Serbian capital WARRING FACTIONS in the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo agreed to a ceasefire yesterday, in response to the sweeping sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro by the United Nations on Saturday. The ceasefire news came after 50,000 demonstrators marched through Belgrade to protest against the war in Bosnia and to show support for those trapped in Sarajevo. Yugoslav federal troops and Serb irregulars had continued to bombard Sarajevo and the Croatian Adriatic city of Dubrovnik despite the sanctions. The latter suffered nine hours of heavy shelling yesterday before a UN ceasefire took effect. The UN Security Council voted on Saturday to isolate Serbia and Montenegro, which comprise Yugoslavia's rump federation, through a trade ban including an oil embargo. The sanctions resolution also cuts all air links, freezes Serbia's financial assets overseas, calls for a reduction in the size of its diplomatic missions and bars Yugoslav representatives from sports events and cultural exchanges. In London, the Trade and Industry Department said some export licences, granted to 50-60 UK companies to supply goods to Serbia and Montenegro, were revoked. Trading links with the Serbian-led remnant of Yugoslavia were severed at 11.30 am yesterday. The Treasury said it had taken action to block Serbian assets from midnight last night. The International Football Federation (FIFA) said it was disqualifying Yugoslavia from international football competition, including the European nations championship finals this month in Sweden. The International Olympic Committee is to meet next week to decide whether Yugoslavia may take part in the Barcelona games this summer. Serb leaders from the ruling Socialist party condemned the sanctions as 'an aggression against the legal, economic and political order'. President Slobodan Milosevic said defiantly that Serbia was 'paying the price for protecting its fellow Serbs'. Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, foreign minister, told Belgrade Radio: 'We will make efforts to make the whole world, especially the Security Council, get the full picture about our attempts to stop the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'The cloud which will come over us will disappear. Serbia will do everything to solve the existing problems in a satisfactory way and as quickly as possible,' he added. UN and Bosnian officials said Serb and Moslem-Croat forces in Sarajevo accepted a ceasefire to start at 6pm (1600 GMT) today. Mr Mile Akmadzic, secretary-general in Bosnia's collective Moslem-Croat presidency, told a televised news conference the pact had been brokered by Colonel John Wilson, a UN peace-keeping officer in Sarajevo. 'We will also start urgent negotiations with the federal army and (UN peace-keepers) to reopen Sarajevo airport and an air corridor over Bosnia,' Mr Akmadzic added, without elaboration. The ceasefire could represent the start of a long and difficult process aimed at sending food, medical and humanitarian supplies into the city. Humanitarian agencies have been unable to penetrate a Serb blockade of Sarajevo for weeks. Mass hunger and sickness are reported in the city of 500,000 people. The renewed barrages against Sarajevo and Dubrovnik had suggested some Serb militia and Yugoslav army troops were beyond political control. Ms Zana Misovic, a Radio Sarajevo journalist contacted by telephone, said the local militia forces were out of control, and that fighting continued in Dobrinja, a suburb of Sarajevo. 'We welcome the sanctions against Serbia, but they are too late. We are afraid that the ceasefire will allow the Serb militia to regroup,' she said. She felt only military intervention could save the city from destruction.

The two sides announced after the meeting that Russia and  the  United States are still partners, although they will have  differences forever.    The statement indicates the U.S.-Russian relations of  partnership will go ahead on a road full of zigzags.    In a world characterized by multi-polarity instead of the  bi-polarity structure, both the United States and Russia are  paying great attention to their mutual relations.    The two heads of state met thrice last year in an effort to  establish a new-type relationship marked by mutual interests,  cooperation and mutual restraint.    At the January Moscow summit this year between Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, the  two countries announced that they have "entered a new phase of  mature strategic relations of partnership."    However, as the situation in Russia and the international  situation evolve, the two countries have neither solved their  old differences nor prevented new ones from erupting. This has  resulted in repeated bumping and frictions between the two  countries over the past several weeks.    "A number of gaps have been appearing in the mansion of  Russo-U.S. partnership" and "Russo-U.S. relations have  experienced some of the most serious crises for the past few  years," local media reports said.    It is not accidental that great ups-and-downs have occurred  in Russo-U.S. relations only months after the Moscow summit.  Local media reports summed up the causes for this change as  follows:    -- Russia is constantly adjusting its own foreign policy,  and  is putting a particular emphasis on an independent policy in  dealing with international affairs;    -- Russia is trying to strengthen its impact and role in  other former Soviet republics to check the expansion of the  United States in those areas; and    -- The evolution of the situation in Russia has aroused  worries in the United States and other Western countries.    Russia's effort to resume its big-power status in the  post-cold war world conflicts with the role of the U.S. as the  only remaining superpower on earth.    Russia has tried to adopt a pro-West foreign policy in order  to win Western aid. However, the policy has not helped Russia  tide over its economic crisis or establish a market economy that  would help the country integrate with the Western world.    Instead, the policy has greatly weakened Russia's impact and  role in the international scene and, to the dismay of many  Russians, the country has lost some of its traditional spheres  of influence.    Yeltsin pointed out recently that Russia's foreign policy is  mainly aimed at "realizing its national interests" and its  diplomatic ideas should always "conform with the supreme  standard of big-power status."    He called for an end to "the situation of faulty and  unilateral concessions" by Russia when it deals with Western  countries.    The Russian foreign minister also said recently that it is a  "fanatical illusion" to wish that the world will be ruled by  only one power -- the United States.    The differences between Russia and the United States were  fully shown in the course of the Bosnia crisis.    Russia, as an active mediator in the Bosnia war and as a  traditional friend of the Serbs, was kept out of the door when  NATO decided in mid-February to press the Serbs to withdraw  heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo with threats of air strikes.    Russia countered the NATO decision by persuading the Serbs  to  withdraw the weaponry on time and sending several hundred  Russian soldiers to Sarajevo. This foiled NATO's plan for air  strikes and increased Russia's confidence in resuming its role  in solving major international crises.    Washington, furious with Russia's action on Bosnia,  retaliated by arresting a senior CIA officer for spying for  Russia, and by expelling a Russian diplomat.    The United States has also been active in expanding into  former Soviet republics ranging from the Baltic nations to  Kazakhstan. The U.S. secretary of state visited almost all the  former Soviet republics, promising things from aid in the  removal of nuclear warheads to "democratic partnership" pacts.    The U.S. supported the Baltic states' call for Russian  troops withdrawal, provided aid to Ukraine at a time when Kiev  was quarreling with Russia over the natural gas supply, invited  Kazakhstan and some other Central Asia republics to cooperate  with NATO, and supported Georgia's call for sending  international peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia.    Russia, which regards these areas as its spheres of special  interests and responsibility, apparently considers the U.S.  move as a kind of threat to its own security.    Meanwhile, Russia's ever-changing domestic situation has  been  marked since last December by the victory of the right-wing  nationalists in parliamentary elections, the resigning of  pro-West economists from the government, and the amnesty by the  state Duma to free former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and  former parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov.    All this has aroused worries and scepticism in the West over  the future of Russia's "democratic and market economic reforms."    Former U.S. President Richard Nixon, who has been on a trip  in Moscow since early March, was turned down a meeting request  [as received] with Yeltsin.    Nixon's mission is clearly to see for himself what's really  going on in Russia and to report his "data-collection" to  Clinton.    Kozyrev and Christopher agreed to further cooperation  between  their countries in dealing with crises like those in Bosnia and  the Middle East, and expressed satisfaction over the meeting.    They also agreed that the two sides would establish specific  organs for guaranteeing their relations of partnership in  dealing with international affairs.    But local media reports have expressed pessimism over  whether  such specific organs can be set up without difficulty.</p>

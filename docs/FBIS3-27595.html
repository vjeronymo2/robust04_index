The situation has attracted overseas investors into the huge  market in this field.    This is a view shared by representatives of nearly 20  overseas business offices in Beijing, as shown in recent  interviews with XINHUA when asked about China's investment  environment.    According to Chun Song-Chin, chief representative of the  Beijing office of the Lucky-Goldstar International Corporation  from the Republic of Korea, the Chinese Government has long been  aware of the importance of developing its infrastructure and has  put large sums into it, as signally manifested by its  determination to build the three gorges project and some other  large water conservancy projects.    Klaus Kaltenthaler, chief Beijing representative of  Germany's  BASF Chemical Corporation, appreciated China's rapid development  in telecommunications, saying that when the BASF came to China  at the beginning of the '80s, China's telecommunication  facilities were very backward, especially international  telecommunication services.    But now, he said, China's telecommunications system was much  better, with portable telephones and pagers widely in use.    H.T. Kung, director of the Public Relations Department of  the AT&amp;T China Company, noted that China has invested  heavily in  the development of telecommunications satellites, cables and  program- controlled telephones, which will increase the  telephone users rate from 2.15 percent of the population last  year to 3 percent this year, and the rate is expected to reach 6  to 7 percent by the end of this century.    He added that this will in turn greatly promote China's  economic development.    China's communication's development also left a strong  impression on these overseas business people.    They felt that China's transport systems have been improved  drastically, with great increases in the handling capacity of  ports like Tianjin, Dalian and Shanghai, construction of more  highways and electrification of railways, and opening of more  domestic and international air routes.    They said, however, that China's infrastructure, still a  weak  point in China's investment environment, was lagging behind  China's economic development, while from a long-term point of  view, this field holds a huge market and vast potential for  overseas investors who are also eager to be involved in this  development.    With the speeding up of China's reform and opening up, Anne  Stevenson-Yang, director of the Beijing office of the U.S.-China  Business Council which has more than 250 U.S. member  corporations, said that more and more U.S. companies want to  take part in China's construction of airports, railways,  highways and power stations, which has created a "craze" in the  U.S.    On China's working efficiency and the quality of its  personnel, these business executives believed that "the change  in people's hearts and heads" and improvement of education are  vitally important to China's reform and further improvement of  China's investment environment.    On this point, China's finance sector attracts more of their  interest. They said that they were pleased to see so many  professional Chinese people engaged in that sector.    While thinking highly of the service of China's banks, they  expressed their expectation of even better services in the  future.    Dick Liu, president of the Du Pont China Company, said that  Chinese Government officials are "more open, more cooperative  and more efficient."    He took Du Pont as an example: the first contract signed in  1991 between Du Pont and China took a year and a half to  achieve, while the second one signed last year only took a year,  and the third one which is under negotiation is expected to be  signed in several months.</p>

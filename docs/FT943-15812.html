			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: How weird air provides the crunch - David Blackwell examines Ricardo's drive into the North American automotive market A small engineering company in Detroit saved Kelloggs millions of dollars on the cost of making cornflakes through computer studies of the airflow through the cereal ovens. Mr Robert Nelson, one of the founders of Airflow Sciences, recalled the US multinational's reaction to modifications that lifted cornflake production at Battle Creek, Michigan, from 80lbs to 200lbs a minute. 'They shut down public tours of the plant - they felt they would be giving away too much.' Airflow, which looks at fluid flow and heat transfer problems, was bought last March by Ricardo, the UK consulting engineers, for Dollars 2.26m (Pounds 1.48m). Mr Christopher Ross, Ricardo chief executive, described it at the time as a company with few competitors, operating in a field that the group already understood and could manage. This fits well with the group's recent direction, as well as enhancing its drive into North America - a market where it sees strong potential growth. The North American automotive industry, which accounts for almost a third of turnover at Airflow Sciences, is returning to growth after deep recession. It is looking to improve what is known as the NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) performance of its vehicles. The big US manufacturers, which were a long way behind the Japanese on NVH, are seeking out independent consultants rather than using in-house staff and equipment. They can then benefit from the breadth of knowledge that gets stored over the years. Mr Ross believes the group is now in a position to offer a service on everything to do with a vehicle apart from designing the body shell itself. Earlier this month, Ricardo, which has experienced 25 per cent organic growth in its automotive division over the last three years, continued its drive into North America with a deal to pay Pounds 13.6m for FF Developments, the company that built the transmissions for the Jaguar 220 and the factory-prepared Ford Escorts in the world rally championship. FFD was founded in Coventry, England, in 1971 by Major Tony Rolt to apply four-wheel drive systems and anti-lock braking systems, which the group developed from the work of the pioneering Harry Ferguson. The FF of the name stems from 'Ferguson Formula.' But Mr Stuart Rolt, the major's son and current chief executive, set up a division in Detroit in 1989 after Chrysler said it would not give the group business unless it was in the US. The Detroit arm now employs 140 compared with 90 in Coventry. Realising that the interest in four-wheel drive had probably peaked, he took the company into automatic transmission design and development and chassis engineering. 'Most of our business is not four-wheel drive any more' he said in Detroit. The latest acquisition will substantially boost Ricardo's presence in the US, where it had no physical presence until 18 months ago, although it opened a consultancy in Detroit in 1992. But its most significant move before the acquisitions was to invest Dollars 4m in an engine testing facility in Chicago. The company had found the volume of business coming from North America disappointingly low, considering there was obviously a large amount to be had. However, North America is a myopic market. The US motor industry likes to deal with people near home. 'Our presence on the ground greatly increases their willingness to work with us,' said Mr John Needham, acting president of Ricardo North America. The test beds have been sited in Chicago rather than Detroit so that the group can tap into both the Detroit automobile industry and the heavy duty engine plants of Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana, where engines are made for construction, agricultural and marine equipment and power generation. Two test beds are now running, and are fully booked until the end of September. Ricardo is planning to have five running within the next five years. The amount of data collected by the test bed computer in one minute of running a single engine is enough to fill 10 computer floppy discs. By the time it is resolved into useful information, it can fill 50. Mr Needham pointed out that the new facility was still earning its stripes, but promises of repeat business were already appearing. 'The potential for growth is quite exciting,' he said. 'We have the skill base, the technology and the products.' Airflow Sciences, aside from speeding up the flow of cornflakes through Kelloggs' ovens, relies on the automotive industry for 30 per cent of sales. Near the office where the latest computers work through complex mathematical models is a building where the results are applied - a world of disembowelled cars, where technologists modify with sticky tape and cardboard parts such as the plastic ducting that demist windscreens. The computer's answers to problems often raise eyebrows. Sometimes they are greeted with disbelief, as happened when the company was asked by Bell Helmets to look at the airflow over US racing drivers' crash helmets. Three years ago, drivers in the open cockpit Indianopolis cars found that they could not use full power as their heads were vibrating so violently that they could not see. Mr Robert Gielow, Airflow founder and president, ran some tests and suggested a tiny raised V should be built into the sides of the helmets. That worked well, but since then the company has developed a flat back helmet that has dramatically reduced the 50lbs of lift which the airflow was putting on ordinary helmets at top speed. Initial resistance to the strange shape waned rapidly, and it is now used by many top names including Emmerson Fittipaldi and Al Unser Jr. The attraction of the company to Ricardo was its ability to apply computational fluid dynamics outside the automotive industry. It has done work to improve the flight of golf balls and the decaffeination of coffee, in the medical and cement industries, on the cold airflow inside refrigerated trailers and the drag outside, and on the airflow of the Channel Tunnel rail cars. But the main target is the US power industry, where legislation on emissions is helping to provide good business. At one power station the computer's suggested placement of baffles in an exhaust flue reduced particulate emissions from more than 30 per cent to such a low level that observers thought their measuring equipment had broken. 'Just a little baffle - it seems so trivial,' said Mr Nelson. But the dramatic result, which would have taken years to find through trial and error, certainly justified his enduring belief that 'air is weird.'</p>

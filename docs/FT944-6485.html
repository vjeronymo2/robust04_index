			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ameritech in Dollars 2.25bn write-down Ameritech, the Chicago-based regional telephone company, is to take a non-financial charge of Dollars 2.25bn net in the fourth quarter, resulting in a loss for the year. The charge represents a write-down in the company's asset value to reflect a more competitive market. Ameritech's move follows that of fellow regional phone companies US West, which took a Dollars 3.2bn charge in the third quarter of last year, and Bell Atlantic, which took a charge of Dollars 2.15bn in the third quarter of this year. Ameritech said it was reducing its net asset value from Dollars 17.1bn to Dollars 13.4bn. The Dollars 3.7bn write-down is reduced to Dollars 2.25bn after tax. Shareholders' equity will fall from Dollars 8.05bn to Dollars 5.74bn. Last year Ameritech made net profits of Dollars 1.5bn. The company said that in all the states in which it operates it is now regulated on the basis of price caps, rather than by the older system of return on assets. It is therefore free to reduce its assets to what it sees as their commercial value, rather than the higher figure on which its allowable return was calculated before. At the same time, Ameritech said it would shorten its depreciation schedules, which were also set previously by the regulators. It said it would now fully depreciate its analog switches and depreciate its more modern digital switches over seven years instead of 17.</p>

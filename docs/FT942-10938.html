			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Lunch with the FT: A snail man making tracks - Michael Thompson-Noel meets Dr Steve Jones, geneticist and commentator Snail platter? Snails in a spring onion sauce? Such thoughts occurred to me as I made my way to the Savoy Grill, London, for lunch with Dr Steve Jones, one of Britain's wittiest and most accessible commentators on the mysteries of science. As a malacologist and geneticist, Jones has studied snails for more than 25 years, and has said he would rather be regarded as the world's foremost snail geneticist than as a world-class communicator. Come to think of it, he added, he was the world's foremost snail geneticist; there were almost no others. In the event, I forgot about snails. We both had oeufs cocotte, after which our preferences diverged in textbook fashion: his to grilled turbot, mine to the caremalised glumness of the Savoy's braised oxtail. Anyway, says Jones, he is virtually 'snailed-out'. These days he is into slugs. 'I am used to being mocked for snails, but slugs are guaranteed to stun anyone into silence.' He is professor of genetics at the Galton Laboratory of University College, London, and gave the 1991 Reith Lectures on BBC radio on genetics and evolution. They were widely praised and led, last year, to his well-received book, The Language of the Genes, now selling briskly in paperback. He is working on a new book, Sex, Age, Death, as well as a BBC television series - seven 50-minute programmes - called Origins. I had wanted to meet him since receiving a copy of The Language of the Genes for my birthday, inscribed, erroneously, by an otherwise reliable colleague: 'To Michael, on your 50th . . . so old, yet still evolving' - an over-statement of 2.040816 per cent. Jones is 50. He was in high spirits when we met. He had just celebrated his birthday and sloughed off, after five years' toil, the 'nightmare' burden of the chairmanship of his department. He is treating 1994 as a sabbatical year. His hatred of bureaucracy runs deep. The new Britain, he has written, 'gets more like the old Soviet Union every day - forms in triplicate, reports to higher authority, and five-year plans. Nowhere is the new Stalinism more obvious than in education'. And, like many scientists, he has had immense difficulty getting funds for research - 10 appeals have been rejected. 'Over the years I have researched different things - mainly fruit flies, snails and slugs. When I was an undergraduate I was given a research project on snails, and it has taken more than 25 years to finish it. In real terms the amounts I have asked for have been going down, while the real costs have gone up, because of technology. Like health, there is no limit to the amount you can spend on science.' At least his public profile has given him the freedom to comment tartly on things that displease him, including professorial pay. I said that I imagined his book sales and journalism provided useful extra income. 'Certainly,' he said. 'My salary as a professor is Pounds 34,500; for Origins, the BBC is paying me twice that. I'm not particularly complaining about my salary, but I am complaining about trying to recruit people in their late 20s for Pounds 17,000.' He is a small and intense man, spike-haired, who speaks so quickly that it is hard to hear him properly. The day he telephoned, I had to ask him to repeat himself. 'Sorry,' he said, 'I tend to mumble.' 'Where would you like to lunch?' 'Anywhere,' he said. 'I often miss out lunch. Isn't there a restaurant at London Bridge?' 'Oh, no,' I said. 'You're thinking of one of Terry Conran's. The food's quite good but the acoustics are dreadful. I mumble, too. Anyway, for Lunch with the FT we're entitled to kill the fatted calf. I'll take you to the Savoy.' We were awarded the best table. The professor surveyed the room with immense caution. I told him that in myth, the Savoy Grill at lunch-time was populated by movers and shakers, but that in my experience most of the customers seemed obsessed with just one topic: the D-Mark-dollar rate. The professor smiled winterily. He is a humorous man himself. It is one of the reasons his book is such a good read. Yet often, humour does not travel. The Language of the Genes has already been published in the Netherlands, Germany and Korea, and a US printing is being readied, but he is not sure how it will be received in the US. In a chapter called The Evolution of Utopia, Jones says that the (fairly recent) change in human mating patterns - outbreeding - may mark the beginning of a new age of genetic well-being. 'Outbreeding,' he writes, 'is not usually due to deliberate policy. Much of it arises . . . as a by-product of social change . . . there is little doubt that the most important event in recent human evolution was the invention of the bicycle.' Fine, you might think. 'But I am having great trouble with the American editors,' says Jones. 'They didn't get the bicycle joke. I explained it. 'But the bicycle isn't very old,' they said. 'Shouldn't you say the wheel?' But then they said: 'What about Australia? The first people who got to Australia got there by boat. Shouldn't you say that the most important event in recent human evolution was the invention of transportation?'' I asked Jones whether he was fed up with people asking him to predict their gene-ordained futures - whether they would die of this disease, or that. But they do not. Jones knows which blood group he is, but almost nothing else about his own genetic make-up. And he thinks it possible that, despite rapid progress in genetics research, many people will not want to know what the future holds. Even so, genetic testing raises great ethical and practical questions. Already, for example, insurance companies are refusing to insure those doomed to Huntington's disease, and there are many ailments of a similar kind. In Britain, about 10,000 people have a one in two chance of carrying the Huntington's gene, but only a small number have come forward since the test was first offered in 1987. 'What does impress itself on me,' says Jones, 'is not curiosity about genetics but the way people blame science and scientists for bad news of all kinds. It is extraordinary. Even ostensibly well-educated people hold science accountable for the things it discovers. I tell them that the dangers from progress in genetics are far less marked than those in physics and chemistry.' At the end of The Language of the Genes, Jones argues that the human biology of the future may not be very different from that of the past. It may even be that 'humans are almost at the end of their evolutionary road, that we are as near to our biological Utopia as we are ever likely to get.' I said I thought this sounded conservative. 'Science,' agreed Jones, 'is intrinsically an intensely conservative occupation.' I said I had been struck by the difference between the short shrift he gives eugenics and his description of the potential for combatting human disease and improving the human condition offered by gene therapy and biological engineering - applied evolution. 'Surely,' I said, 'the eugenicists' basic wish, to improve the fitness of humanity, was not, in itself, contemptible? Won't genetic screening and gene therapy help do the trick? You say in your book that 'in life, tinkering works,' and that 'the new biology has brought little but benefit'.' He agreed: there could be nothing wrong with wishing to improve human health or the lot of the disadvantaged. Nor was there anything intrinsically unwise with the conviction that a smaller world population might help humanity. But he was determined to hold the line there. After all, Francis Galton, Charles Darwin's odd-ball cousin and the father of eugenics, founded the laboratory in which Jones now works at University College, London - the world's first human genetics institute. 'The agenda of the original eugenicists was to improve the human race,' said Jones, 'whereas the agenda of modern genetics is to improve the health of hundreds of thousands of people. That is the difference.' We found no time whatsoever for the D-Mark-dollar rate.</p>

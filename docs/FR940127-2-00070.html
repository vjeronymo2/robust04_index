State agencies also have new program responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Group eligibility requirements have been changed to address imports of articles from Mexico and Canada only and to authorize the certification for NAFTA&hyph;TAA of worker groups when the workers' firm shifts production to Mexico or Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Workers are required to be enrolled in training to qualify for trade readjustment allowance (TRA) payments.

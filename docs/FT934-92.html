			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Boost for rented housing urged The government should introduce new incentives to encourage greater investment in private rented housing after Business Expansion Schemes end today, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says in a report. A study by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand commissioned by the Social Research Foundation estimates that BES schemes have raised more than Pounds 2bn, providing 40,000 private-sector lettings. The foundation proposes that, in place of BES schemes, the government should create investment trusts for authorised private rented housing which would be exempt from capital gains tax. 'These would enable pension funds and other non-taxpayers to take an indirect stake in rented housing without being actively involved in landlords and without incurring tax along the way,' the foundation says. The trusts would encourage private renting without any immediate additional costs to the exchequer, it says. The foundation also recommended the introduction of capital grants for private landlords. Instead of paying grants at a flat percentage rate, landlords would bid from a cash-limited fund which would allocate money to those proposing the most effective developments. A Pounds 150m fund would be sufficient to create 15,000 more homes with a total value of Pounds 750m, the report says. It estimates that BES schemes in total had generated 60,000 lettings including those by housing associations and university accommodation but at a cost of Pounds 20,000 per dwelling in tax refunds. 'Our proposals point to a more efficient way of sustaining the momentum created by BES,' the report says. It estimates that there was still only one genuine private letting in Britain to every 20 homes in owner-occupation. This was 'inhibiting choice and creating a drag on economic efficiency'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- The Diet's budget business  remained stymied Tuesday due to a stalemate in wranglings  between the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's controversial loan.    Political sources said the chances for an early start to  deliberations on fiscal 1994 budget bills at the House of  Representatives Budget Committee are slim, predicting an impasse  to last through next week.    Hosokawa rejected the demand by the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) to summon his former aide, who was in  charge of Hosokawa's finances when he borrowed 100 million yen  from Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-tainted trucking firm. Top  LDP officials refused to take part in the Budget Committee  debate unless the seven-party coalition promised to bring the  witness before the Diet.    The LDP also decided to boycott discussions at all  committees  if the coalition opens the Budget Committee meeting without the  LDP.    LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura the LDP also demands that Hosokawa  provides more information about the loan, which the opposition  claims was an undeclared political donation.    After being briefed by Takemura on the meeting with Mori,  Hosokawa told reporters that he has no intention to agree to a  Diet testimony by his former aide.    Hosokawa has said he repaid the loan, which he says was used  for personal affairs, with interest by 1991.    Diet discussions over a full state budget for fiscal 1994,  which began Friday, have been suspended due to the stalemate.</p>

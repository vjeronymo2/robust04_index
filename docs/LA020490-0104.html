			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WEEK: 'DEATH' ONE-ACT IS CLASSIC WOODY ALLEN  </P> <P> Play it again, Woody. Hollywood's Attic Theatre is about to present its second  annual Woody Allen one-act play.  </P> <P> Last summer, Allen's "God" had a successful run there. Now comes the companion  piece, "Death" (1975), opening Friday.  </P> <P> "Kleinman is your classic Woody Allen schlemiel character," explained Attic  artistic director James Carey. "He's awakened one night by a gang of vigilantes  in search of a murdering fiend who's knocking off 6 to 12 people a night. The  police can't stop him; no one knows who he is. The vigilantes say they have a  plan -- although they never tell us what it is. Kleinman is pulled into the  chase totally unwillingly. He says things like 'Maybe my boss will be there; I  should dress for the occasion.' "  </P> <P> The ending is equally irreverent.  </P> <P> "It's very much a Woody Allen-type play -- looking at life, death, God and  sex," Carey emphasized of the hourlong piece (which will play at 8 and 10  p.m.). "Dark, yes. It's a very black comedy, and we're doing it very broadly.  The script really lends itself to a slapstick, Marx Brothers, almost burlesque  style. So the set is two-dimensional cutouts on a pulley system, and as the  characters walk across the stage, stagehands move the scenery. It's very  cartoonish and yet realistic. It has his sense of humor."  </P> <P> THEATER BUZZ: Things have been hopping at the Mark Taper Forum, where the  demand for sold-out performances of Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance Shakespeare  Company has resulted in lines at the box office beginning at 8:30 a.m. on  Saturday (the box office opens at 10 a.m.) and at 2 p.m. for the evening  performances.  </P> <P> Some of the line-dwellers also have taken up a practice used by next-door  "Phantom of the Opera" hopefuls: "borrowing" chairs from the adjacent Music  Center Plaza to ease the long wait. As a result, mid-day picnickers at the  plaza now do their lunching standing up.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, over at the Taper press office, the publicists have been busy  fielding complimentary ticket requests from an endless stream of would-be  theatergoers. Like: the out-of-town journalist, whose play reservations hadn't  been confirmed, but nonetheless called to announce that her airline  reservations were set and that she'd be arriving that weekend.  </P> <P> Or the writer from a late-night talk show who called one of the publicists many  times each day for a week, offering "special" passes for the free tapings of  his show as reciprocation for tickets. Or the friends (and friends of friends)  who hadn't been heard from in years. Or all the callers claiming to be  reporters.  </P> <P> Said the publicist: "I've certainly found out about a lot of newspapers, radio  programs and cable TV shows I'd never heard of before."  </P> <P> CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: In spite of the public clamor, local reviewers were mixed  in their appraisal of the Renaissance's Company's repertory program of "King  Lear" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream."  </P> <P> Said Sylvie Drake in The Times: "What's lacking all around is substance.  Penetration. Subtlety. Branagh's world is a place without nuance, a long drink  of cold water, limpid, refreshing, healthy but without aftertaste. The  productions . . . explode. They don't dig deep and don't touch us deeply."  </P> <P> In the Hollywood Reporter, Ed Kaufman said of "Lear": "What the talented and  inventive Branagh has done is to make Shakespeare accessible for all; yet in so  doing, he has virtually stripped the figurative quality (and so the  metaphysical 'overview') from a tragedy that questions everything.."  </P> <P> In reviewing "Lear," Daily Variety's Jim Farber wrote: "Branagh, as director,  shows himself a young man willing to take on the biggest challenges, able to  give 'Lear' a sense of grit and violence, but not ready to instill the  experience with the multiplicity of layers that complete the drama."  </P></p>

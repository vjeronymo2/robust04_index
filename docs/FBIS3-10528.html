			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "To Serve </F> the Country Until the End"]    [Text] While the stock exchanges reflected a bull market  following the announcement of the economic plan's new stage,  another kind of speculation took place in Brasilia about who  could replace Finance and Economy Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso in his post. The point is that since it is thought that  Cardoso will be nominated as a presidential candidate by his  party, it is reasonable to begin speculating on who will  administer the economic plan. The difference between the stock  exchanges and the speculations in Brasilia is that in the former  ones investors are concerned with gaining or losing cruzeiros  based on real assets; while in the latter case the players are  making speculations without knowing the balance that the auditor  of "Brazil company" (that is, the president of the Republic)  will present, and exerting pressure on Mr. Itamar Franco,  through daring bids, to make him accept either this or that  candidate who appeals most to the new-style technocrats or the  new-generation politicians. As always, Brasilia does not live in  the real world. While the politicians debate whether a minister  is leaving to become a candidate, they forget that the economic  plan's success lies mainly in the credibility given to it by the  economic agents. It is evident that in the past few months such  credibility was not given to the economic team as a whole, but  to the finance minister. We are not trying to discredit the  university professors that counsel Minister Cardoso, but the  truth cannot be hidden. There is only one truth: After defeating  resistance inside and outside the administration, after scoring  accomplishments and consenting to minor defeats on several  fronts, Cardoso is the indicated person to administer the  economic plan, which is a much more difficult task than creating  it because he will have to confront the labor unions, the price  increases that can be considered sabotage, the temptation to  call on the "old lady" (Sunab [National Supply Superintendency])  to control whether prices are within the average increases of  the previous four months or if there have been abusive hikes,  and those who think it is much easier to freeze prices than to  live with the market fluctuations.    Even understanding that the party leaders keep an eye on the  presidential race, we cannot forget that the defense of the  economic plan's rational part will allow the presidential race  -- which has great political and social meaning -- to develop  normally. A failure of the economic plan will affect the  electoral atmosphere in such a way that the election campaign  will become a real "battle" (in the past, candidates simply ran  for elections); a success in the economic plan, even if partial,  will make the attacks the candidates will throw at each other at  least civilized, as expected by the public. A failure will  mainly favor those who fish in troubled waters, while a success  will favor those who defend democratic normalcy.    Speculations about who will replace the finance minister  only  help wear out the economic plan. How many people used to  ironically say before Provisional Measure No. 434 was published  that the plan would be a great election campaign? How many  politicians disapproved the provisional measure in case Minister  Cardoso left his post, called by the PSDB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party] to run against Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva?  However, if the minister leaves his post to become a  presidential candidate, the public will believe the economic  plan had electoral purposes; consequently, it will be easy to  discredit the economic plan, something that will benefit a few  speculators in the stock exchanges or in other alternative  circles like in the campaign to discredit the regime. To suppose  that the execution of the economic plan will be the same without  Minister Cardoso is to be extremely naive. For months Minister  Cardoso worked hard on the most difficult part of his task,  which was to convince President Itamar Franco not to break  contracts or impose a price freeze. This was possible thanks  only to the personality of Minister Cardoso and his undeniable  influence on the chief of state. Whoever was to replace the  finance minister, no matter how much political support he may  have, would have to go through the daily ordeal of first  convincing his aides and then the president himself to impose  his views, without being sure of having the same prestige as his  predecessor. Once outside the government, it will be useless for  Fernando Henrique Cardoso to try to influence President Itamar  Franco or his Juiz de Fora intimate circle. Whoever goes  outside, remains outside. When accepting President Itamar  Franco's invitation to become finance minister, Fernando  Henrique Cardoso knew he made a choice deep down: to postpone  his personal political plans, replacing them with the valuable  task of re-establishing the country's confidence in its  currency. Now, he must stick with this task until the end, under  the penalty of becoming another former finance minister who  gives his opinion about his successors' savior economic plans in  the future.</p>

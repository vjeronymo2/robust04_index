			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Linread 23% up despite exceptional Linread, the Midlands-based fasteners and precision components group, brought forward the announcement of its annual results to announce a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits and an increased dividend. This follows a warning last December that exceptional charges in the second half would be double those of the first, indicating a total for the year of about Pounds 800,000 to pay for restructuring. However, by bringing forward restructuring plans for this year the exceptional charge was higher at Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 743,000). But this still left pre-tax profits for the 12 months to December 31 at Pounds 857,000, against Pounds 697,000 restated for FRS 3 and to reflect changes in the accounting policy for a leasehold property. Earnings per share were 3.88p against a restated 2.21p. The proposed final dividend is lifted to 2.35p (2.25p) making a total of 3.92p (3.75p). Turnover was lower at Pounds 36.4m (Pounds 37.8m) while operating profits fell from Pounds 1.49m to Pounds 1.08m. The pre-tax advance reflected a sharp reduction in interest payable to Pounds 225,000 (Pounds 794,000). This fall came because of tighter stock controls related to the greater efficiency of the group's manufacturing techniques. Gearing was cut from 50.1 per cent to 28.4 per cent. The tax charge, at Pounds 384,000 (Pounds 428,000), was again 'abnormally high'. The group has now finished its immediate restructuring programme and expects to benefit quickly from any upturn in its main automotive and aerospace markets. 'In certain sectors we anticipate increasing our market share, particularly in North America,' Mr Peter Tahany, the chairman, said. The shares rose 18p to 134p.</p>

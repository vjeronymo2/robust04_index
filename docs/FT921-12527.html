			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / IG Metall chief urges strike THE leader of the IG Metall union yesterday urged German steel workers to vote for a strike in the official ballot which starts tomorrow. However, he said later that the way was still open for a fresh offer from employers. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the union president, was loudly cheered as he told a meeting of about 4,000 members in Duisburg that the time for talking was over. Reminding his audience that the outcome of the confrontation would affect all German pay negotiations this year, he said there would be no more dealings. 'The cards will be shuffled again on Sunday,' he added. At a subsequent press conference, however, he said there was nothing to stop employers from presenting a new offer between ballot and strike. Workers at the meeting appeared to be enthusiastic about possible action. 'It's strike weather,' one said, although the mood was more subdued earlier in the day when the town was shrouded in fog and ice. While there was some anger about the employers' offer of about 5.5 per cent, there was also concern that the union had lowered its official 10.5 per cent claim to around 6.5 per cent, and worry about job security. Duisburg is one of several north-western towns likely to be hit this year by a renewed wave of steel industry job losses. The ballot of union members - 100,000 out of a total industry workforce of 135,000 - will end on Thursday, with the result expected to be announced on Friday.</p>

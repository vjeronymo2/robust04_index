			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The North Korea-U.S. Nuclear Negotiations in </F> Which the United States Made Compromises"]    [Text] A high-ranking U.S. Government official confirmed  that North Korea and the United States agreed on a one-time  inspection of seven nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. Therefore,  it seems that the tedious nuclear tug-of-war has overcome one  stage for the time being. The result of this negotiation may  have been a choice under the necessity of avoiding a  catastrophe. It is a result which is somewhat unsatisfactory.    What was agreed upon at the negotiations between North Korea  and the United States was to carry out limited inspection. This  is an agreement which is worse than the conditions that were met  before North Korea announced it would withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] in March of 1993. North Korea is  claiming that since it has withheld its withdrawal from the NPT,  it is not a full member country of the NPT. Therefore, it is  saying that allowing the one-time inspection is not an  obligation but a form of cooperation.    This does not even meet the condition of the ordinary  [tongsang] inspection that could have been carried out before  the demand for inspection was made by the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] on unreported nuclear facilities in  Yongbyon. As such, North Korea is carrying out acts lacking  international level but on the other hand it is gaining profits.  North Korea has fulfilled its demand of making us withhold the  Team Spirit exercise and obtained direct contact with the United  States since March. While North Korea achieved such results,  not one demand by our side was met.    In the beginning, the United States had demanded that North  Korea accept complete nuclear inspections. However, the United  States made a strategic compromise as a last resort to make  North Korea receive complete nuclear inspections by committing  North Korea to the NPT system. The U.S. plan is that rather  than breaking off negotiations, it hopes to maintain a dialogue  to consecutively resolve issues at the next high-level talks.    Therefore, the remaining problem at this point is on how  negotiations will progress between North Korea and the IAEA to  discuss the method and time of the inspection. It is uncertain  whether the IAEA will agree on the method of a one-time  inspection which will stop at examining the continuity and  safety of North Korea's nuclear inspection. If such an  inspection is carried out, it will be regarded as a bad  precedent.    A more important issue is whether North Korea will show a  sincere attitude in the third round of North Korea-U.S.  high-level talks as anticipated. Judging from North Korea's  means of dialogue up until now, we cannot rule out the fact that  North Korea may lead the high-levdl talks to slow progress by  launching its offensive in waves through endlessly new  conditions and proposals. The U.S. strategy is to reach an  agreement on inspection of unreported facilities at the  high-level talks but it is expected that there will be many  critical stages.    As a result of its interest in negotiations with the United  States up until now, North Korea may well treat South-North  dialogue superficially. That kind of sign has appeared on  several occasions. We must be prepared to defend our firm  principle of guaranteeing North Korea's nuclear transparency and  securing South-North dialogue.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: UK in breach on employee rights - European Court UK rules on the protection of employees' rights in the event of companies changing hands or when collective redundancies take place breached EC law, the European Court of Justice ruled last week. The Court said the UK had failed to implement fully relevant EC directives. The directives related to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of the transfer of a business or collective redundancies. Both placed a duty on employers to inform and consult representatives of workers affected by a transfer or redundancies. The European Commission took the UK to court for failure to implement them properly by not providing for the designation of employees' representatives in firms where the employer refused to recognise trade unions. The UK argued that employers who did not recognise trade unions were not covered by the obligations in the directives because union recognition in companies was traditionally based on voluntary recognition. The Court did not accept that argument. It said the aim of the directives was to ensure comparable protection for employees' rights in all member states and to harmonise the costs of such provisions for companies in the EC. To that end, the directives laid down compulsory obligations on employers regarding informing and consulting employees' representatives. The Court found member states had no opportunities under the directives to restrict the rights of employees to those companies which under national laws were obliged to have union representation. Although one of the directives specifically provided for situations in which companies did not have employees' representatives, the Court said this provision should not be read in isolation and that its effect was to allow employees without such representation to be properly informed. The Court said it was not the intention of the Community legislature to allow the different legal systems within the EC to accept a situation in which no employees' representatives were designated since designation was necessary to ensure compliance with the obligations laid down in the directive. The Court was not concerned either by the fact that the directives did not contain specific provisions requiring member states to designate workers representatives if there were The directives required member states to take all the measures necessary to ensure employees were informed and consulted through their representatives in the event of either a transfer or collective redundancies. That obligation did not require there to be specific provisions on the designation of employees' representatives. Two further claims were made by the Commission. The first was that UK rules only required the employer to consult with the employees' representatives, to take into consideration what was said, to reply and give reasons if the representations were rejected. The obligation under the directives was to consult representatives with a view to seeking agreement. The UK conceded its rules did not provide for this. The second claim was that the sanctions provided for in the national rules for failure to comply with the obligations to consult and inform were not a sufficient deterrent for employers. Under the UK rules any compensation which an employer might have to pay could be set off against any amounts required to be paid to the employees. The Court said where a Community directive did not specifically provide any penalty for an infringement, or where it referred for that purpose to national laws, the obligations of the member states under the Rome treaty were to require them to ensure infringements of EC law were penalised under conditions, both procedural and substantive, which were analogous to those applicable to infringements of national law of a similar nature and importance and which, in any event, made the penalty effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The UK had failed to do that. C-382/92 and 383/92: Commission v UK, ECJ FC, June 8 1994.</p>

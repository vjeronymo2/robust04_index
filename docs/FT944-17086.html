			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (9): The space that they deserve - Daniel Green investigates the trend to bigger air seat sizes Business class air travellers have always been coveted by airlines. The seats in which they sit are usually large and, though the number of passengers that can be carried is thus reduced, the premium prices they pay  -up to seven times the price of an economy class seat - more than makes up for that. The extra cost may be worth it. Large seats help business travellers arrive at their destinations able to work rather than in need of a day to recover on the beach. But until now, the advantages of space have been largely reserved for long-haul passengers. Most people travelling within Europe have found themselves crammed into exactly the same size of seat as economy passengers. It leaves them struggling for elbow space to use their personal computers or read a newspaper. Things are changing, and not before time. In recent years, airlines have feted the long- haul business class traveller. Their inducements to fly have mostly taken the form of fringe benefits such as gourmet meals, in-flight entertainment and limousines to the airport. But in the past year, the battle in long haul has been about seat size. The standard industry measures of seat pitch - the distance between seat rows - has risen from 38-40 inches to more than 50 inches in many cases. Credit for the change lies partly with UK long-haul specialist Virgin Atlantic which, for more than a decade, hasoffered business class ticket holders fully reclining seats. Now the list of those with similar offerings includes several US, Japanese and European carriers. The effort that these airlines have put into long-haul business class may be one factor behind research findings, to be published later this year by the Official Airlines Guide group of publications. These show that almost one-sixth of business travellers who regularly use short-haul economy class have downgraded from business class in the past 12 months. In long haul, by contrast, the figure was less than one-in-10. long-haul business class passengers surveyed have traded up from economy in the past year as have moved up in short-haul. Many airlines may be congratulating themselves on the success of their strategy, but one conspicuous bystander so far in the rush to bigger seats has been British Airways. It has not yet conceded a need to give up its lucrative long-haul first class service, where it can sell tickets for twice even the business class price. Instead, last month it plunged into short-haul by offering bigger seats to its business passengers flying within Europe. BA is building into its European fleet an ingenious seating design in which rows of three 17-inch wide seats can be converted to two 19-inch wide seats with a useful elbow gap between them. The conversion is mechanical and can be completed in a few seconds for each row of seats. The new set-up allows BA to offer business class ticket holders wider seats. At least as importantly, it retains the flexibility to create a larger business class section for, say, the first Paris flight of the day, and a larger economy section for flights later or at the weekend. overdue. 'Research we conducted two years ago showed that there was something amiss with business class in Europe,' says Mr Peter Liney, BA's group brand manager. 'Business class meant little more than a flexible ticket which you could get by paying full price in economy. Our passengers told us we were not giving value for money.' In spite of the hype for its new Club Europe product, BA is not unique in Europe and was not the first to offer wider seats to its European business passengers. The credit for that goes to Swissair which, with Lufthansa, was the last continental airline to give up first-class travel within Europe in the 1980s. Swissair continued to offer more space in business class, and at the end of 1993, Lufthansa announced that it, too, was installing variable width seats. BA's Mr Liney admits that Lufthansa's and Swissair's products have in the past been better than BA's. In the US and Asia, too, the deal for short-haul business travellers is improving. Established US carriers are seeking weapons with which to defend themselves against newer, low-cost, no-frills carriers such as South West. These smaller rivals operate single class aircraft with little or no on-board catering, low prices and an excellent punctuality record. It is a formula that has proved popular with leisure and business travellers alike. American Airlines, Continental and others have responded by using their three-class international aircraft on longer domestic routes. For comparison, London-Tel Aviv or Paris-Moscow trips count as European flights on BA and Air France. The aircraft used will be similar to those used on the London-Paris route. Flights of a similar length in the US are now sometimes served by long-haul aircraft switched from international routes. In Japan there is little likelihood of long-haul seating patterns being offered domestically. The aircraft have been notoriously crowded, with around 500 seats crammed into some Boeing 747 shuttles between Tokyo and Osaka. In spite of this, All Nippon Airways has seen fit to offer 'super seats' - seat pitch of 38 inches and width of 20 inches - to 16 domestic destinations. Furthermore, these seats are on sales at a flat surcharge of Y7,000, with passengers getting separate check-in, their own lounge, slippers and a shoehorn. Neither BA nor any western hemisphere carrier is likely to match this in the near future. Where BA has a better claim to originality is in the unprecedented level of marketing behind its relaunched business class. It claims to have planned the biggest product launch in airline history and is spending Pounds 25m to advertise to 110m adults in 16 European countries. This is only the latest stage in BA's strategy of creating branded products out of airline services. That strategy has already forced other European carriers to revamp their marketing. 'BA marketing really affected the rest of us,' says one Swissair executive. Such are the competitive pressures in European air travel that what has happened in marketing may spread to business class services. It might only take a small swing from carriers such as Lufthansa and Air France to BA on routes where they compete to trigger a response. Business class passengers across Europe may yet win the space that their ticket price entitles them to.</p>

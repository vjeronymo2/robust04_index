He explained  to our correspondent in Jerusalem why Israel refuses to make any  concessions prior to reopening negotiations with the PLO.    [Rousselin] What condition set by the PLO are you ready to  satisfy to ensure the reopening of negotiations?    [Beilin] We cannot talk of preconditions. We have taken  steps to deal with the settlers. These are not concessions with  regard to the PLO but the result of internal discussions. It is  a serious mistake to impose preconditions for the reopening of  negotiations. That simply slows down the process whereas we  should be accelerating it to conclude a deal as soon as possible.    [Rousselin] The Oslo agreements did not cover the problem  that is being posed today, namely protection for the  Palestinians...    [Beilin] No, that has been considered very seriously and  they  will have their own police force. That is the best way for them  to protect themselves. That can be implemented very quickly.    [Rousselin] Would not an international presence contribute  to  Palestinian security?    [Beilin] Such a presence would not have avoided the  massacre.  We can avoid that sort of thing as long as we are present. The  Palestinians will be able to avoid it when they have their own  police force. However, I admit that the issue of an  international presence is still open to discussion.    [Rousselin] The Gaza and Jericho agreement does not settle  the problem of Hebron...    [Beilin] Would an international presence settle the problem?    [Rousselin] I do not know. Maybe if the settlers were  disarmed or moved...?    [Beilin] The most important thing is not to take a settler's  pistol away from him. For 26 years we considered that we had to  protect the Israeli people in the territories from the  Palestinians. That was not totally crazy because they were  constantly threatened by the Palestinians. We must now deal  with the opposite situation. It is an upheaval in our way of  looking at things. It was so clear that it was the Palestinians  who had to be searched at the entrance to the Tomb of the  Patriarchs! That will not occur again.    [Rousselin] Since you have changed your way of looking at  things, why not now negotiate provisions for the security of the  Palestinians as you did in Cairo for the security of the  settlers?    [Beilin] We must discuss the details of how the agreements  signed will be implemented. That can be done in just a few  weeks. However, that does not require a new general agreement  such as the one concluded in Cairo.    [Rousselin] How can you justify the continued presence of  settlers in the heart of Hebron?    [Beilin] We have to distinguish between the wisdom of having  founded this type of settlement in Hebron, and the question of  whether we should change the current situation. Expelling the  settlers would be very difficult legally speaking. We would  have to justify our actions before the Supreme Court. If they  have committed crimes, they will be dealt with by the judicial  system. If they are innocent, we will be asked why they are  being evacuated. Having said that, I was personally against any  cohabitation in the territories from day one.    [Rousselin] You admit that the presence of settlers in  Hebron  is a mistake yet you refuse to correct this mistake under the  pretext of not making concessions to the PLO...    [Beilin] It is a "fait accompli..." The PLO agreed with us  in Oslo that we would not move a single settler. To go back on  an agreement that was a major step forward for our two peoples  would be the gravest error we could ever make. The cost would  be enormous. It took us a year to get as far as Oslo...    [Rousselin] Could you not amend the signed agreements?    [Beilin] Rightly or wrongly, we agreed in Oslo not to move a  single settler. I understand the criticisms which they (the  leaders of the PLO) are being subjected to. I understand their  isolation and bitterness. However, if it means taking a step  backward, then it is not acceptable. I understand that they  want to know what we are doing.    [Rousselin] So you are ready to discuss it?    [Beilin] We will explain to them the measures we have taken  on our own initiative and not as a result of discussions with  them. We understand their pain and their anger. Naturally, we  are prepared to talk about it, not as an obstacle blocking the  path to an agreement but to explain to them that we are taking  steps as the ruling authority in the territories.    [Rousselin] Why will you not consider redeployment outside  of  the Arab-populated zones like Hebron, as planned for July on the  eve of the elections in the territories?    [Beilin] This redeployment will only come if there are  elections. The agreement is very clear on that point and, as  you know, the Palestinians are not in full agreement where the  elections are concerned.</p>

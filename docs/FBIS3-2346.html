According to local officials, the prefecture now has 41,867  rural and township enterprises which created one billion yuan of  output value last year, accounting for more than half of the  total rural output value. The rural and township enterprises  contributed 33.82 million yuan to the local revenue in the past  year.    For a long time, Dingxi had been so poor that about half of  its rural population did not have enough to eat or wear.    Since 1983, local government, together with relevant local  departments, has proceeded in accordance with local conditions  and begun to adjust the production structure in rural areas.  They have adopted measures to encourage local farmers to set up  rural and township enterprises or be engaged in diversified  economy without neglecting grain production.    As a result, rural and township enterprises engaged in  engineering, transport, carpet-making and food-processing  sectors have mushroomed in Dingxi prefecture.    At the same time, the prefecture has also worked out  preferential policies to attract outside investment for  development of local resources.    The quick development of rural industry has also created  more  job opportunities for surplus rural labor, effectively improving  the living standards of local residents.    At present, 170,000 rural laborers, or about 12 percent of  their total, have found jobs in local rural and township  enterprises.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures slipped lower for the second day running, moving through an arc of nearly 50 points in improved trading volume, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract stood at 3,097 at the official 4.10pm close for a decline of 22 points. The premium to the cash market was 14 points and fair value was around 11 points. In spite of the day's extensive trading swing - the December contract moved between a high of 3,118 and a low of 3,071 - activity was again below average with 12,261 contracts, against 9,600 on Tuesday. Traders said the quality of business remained weak, with the market nervous and unsure of direction. Local, or independent, traders set the tone for much of the session. There were occasional pockets of arbitrage dealing but the pickings were clearly very slim. Institutional business was nowhere to be seen. Volume in the traded options market improved to 28,484 lots, from 22,515 on Tuesday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE activity accounted for just over 17,000 contracts. There were a number of features among individual stock options. British Steel saw 2,007 lots traded and Guinness 2,000 contracts. Barclays - reflecting big switching in the banks sector - British Airways and ICI were also active.</p>

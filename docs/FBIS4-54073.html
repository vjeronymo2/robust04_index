			<p>BFN     [Text] Pak Yong-nam, director of the Atomic Energy General  Department of the DPRK, has sent a letter to Hans Blix, general  director of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], in  connection with the fact that a case involving the concealment  of plutonium had taken place in Japan.    The letter says: On 4 May, the director of the U.S. Nuclear  Control Institute, in a letter to the U.S. Secretary of State,  pointed out that 70 kg of plutonium, a massive amount, had been  concealed in the Tokai Nuclear Fuel Plant, Ibaragi Prefecture,  Japan. He also directed serious attention to this.    The letter points out as follows:    International opinion expresses the concern that, given the  fact that numerous nuclear facilities have been operated in  Japan for tens of years, a more massive amount of plutonium may  have been concealed in Japan and used in producing nuclear  weapons. Voices are growing every day that demand an urgent and  clear explanation of the truth of this incident.    The agency invented a nuclear suspicion with regard to our  fledgling [chongsohan] peaceful nuclear activities and thereby  created complexity, while failing to call into question the fact  that 70 kg of plutonium, a massive amount, had not been reported  but concealed for five years at a plant in Japan, where it is  said an IAEA inspection team stays permanently and conducts  inspections, and Japan's dangerous nuclear activities. The  international community expresses deep concern over the obvious  double-standard policy.    The letter goes on to say that this case cannot be  overlooked  today when Japan's nuclear armament which has reached the danger  line in actuality poses a threat to peace and security in Asia  and, in particular, on the Korean peninsula. The letter also  stressed that it is necessary for the secretariat of the agency  to accept the voices of the international community as a matter  of course; raise the case involving the concealment of plutonium  in Japan for discussion at an extraordinary meeting of the  agency's board of governors without delay; probe the truth  behind it; take a measure for a more overall and thoroughgoing  special inspection of all the nuclear facilities in Japan; and  promptly take other practical measures to resolve the suspicion  and worry of the international community.</p>

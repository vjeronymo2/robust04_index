			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Japanese consumer  sentiment picked up in the January-March quarter following two  previous consecutive quarterly drops, with improving confidence  in the labor situation, the government said Monday [25 April].    The consumer sentiment index for the first quarter stood at  a  seasonally adjusted 38.1, up 5.6 percent from the  October-December quarter, said the Economic Planning Agency.  The index is a gauge of consumer expectations as to whether or  not things will improve in six months' time in five areas  including labor, income and prices.    An agency official said the recovery in consumer sentiment  was mainly because the number of people with pessimistic  outlooks was declining, rather than those with optimistic  projections increasing.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (9): Currency trading matures - Forex rooms are far more complex than before THE popular image of foreign exchange dealers as the most frenzied of market players  - young men burning with rage in front of computer screens, slamming telephones on to desks while exchange rates flicker before their eyes  - must now give way to a calmer, if occasionally frenetic, reality. Forex dealing rooms are more complex places than they were. They are now carefully integrated into their respective banks' operations in bonds, domestic money markets and other activities. Currencies are now far less volatile and in most banks, dealers spend less time guessing whether government authorities will intervene on behalf of one currency or another, and more looking for customers whose currency portfolios they can manage. Currency dealing is no less profitable. Forex can be among the most lucrative markets in which any bank or corporation can invest. It is a growing market, with a staggering global turnover of around Dollars 800bn a day. 'It is easily the most consistent area for trading profits,' says Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London. 'It is far more difficult for a bank to have a stable basis in bonds and equities than in forex these days.' But forex is no longer the dynamic and speculative arena it was a decade ago. Then, it was populated by dozens of medium-sized banks and corporations, ready to make quick profits on gyrating exchange rates. Now, the operators are fewer in number and bigger in size, dominated by names such as Citibank, UBS, Bankers Trust and Barclays, all of whom are increasing their market share while smaller operators gradually leave the market. Three factors have brought about the shift in the balance of power: First, it is harder to make quick profits in currency dealing because exchange rates are far less volatile than a decade ago. From the mid-1980s, the Group of Seven leading industrial nations decided that they shared a common interest in defeating inflation and intervened in the market to manage their exchange rates. G7 policy co-ordination is still strong, in spite of recent tensions over the extent to which Germany and Japan are prepared to loosen their respective fiscal policies and help improve the global economy  - G7 finance ministers have managed to keep the Japanese yen strong against the US dollar after stating last month that a strong yen was essential for world economic adjustment. Central bank intervention has also become less dramatic. In the 1980s, market-makers could still gamble on how central banks might intervene. Now the process has become more technical. 'Central Banks make much more subtle changes,' says Mark Slater, managing director of forex at Merrill Lynch in London, 'and intervention is more often a smoothing process, not an attempt to turn the market. The market players, instead of saying 'Let's take the central banks on' admit that the authorities will win in the end.' The second pressure is the spread of the so-called 'Basle mentality' in international banking. Since July 1988, when the central bankers of the world's leading countries agreed on minimum capital adequacy ratios for international banks, awareness of credit and counterparty risk has grown. Recession in the English-speaking world, with its trail of bad debts and the downgrading of banks by rating agencies, has encouraged prudence in international banking. Third, the advent of global financial trading has meant exchange rate movements are increasingly affected by huge financial flows rather than trade. In the 1980s, market-makers in foreign exchange would be sufficiently well-informed about currency flows by having a handful of large corporate clients. Today, they need lines to fund managers all over the world if they are to compete effectively in the market. Banks and corporations have responded in several ways to these new pressures. The big banks are increasingly concentrating on the development of a secure customer base, a policy which underpins the risks they take in trading on their own capital. Citibank, one of the biggest, with around 10 per cent of the London market, is proud of its customer service. 'Around half our traders are engaged in the market, and the other half are talking to customers,' says Julian Simmonds, Citibank's managing director of forex. 'You have to get the balance right these days between customers and risk.' Investment banks dealing in forex also believe that customers matter, if for different reasons. Mr Slater of Merrill Lynch says that the growth in forex trading at his investment house is due to the demands of fund managers for 'currency overlay'. This is especially necessary, given the six-point differential between short-term interest rates in Germany and the Federal Bank's funds rate in the US. 'More and more, we see pension funds farming out the currency side of their portfolios,' he says. 'Eighty or 90 per cent of our revenue is now from client-generated business. If we don't have a client base with massive growth we will be left behind.' In addition, foreign exchange dealers need to be constantly on the look-out for new markets to counteract the fall in exchange rate volatility. Mr Simmonds of Citibank believes that the market will contract further with European Monetary Union. 'There will be less volatility as the currencies converge,' he says, 'and we will have to look beyond the frontiers of Europe for new currencies to trade.' He has his sights set on two regions. First, the currencies of Latin America, whose equity markets were among the best performers last year. Second, the currencies of eastern Europe, above all the Russian rouble. 'As Russia moves towards full convertibility, we need to be involved,' he says. 'If the options close in European currencies, other opportunities must open up.'  --------------------------------- ANNUAL FLUCTUATION RANGES FOR THE USDOLLARS AGAINST THE D-MARK AND             THE YEN  ---------------------------------           Pfennigs     Yen  --------------------------------- 1985        105         63 1986         55         51.5 1987         36         39.5 1988         36         36.5 1989         39         27 1990         26         35 1991         39         19 1992*        18         12  --------------------------------- * to mid-May Source: Swiss Bank Corp  ---------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Tang Shuifu (3282 3055 1381)] </F>   [Text] Seoul, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- ROK National Assembly  Speaker Yi Man-sop met with the visiting Liu Shuqing, president  of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, here today.    During the meeting, Yi Man-sop recalled with pleasure the  beautiful impressions left upon him by his China visit more than  two months ago. He said: Korean-Chinese relations have enjoyed  very rapid development in all fields in the past year or so  after the two countries established diplomatic ties. He  expressed his hope that such friendly cooperation will be  further strengthened.    Touching on the Korean nuclear issue, Yi Man-sop said that  he  personally opposes the application of pressure and sanctions  against Korea [DPRK] and that he hopes the nuclear issue can be  peacefully resolved through dialogue.    Liu Shuqing said: China hopes that peace and stability will  be maintained on the Korean peninsula, and it hopes that  conflicts will not occur. Sanctions cannot solve a problem.  The Korean nuclear issue should be properly resolved through  dialogue under the framework of a tripartite dialogue between  the four parties.    ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu also met with Liu Shuqing  here today.    Liu Shuqing called on ROK Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang in  Seoul on 7 April. In their conversation, Yi Hoe-chang said:  The talks between President Kim Yong-sam and Chinese leaders  during his visit to China were very helpful for developing  bilateral relations. The ROK follows with great concern China's  reform and opening up, and it admires China's achievements.    Liu Shuqing said: China and the ROK share cultural ties of  long standing. Relations between the two countries have enjoyed  a very rapid development after they established diplomatic ties.  He expressed his hope that Sino-Korean friendly cooperation in  all fields will develop further.    On the same day, Liu Shuqing also met with former ROK  President No Tae-u here. Both sides held a friendly  conversation.    Liu Shuqing arrived here on 6 April to begin an eight-day  visit to the ROK at the invitation of Sun Zhu-huan [name as  received], chairman of the council of the ROK International  Exchange Consortium.</p>

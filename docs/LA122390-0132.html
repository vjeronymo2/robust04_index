			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ADOPT-A-FAMILY PROGRAM DELIVERS HOLIDAY JOY;  </P> <P> GIVING: HARBOR REGIONAL CENTER FINDS SPONSORS FOR 250 FAMILIES WHO HAVE  DISABLED LOVED ONES AND PRESSING FINANCIAL NEEDS.  </P> <P> It's two days until Christmas and 11-year-old Bambi Thomas already has a bike  and a Barbie doll. Her brother, Pierre, has a silver scooter. And cousin  Tyrell, well, he just keeps smiling about all the presents he got this year:  the roller skates, a radio, red tennis shoes.  </P> <P> Tyrell, an autistic 13-year-old, is the reason this year's holidays include  dozens of gifts for him and his family from people they barely know. The gifts  fill the family's two-bedroom apartment at Dana Strand Village in Wilmington.  </P> <P> "It's so wonderful," Tyrell's grandmother, Vivian Jackson, says, watching her  grandchildren play with their toys. "It's a blessing, it really is," adds her  daughter Shirley, Tyrell's mother.  </P> <P> The toys were among the presents given to the family last week by Los Angeles  Harbor College -- one of more than 100 sponsors of a special holiday program  providing gifts, food, clothing and even small checks to South Bay families  with developmentally disabled parents or children.  </P> <P> The Adopt-A-Family program is sponsored by Harbor Regional Center, a  state-funded, nonprofit agency in Torrance that serves about 5,000  developmentally disabled people in the area. The center, founded in 1977,  provides counseling, referral and other services to people disabled by autism,  mental retardation, cerebral palsy, severe epilepsy or other neurological  disorders. The clients range in age from infants to senior citizens.  </P> <P> The center's program began in late 1986 when the Soroptimists of Del  Amo/Torrance contacted Harbor Regional about sponsoring one of the center's  families for the holidays, said John Kauffman, the center's outreach  coordinator. "They said they'd like to do something at Christmas as a project,"  Kauffman said. "And the program just grew from there."  </P> <P> This year, the program will serve its largest number ever -- 250 families  selected by the center's counselors. The families, Kauffman said, not only have  disabled parents or children but pressing financial problems. "They are the  very neediest of the people we serve," he said.  </P> <P> Chris' family is an example.  </P> <P> Last year, the Artesia teen-ager was nearly killed in a gang attack near his  home, run down by a pickup truck as he rode his bicycle with a friend. Chris,  14, suffered profound brain damage in the attack, which was aimed at his  friend, who belonged to a gang.  </P> <P> "One day, he's a normal kid and the next day, he's in a hospital almost dead,"  said Chris' mother Eva, a single mother of four who asked that her family's  last name not be used because her son's attackers remain at large.  </P> <P> The incident left Chris unable to walk or talk. It also devastated his family,  financially and emotionally.  </P> <P> Eight months after the attack, as the family struggled with the new and  staggering responsibilities of caring for Chris, Harbor Regional's Kauffman  went to their home. He brought with him food, a check for $100 and Christmas  gifts including a radio for Chris, who has always loved music.  </P> <P> Brenda Smiley, a Harbor Regional counselor, recalled, "After they got the  presents, Eva called me up and said, 'You know, I was really starting to give  up. I felt like we were headed down a long, dark hole. But when the gifts came,  I realized it was a tunnel because there was light at the other end.' "  </P> <P> "What really made my heart drop was the check," Eva added in an interview. "I  just couldn't believe it. I didn't know there were people like that out there.  </P> <P> "I have a load on my shoulders, but I'm strong enough for that. Sympathy, I  don't need," she said. "But the help they gave me was fantastic."  </P> <P> The program, according to Harbor Regional officials, not only helps the  families through the holidays but serves as an unexpected acknowledgement of  what they endure in caring for a disabled relative.  </P> <P> "Having a developmentally disabled person in a family is very disruptive. The  person requires a lot of attention," Kauffman said. "And this is a time when  that is acknowledged by others. Suddenly, this person who you've been caring  for all year is bringing something to the family."  </P> <P> The program, center officials said, also provides the disabled with new  self-esteem. "One of the ways to stimulate the return of anybody's functions is  to build significant events into their life," Smiley said. "So this program  really seems to improve the client's self-image, because they understand that  people really do care, that people want them to have a nice holiday.  </P> <P> "And that helps to strengthen the relationships within the family. Life gets  happier for everybody," she said.  </P> <P> In Chris' case, the gifts -- particularly the portable radio -- were catalysts  in overcoming severe depression that followed him home from the hospital last  year, Smiley said.  </P> <P> "He went through some serious depression, of course, as he was beginning to  recuperate," she said. "Now he's got his smile back. And that's good."  </P> <P> Finally, according to Smiley and others, the program helps bring the travails  of the developmentally disabled to the attention of other families, family  sponsors and service groups. "It gives people some idea of what it's like, and  they see the similarities between themselves and the disabled are more striking  than the differences," Kauffman said.  </P> <P> "Every kid likes to celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah," he said. "Everyone likes  to have clothes to wear and food to eat."  </P></p>

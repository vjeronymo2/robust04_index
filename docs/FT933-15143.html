			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Russia bank chief gloomy on economy THE CHAIRMAN of the Russian Central Bank yesterday delivered a gloomy report on the Russian economy to parliament  - undercutting the upbeat impression of an economy picking itself off the floor which Russian officials have been seeking to present at the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, reporting on the bank's accounts for last year, drew a picture of an economy in which the flight of capital was out of control and the government foreign exchange reserves were almost exhausted. He said that, on January 1 this year, the Central Bank had reserves worth only Rbs605.2bn  - about Dollars 600m (Pounds 400m)  - with gold reserves worth Rbs137bn, or about Dollars 130m. The country's GDP had declined by 18.5 per cent in 1992 from 1991, he said, and inflation averaged 31.3 per cent each month in the past year, more than expected. Mr Gerashchenko said the consumer price index had risen 26-fold in the past year. Though the bank chairman acknowledged that an agreement with the government had drawn Russia back from the brink of a monetary crisis, he insisted that the government had a duty to bail out heavily indebted state companies. Mr Gerashchenko said Russia would receive no significant foreign investment until the debt owed by the country to governments and to companies with which it used to trade had been paid off. Russian exports for 1992, he said, totalled only Dollars 38.1bn, a decline of 26 per cent from 1991, half of which was accounted for by fuel and other energy. Exports of machinery, once a large part of Russian exports, represented only 9 per cent of the total in 1992, he said. Noting that 'capital flight has grown enormously in the past year', Mr Gerashchenko urged the government to adopt stricter rules in an effort to stop the illegal export of hard currency. The parliament 'took into account' a report on the Central Bank by the auditing company Coopers and Lybrand, and demanded that the bank produce figures within a week explaining the gaps in the accounts for last year which had been noted in the report.</p>

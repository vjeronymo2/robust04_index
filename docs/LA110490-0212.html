			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SO LITTLE RESPECT RECENTLY FOR S. PASADENA POLICE DEPT.  </P> <P> Sunday, Oct. 28, you printed a letter to the editor titled "Party-Goer's Side  of the Story."  </P> <P> It's signed John Bernardi Jr. In my opinion, John Jr. is a big crybaby. In the  article you printed (Times, Oct. 4), it said when the police tried to do their  job he said wait till I tell my dad.  </P> <P> I think it really stinks that the South Pasadena police can't do their job  without thinking twice!  </P> <P> TIM TANAKA  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

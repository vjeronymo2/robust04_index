			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro last night  decorated Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani with the Jose  Dolores Estrada San Jacinto Battle Order in the degree of Great  Collar. Cristiani is in Nicaragua on an official visit. During  the ceremony, Chamorro emphasized the ties of friendship between  the two Central American countries.    [Begin Chamorro recording] On this occasion, I wish to  reiterate the deep friendship that the Nicaraguan people have  always expressed for our Salvadoran friends. The feeling is  mutual. In this way, I am returning the hospitality that I  received during my visit to El Salvador in March last year, when  the entire Salvadoran community treated me with love,  friendship, and understanding. These ties are strong because we  are one and the same people who have shared the experiences of  the same history. The two peoples are united by efforts to  attain peace and progress in our countries. It is up to us  Nicaraguans to testify to this friendship. To you, Mr.  President, and the friends that accompany you, I reiterate our  sincere feelings of friendship toward the Salvadoran people, so  worthily represented in the past four years by a statesman who  has wisely led his people along the path of peace and  reconciliation.    The Salvadoran people suffered through a sad and cruel war,  and they appreciate President Cristiani's great efforts toward  pacification, disarmament, reconciliation, and democratization  in his country. In Nicaragua, we also have had to work  ceaselessly to consolidate the peace that we enjoy today. We  learned a lesson that we will never forget. Dialogue and  reconciliation should be the instrument for resolving our  disagreements. Peace in our country becomes stronger by the day  and overshadows all memories of the past. For that reason, our  commitment to democracy is based on the rule of law and justice,  which is enforced by strengthening the state of law and  democratic institutions and by protecting human rights.

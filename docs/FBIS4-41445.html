			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 21/6/1994 -- Last week a group  of smugglers of radioactive substances was arrested in action,  announced to BASAPRESS the chief of the Moldovan Ministry of  Interior Department for Combating Organized Crime. The group  had been monitored by the interior ministry bodies over four  months. Moldovan citizens Ion Petcu, Alexandru Budoianu, and  Simion Tarlev, in collaboration with a Russian citizen, were  attempting to sell for $20,000 a tank with 1 kg of the  radioactive substance called Gamma Cobalt-60 to a foreign  merchant. According to the experts, this quantity would have  been sufficient to pollute the entire territory of Moldova.  Simion Lacramioara, the chief of the mentioned department,  declared that recently Moldova has faced an increase in the  smuggling of radioactive substances and drugs. In his opinion,  this trend is caused by the lack of strict customs controls on  the western borders to Romania and by the lack of borders  themselves in the east, with Ukraine. According to Lacramioara,  the radioactive substances are stolen from Russian military  bases and then smuggled into Western Europe.</p>

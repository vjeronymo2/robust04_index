			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Man in the News: Sticky wicket at Central TV - Leslie Hill As an avid amateur cricketer, Leslie Hill, chairman and chief executive of Central Independent Television, is the ideal person to bowl fierce sporting metaphors at Mr Peter Brooke, National Heritage secretary and member of the Marylebone Cricket Club. On the changes to the ITV ownership rules proposed by Mr Brooke, the Central Independent Television chairman says: 'What he has done is bowl us a flipper, a ball that looks like a googly but goes the other way.' You do not need to know one end of a cricket bat from another to realise that whether it is flippers or googlies, Hill, a long-time advocate of rationalising ITV's structure, is not happy about some aspects of the government's decision to allow consolidation in the industry. 'It's two steps forward and one step back,' says Hill, who as far back as 1988 told the then prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, on a visit to Central's Nottingham studios that the 15 ITV companies should, in the interests of efficiency, be reduced to no more than five or six. Hill, the businessman who worked in the music industry and in industrial services before coming to television in 1987, received telexes from other ITV companies 'presuming' he would resign from the ITV Association - the body representing all the companies - after his controversial comments found their way into the national newspapers. 'ITV was a bit of a gentlemen's club at the time,' says Hill. 'You weren't expected to rock the boat. I believed you should either redraw the map (of ITV) in a sensible way to create similiar-sized regions or you should allow the market to do it.' The 57-year-old Hill, now ironically chairman-elect of the ITV Association that once saw him as an uncomfortable outsider, is pleased that the government has decided that outside London an ITV company will be able to hold two broadcasting licences, however large. At the moment, the nine largest companies cannot take each other over. He is, however, disappointed at the anomalies he believes the apparently simple change will leave in its wake. For instance, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, which recently issued a profits warning, cannot be taken over easily because it holds two broadcasting licences. If another ITV company pounced, it would face a messy divestment of Tyne Tees. 'It seems extraordinary that the company that in some ways most needs taking over cannot be taken over in its present form,' says Hill of Yorkshire, a company in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, holds a 14 per cent stake. Setting the limit at two licences, instead of allowing one company to own two large licences plus one of the remaining small five, means that nobody will want to forfeit their chance to own another big licence by taking over minnows such as Border or Grampian. Such companies could be acquired now as defences to takeovers even under existing regulations, if the Independent Television Commission, the regulator, agreed. But it is far from clear whether shareholders would support such shenanigans. 'Under the previous ownership regulations the 15 could at least in theory have become nine,' says Hill. 'Now it can move to eight. Moving from nine to eight ITV companies is not a huge step forward.' The barriers in the way of deeper consolidation will lead to uncertainty and confusion after the expected rapid outbreak of takeovers, he believes. The government plans to make changes to the licences which are likely to operate after January 1 next year, and Mr Brooke, who plays one of the straightest bats in politics has promised to keep the issue of ownership under review. He said this week he would look at whether newspaper publishers should be able to own ITV companies. Relaxation of the present 20 per cent limit on ownership of a single ITV company for publishers is likely to happen eventually - it could have been this time but for fears that Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International, owner of five national newspapers would have swooped on an ITV company. While the present rule change may be modest it could have profound implications for Hill's career. He has long known that by advocating a smaller number of large ITV companies, he could be one of the first to be trampled in the rush. 'Three times I have been in companies that have been taken over,' he says. 'Twice I was promoted and the third time fired. The best deal financially was the time I was fired.' Central is not only attractive as the second largest in ITV but as a company which successfully bid only Pounds 2,000 for its licence. This means that its annual payments to the government are far less than most companies of its size, although it still has to hand over a percentage of its advertising revenue. So Hill is a potential victim as well as a potential predator. Conventional wisdom in the industry has it that Michael Green's Carlton Communications, which owns 20 per cent of the Midlands' company, will move against Central. It would be an expensive morsel. In July 1991, before the news started to leak about the company's low bid, the share price stood at about 630p. It has now reached Pounds 21.68 giving the company a market capitalisation of Pounds 583m - still small compared to Carlton's Pounds 1.5bn. Despite Hill's powerful and ambitious minority shareholder, he is big enough and determined enough to want to be a player in his own right. He could launch a bid for London Weekend Television, although there he might find himself on a collision course with Granada, which already owns 20 per cent of the London weekend company. Anglia, with a market capitalisation of about Pounds 200m, would seem to be Hill's most obvious target if Green fails to clinch a deal quickly. HTV, the commercial broadcaster to Wales and the west, could be a takeover target at a pinch. Hill declines to comment on how he plans to play such a sticky wicket. But anybody trying to bowl him out should be warned that Hill still plays a mean game of cricket and can bowl unfriendly inswingers - if not flippers or googlies.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (24): Best of both worlds - Case study / Courier service company / DHL has standardised on an integrated office automation package - yet staff still have freedom of choice DHL International has standardised on a single program package which combines word processing, spread-sheet processing, electronic mail and a database. Yet despite its worldwide investment in the package it still allows staff to use software of their own choice. DHL settled on the package from UK company Uniplex in 1986 and it is now installed in most of the 200 countries in which DHL operates. A worldwide network of computers running under the Unix operating system enables any user at any terminal or personal computer to send a message to any other. In the UK, 1,000 of the 1,700 staff have terminals or personal computers linked to local Hewlett-Packard minicomputers; these connect to the central Pyramid machine, which provides the UK link to the international network. The staff without terminals are those who do not need them - for example, parcel sorters in warehouses and van drivers, although the drivers are set to be linked in, too. The Uniplex system provides basic office automation facilities and offices also use it to send each other details of movements of customers' parcels. Even so, DHL allows staff to use other word processing and spread-sheet software and even has support teams for some of these non-standard products. 'Any organisation would naturally love to standardise, but I believe in giving choice,' says Mr Ian Benger, UK information technology director, who personally prefers to use the Wordperfect product for word processing. 'If someone's very familiar with another system it can be frustrating to have to switch. 'With a good office automation system it shouldn't matter what word processors people use as long as when they send their messages the recipients can understand them. 'The power of Uniplex is that it allows people to communicate very quickly and easily across different computers and in any format. 'Uniplex supports different word processors and ensures the messages are received in the right formats, although you lose character attributes such as bold and italic. Spread-sheets from different packages can also be handled in this way, although not quite as well.' Ian Benger's department supports Uniplex, Wordperfect and the Microsoft Word word processors. All training on Uniplex in particular is done internally. Staff can request other packages outside these three but there would be no internal support. Mr Benger is very conscious of the need to control the introduction of non-standard software. 'Any organisation has a responsibility to control what its staff are doing,' he says. 'If someone wants to use a different package, my department buys it and installs it. That ensures our people do not bring in software which they have copied illegally. In addition, we keep the supplier's master discs, so they cannot be handed round and loaded on different PCs. This means we know what software is loaded and where. 'We run a constant audit exercise. There is no formal check every three months, but when we get calls for support we take the opportunity to examine the local PCs and if we find software that shouldn't be there we delete it. This ad hoc auditing means users can't prepare for a check. 'Software piracy hasn't been a real problem for us, perhaps because of our view that you must stamp it out before it starts. Piracy is a disciplinary offence here.' Although staff are allowed to use software of their choice, the electronic mail facilities of the Uniplex system have been a great success. DHL previously used fax machines and the telephone for internal communication. 'Everyone uses electronic mail now, as a matter of course,' Ian Benger says. 'All internal mail and memos go by electronic mail, regardless of whether the recipient is in the next office or on the other side of the world. 'It's certainly affected our use of the phone: if a message is not urgent, people don't even bother with the phone; and if it is urgent, people try the phone and if there's no answer they send an electronic mail message. We've looked at voice mail twice, including just three months ago, but still decided we wouldn't make full use of it because of the success of electronic mail.' One new move is a switch from computer terminals to personal computers. There are currently 300 personal computers; the remaining 700 terminals will be replaced over the next three years. During that time, DHL is likely to move to the new Uniplex Ongo package, which brings in the graphics of Microsoft Windows and the Unix equivalent - Motif. The original version used by DHL uses standard terminals largely limited to text only. DHL has tended to buy Compaq personal computers but Ian Benger says the relationship with the supplier is more important than standardising on particular products. DHL has a 'very good relationship' with supplier Corporate Computers, he says. Another development is planned outside the office. At present, couriers in the UK have a small bar-code reader and data recorder for gathering data about parcels as they are picked up and delivered, plus a receive-only radio linked to a printer which prints instructions about customer pick-ups. DHL is now looking at the new so-called personal digital assistants such as Apple's Newton notepad: information and commands are entered by writing on the small screen with an 'electronic pen.' Mr Benger points out that such devices could store and gather much more information. Two-way radio links would enable couriers' devices to transmit information back to the Uniplex system as soon as a pick-up or delivery was made, giving DHL more up-to-date tracking information. An important benefit for staff morale and motivation would be that people working away from an office, largely on their own, could be sent internal memos and notices through the Uniplex system to their hand-held computers. COMPANY SNAPSHOT: DHL International is a leading international air courier, operating in 200 countries and moving 80m packages a year. There are 28,000 staff worldwide; 1,700 in the UK, working from 36 sites. The company turnover is Dollars 2.5bn, worldwide. Computers: worldwide network of computers running under the Unix operating system, especially Pyramid and Hewlett-Packard machines. In the UK, 35 sites have Hewlett-Packard computers, all linked to a Pyramid machine at the head office near Heathrow Airport, west London, which supports head office processing and connects the UK network to the international network. There are 700 Wyse terminals and 300 personal computers.</p>

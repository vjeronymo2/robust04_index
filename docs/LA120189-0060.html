			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HONECKER LIABLE FOR PROSECUTION  </P> <P> East German authorities Thursday stripped former leader Erich Honecker of  immunity from criminal charges and began an investigation of alleged abuses of  power by Honecker and other disgraced Communist Party officials.  </P> <P> Authorities also sealed off a country estate where Honecker and other ousted  leaders have lived, apparently to prevent removal of evidence.  </P> <P> The moves were the strongest indications to date that the former leadership  will be made to account for alleged abuses.  </P> <P> "Everyone is equal before the law," Communist Party chief Egon Krenz said on  national television. He said the accusations against Honecker and others are  "serious and unworthy of a Politburo member."  </P> <P> The official ADN news agency reported later that more than 10,000 East Germans  marched in the city of Erfurt to protest special privileges for top party and  government figures.  </P> <P> ADN announced a criminal investigation into alleged abuse of power by Honecker,  former Premier Willi Stoph, and former Politburo member Guenther Kleiber, who  are all in seclusion. Their whereabouts is not publicly known.  </P> <P> The news agency said Honecker, who was dropped from power Oct. 18, was under  investigation on suspicion of having misused his office for personal gain. It  gave no details of the alleged abuses.  </P> <P> Krenz, a former protege of Honecker's, has been pressing for exposure and  punishment of past errors and excesses as a means of repairing his party's  tarnished image.  </P> <P> Krenz faces widespread opposition from many pro-democracy activists, as well as  within the troubled party hierarchy, which is scheduled to meet in a crucial  session Dec. 15-17.  </P> <P> The party that has dominated government and society for 40 years also is  wrestling with challenges and demands for broader power-sharing by the  fledgling political opposition.  </P> <P> The Communist Party last week announced an internal investigation of reported  wrongdoing by Honecker, his top lieutenant Guenter Mittag and other party  figures recently removed from positions of authority.  </P> <P> Mittag was thrown out of the party Nov. 23 in the first punitive action against  any of the ousted officials.  </P> <P> The aging party figures who were part of the hard-line regime headed by  Honecker for 18 years are accused by pro-democracy forces of having lined their  pockets at public expense while the national economy slipped continuously  behind that of West Germany.  </P> <P> Regional government chief Hartmut Boecker said that the immunity Honecker was  earlier entitled to was suspended "to facilitate a criminal investigation and  inquiry," ADN reported.  </P> <P> Local authorities also have imposed a security cordon around Honecker's  residential estate to "prevent the removal of material from the buildings,"  Boecker was quoted by ADN as saying.  </P> <P> East German newspapers reported Wednesday that Stoph had abandoned his opulent  home in a former nature preserve after hauling out artwork and furniture. He  left behind expensive electronics, imported wine and other evidence of the  lavish life style previously enjoyed by the party elite.  </P> <P> ADN gave no indication of what charges might be filed against any of the  officials.  </P> <P> Honecker, 77, has not been seen in public since his ouster six weeks ago, and  is reported to be seriously ill.  </P> <P> Krenz initially was seen as the former leadership's handpicked successor, and  he was therefore widely mistrusted. But under public pressure for social and  economic reforms, the new party leadership has agreed to talks on the nation's  future, beginning next week.  </P> <P> Party leaders have also promised to give up their constitutional mandate for a  "leading role," and have agreed to work toward free elections.  </P></p>

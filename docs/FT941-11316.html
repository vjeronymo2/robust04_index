			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Steelmakers' optimism tempered by overcapacity - Surge in US demand masks problems After three years in which they racked up combined operating losses of Dollars 3bn, any numbers not swathed in red ink are apt to make the US's large steel companies feel almost light-headed. But 'Big Steel' - the collective name given to the country's six big integrated steelmakers - still has a long way to go to justify the optimism that has driven share prices in the sector ahead this year. Without doubt, the steel-makers look in better health than for some years. Buoyed by a domestic economic recovery that has lifted demand for steel from the automobile, appliance and construction industries, they reported a combined operating profit of around Dollars 100m in the third quarter of last year - their first since the third quarter of 1990. Operating profits climbed to Dollars 150m in the final three months of the year. The big companies - USX's US Steel subsidiary, Bethlehem, LTV, Inland, National and Armco - have also bolstered their collective balance sheet after the ravages of the last downturn. In the past year, they have sold Dollars 1.5bn of ordinary and convertible preference shares between them in a binge of capital raising. That is set to continue, with Armco and Kawasaki Steel of Japan last week announcing plans for a Dollars 590m recapitalisation (Dollars 315m of it equity) for their Armco Steel joint venture. A sharp improvement in the US steel market lies behind the turnround, and investors' demand for the steelmakers' shares. Last year, US makers of cars and appliances increased orders for flat-rolled steel, which is the staple product of the big steelmakers. Mini-mills, which make steel from scrap melted in electric furnaces, dominate the market for structural products, rods and bars, though some have targeted the flat-rolled market. US steel companies shipped 87.5m tons last year, according to a Salomon Brothers estimate, up around 6 per cent from 82.2m the year before (which itself was 4 per cent higher than the trough of 1991). The biggest growth is likely to have come in flat-rolled products, which account for around half the market and sales of which grew by some 8 per cent during 1993. Nor is there any sign of a surge in imports - though that may follow if the US dollar continues to strengthen. Last July, when the US's International Trade Commission refused to confirm some of the tariffs which had been imposed on imports by the country's Commerce Department, the domestic industry braced itself for a new wave of imports. It did not come. Imports remain at around 17 per cent of the US market, 10 points lower than a decade ago. They could fall further, if US steel-makers increase their domestic output and stop importing semi-finished steel to feed their mills. Perhaps even more important for the big producers, domestic rivals - which have provided tougher competition than foreign steelmakers in recent years - have had their own problems. The mini-mills have been hit by a sharp rise in the cost of scrap, which has wiped out much of their cost advantage. 'Some scrap prices are double what they were a year ago,' says Mr John Jacobson, a consultant at the Wefa Group. The result has been a rapid increase in steel prices. Hot-rolled sheets were selling at Dollars 360 a ton at the end of last year, 20 per cent more than at the start of the year. The price of cold-rolled sheets had risen by 16 per cent, to Dollars 487 a ton. These price rises have yet to feed through fully into the steel companies' figures, however. Many supply contracts have yet to be renegotiated. There have also been reports that big carmakers have succeeded in holding out against the full price rises. It is not surprising the steel companies feel more optimistic than for some time. But their recovery needs to be put in context. Steel prices are still well below the level reached in 1988 and 1989 - when steelmakers enjoyed a brief respite between the long slump of the early 1980s and the more recent dip. Slow economic growth in Europe and Japan, adding to the overcapacity in the worldwide steel industry, is likely to prevent prices rising much further. The construction of new mini-mills in the US - some built by the big steel companies - will add to capacity over the next two years, further holding back prices. In addition, the operating profits of the big steel companies look fragile when set against combined sales running at around Dollars 5bn a quarter. At the after-tax level, the steelmakers have yet to break back into profit (though that should come this year). The big steelmakers also continue to be weighed down financially by the sort of problems that newer, low-cost rivals do not face. Bethlehem Steel took a Dollars 350m charge in the last quarter to cover restructuring in its structural products division, an area where it is in most direct competition from the mini-mills. Falling long-term interest rates have pushed up the steelmakers' pension fund liabilities: Bethlehem pumped Dollars 260m into its pension fund in 1993, but still saw the fund's deficit rise to Dollars 1.6bn, from Dollars 1.2bn the year before. LTV, emerging from bankruptcy last summer, put Dollars 1.4bn into its pension plans, and intends to contribute Dollars 579m more this year. Concerns like these have tempered optimism among the steelmakers, in spite of their full order books.</p>

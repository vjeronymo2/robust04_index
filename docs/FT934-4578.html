			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Trade officials encouraged by progress in talks Trade officials in Geneva yesterday were philosophical about the lack of concrete results in the Gatt negotiations and said they were encouraged by reports of progress. 'They do seem to be coming to some specific results,' said one. 'If we get something on Monday, that would just about fit in with the negotiating timetable, though there will be a lot of work to do next week.' Officials at Gatt headquarters said Mr Peter Sutherland, the director-general, was in close touch with the US and EU negotiators, but he declined to comment. The relatively upbeat mood among officials appears to reflect a belief that the setting of fresh US-EU talks for Monday partly reflected Sir Leon Brittan's wish to avoid presenting a draft accord to EU ministers at last night's special council meeting, as demanded by France. This in effect prevents Paris putting a spoke in the wheel of the Uruguay Round negotiations before they conclude on December 15. Nonetheless, there will be disappointment among trading partners that US-EU differences over market access for goods and services could not be resolved before today's key meeting in Geneva to evaluate the results in the round so far. Although it is already clear that the Uruguay Round target of one-third tariff cuts is likely to be exceeded, overall gains from the round still remain heavily dependent on what the two trading giants decide to give each other, for instance, on textiles, fish, non-ferrous metals and electronics. In addition, the two sides have not yet resolved differences over financial services, maritime transport and audio-visual services. Trade officials said that intensive negotiations on all aspects of the round would continue through the weekend on the assumption that a US-EU deal was close. 'The rest of the process is in reasonably good shape for the final bargaining,' said a senior trade diplomat.</p>

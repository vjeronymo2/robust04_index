			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: New trust focuses on waters THE RECENT upsurge in water shares, in the midst of the sector's preliminary results season, gathered further momentum yesterday, with good general buying of the sector said to have gained impetus from large-scale buying of the FT-SE 100 water constituents by Smith New Court, the leading UK securities house. Over the past three trading sessions, water issues have risen more than 8 per cent. The strong buying by Smith was associated with that company's participation in the launch of the new Johnson Fry Utilities Trust investment trust. The new trust is sponsored by Smith New Court Corporate Finance and distributed by Smith New Court Securities. The prospectus for the new trust, which will invest primarily in UK utility stocks, such as BT, British Gas and other water and electricity issues, was published yesterday. Anglian Water outpaced its FT-SE 100 rivals yesterday, closing 14 higher at 484p, closely followed by North West Water, up 12 at 474p, Severn Trent, due to report this morning and 9 stronger at 496p, and Thames, 5 to the good at 476p. Northumbrian led the smaller stocks, adding 14 at 577p. Dealers also said the utilities were attracting keen support ahead of next Monday's market debut by Northern Ireland Electricity. 'Grey market' indications yesterday suggested an opening level of around 121p to 124p.</p>

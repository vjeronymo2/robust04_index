			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Launch of New FT Indices: National Power to contract out tax work NATIONAL POWER, the privatised electricity generator, has contracted out its tax compliance work to KPMG Peat Marwick and Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firms. The move is the latest in a series of recent attempts by companies to 'out-source' to external consultants activities which were traditionally considered core headquarters functions. One of the existing six tax staff will remain to help manage the work. KPMG will have the equivalent of four full-time staff working on UK tax matters. PW will be working on overseas tax and on oil and gas issues.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--The government was underlining the need for  prudence in the public sector while dealing with taxpayers'  money by ordering a flat 10 per cent cut in all "working  expenditures" of all ministries and departments, Finance  Minister Sami Gammuh said Monday [7 March].    Mr. Gammuh, explaining a Prime Ministry order issued earlier  this week, said the government would use the savings from the  operational budgets of the ministries and departments to improve  public services and productive sectors of the economy.    The minister said the government was hoping to save up to JD  20 million through the ordered reductions in spending in all  areas of current expenditure--water, electricity, transport,  communications, stationery, etc.    However, he indicated that JD 20 million was not an absolute  figure.    More importantly, he said, "we want to raise the awareness  of  everybody concerned while dealing with public funds of need to  be careful and prudent."    "Everyone has to ensure that resources are spent in the  right  channel with optimum benefits to serve the purpose for which  they are allocated," he told the JORDAN TIMES.    Mr. Gammuh said the move was also intended as a message to  "all concerned," including ministers and senior decision-making  officials at various departments that "there is a need for  better management of economy" and that they should exercise  control.    "Wastage has to be reduced and better utilisation of funds  and cost-effectiveness have to be achieved in all government  ministries and departments," he said.    "We know this is difficult, in view of the fact that the  (1994) budget is already tight," Mr. Gammuh said. "But there is  no alternative if we were to advance towards self-reliance and  indpendence from external assistance."    The JD 1.487 billion fiscal budget for 1994 projects a  shortfall of JD 158 million, expected to be addressed by  external assistance.    The "operational budgets" covered under the government  measures are estimated at nearly JD 200 million for 1994.    Dr. Fahid al-Fanik, an economist and newspaper columnist,  agreed that it was "difficult to cut expenditures" but said the  government move was "worth exploring."    Reducing expenditure has been adopted by the government as a  means to cut the budget deficit for several years now, "and  there is a limit to which one could go in reducing expenses  before reaching the bone," Dr. al-Fanik said.    However, the economist said he saw room for reduction in the  travel expenditures and allowances for government officials.    "I think the minister is seeking a saving of JD 10 million  to  JD 20 million," given the nature of expenses as given in a  government circular issued Sunday, Dr. al-Fanik said.    "It will be worthwhile even if we save JD 1 million or JD 2  million," he said.    The circular from the Prime Ministry defined the areas of  reduction as water, electricity, fuel, telephone, telex, mail  and stationery expenses.    It said a significant increase in expenditure was noticed in  these areas and that it was necessary to economise in line with  the economic restructuring programme under way in the Kingdom.    Mr. Gammuh said the measures to cut expenditures applied  also  to all public sector undertakings, including institutions such  as the Social Security Corporation, the Jordan Investment Bureau  and other agencies which operate directly under government  guidance.</p>

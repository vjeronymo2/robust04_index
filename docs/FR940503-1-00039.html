			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The decision of the Regional Administrator must be based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable law and on the administrative record, which includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recommended decision of the Presiding Officer. Upon receipt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Presiding Officer's recommended decision, the Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator may either withdraw the field citation, if he  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concludes that the Agency has not sustained its burden of proof,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or issue an order granting the requested relief, in whole or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part. Any decision by the Regional Administrator must be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> writing, supported by clear reasons based on the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record and applicable law, and include a statement of the right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to judicial review and of the procedures and deadlines for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining judicial review. If the Regional Administrator rejects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recommendation of the Presiding Officer, the explanation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that rejection must be in writing and made part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regional Administrator's order must include a discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the applicable penalty factors which were considered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of a penalty under the Act, and set forth the penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed. Part 28 would be revised to limit the Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator's authority to issue a default order by excluding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those based on a default for failure to respond or to request a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing (which would become final, pursuant to section 113(d)(3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the CAA, by operation of law).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any order issued by the Regional Administrator becomes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective thirty days after issuance, unless either the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Appeals Board (the Board) suspends the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the order pursuant to its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sua sponte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority, or a judicial appeal is taken pursuant to section 113(d)(4) of the Act. No person may stay the effective date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an administrative order by attempting to appeal it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administratively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision of the Regional Administrator to issue a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision constitutes final Agency action (subject to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sua sponte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review by the Board) on its effective date, for purposes of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judicial appeal. Withdrawal of the field citation, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not constitute final Agency action, unless it occurs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without prejudice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board, on behalf of the Administrator, is authorized to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review part 28 rulings by Regional Administrators,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sua sponte, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues of law. The Board may not become involved in factfinding; second guess the penalty amount issued by the Regional Administrator; or review orders issued on consent. The Agency anticipates that this review authority will be exercised infrequently, but believes that the authority is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure consistent Agency positions on the applicable law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board may withdraw a Regional Administrator's order if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it determines that the Agency lacks jurisdiction to assess a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty, or if it determines that the Respondent is not liable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under applicable law. The Board shall remand an administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order if it determines that elements of the Respondent's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability are different from those found by the Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator. Under such a remand, the remedy should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformed to the amended conclusions of law. The order shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also be remanded if the Board finds that the order fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide clear reasons for the decision. The Board shall allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Regional Administrator's order to issue unchanged if it finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the order is legally sufficient and it agrees with all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material conclusions of law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties are not permitted under part 28 to administratively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal adverse rulings, either to the Regional Administrator or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Environmental Appeals Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedural Due Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA recognizes that the administrative imposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties for minor violations of the Act may affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitutionally protected interests of those against whom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions have been taken. Part 28 includes precautions to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that individuals subject to a finding of liability for a civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty will have all of the protections that due process of law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires. These precautions include an impartial Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer; the right to a hearing on liability, with a right of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross-examination; and a final Agency action based solely on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative record and applicable law. For a detailed due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process discussion concerning part 28, see the July 1, 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal at 56 FR 29997  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The part 28 procedures provide all of the procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to meet constitutional due process requirements under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the leading Supreme Court case,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mathews <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eldridge <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 424 U.S. 319  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1976). In that case, the Supreme Court set out a three-part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test for determining whether the administrative procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided to an individual prior to the deprivation of a property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest by the government meets the due process requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Fifth Amendment. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mathews  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> test involves balancing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnitude and nature of the individual interest at stake; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit of additional procedures in reducing the risk of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> erroneous deprivation of that interest; and the governmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest in not providing such additional procedures. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the part 28 procedures streamline the adjudicatory process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided for analogous administrative hearings under the APA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those procedures do not eliminate any of the constitutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements of such hearings. The part 28 procedures grant the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person receiving the field citation a full opportunity to review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the evidence of minor violations, as well as address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propriety of the assessed penalty. Since these procedures allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for complete adjudication of liability issues, there would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> little benefit to the Respondent in more extensive or attenuated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, and disproportionate cost to the Agency and to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The field citation program will typically address violation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and penalty issues that are simple and straightforward matters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since these cases should not be complex, their resolution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well-suited to the expedited administrative penalty proceedings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandated by Congress and included in part 28. For these reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as those noted in the July 1, 1991 proposal, EPA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed part 28 procedures would adequately provide for due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process in the assessment of penalties under the field citation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. 40 CFR Part 59_Rules Governing Administrative Hearings on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Field Citations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The third Agency proposal involves using new procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducting administrative hearings requested by persons to whom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> field citations have been issued under section 113(d) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 113(d) of the Act provides that any person to whom a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> field citation is issued may either elect to pay the penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment or to request a hearing, in accordance with procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the regulation which implements the field citation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Section 113(d) further provides that the penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed in the field citation becomes final unless the person to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whom it is issued requests a hearing within the time specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the implementing regulation. Section 113(d)(3) explicitly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that the hearing is not subject to the requirements of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formal adjudicatory hearing under the Administrative Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 554 or 556. Instead, the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Basis for Hearing Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

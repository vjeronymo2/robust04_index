			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney chief forecasts more losses Euro Disney faces losses for 1993-94, even if creditor banks and Walt Disney, its largest shareholder, agree on a financial rescue package for the struggling amusement park owner, AP-DJ reports from Paris. In a report to be presented at today's annual stockholders meeting, Mr Philippe Bourguignon, the chairman of Euro Disney, says that the deficit will continue in the second half of this year, ending September. Euro Disney is working against a March 31 deadline to agree a restructuring plan with its banks and Walt Disney on its FFr21bn (Dollars 3.5bn) of debt. The company lost FFr5.3bn in 1992-93. 'If the restructuring is carried out, these measures ought to improve the financial situation of the group,' Mr Bourguignon says. 'But even so, the group should find itself in a deficit situation for the first and second halves of fiscal year 1994.' Mr Bourguignon says in his report that the 'deeply unbalanced financial structure of Euro Disney has become intolerable to the point of endangering the existence of the enterprise.' The future of the park depends almost entirely on the negotiations with the 63 banks and Walt Disney, which owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, he says.</p>

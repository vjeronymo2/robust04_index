Some members, led by Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, are hoping to be listed by the US administration as eligible for Nafta membership. But the issue appears to be splitting the 20-year-old community, as other members think that all Caricom members, should seek links with Nafta. French President Francois Mitterrand launches a French trade and diplomatic initiative in South Africa, starting with talks in Cape Town with Nelson Mandela.

UK building societies: The Treasury is expected to reveal some time this week the results of a review of building society law which it announced earlier this year.

Puffing into the sunset: The last set of accounts for British Rail as a nationalised organisation, for the year to March 1994, appear today.

Federal Reserve governors and regional presidents meet today and tomorrow to discuss US monetary policy. Many analysts expect the Fed to react to dollar weakness and signs of domestic economic strength by raising interest rates again, either after the meeting or following key employment figures on Friday.

Measured on a yearly basis, manufacturing output is expected to be 1.6 per cent higher than last May. Pay talks will be held in London for 1.5m local government workers. This will be a key test for the UK government's public sector pay bill freeze. Saleroom: Sotheby's in London this morning is offering The Immaculate Conception by Velasquez (detail below) in its auction of Old Masters.

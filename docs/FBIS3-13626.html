He then held talks with his Algerian  counterpart, Mr Mohamed Salah Dembri. The talks started in the  evening at Djenan El Mithak villa and revolved around bilateral  ties and the Palestinian cause, which is at the center of all  Arab states' concerns. Samia Azzi reports:    [Azzi] Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' visited  Algeria  for two days as a special envoy of President Hafiz al-Asad to  meet President Liamine Zeroual. This morning, he was met on the  second day of his visit by the head of state and handed over a  message from Zeroual's Syrian counterpart, Hafiz al-Asad.    At the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Mohamed Salah Dembri received  his Syrian counterpart. The talks were extended to include  delegations of both countries. Mr. Faruq al-Shar' did not  conceal the Syrian Government's concern about what was happening  in Algeria.    The talks were not restricted to conditions in Algeria but  included bilateral ties and their future. During the meeting,  an agreement was reached to revive the activity of the bilateral  Algerian-Syrian committee. It is to convene next June.    What is happening in the Middle East, particularly after the  massacre at al-Ibrahimi mosque, and the Arab position in  general, were subjects discussed by the two sides. They  unanimously agreed on the necessity to put the problems forward  at the Arab League's ministerial council during its ordinary  session.    [Begin recording] [Al-Shar'] I am satisfied with the outcome  of this visit. I am particularly satisfied with what I heard  from President Zeroual concerning various issues -- whether  those dealing with international or Arab spheres, including the  importance of Arab solidarity and Arab unity to confront various  challenges. We held in-depth discussions on the internal  situation in sisterly Algeria and also on bilateral ties between  the two sisterly countries and means of boosting them. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by LDDP Deputy Chairman Gediminas Kirkilas: </F> "Provincialism or the Fear of Competition?"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The level of political  culture largely depends on the ability of parties' to compete  among themselves. I suppose that the public's opinion on  democracy, parliamentarism, and pluralism is also very  important. It is no secret that opponents of democratic  development are trying to persuade society to accept the ideas  of "a firm hand," "order," and so on, by pointing to  parliamentary discussions and uncultured attacks of one party  against another. For obvious reasons, it is not difficult to do  this in our current situation.    The current opponents, who previously held power, are  particularly angry and impertinent. One can understand them:  Their greatest desire is to return to power as soon as  possible, and the current majority, that is, the Lithuanian  Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], is their "number-one enemy"....    It is more difficult to understand the relations,  particularly recent ones, between the LDDP and the Lithuanian  Social Democratic Party [LSDP]. Our supporters are calling and  asking us what happened to make the two parties so hostile  toward one another recently.    Certainly, given the latest LSDP press conferences and its  leader A. Sakalas' special trip to the Socialist International  with the aim of lodging complaints against the LDDP and  preventing its admission to this organization, such questions  are only natural. We say nothing about the Social Democrats'  pitifully ridiculous interpellation to the government and their  weekly LIETUVOS ZINIOS [News of Lithuania] permeated with LDDP  criticism, which, incidentally, has not published an LDDP  opinion even once, while TIESA has done this quite often.    I will begin from LDDP's attitude toward the Social  Democrats. Our attitude toward the LSDP and its activities has  been positive since the very beginning. We remember how both  factions often voted together or held similar positions in the  former Supreme Council, particularly when we had to defend  democracy and common sense. Both parties expressed the same  views on and contributed most to the May 1992 referendum by  speaking out against greater powers for the former parliament  leader [Landsbergis], as well as the same opinion on the  constitutional process.    As we remember, the 1992 elections to the Seimas  [parliament]  were not very successful for the LSDP. Shortly thereafter, the  LSDP leadership refused to cooperate with the LDDP government or  form a coalition. The Social Democrats, liberals, and centrists  must have feared the rightists' accusations of "collaboration"  with the LDDP government.... Despite such a position, the LDDP  faction voted for LSDP leader A. Sakalas when electing the  Seimas deputy chairman, and later appointed him head of the  Lithuanian delegation to the European Council Parliamentary  Assembly.    This does not mean that the LDDP is demanding some unusual  loyalty from the Social Democrats. I think, however, that we  could expect normal relations. One cannot say that the Social  Democratic opposition is as destructive as that of the  right-wing parties which, in general, are continuing the  election campaign and organizing strikes, rallies, pickets, and  so on. The Social Democrats, and, maybe, the liberals and  centrists, are trying to uphold a more civilized spirit of  political discussion. This is very important, because the  destructive policy of the right-wing opposition could make  Lithuania's political life absurd and completely discredit  parliamentarism and the shoots of democracy.    However, one cannot help noticing the LSDP nervous reaction  to LDDP attempts to become a member of the Socialist  International. What is this: Provincialism, the fear of  competition, or the inferiority complex of a smaller party? In  my opinion, we should not compete for membership in this  prestigious international organization. One of the key  principles of the Socialist International is the solidarity of  leftist forces. [passage omitted]    In some post-communist countries of Europe, for example, in  Poland and Slovakia, social democratic and leftist parties  overcame this syndrome of provincialism long ago, and they can  cooperate and form coalitions.    The LDDP and LSDP membership in, as well as prestige and  influence on international organizations will depend on their  actual political weight in the legislature rather than on  international party intrigues and the extrapolation of our  provincial relations to Europe. Currently, the LDDP is  cooperating, exchanging delegations and experience, and  consulting with social democratic and leftist parties in France,  Britain, Poland, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Hungary, and  Germany, as well as in Scandinavia and the Baltic states. We  participate in the work of the European Forum for Democracy and  Solidarity (one of the divisions in the Socialist  International), women's and youth organizations, and  foundations. Our membership in one or another organization will  depend on the majority's opinion rather than on that of  individual leaders.    Certainly, while talking with leaders of some European  party,  it is not pleasant to learn that our colleagues from another  Lithuanian party have already tried to impart an unfavorable  opinion of the LDDP.

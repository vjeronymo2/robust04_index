			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US says Spain abused OECD rules on aid THE US and Spain have become embroiled in a row over a suspected attempt by Madrid to circumvent tough new curbs against the misuse of aid to buy market share in developing countries. Washington, supported by many of its fellow members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), has accused Spain of abusing the new rules by launching two unusually large lines of export credit only a fortnight before the restrictions come into effect. The new rules will restrict the use of such assistance to genuine development aid, such as schools and hospitals, and ban it entirely for richer developing countries. The dispute blew up after Spain informed the OECD's Paris headquarters that it had agreed to make available SDR723m (Pounds 565m) of mixed aid and commercial credit to Mexico and SDR650m to Venezuela, both of which would be ineligible for such assistance under the new rules. These credit lines, the latest in a long-standing Spanish campaign to promote trade links with Latin America, are available for two years and are made on condition that the recipients use them to purchase Spanish exports, an OECD official said. Their combined value of SDR1.4bn compares with Spain's Dollars 800m (Pounds 446m) aid budget for 1990, according to the OECD's latest records. Spanish officials say most of - if not all - the credit lines are simply existing credits which had not been fully taken up and which are being renewed. They are among the five largest concessional credit lines ever recorded by the OECD, an official close to the talks said. A US official added that the move was a serious breach of the agreement. Italy, which like Spain, had resisted the new curbs, has also made available unusually large concessional credits recently, but these are not nearly large enough to cause a political problem, officials say. The curbs were agreed in principle at the end of last October, pending ratification by OECD members' parliaments. They received their final touches at an OECD meeting in Paris this week, and will come into effect on February 15. The new rules allow OECD members to vet each others' aid projects in advance to ensure aid budgets are not used for schemes that could be commercially financed. Projects of more than SDR50m must be examined by a committee of OECD members.</p>

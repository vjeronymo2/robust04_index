			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Haluk Geray: "Design by the U.S. Congress on the </F> Kurdish Problem"]    [Text] Ankara--It has been reported that the argument in  the Congress that the U.S. Administration has violated the UN  embargo on Baghdad is aimed at legalizing the scenario on the  establishment of an independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq.  It will be recalled that Lee Hamilton, head of the House  Subcommittee on Europe and Middle East Affairs who defends the  view that Turkey should allow the Kurds to establish a  federation or a state of their own, claimed in the Congress two  days ago that the Clinton Administration has violated the  embargo on Iraq. According to Hamilton, the allocation of funds  for the Kurds for the acquisition of oil from the Baghdad  Administration constitutes a violation of the UN sanctions.    Several sources in Ankara have described Hamilton's approach  as aimed at justifying the plans that have been drawn up to  fragment Iraq for the establishment of an independent state in  the northern part of that country. The sources said that the  export of oil from Iraq would be a violation of the UN embargo  but, technically speaking, the transfer of oil by the Baghdad  Administration from one part of that country to another cannot  be regarded as a violation of the sanctions.    An official has said that Hamilton may be right only if a  Kurdish State existed in northern Iraq. He asserted: "The  United States, European Union, and Turkey have provided  humanitarian aid to the Kurds in northern Iraq. That applies to  the need of the Kurds for fuel. They have used the funds the  United States has made available to them to acquire oil from  al-Mawsil. That cannot be described as a violation of the  embargo because the oil remains in Iraq. However, any attempt to  take the oil out of Iraq will violate the embargo. Hamilton  wished to hint that a Kurdish State exists above the 36th  parallel in Iraq. He believes that the embargo has been  violated because a foreign state has purchased oil from Iraq  with U.S. funds. It seems that he is convinced that Iraq has  been divided into two parts and that anything that crosses from  the south to the northern part of the 36th parallel is an  exported commodity."    Considering the fact that Iraq's territorial integrity is  essential for the preservation of Turkey's territorial  integrity, Ankara is convinced that the Clinton Administration  has not violated the embargo from a technical viewpoint.  However, officials have drawn attention to the following:  <H5>  Funds Have Been Transferred </H5>   Technically speaking, the embargo may not have been  violated.  Nevertheless, funds have been transferred to Baghdad through the  Kurds in Iraq. However, Turkey's plan to withdraw oil from the  Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline does not require the transfer of  funds to the Baghdad Administration. The source that will be  created through the withdrawal of the oil from that pipeline  will be channeled to Iraq in the form of foodstuffs.    The signs we have received from Washington indicate that  Turkey and the United States may agree on that plan. In fact,  Ankara expects the U.S. Administration to finalize its  assessment during the next few days. The UN Security Council or  the UN Sanctions Committee will most likely make the necessary  "changes" to allow Turkey's plan to be put into effect.    Meanwhile, it has been ascertained that the Kurdish  officials  in northern Iraq have proposed to Ankara that Turkey should move  to prospect for oil in their part of the country.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STARLITES ENJOY A FAMILIAR RESULT IN THEIR NEW HOME  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Starlites, who have won all the championships Major League  Volleyball has awarded (two) only to meet with mass indifference at home, began  their third season seemingly bent on making some sort of wave.  </P> <P> And so, Friday, there on the Bren Center floor, were couples dancing to Rolling  Stone riffs from a quintet called the Junk Band ("The Starlites' official music  machine"), professional football cheerleaders signing autographs and, in the  seats, a lot of people who got to the place with free tickets.  </P> <P> "We gave them out wherever we could," said George Corey, one of the team's four  owners.  </P> <P> The announced crowd of 1,528 -- which included those with free tickets -- was a  big difference for a team that played in front of home crowds as sparse as 25  last season.  </P> <P> "I actually heard people cheering," said Starlites outside hitter Dale Hall.  </P> <P> "This is easily twice as large as any home crowd we played in front of last  year," said Al Gasparian, Starlites coach.  </P> <P> What hasn't changed is the Starlites' habit for winning in this league. The  Starlites, who have compiled a 36-8 record their previous two seasons, easily  handled the Portland Spikers, 15-2, 15-11, 15-9.  </P> <P> The Starlites jumped to a 9-0 lead in the first game and cruised to a victory.  The Spikers -- who were the Arizona Blaze last season and the Dallas Belles the  season before -- held leads of 2-0 in the second game and 5-0 in the third only  to have the Starlites overtake them in each.  </P> <P> Hall's all-around game -- eight kills, eight blocks, 12 digs -- seemed to spark  the Starlites all night. She is one of three players presently on the team who  played on last season's championship team. Among those who left was former U.S.  Olympic team standout Rita Crockett, who is now playing in Italy.  </P> <P> Though his personnel has taken a change for the drastic, Gasparian said he felt  "fortunate that things on the court didn't look as different from last season  as I thought they might."  </P> <P> Of course, Portland also only had three players from last season's team. And  unlike the Starlites, Portland didn't have a lot to build on to begin with. The  then-Blaze had the league's worst record last season at 5-16.  </P> <P> "We were in the same position they were in before this season," said Terry  McLaughlin, Portland coach. "But obviously they've progressed a lot farther  then we have."  </P> <P> Among the Starlites' new players making an immediate impact was Detra Brown,  who led the team with 10 kills. Margaret Grant (17) and Sherri Brinkman-Reilly  (16) provided solid blocking.  </P> <P> The Starlites play the San Jose Golddigggers, whom they have beaten in each of  their league championship finals, Sunday in San Jose.  </P></p>

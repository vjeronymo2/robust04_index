			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 23, BNS -- Members of the Estonian  Liberal Democratic Party [ELDP], Culture and Education Minister  Paul-Eerik Rummo and Finance Minister Heiki Kranich will for the  time being continue as Cabinet members.    Rummo and Kranich were authorized by the ELDP council and  the  Liberals faction in parliament to continue in the present  government pending the outcome of the Pro Patria congress  scheduled mid-June in Tallinn.    The decision was made already Thursday [19 May] but the  party  council and the Liberals faction agreed to make it public only  after the coalition council session early this morning.    The ELDP proposes that Pro Patria's coalition partners --  the  Estonian Rural Centrist Party [ERCP], the Estonian National  Independence Party [ENIP], the Estonian Social Democratic Party  [ESDP] and the ELDP -- should get together and work out their  stand on the nomination of a new prime minister as well as other  possible Cabinet reshuffles.    The ELDP says its proposal stems from its "concern that the  government should remain operational and the coalition survive."    The other coalition partners, ERCP, ENIP and ESDP, announced  at the end of last week they don't plan to recall their  ministers from the government. Pro Patria member, Foreign  Minister Juri Luik told reporters today he has no intention of  leaving the Cabinet before the Pro Patria congress.</p>

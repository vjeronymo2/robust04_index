			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Arkadiy Nikiforov report in the "Power" column: "Boris </F> Yeltsin Supports Yuriy Skokov's Proposals. Viktor Chernomyrdin  Has Been Tasked With Promoting Collaboration With the Russian  Commodity Producers Federation"]    [Text] As has become known, Boris Yeltsin recently  considered and approved proposals by the Russian Commodity  Producers Federation [CPF] urging prompt measures to salvage  domestic industrial and agricultural production. As  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reported earlier, the message by CPF  Chairman Yuriy Skokov to the Russian president presented  proposals on organizing a system of interaction between the  federation and the government to map out and undertake concrete  joint actions. Boris Yeltsin tasked Viktor Chernomyrdin with  setting up contacts with the CPF in the interests of overcoming  the catastrophic production decline and slowing down the growth  in unemployment.    Interestingly, the CPF's initiatives are meeting with  approval not only in the Kremlin but also abroad. During Yuriy  Skokov's visit to Germany in March and to France in April,  representatives of government and business circles in those  countries accepted the CPF's proposal to conclude agreements  with the major employers' associations of these countries. Such  agreements should make up the foundation for a system of  nongovernmental interaction between Russian and foreign  commodity producers which is expected to resolve a whole number  of complicated problems of international economic cooperation  and collaboration.    Practical activity to create a system of basically new  interrelations between Russian manufacturers and their own  government and foreign partners is a real step toward forming a  complex market infrastructure, without which a free enterprise  system cannot work effectively. In this context Yuriy Skokov's  activity finds understanding not only among large Russian  businesses but also, for example, in U.S. financial and banking  circles. Thus, a member of the U.S. delegation led by the U.S.  commerce secretary who visited Russia at the end of March stated  that the period of reform "from above," associated with the name  of Yegor Gaydar, has passed. Today reforms will produce an  effect only if the painstaking efforts by Skokov and others to  create viable elements of a modern market economy, based on  Russia's specifics, are a success.    Next to Yuriy Skokov's declared intention to contest the  1996  presidential elections, the tactics and strategy of his actions  appear peculiar. Unlike other potential presidential  candidates, he has practically given up active self-promotion in  the mass media, apparently believing that the best advertising  is his strongly consolidated position as a leader in domestic  financial-industrial capital.</p>

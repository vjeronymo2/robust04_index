			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Moldova tanks move on breakaway region MOLDOVAN tanks and armoured vehicles were reported last night to be mobilising near the disputed town of Bendery, as the conflict in the breakaway region of Trans-Dnestr threatened to worsen. The military movement came just a few hours after Moldova urged Russia to show restraint to avoid war over TransDnestr. There were already heavy casualties in weekend fighting in the region. Nationalist Russians and Ukrainians in TransDnestr want to break away from the largely Romanian-populated Moldova in one of a string of ethnic conflicts in former republics of the Soviet Union. The separatists early yesterday seized back control of Bendery from Moldovan troops and police who had captured it just the day before. But they feared that a force of about 2,500 heavily armed Moldovan troops on the outskirts might mount an attack before dawn today. TransDnestr officials said some 300 separatists had been killed in clashes in the past two days. The Moldovan Defence Ministry put Moldovan losses in the previous 24 hours at 30 dead and 200 wounded, with 100 killed and 300 wounded on the other side. Moldovan President Mircea Snegur was quoted by Itar-Tass news agency as accusing Moscow of imperialist designs and saying any intervention by Russia's 14th Army, stationed in TransDnestr, would mark the start of all-out war. Interfax news agency said Mr Snegur urged Russian President Boris Yeltsin in a telegram to show restraint and not to intervene in his country's internal affairs. This appeal was in response to tough warnings by Mr Yeltsin and his deputy, General Alexander Rutskoi, that Moscow would intervene to protect minority Russians in the former Soviet republics. In a lull in the conflict yesterday tanks vied with strolling families for space on the streets of Tiraspol, beleaguered capital of TransDnestr, about 10km from Bendery. A few dozen exhausted volunteer fighters from the Kirov factory in Tiraspol nibbled at strawberries, dozed in the sun and dodged machine gun fire from a Moldovan sniper on the ninth floor of an apartment overlooking their positions. But the casual attitude of soldiers and civilians alike was no sign that the conflict was abating. The weekend fighting has further alienated TransDnestr from Moldova. And with open Russian military support, the sliver of land on the right bank of the Dnestr river, with fewer than 1m inhabitants, is now grimly confident it can beat back the Moldovans. 'It will be a real war,' warned Mr Veleri Litskoi, the secretary of state of the breakaway region. 'But even with the support of the Romanian army Moldova cannot defeat us. Together with the 14th Army our forces are 200 per cent adequate.' Mr Litskoi believed the 10,000-20,000 well-trained 14th Army troops based in Trans-Dnestr, many of them locals, together with the region's Republican Guard, which is commanded by 14th Army officers, could repel any further attacks even if Romania threw its support behind Moldova, with which it has close ethnic ties. Romania yesterday condemned alleged Russian interference in Moldova.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Danger of confusion in financial markets Sir, 'The Bank of England yesterday warned that unless base rates are increased in the next few months (my italics) the government could fail to meet its target of reducing inflation to a 1-2.5 per cent range by the end of this parliament' (front page, lead story, August 3). This report covered the publication of the Bank of England Quarterly Inflation Report. Yet nowhere in the report itself did these words appear. Its conclusion was: 'If official interest rates were to remain unchanged over the next two years, then it is probable that inflation would gradually rise to a level above the mid-point of the target range' (my italics again). Which has the more authoritative status, the text of the Inflation Report, or the warning given to the press interpreting it? The Bank of England risks creating confusion in financial markets by giving an interpretation to its own words which goes well beyond their meaning as written. It would have been helpful had your reporters at least drawn attention to the written conclusion of the Inflation Report, so that readers could have drawn their own conclusions from the contrast between the two. If the Bank's 'warning' was to be taken seriously, it should surely have been written into the Inflation Report conclusion. If the Bank does not recommend a rise in rates within the next few months, it can point to the written text; if it does, it can point to the warning. It is a bit too like the old system of nods and winks which was supposed to have been replaced by the 'new policy of openness', with the report at the centre of it.

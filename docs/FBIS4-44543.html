A few days  ago, Shanghai Shentong [3947 6639] International S&amp;T  Company--formed from the Shanghai Municipal Land Management  Bureau and Shanghai Jiaotong University's Overseas  Company--reached agreement with Hong Kong's Huaxu [5478 2485]  Ltd. to build on this plot a US$70 million trans-century smart  tower. Groundbreaking for this smart tower, to be called  Shentong Square, took place yesterday. The joint venture,  called Shanghai Shentong Real Estate Development Ltd., hoisted  its signpost yesterday as it geared up for this development  project. The 28-floor Shentong Square, occupying 60,000 square  meters of land, is to be completed in 1996, in honor of the  centennial of the university. The tower offices will be  partially sold and partially leased.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec resolve faces test of March output figures PRODUCTION discipline among members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has given oil prices a boost in the past couple of weeks. But the market has since settled into a tight range as traders await final output figures for the club's March production. Opec members are believed to have pumped between 24m barrels a day (b/d) and 24.3m b/d in March. This is still some way above the organisation's ceiling of 23.58m b/d which was set in February, but indicates that countries are at least cutting back from last month's high output levels of around 24.6m b/d. 'There will be some leaks, but it doesn't matter. The market can absorb it and this is better than expected,' said Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, the UK stockbrokers. Others are less sanguine, expressing concern about expected Iranian over-production. Iran's output is estimated at anywhere between 3.5m b/d and 3.8m b/d, which implies some decline from its level of 3.85m b/d in February, but still above its quota of 3.34m b/d. 'If Iran doesn't show much of a production decline by April, I will be quite concerned about the market prospects because it raises the prospect of Kuwait cheating,' said Mr Gary Ross, chief executive of Petroleum Industry Research Associates in New York. Mr Ali al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister, has threatened to produce more than his country's quota if he sees any other members flouting their own production ceilings. But Mr al-Baghli reasserted at the weekend that Kuwait was sticking to its quota of 1.6m b/d. This is backed up by some independent surveys and tanker tracking data. Oil prices on the International Petroleum Exchange have been trading in a range for the past week as volumes have been low. The market is searching for a direction and traders have seized upon Opec as the guiding factor. Brent crude for delivery in June was Dollars 18.76 a barrel, down 17 cents, on the IPE last night. 'We'll all be looking for the nature of seepage from the Opec agreement,' said Mr Peter Hills, head of the energy desk in London at ED &amp; F. Man, the international commodities house. Mr Hills said the market will not be concerned if all members are overproducing slightly, but if the extra barrels are coming from Iran, it will perceive more of a problem. World demand for the second quarter is expected to be 1.3 per cent higher than last year. Mr Pyne believes that if Opec can keep its production at 24.2m b/d in the second quarter, Brent prices will average Dollars 19 a barrel and could reach Dollars 20 a barrel. Opec ministers will meet informally in Oman on April 13 to review market developments, but they are unlikely to set any policy. Ministers talks are expected to focus on Opec's opposition to carbon taxes. A difficulty facing the club's next formal meeting in early June could be a demand from Kuwait for parity with the United Arab Emirates which produces around 2.2m b/d. This could mean Kuwait absorbing any overall increase in Opec production towards the end of the year, which will be hard for Saudi Arabia and Iran to stomach. Both countries are facing revenue shortfalls. In addition, some market rumours and US press reports suggest that Iraq is breaking the United Nations' embargo on exporting its crude. So far, this is reported to have been a trickle of sales to Iran via a refinery in Sudan, but the prospect of Iraqi oil returning to the international market could ruin the current price stability. In the meantime, all eyes are on Opec and official estimates of member countries' production levels which are due out by the end of the week. This could be enough to jolt prices out of their current range.</p>

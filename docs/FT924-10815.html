			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Strong City support belies Blenheim's dilemma - Angus Foster examines deepseated fears that the show organiser has grown too fast too quickly as new competitors hungrily eye its territory BELIEVERS in the house of Blenheim beware. The rapidly growing organiser of exhibitions, which has seen its market capitalisation increase from Pounds 65m towards Pounds 500m in the last two years, is begining to look overvalued. The company's support in the City remains robust. After UK operations suffered from slack controls in the late 1980s, management is again widely seen as effective. Its strategy of exploiting the previously unsophisticated exhibition industry is credible. And it is financially sound, with net borrowings below Pounds 40m and interest cover of 7 times. But questions are being raised. Rapid growth, largely led by acquisitions in France and the US, will be increasingly difficult to maintain. Most of the big shows have already been bought by Blenheim and competitors like EMAP and Reed International, and purchase prices in the US are now high. Plans to use exhibition databases to move into trade magazines have yet to establish a track record. Yesterday's 5 per cent fall in the share price, down 29p to 504p, reflects new caution following the company's announcement Tuesday that pre-tax profits are up 31.8 per cent to Pounds 37.3m in the 12 months to August 31. Some analysts say Blenheim's shares, which are trading respectively on 15 times and 13 times forecast earnings of Pounds 46m and Pounds 54m for 1993 and 1994, are set at least to consolidate as growth slows and the company matures. 'My feeling is the City has not come to terms with Blenheim's medium term prospects, and has yet to adjust accordingly,' according to one fund manager with shares in the company. Blenheim's success has been based on two pillars. In the early 1980s in realised that exhibitions, mainly run by individual entrepreneurs and trade associations, would be extremely profitable - with margins of up to 50 per cent - if centrally managed by professionals. After seizing the chance, it paid more than Pounds 300m in cash and shares buying exhibitions in the US and Europe. Although some purchases failed, and others in retrospect were too expensive, Blenheim did acquire events like the building supply exhibition in Batimat, France and computer shows in the US. Blenheim needed its second pillar, a premium stock market rating, to acquire overseas shows, often at 10-15 times earnings, without dilution. This rating was earned by performance, but also by effective financial public relations. Mr Neville Buch, chairman, is a former City fund manager adept at dealing with institutions. Blenheim is confident of continued above average growth from exhibitions. The costs of hiring and staffing a stand at an exhibition are often three or more times cheaper than advertising. According to Mr Phil Soar, group chief executive, exhibitors only meet potential buyers. 'We provide an audience with no wastage,' Mr Soar said. Blenheim is also improving yields. Exhibition space has traditionally been sold at flat rates per square metre. But at some UK and German exhibitions, Blenheim sells according to a stand's location and flow of visitors. This boost margins. At the same time, the company has concentrated on costs, reducing headcount and rationalising offices. The success rate for new exhibitions, which stood at about 20 per cent between 1985-1990, has more than tripled as stricter launch criteria was introduced. In the period just ended, pre-tax margins increased 1 percentage point to 24.3 per cent, and profit per employee increased 38 per cent in the last two years. This was despite recession, which particularly affected UK exhibitions. There are now fears of a downturn in France, which contributed 53 per cent to profits last year. Blenheim hopes its market leadership, and companies' preference to cut advertising ahead of exhibition costs, will provide protection. Exhibition databases are being used to provide new services and generate new profit streams mainly from trade publishing, but also from seminars and corporate training. The aim, according to Mr Buch, is to reinforce exhibitions and maintain regular contact with exhibitors. In the next five years, the proportion of profits from exhibitions could fall 10 per cent from 80 per cent as publishing profits grow. The company now publishes 15 magazines with a similar number planned for launch. Although circulation is small, some are extremely profitable. Bobbin, an 8,500 copy per month US textile publication, makes Dollars 14 profit a copy - Dollars 1.4m a year. Acquisitions will continue, but at a slower rate. The company is negotiating to take a 50 per cent stake in running the City of Stockholm's exhibitions. It is also looking at small acquisitions in Germany, Italy and Spain. Despite Blenheim's confidence about the future, and its record of improved margins, its strategy is not watertight. Because of its size, it is increasingly vulnerable to competition. Soon after paying Pounds 23.9m for the leading New York jewellery exhibition last year, Blenheim discovered the main US jewellery magazine was launching a rival show in Las Vegas. Mr Soar said the shows target different exhibitors. But given the low launch costs for exhibitions, and potential profits, other competitors are sure to follow. Blenheim successfully acquired large shows like Batimat and computer exhibitions in the US, partly because management was retained. After several years of low growth at the bi-annual Batimat, pre-contracted revenues for 1993 have jumped 72 per cent to Pounds 22.4m as more space became available. But with smaller exhibitions, which the company is being forced to look for, the record is mixed. Mr Buch agrees Blenheim overpaid for several UK shows. It has closed down its Belgian operations, which could not generate enough volume, and Switzerland is believed to be performing poorly. Blenheim has also suffered from lack of middle management continuity. Of Blenheim's 25 managing directors in 1992, 11 have left. Mr Buch said this is because the company grew so quickly and because training was overlooked until recently. A lack of management resources, due to the company's rapid growth, has left Blenheim virtually unrepresented in the Far East, source of much of Reed Exhibitions' recent growth. Lastly, the move into trade publishing is risky, despite Mr Soar's background in the industry. Developing magazines, as the company itself points out, takes more than five years. In that period, a once dominant exhibition can be undermined by competitors. If an exhibition folds, the losses are probably less than Pounds 50,000. If a magazine goes with it, the accumulated losses could be several times that figure. According to one of Blenheim's competitors with magazine and exhibition interests, launching magazines to support events is a high cost and long term venture. 'I'm not convinced they can do that without sacrificing their high growth reputation, so far deserved, in the City,' he said.</p>

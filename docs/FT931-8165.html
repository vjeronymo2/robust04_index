			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Newcastle Building Society 11% ahead Newcastle Building Society raised pre-tax profits by 11 per cent from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 13.5m in 1992, while assets grew from Pounds 971.5m to Pounds 1.08bn. Mr Bill Midgely, the managing director, said it had been a good, solid year which bode well for 1993. Profit growth took into account full provisioning in respect of actual and anticipated mortgage losses on repossessed properties and anticipated losses on serious arrears cases. Mr Midgely said continuing uncertainty in the housing and financial services sector had prompted the society to be especially prudent as regards provisions this year. It had taken on a general reserve of Pounds 250,000 and, in doing so, had depressed profit growth by 2 per cent. Net advances increased from Pounds 95.3m to Pounds 114.6m in the year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Staff Major General Haytham Qasim </F> Tahir, former defense minister of the Republic of Yemen and  present "defense minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen"  and member of the Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist  Party, by Salih al-Qallab; place and date not given -- published  in conjunction with London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT]    [Text] [Al-Qallab] The northern forces advanced on all axes  while your forces are still on the defensive. What are the real  reasons for this?    [Tahir] The other party in Sanaa has fully prepared for the  war over a long period of time. The treacherous attacks on our  units in the north were practical "rehearsals" for this war.  Moreover, the regime in Sanaa has thrown in all the army and  tens of thousands of armed tribes that are loyal to this regime  and to 'Abdallah Bin- Husayn al-Ahmar. It also mobilized the  entire human and material resources of the state in this war.    As for us, we confronted this all-out war with modest human  and material resources because the balance of power between us  and them is no more than one to 10. This means every 10  brigades by Sanaa will be met by only one brigade on our side.  For example, 7,500 troops attacked our (southern) 650-strong 3d  Armored Brigade, which was stationed in the outskirts of Sanaa.  Nevertheless, this war has failed to achieve its strategic  objectives. As you may know, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his  advisers had planned to settle accounts with what they termed  "separatists" in two or three days.    [Al-Qallab] Why were you late in your reply at the start of  the war, especially after the destruction of your brigades in  the north? Were you not expecting a northern military action of  such magnitude?    [Tahir] In fact, and as you have said, we never expected  'Ali  'Abdallah Salih to go so far as to launch an all-out war against  our people. The war began by attacking and annihilating our  brigades in the north and then by storming our borders from four  directions. This was accompanied by random artillery, missile,  and air bombardment of villages, houses, and schools. Vital  economic installations like the Aden refineries, water and power  stations, and secure residential areas were also bombed.    Actually, we had a bitter experience with 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, from whom we saw nothing but maneuvers. We were also not  prepared for this war which was imposed on us. Nevertheless,  our Armed Forces and people confronted the aggressors in all  governorates after it became certain that the aim of the war is  occupation and domination of the south, something which has  never been accomplished. The war is entering its 50th day and  the steadfastness of our people and forces is, in all criteria,  considered victory.    [Al-Qallab] You spoke about Sudanese and Iraqi participation  in the fighting against you, but you did not prove that through  prisoners, equipment, or other evidence.    [Tahir] There is absolutely no doubt about the participation  of Iraq and Sudan in this war on the side of the regime in  Sanaa. There are Iraqi military experts and soldiers fighting  with the northern forces. Some of them were captured at Shabwah  axis. There was audio and visual news media coverage of this  subject. I can confirm to you that the war launched against us  is totally run by Iraqi expertise. Sudan is also directly or  indirectly participating in this war, thus proceeding from the  declared alliance between the two regimes in Sanaa and  Khartoum--an alliance in which the extremists play a basic and  decisive role. The "Arab Afghan" groups are also fighting with  the northern forces.    [Al-Qallab] Is it true that there are northern penetrations  in your ranks?    [Tahir] It is quite natural for the so-called penetrations  to  occur, not only in our ranks, but also in the ranks of the  northern forces. The reason is that we were one state. As for  us, we did not think with a conspiratorial mentality or work  with intelligence methods as the other party did. In any case,  this had no impact on our forces' combat position on the fronts.  The war the other party triggered against our people was an  all-out war which was opposed by all not only in the south but  also in the north as well as in the Arab homeland and the entire  world. Matters have become clear and the war is no longer a war  against "rebels" or "separatists" as Sanaa media rumored. It  emerged as a war against en entire people and state, which is  the Democratic Republic of Yemen.    [Al-Qallab] Does President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih want  indeed to see Aden fall, or did he intend to pressure you on  that front in order to keep your forces in this area so that he  can divert his attention to the oil-rich region of Shabwah?    [Tahir] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih cannot take Aden or occupy the  oil-rich areas in Shabwah. The only thing he could do was to  bring about further damage and destruction in Yemen, murder more  innocent civilians, and destroy the northern and southern  armies. Events since the eruption of fighting on 27 April  confirmed that this is a losing war in which there will be no  victors. Certainly, the results of this war will be against the  wishes of those who ignited it.    [Al-Qallab] The northerners are accusing you of receiving  military aid from certain neighboring states. How true are  these accusations?    [Tahir] These accusations are merely propaganda aimed at  diverting attention from the aid which the other party is  receiving from a number of states. Foreign media and diplomatic  sources revealed on several occasions the names of these states.    [Al-Qallab] It is well known that you use Soviet and  eastern- bloc weapons in general. How have you managed during  the war, especially with spare parts?    [Tahir] We have sufficient weapons and equipment to defend  ourselves and the sovereignty of our state.    [Al-Qallab] If there was a cease-fire, how will you deal  with the issue of the Democratic Republic of Yemen's territory  occupied by the northern troops during the war?    [Tahir] The cease-fire is no longer a Yemeni issue, but an  international one, according to UN Security Council Resolution  924 which was only adopted after 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih refused to  heed the calls of reason and logic and all the Arab appeals and  initiatives to stop this war, which aims at murder and  destruction. We have presented an initiative to set up a team of  international observers to monitor the cease-fire and the  withdrawal of the northern troops to the positions they occupied  before the fighting started. Here, I wish to stress that we  will not relinquish a single inch of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen's territory.    [Al-Qallab] Do you think things will stop at that point if a  cease-fire goes into effect, or will the war take another shape?    [Tahir] This war was imposed on us by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  and his regime. We are defending ourselves and our people's  right to a dignified, free life without any humiliation or  submission. Our people have chosen their own future and path by  supporting the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen  which is based on law and order and respect for human rights.    [Al-Qallab] Since you are the defense minister and aware of  many things, who do you think is planning and running the  operations on the northern side?    [Tahir] I was the defense minister of the Republic of Yemen  and I am now the defense minister of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen. I know that the military regime in Sanaa has long ago  planned this all-out war against our people in the Democratic  Republic of Yemen. I know that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's advisers  and Iraqi military experts have planned and run the military  operations against our people. Their schemes, however, failed,  or, at least, were not implemented according to plan. They only  succeeded in inflicting further human losses and destroy and  sabotage the economic infrastructure in the northern and  southern parts of Yemen.    [Al-Qallab] What are the real losses in men and equipment?    [Tahir] If we are talking about military losses within the  southern army, these are very small and limited, despite the  acts of treachery against our units that were based in the  north. As for civilians, there were great losses because the  battles were fought on our land and because the northern troops  deliberately and indiscriminately bombarded, with rockets and  artillery and from the air, the towns and villages, including  the capital Aden, leaving hundreds of dead and wounded among the  innocent, defenseless people.    You can be certain that the civilian losses on the northern  side are very small because from the beginning, our forces were  eager not to hit the cities and residential areas in the north.  As for the military, the northern troops suffered major losses,  which I estimate at scores of thousands of dead and wounded.  This is because our forces were in a defensive position while  the other troops were attacking. Furthermore, the Sanaa regime  was throwing in scores of thousands of untrained young men who  had no faith in this losing war.    [Al-Qallab] Why did the northern forces bombard southern  airports and vital targets at a time when you ceased to attack  the northern airports, although you bombarded Sanaa airport at  the beginning of the fighting?    [Tahir] We did not bombard Sanaa airport. We only bombarded  military targets in this airport and scored accurate hits on the  first day of war. We did not bombard any vital, economic, or  service targets, contrary to the northern forces which  indiscriminately attacked power and water stations, oil  refineries, schools, hospitals, and residential areas. All  northern air raids and attacks, however, did not score any  worthwhile hits against our military targets despite the Iraqi  and other foreign expertise and aid.    [Al-Qallab] Is it true that the northerners are pushing you  to declare a state in Hadhramaut, so they can turn Aden into a  free zone and annex the governorates captured by the northern  forces?    [Tahir] There is no doubt about it. The Sanaa regime's talk  about legitimacy and unity is an exposed media and political  deception. However, I assert to you that our people will  courageously and valiantly resist and will defend every inch of  the Democratic Republic of Yemen.    [Al-Qallab] What proposal on unity will you accept, now that  the previous formula has failed and resulted in this devastating  war?    [Tahir] It is difficult to discuss any formula for a unity  with Sanaa's military regime which slaughtered unity and wanted  to annihilate our people and occupy their territory.    [Al-Qallab] Why has there thus far been no Arab recognition  of you? Does this mean that you entered the war without having  made good calculations and good assessment of the situation?    [Tahir] What we care about is that our people have chosen  their path, and the steadfastness of our Armed Forces and people  in a devastating total war for almost two months calls for  pride. This is the real recognition of our existence as an  independent state on the ground. The Arab and international  recognition will be made on this basis soon.    With regard to saying that we entered the war without good  calculations, we actually did not enter this war. It was  imposed on us, and they planned this war without our knowledge.  However, their calculations were wrong because they announced  that they would finish it in two or three days. But the war has  been raging for approximately 60 days, which means that their  calculations were wrong although they planned this war.    [Al-Qallab] Why did 'Ali Salim al-Bid move to Hadhramaut?  Does this mean that you believed that Aden would fall?    [Tahir] The presence of brother (President) 'Ali Salim  al-Bid in Hadhramaut was part of a plan to distribute the  political leadership members among the governorates and areas in  order to lead and guide the defensive and tactical actions on  various battlefronts, especially since the Sanaa regime aimed to  occupy all southern governorates, which now constitute the  Democratic Republic of Yemen.    In any case, brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid has accomplished his  mission and he is now in Aden. Meanwhile, other leadership  members are still distributed among the governorates, and some  others are on diplomatic and political missions abroad.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPER BOWL XXIV;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS 55 DENVER BRONCOS 10;  </P> <P> DISBELIEF, DEPRESSION GRIP DENVER  </P> <P> Parties and celebrations quickly turned somber Sunday as Denver fans watched  their Broncos lose, 55-10, to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV.  </P> <P> Dressed in orange and blue, fans turned out at local bars and restaurants to  watch the game. But their enthusiasm for the Broncos and predictions of a Super  Bowl victory turned to depression and disbelief by halftime, when the Broncos  trailed, 27-3.  </P> <P> Although there was the usual outbreak of "Broncomania" in Denver after the  Broncos won the AFC championship and a Super Bowl berth Jan. 14, the level of  excitement was lower and local support for the team was noticeably less visible  than for Denver's previous three Super Bowl appearances.  </P> <P> About 300 people gathered at Fat 'n Mike's, a bar owned by the Denver Nuggets'  Fat Lever and former Bronco and current Raider Mike Harden.  </P> <P> One waiter said before the mood turned dismal that things were a bit on the  wild side at the restaurant.  </P> <P> "It's crazy here. It's a nuthouse. But it's kind of fun, though," said the  waiter, who identified himself only as L. A.  </P> <P> Even at halftime, die-hard fans remained true to the orange and blue.  </P> <P> "We're just going to let them get complacent," said Pat Brown, who wore  miniature Bronco helmets for earrings. "We want them to get comfortable."  </P> <P> "They're saving it up for the second half," said Ann Meadows, who came to the  bar with 20 friends.  </P> <P> Fans at the Boiler Room in downtown Denver started leaving halfway through the  third quarter, when the Broncos trailed, 41-3. Although a Bronco comeback at  that point seemed impossible, the crowd cheered as quarterback John Elway ran  in for Denver's lone touchdown of the game.  </P> <P> The cheers were short-lived, however, as San Francisco retaliated quickly,  scoring 14 more points. When Gary Kubiak replaced Elway as quarterback in the  fourth quarter, the crowd cheered again.  </P> <P> Fans had grown sarcastic by the end of the third quarter with San Francisco  holding a 41-10 lead.  </P> <P> "I think Elway should be sent to another team," said Jim Hallack. "He chokes  under pressure and he's not as good as he thinks he is."  </P></p>

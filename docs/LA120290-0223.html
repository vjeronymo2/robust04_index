			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: IN UNLV RULING, NCAA RIGHTS A WRONG  </P> <P> One other multiple-choice list the NCAA had to ponder before doling out the  punishment that ended a 13-year Shark hunt:  </P> <P>  Potential Results From An Outright Ban Of Nevada Las Vegas From The 1991 NCAA  Basketball Tournament.  </P> <P>  a) One more joy-filled ride through this country's legal system, meaning a  14th year of glorious litigation, followed by a 15th, and maybe a 16th while  UNLV, in the interim, obtains a court order to keep its Rebels  postseason-ready.  </P> <P>  b) A 30-0 UNLV team with nowhere to go, an NCAA tournament played to determine  who's No. 2 and a 1991 championship trophy sent back to the shop for asterisk  enhancement.  </P> <P>  c) The Poulan/Weedeater/USF&amp;G/Bally's War de Trump, a renegade "real  national championship" game between outlaw UNLV and the NCAA winner, with Don  King promoting, Ted Turner broadcasting and the Mirage Hotel hosting. In the  parking lot.  </P> <P> For the NCAA, it was name your nightmare. One way or another, whichever way the  NCAA turned, there was going to be a mess.  </P> <P> Of course, the NCAA was the original polluter, dumping the toxic waste four  months ago with its ludicrous ruling to penalize UNLV now for alleged crimes  committed when Larry Johnson and Stacey Augmon were in the third grade. So Tark  got to them, then, too? Ply them with a a couple of Schwinns? A few trips to  Tastee-Freeze?  </P> <P> The NCAA couldn't get Jerry Tarkanian in 1977, couldn't get him through the  entire Carter and Reagan administrations, but when it saw a crack in the  judicial door this summer, it went for the hammer, turning a blind eye to the  ethical and procedural obstacles that should have shut it down within seconds.  </P> <P> Ethical: The UNLV players of 1990-91 should not have to pay for the sins of  '77. Neither should the UNLV players of 1991-92, but that's the deal UNLV cut  and that's the deal it now must live with.  </P> <P> Thirteen years is a long time -- long enough for entire athletic and academic  administrative staffs at UNLV to turn over. From 1977 to 1990, the only salient  constant was the coach and if the NCAA still felt the need to tag someone, it  should have been The Bald One and no one else.  </P> <P> Procedural: Thirteen years is also long enough to render pages of NCAA  regulations obsolete. This is why Tarkanian remains outside NCAA cross hairs,  at least on this set of charges.  </P> <P> Before 1985, the NCAA could not directly sanction a head coach for rules  violations; only the school could sanction the coach. UNLV made such an attempt  in 1977, but Tarkanian sought, and won, an injunction from the District Court  in Las Vegas prohibiting the university from taking action against him.  </P> <P> The injunction still stands and so does Tarkanian, immune from any suspension  and/or fine because 1977 guidelines continue to govern this case.  </P> <P> Tark's in-court team is even better than his on-court team.  </P> <P> With the coach untouchable, the NCAA went after the players. Mistake No. 1. The  intent of the NCAA infractions committee, supposedly, is to make the punishment  fit the crime, but this time, the NCAA didn't come close. The NCAA was benching  its defending champion, but more than that, it was benching one of the best  college basketball teams ever assembled.  </P> <P> As underclassmen in 1989-90, Johnson, Augmon, Greg Anthony and Anderson Hunt  went 35-5 and made a mockery of the 1990 NCAA final. In 1990-91, they were  going to be better. Johnson and Augmon were back as All-American bookends at  forward. Anthony and Hunt were back to energize the backcourt. The only vacancy  was at center -- and there, Tark had redshirt George Ackles coming back and  seven-foot JC transfer Elmore Spencer coming in.  </P> <P> Think hard about this UNLV team and it's hard not to think about UCLA. Fact:  UCLA is the last team to win back-to-back national basketball championships.  Not so idle thought: UNLV is the first team to have a better-than-legitimate  shot to match that feat. The best team since the Walton Bruins? It isn't out of  the question.  </P> <P> Paying players, slipping players free airline tickets, pressuring players into  lying to NCAA investigators -- none of this is good for college basketball. But  barring UNLV from the next championship tournament -- you can place that under  the same heading.  </P> <P> Unless it is proved that this group was illegally assembled or compensated, it  deserves its chance at history. On this much, the NCAA and UNLV finally agreed  last week.  </P> <P> The NCAA didn't cave in.  </P> <P> The NCAA didn't back down.  </P> <P> The NCAA didn't turn yellow.  </P> <P> What the NCAA did do was right a wrong before it became too late and find a  solution that wasn't perfect but might have been the best available. Given the  conditions -- "unprecedented" in the understated words of the infractions  committee chairman -- it was the correct call.  </P> <P> You can accuse Tark of pulling another fast one, if any maneuver requiring 13  years can be considered fast. You can accuse Tark of selling out UNLV's future  -- a future that might or might not include Tark -- for the golden moment at  hand.  </P> <P> If you do, you'll probably be interested in the Lloyd Daniels charges, due to  hit UNLV within the month. Post-1985 regulations apply to this one.  </P></p>

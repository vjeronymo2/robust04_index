			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Exxon to issue credit card with GE Capital Exxon yesterday became the second US energy group to launch a co-branded credit card, following Shell Oil a year ago. The move also represents the biggest step by GE Capital, the financial services group which is issuing the card, into the co-branded credit card sector, the fastest-growing part of the card market. Until now, the financial services group has specialised in issuing private-label cards for retailers. Its only co-branded card has been for General Electric, its parent. Service stations represent a big potential market for general purpose credit cards. At present, there are about 117m private-label cards issued by oil companies, which can be used only in their own outlets and which account for annual payments of Dollars 27bn. Exxon sold its own private-label card business to GE Capital last December. Yesterday, the financial services company said it did not believe the new co-branded card, which carries the MasterCard logo, would compete directly with that business. Cardholders, who will not pay an annual fee, will receive a rebate of 3 per cent on purchases made in Exxon's 9,400 stations, and 1 per cent on other purchases.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Fewer Finns back EC entry SUPPORT among Finns for their country's application to join the European Community has fallen in recent months, according to an opinion survey which was published yesterday, Reuter reports from Helsinki. The results, published a day after Finland opened negotiations to become an EC member, showed 43 per cent of Finns in favour of membership in November, down from 54 per cent in June. Those opposed to membership increased to 37 per cent from 25 per cent in June. The Community launched official accession talks with Austria, Finland and Sweden on Monday in Brussels. The Finnish centre-right government hopes the country can become a member in 1995 after a referendum, probably in 1994. Europeans debated yesterday whether the first live TV broadcast from a European Community ministers' meeting marked the beginning of a new EC openness, but most agreed it was a rather dull affair, Reuter reports from Copenhagen. Television in many countries carried parts of the meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday. Danish television said 2 per cent of Danes, about 100,000 viewers, watched a two-hour live transmission before noon as well as a one-hour session in the afternoon. In Sweden, where anti-EC sentiment is rising, national television had live coverage of Mr Ulf Dinkenspiel, the European affairs minister, listing his country's expectations in Brussels at the start of EC entry talks.</p>

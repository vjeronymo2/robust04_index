			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Reed Elsevier to Pounds 314m Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group, yesterday announced a 12 per cent increase in its first-half following improved performances by its business and consumer publications. Profits rose from Pounds 281m to Pounds 314m on sales up 9 per cent at Pounds 1.5bn (Pounds 1.39bn) in the six months to June 30. The results were enhanced by a Pounds 15m contribution from new subsidiaries, dominated by Official Airline Guides - acquired last year for Pounds 277m - and Editions Techniques, the French legal publisher, which cost Pounds 77m. 'The acquisitions are doing well and make our full-year prospects very comfortable,' said Mr Ian Irvine, co-chairman. Profits would have been higher still, he added, had it not been for lower pension credits and losses on property disposals. Operating profits rose by 15 per cent from Pounds 295m to Pounds 340m as the existing publishing businesses benefited from organic growth and cost reductions. Cost savings and restructuring helped lift operating margins by 1.3 points to 22.6 per cent. Mr Irvine warned, however, that flat trading conditions in some sectors meant the group was unlikely to benefit from price rises in the near future. Scientific and medical publishing was hardest hit and Mr Irvine said 'the market remained in deep trouble'. Nevertheless, a reorganisation helped the area lift operating profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 83m on flat sales of Pounds 254m (Pounds 248m). Restructuring also helped the professional publications business, where contributions from Editions Techniques pushed profits up to Pounds 65m (Pounds 59m) on turnover ahead 14 per cent to Pounds 247m. The sharpest increase was reported by the business division. Buoyant exhibitions activity and gains by Official Airline Guides lifted profits by 34 per cent to Pounds 135m on sales of Pounds 579m (Pounds 515m). A recovery, meanwhile, in UK advertising and positive Dutch circulation figures led to increased profits of Pounds 57m (Pounds 48m) in consumer publications, on a 5 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 426m. 'To increase profits and, more importantly, margins in these difficult markets is an excellent achievement,' said Ms Christine Munro, media analyst at Hoare Govett. Earnings per share at Reed International, the UK publisher with a 52.9 per cent interest in the Anglo-Dutch group, rose to 23.6p (21p) under FRS 3. It declared an interim dividend of 6.7p (7.5p). Elsevier reported earnings per share of Fl 5.11 (Fl 4.41), with a dividend up from Fl 1.67 to Fl 1.76. See Lex</p>

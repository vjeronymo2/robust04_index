			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (9): Key to the future - Trade TRADE is vital to Iran's reconstruction. The eight-year war with Iraq eroded the country's productive capacities and, since the end of the war, the government has increased imports of raw materials for factories as well as consumption goods. Imports rose steadily from a low of Dollars 9.5bn in 1988 to more than Dollars 26bn in 1991-92. The composition of Iran's main trading partners shifted as a result of the revolution but not as much as the rhetoric from Tehran, with its emphasis on relations with Third World countries, might suggest. Before the revolution, 85 per cent of Iran's trade was with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. That proportion is now down to a still sizeable 75 per cent. Germany and Japan head the list. Trade with other countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, has become more important to Iran. Dubai's free port and its proximity to Iran have made it a busy re-export point for goods destined for Iran. Imports from the UAE, particularly of luxuries and consumer goods, have increased substantially since the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. They grew from Dollars 276m to Dollars 949m in the space of a year and now account for more than Dollars 1bn in Iranian imports. The increase in trade has been helped by a relaxation of Iran's import and export rules and higher foreign exchange earnings as a result of increased oil prices particularly since the 1991 US-led war against Iraq. The bulk of exports and imports are still controlled by the government, through its approval of price and supplier. Public sector imports still account for the majority of imports which are usually carried out by international tender under the control of government agencies. Imports by the private sector are still restricted although machinery, raw materials and spare parts among others, can be imported with government-allocated foreign exchange. At the end of last year, the government lifted the requirement for a government allocation of foreign currency for a variety of goods, including electrical and electronic equipment, construction materials, metals tools and food and textiles. Payment can be made from an overseas bank account or with currency bought at the free market rate. In an attempt to encourage non-oil exports, the government has limited restrictions on the foreign exchange generated by the private sector through exports of handicrafts, agricultural and some manufactured goods. The Procurement and Distribution Centres, which used to control some of the most important industries, have been dissolved in an attempt to allow market forces to take over. In addition, Iran has been keen to encourage foreign investment through the establishment of free trade zones in the Persian Gulf. The largest, on Qeshm island, near the Straits of Hormuz, is intended to attract energy-intensive industries because of the access to Qeshm's natural gas reserves. The government says that there has been Dollars 10bn of foreign investment commitments but pledges have been greater than actual disbursements. The policy of countertrade has been largely abandoned, partly because of stiff opposition by the National Iranian Oil Company, although the government still seeks buy-back deals. Until last year, the difficulties of trading with Iran were outweighed by the attractions of its immaculate payments record. However, for the first time since the revolution, there have been prolonged delays on payment of Iranian letters of credit and Iran's main trading partners are watching the situation with growing unease. Their export credit agencies have been holding a series of formal and informal meetings with each other in an attempt to judge the severity of the problem. The two main factors behind the delays are thought to be the relaxation of Bank Markazi controls on the domestic commercial banks which resulted in unsupervised issues of letters of credit at the free market exchange rate. Bank Markazi has argued that the problems are only to be expected until the new system can operate smoothly. For Iran's creditors, however, there is the greater anxiety that Tehran has overreached itself. The government, which kept a tight rein on consumption with great success during the war against Iraq, has been overspending. Oil revenues in the first three quarters of 1992 are optimistically estimated at Dollars 16.7bn with non-oil exports making up another Dollars 1.9bn. The total foreign exchange income for the year may not exceed Dollars 20bn, while imports are expected to exceed Dollars 21bn. This represents a cutback from the Dollars 26bn imported the year before when foreign exchange income was only Dollars 20bn. Unfortunately, oil prices have been dropping due to Opec oversupply, making it unlikely that Iran will find it easy to generate enough income to cover its payments debts quickly. President Rafsanjani, who presented the budget for 1993-94 in December, set total foreign exchange income for the year at Dollars 23.4bn but the Majlis, which has to approve the budget, has reduced this to a more realistic Dollars 19.8bn, of which Dollars 17bn is expected to be in oil exports. It is estimated Iran will take one year to catch up with its short-term debt. Hopes are that the government will either agree to refinance its debt, a move which would be politically difficult, or will curb its imports. Iran's main trading partners have reported a slowdown in the growth of exports during 1992 compared with 1991 but only France recorded a real fall. During the first three quarters of 1992, Germany, which is most exposed to the payment delays, reported exports of more than Dollars 4bn, compared with a total exports of Dollars 4bn for the whole of 1991. Japanese and Italian exports slowed to a 20 per cent increase compared with the year before. Japan exported just over Dollars 2bn in January-September while Italy reported exports of Dollars 1.4bn in the first six months of last year. UK exports also increased by 20 per cent to Dollars 840m during the first three quarters of the year. French exports, however, dropped by nearly 30 per cent during the same period to just under Dollars 600m, partly because of increased tension in relations between the two countries. Few banks are now willing to take Iranian risk and billions of dollars' worth of project finance is now in limbo until the delays are sorted out. Iran's previously good payments record may yet reassure its trading partners and there have, as yet, been no claims on the export credit agencies. However, Iran's ability to manage its mounting debt will be watched carefully.</p>

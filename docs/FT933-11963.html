			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: News Corporation Doubtless there is a great untapped market for satellite television in Asia. Whether it will be profitable for the companies that enter it remains to be seen. The market requires expensive libraries of programmes in many languages. The geography and unsophisticated financial infrastructure of parts of the region will make it difficult to operate encrypted subscription services. That makes the venture more heavily dependent on uncertain advertising revenues. The attitude of the Chinese government will also be critical. Given that satellite television is very difficult to control, the Chinese authorities may be slow to sanction the widespread ownership of dishes. News Corporation's acquisition of a stake in Star TV is thus something of a calculated gamble. But at least Mr Rupert Murdoch has stacked the odds in his favour. News Corp's library of English language programmes from Fox and BSkyB will expand Star's attraction to the English-speaking Asian audience which stretches from the Gulf to Japan. That group is mostly concentrated in areas where subscription services may be feasible. Cable services into Hong Kong provide a ready market, and Star already owns a large library of Chinese language films. News Corp has also reduced the risks by using equity to fund the purchase - albeit at the expense of diluting earnings. Perhaps the most important facet of the deal, however, is that Mr Murdoch has effectively shut other companies out of Star. That both guarantees a market for Fox's output and gives the company a head start in Asia. If there is a profitable niche, News Corp is now best placed to step into it.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: The FT and the British election - wrong, wrong but for the right reasons, and right Sir, In addition to the comments in other newspapers about your unexpected pre-election editorial, you have no doubt received lots of expressions of surprise and dismay from your business readers. Certainly most will have been shocked that the newspaper which is so cherished by industry, commerce and the City should have actually suggested that a Labour victory was preferable. In my view you are to be warmly congratulated, but not because I think your advice was right. Indeed in my view it was quite misconceived. It is of course desirable that we should not end up with one party permanently in government and the others permanently in opposition, but I believe that the Labour party has a good deal more learning and forgetting to do before it can be entrusted with government. It may well be that this will now happen and your advice, if it were then the same, could more safely be followed next time. However, the point is that you demonstrated once again that splendid independence which has always characterised the editorial columns of your newspaper. As you know, I was privileged to be a director both of the Financial Times and your parent company for eight years. I sat on the board with such great men as Lord Drogheda, Lord Gibson and your famous predecessors, Sir Gordon Newton and Fredy Fisher. While we would occasionally gossip at board lunches about matters of political and commercial interest, there was never any attempt to influence editorial policy. I am sure that this would also have been the case on this occasion. I repeat, therefore, that while I disagreed strongly with your editorial advice I support totally your right to proffer it.

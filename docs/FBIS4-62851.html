			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The State Duma delegation holding talks in the  Chinese capital represented virtually the entire political  spectrum of the Russian parliament. As we know, deputies have  very differing views on reform in this country. They evaluate  in different ways the possibility of applying Chinese experience  in Russian conditions and of reaching a solution to border  problems. Nevertheless, at meetings with the Chinese leaders,  the deputies appeared to display a united front, confirming that  China continues to be one of the priorities in Russian foreign  policy.    Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Ivan Rybkin, head of the  Russian delegation, also agreed that economic changes must be  based on concrete conditions in each state. But stability in  society is an indispensable prerequisite for any reform. At the  meetings both sides recalled the longstanding friendship between  the peoples of Russia and China and the lengthy frontier which  they share. But this is no longer enough for the effective  development of bilateral cooperation. As Ivan Rybkin put it,  the Chinese leaders took note of specific proposals to change  the situation. These will be discussed in detail at the  upcoming meeting of the Russo-Chinese commission on trade and  economic cooperation and during the visit to China by Russian  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>

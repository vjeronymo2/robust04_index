			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / EC inches closer to recognition of Macedonia THE prospect of European Community recognition of Macedonia inched nearer yesterday, as the latter held its first direct talks with Greece to resolve their months-long impasse over nomenclature. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal which holds the EC presidency, reported that 'positive aspects' had emerged from separate talks he held on Sunday with prime minister Constantine Mitzotakis of Greece, and Macedonia's foreign minister, Dr Denko Maleski. The Portuguese presidency has floated a four-point plan to ease Greek fears that recognising Macedonia under that name would stir separatism in northern Greece. This involves EC guarantees of the two countries' border, an exchange of notes between Athens and Skopje disclaiming the existence of a Slav minority in Greece, EC aid for Macedonia, and a commitment by Macedonia to clarify that its constitution implies no territorial claim on Greece. After Dr Maleski met Mr Mitzotakis' deputy foreign minister yesterday, Portuguese officials said Greece and Macedonia were happy with the four points, but still stuck over the latter's name. Belgium suggested that for a time Macedonia use one name at home and another abroad. President Kiro Gligorov sent a letter to yesterday's meeting of EC foreign ministers complaining of the Community's failure to grant his state recognition nearly six months after it said it met the test of independent statehood. He asked if there had to be war in Macedonia as in other former Yugoslav republics for it to be recognised. Seeking to avoid the eruption of another flashpoint in Kosovo, the Serbian province with a large Albanian population, EC ministers cautioned all parties to exercise restraint. This is both a warning to Serb leaders not to repress the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo, and to neighbouring Albania not to intervene and so bring an international dimension to the the Yugoslav civil war.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Portugal (5): Spectacular growth - Expansion in the banking sector PORTUGUESE banks enjoyed explosive growth during 1991. Networks expanded spectacularly; institutions diversified, and considerably increased the range of products and services they offer; and the traditional division of labour, between commercial and investment banks, was eroded as players battled for market share. Expansion was fuelled by a 23 per cent increase in corporate and personal credit, in spite of high interest rates. Prime corporate customers now pay about 19 per cent for funds, while the rate for consumer credit can be above 26 per cent. Economic growth slackened, but at 2.7 per cent remained sufficiently sturdy to encourage demand; and with real wages rising by almost 5 per cent, private consumption was buoyant. All this provided a propitious setting for financial institutions rushing to complete their expansion plans before January 1993, when they will face open competition within the European Community's single market in financial services. The most dramatic growth was at Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP), one of Portugal's leading commercial banks, which last year opened 111 branches, bringing its total network to 242 branches. Jorge Jardim Goncalves, BCP president, says 1991 was 'the year of greatest effort since the foundation of the bank' six years ago. BCP took on an extra 1,000 employees (it now has more than 3,000), all of whom required specialised training; expanded the activities of the group in fund management, leasing, brokerage and insurance; and spent another Es5bn (Dollars 36m) on computer systems. Mr Jardim Goncalves says this was achieved without affecting the bank's performance. Total assets grew by over 50 per cent to Es1,206bn, and net profits by 33 per cent to Es18.2bn. Credit extended to clients was up 75 per cent to Es516bn, and customer deposits grew 59 per cent to Es932bn. Taking a different route, Banco Portugues de Investimento (BPI), the leading private investment bank, pursued its own expansion plans by buying Banco Fonsecas &amp; Burnay (BFB), a medium-size commercial bank that was privatised last summer. The purchase of BFB and its 115 branches gives BPI, with headquarters in Oporto and an office in Lisbon, immediate access to a wide section of the market. Artur Santos Silva, BPI president, says the assimilation of the bank into the group is proceeding smoothly, and that this year's targets for strengthening BFB's provisions to cover bad debts and replenish its under-funded pension fund have already been passed. 'We are very pleased with what we've achieved so far. A new strategy for BFB has been prepared, and we will open another 25 branches,' he says, adding that BFB will be a retail, not a universal, bank, and that it will target middle segments of the private market and small and medium-sized companies. The effect of the purchase on the BPI group's consolidated balance sheet, is noticeable already. Total assets rose from Es171bn in 1990 to Es975bn at end 1991, though, even without BFB, group assets doubled to Es305bn. Net profits rose from Es8.6bn in 1990 to Es9.3bn, though the 1990 figure was inflated by extraordinary income from the sale of an 11 per cent stake in another bank. In direct competition with BPI, the Banco de Comercio e Industria (BCI), a private bank with a leading position in corporate trade financing, expanded organically into the retail sector by more than trebling the number of its branches from 25 to 84 with a total investment of Es21bn. The bank's physical expansion was supported by a punchy advertising campaign, pointedly aimed at customers of the more conservative state-owned banks. Francisco Veloso, BCI president, says results exceeded the bank's expectations. The number of non-corporate clients almost quadrupled, and in the last six months the value of private deposits more than doubled. 'It was very difficult. We had to change everything to meet our targets, but we managed to do it without a (negative) effect on our results.' BCI officials say total deposits (private and corporate) rose from Es63bn in 1990 to Es166bn last year. Credit extended to clients was up 73 per cent from Es94.2bn to Es163bn, and total assets rose 109 per cent from Es147bn to Es308bn. BCP, BPI and BCI provided the most striking examples of a general trend that is likely to continue this year. Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA), Portugal's second largest bank, which was 33 per cent privatised over a year ago and is awaiting a second phase of privatisation, wants to increase the number of its branches from 200 to 260 by the end of 1992. And Banco Totta &amp; Acores (BTA), a leading private bank in which Banesto of Spain has an important stake, plans to open 10 branches by June, to bring its network to 213 branches. Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa (BESCL), which was fully privatised last month, raised the number of its branches from 168 to 210 last year, and is expected to open another 40 branches this year. Final results for 1991 are likely to show an increase in assets of over 20 per cent, from Es1,197bn to Es1449bn, and net profits up from Es12.5bn to Es15bn. Now that control of BESCL has returned to the Espirito Santo group, representing the interests of the Espirito Santo family who owned the bank before its nationalisation in 1975, its future will depend on the group's broader strategy. 'BESCL will be the centre of the whole group, but it will remain fundamentally a retail bank. Other group institutions will specialise in investment banking, leasing, insurance and other activities in Portugal and internationally,' says Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado, group chairman. Foreign banks in Portugal also have expanded. Barclays has grown from five branches in 1990 to 28 at the end of 1991, and plans to have up to 60 branches by the end of this year. Banco Bilbao Viscaya (BBV), the Spanish banking group which bought Lloyds Bank Portugal with its 12 branches in 1990, plans to open another 60 branches this year. Other spanish banks are gradually building up their Portuguese branch networks. Newcomers add to the pressure. The Banco Nacional de Credito Imobiliario (BNC), a housing mortgage bank established last autumn, plans to open 17 branches this year. Finantia, a merchant bank in all but name, is awaiting official authorisation to transform itself into a fully fledged bank, as are several other financial services and investment companies. Eduardo Costa, managing director, says Finantia will not compete with the retail banks in the broad market for deposits, but as an investment bank it could effectively draw on corporate clients to increase its funding base. Finding a cheaper source of funding is one of the main reasons for the investment banks' move into the retail sector. For most banks, broadening their activities is seen also as the only way to secure their future and maintain market shares in the face of increasing competition and declining interest rates and margins. Alexandre Vaz Pinto, chairman of the Portuguese Bankers Association, says conditions will be more difficult this year. 'Margins will fall by about 1 percentage point, but it could be more, especially for banks with a small deposit base which rely on the money markets for funding. The cost of funding on the money markets could rise.' With average margins of about 5 per cent for the big banks, a one-point fall is tolerable, though some bankers believe margins could fall twice that much, and this has to be set against rising operating and expansion costs. 'The time of cheap funding is over,' says Mr Veloso. 'Controlling costs and risks and improving productivity will be the crucial factors.'</p>

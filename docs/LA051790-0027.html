			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPROVING POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS  </P> <P> If both parties want to reform campaign financing and coverage (front page, May  7), the solution is simple. Since almost every dollar is spent on advertising,  prohibit political advertising.  </P> <P> It's not needed and, if the goal is to turn out the voters, it's a miserable  failure. The higher the spending, the lower the voter turnout.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has never advertised in the U.S. but his name, face and ideas are  universally known.  </P> <P> That may be the secret -- ideas. If candidates stop selling themselves like  soap and breakfast cereal, they would have to command attention with substance  instead of production values.  </P> <P> If their ideas are compelling and plentiful enough, their day-to-day coverage  would increase in ratio as would their TV guest appearances, debate  invitations, and commentary page articles. Their personal exposure to the  voters would come with innovative barnstorming enhanced -- if their ideas are  newsworthy enough -- by regional exposure on television and newspapers.  </P> <P> Campaigns could be run at a fraction of today's costs. All it takes is a ban on  political advertising and insistence by the media for legitimate news instead  of "photo ops." Who knows, voters might start voting again.  </P> <P> One problem: How do you get the media to back an advertising ban?  </P> <P> PHIL WILLON  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Peninsula  </P></p>

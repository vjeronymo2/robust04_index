			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand in Sarajevo: Day when rivers run with blood HISTORY yesterday rose from the mortar and artillery smoke of the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo as French President Francois Mitterrand's armoured helicopter landed at the city's airport, writes Judy Dempsey. But it will take more than Mr Mitterrand to destroy the myths which surround June 28, St Vitus's Day. Every year on that day, according to legend, the rivers of the Balkans will run blood red at midnight. Indeed, it was on June 28 1914 that Gavrilo Princip, a 20-year-old Serb revolutionary student, shot dead Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo. That event sparked the first world war, after Austria declared war on Serbia. On that day in 1921 the Constitution of Yugoslavia - the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes - was proclaimed, amid suspicions among the latter two that Serbia would dominate the new state. On June 28 again, 27 years later, the late Josip Broz Tito stunned the world by breaking with Stalin, a move which earned him friends in the west and which saw the beginnings of the establishment of the neutral and non-aligned states. But the significance of St Vitus, a 14th-century Sicilian martyr, goes back many centuries. On St Vitus' Day in 1389, Ottoman troops defeated the Serbs on the fields of Kosovo Polje, the cradle of the Serbian kingdom. Six hundred years later to the day, Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic sought to redress this ignominious defeat by addressing a crowd of over 250,000 people at Kosovo Polje. Amid sweltering heat, and an atmosphere of nationalist fervour, he vowed to create a Greater Serbia in which all Serbs would live. In 1991, on June 28, a humiliated Yugoslav army, backed by Mr Milosevic, declared a ceasefire in the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia, after they had failed to quash Slovenia's quest for independence. That same day, the army started turning its attention to Croatia, leaving over 6,000 dead in a war which soon spread to Bosnia-Hercegovina.</p>

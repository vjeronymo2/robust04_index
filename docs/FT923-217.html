			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Safeway tumbles 44.6% to Dollars 20m TOUGH competition in the US food retail industry and the pressures of a lacklustre economy were underscored in the underlying third-quarter earnings of Safeway, the California-based supermarket group, which tumbled 44.6 per cent to Dollars 20m, or 17 cents a share. Net income for the same period of 1991 was distorted by extraordinary items, which brought net income to Dollars 40.3m, or 33 cents a share. Stripping-out one-time items, Safeway earned Dollars 36.1m in the quarter. The company had warned investors to expect earnings to drop about 50 per cent in the latest three months. On Wall Street, the shares closed down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 9 7/8 , equal to their 52-week low. Sales for the 1992 third quarter fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 3.5bn, while same-store sales eased 3.5 per cent. The company, which was subject to a Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, reduced its interest expense in the latest quarter to Dollars 63.7m from Dollars 82.2m a year earlier. For the first nine months, Safeway earned Dollars 48.4m, or 41 cents a share, against Dollars 102.6m, or 91 cents a year earlier. Revenues stood at Dollars 10.3bn, compared with Dollars 10.46bn last year. Times Mirror, the US media group, expects third-quarter operating results in its Newspaper Publishing Group to be considerably lower than those of a year ago, Reuter reports from Los Angeles. The company gave no figures, but said improving advertising volume at its eastern newspapers and lower newsprint costs were not sufficient to offset the sharp declines in advertising revenue at the Los Angeles Times. The company said newspaper advertising revenues for the four weeks ended August 30 decreased 5.6 per cent, to Dollars 105.7m from Dollars 111.9m in August 1991.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR COLORADO THIS TIME;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BIENIEMY SCORES WITH 12 SECONDS TO PLAY AS BUFFALOES RALLY  FOR A 21-17 VICTORY OVER STANFORD.  </P> <P> After one unsatisfying tie, Colorado wasn't about to settle for another.  </P> <P> The sixth-ranked Buffaloes went for -- and got -- a clinching touchdown instead  of a tying field goal in the closing seconds Thursday night against Stanford.  </P> <P> Tailback Eric Bieniemy dived 1 yard for the winning score with 12 seconds  remaining as Colorado eked out a 21-17 victory over upset-minded Stanford.  </P> <P> "No question, we were going to go for it," said Colorado Coach Bill McCartney,  whose team endured a 31-31 tie with Tennessee 11 days earlier in Anaheim. "If  it were fourth-and-eight, we still would have gone for it."  </P> <P> Bieniemy's score -- his third of the game -- came on fourth down and capped an  80-yard, 15-play drive after Stanford's John Hopkins had given his team a 17-14  lead on a 27-yard field goal with 4:17 to play.  </P> <P> The Cardinal shocked Colorado early, using a long punt return and a turnover to  forge a 14-0 lead in the first quarter. But Bieniemy, who rushed for 149 yards  after being suspended for the opener, produced a 14-14 tie with third-quarter  scoring runs of 18 and 36 yards.  </P> <P> Facing fourth-and-one from the two on its final drive, Colorado passed up a  field goal and quarterback Darian Hagan sneaked for the first down to the one.  But two subsequent plunges by George Hemingway produced nothing, and a  third-down pass fell incomplete. On fourth down, Bieniemy, who finished with  149 yards rushing, went airborne off the left side for his third touchdown.  </P> <P> Stanford Coach Dennis Green said he wasn't convinced Bieniemy scored on the  fourth-down leap.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, if we were at home, they don't get that call," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FYI: MODEST STATEMENTS FOR THE WANNABES  </P> <P> For Madonna wannabes too modest to wear their underwear topside, Los Angeles  designer and professional singer Zoe Fox has made a line of hand-painted  shirts, leggings and bicycle shorts with sexy undergarments drawn on the  outside. They are just the ticket for people who want to celebrate Lingerie  Week (April 22-29) in public.  </P> <P> A lacy, black merry widow (pictured here) with rosettes and rhinestones adorns  a man's vintage dress shirt, $160. A V-neck white T-shirt is painted with a  gilded rose bra, $120. Leggings to match the shirts in black or white sport  trompe-l'oeil garters, tattoos and lacy polka dot panties -- the bicycle-length  are $80; ankle-length, $120.  </P> <P> The collection, called Cupid City, is available at Tilly &amp; Mac in Venice  and by special order at Soho On Montana in Santa Monica. JOANNA DENDEL  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule implements the provisions in the Act in two ways. Appendix I has been revised by adding paragraph F to section VI to preclude any person from performing the safety-sensitive function that the individual was performing if that person had two verified positive drug test results or if the individual used a prohibited drug while performing such a safety-sensitive function. A definition of ``performing'' paralleling the one in the alcohol misuse prevention program rule has been added. In order to effectively administer this provision, the final rule provides that this prohibition is effective for drug tests and on-duty drug use occurring after the effective date of the final rule. (The NPRM proposed to amend the regulatory sections to implement this prohibition. However, for clarity and consistency with the alcohol misuse prevention program we are adding this provision to appendix I.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bar is limited to the narrow prohibition in the Act and will not affect the performance of other duties. While the FAA recognizes that a narrow bar could lead to anomalous results (for example, a person might be barred from performing screening duties but could serve as a pilot), a bar that is limited to the statutory requirements is more likely to be consistent with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act or other legal constraints. The FAA expects that employers will exercise responsible judgment in determining whether employees not expressly barred from service should be permitted to perform other safety-sensitive duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bar on two-time violators will apply both to persons who have gone through rehabilitation and to those who, after evaluation, were determined not to need treatment. Otherwise, an employee who was found to need treatment and had an instance of recidivism would be subject to the bar, but an employee who did not need assistance but simply chose to use drugs again would not be. This provision is established under the FAA's general statutory authority to prescribe regulations affecting aviation safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters representing labor organizations objected to the permanent bar in principle, but recognized the FAA's statutory requirement to impose such a bar. Commenters representing employers objected to the FAA's implementation of the permanent bar in which the burden of ensuring that permanently barred individuals do not perform the relevant safety-sensitive duties is placed on employers. These commenters assert that the FAA should maintain a name-specific ``black list'' that employers could check to determine an applicant's status. The FAA has not adopted this recommendation and believes that it would be inappropriate to do so. Aside from the obvious privacy and logistical issues associated with the creation of such a data base, it would not serve the purpose asserted by the commenters, which appears to be to relieve the employers of the necessity of obtaining information regarding applicants' drug testing history. However, the permanent bar is not the only measure precluding service in a safety-sensitive function. In addition, if an individual has a verified positive drug test result or has refused to submit to a drug test, the employer cannot use the individual to perform any safety-sensitive function unless and until the appropriate MRO or SAP evaluation and return to duty requirements have been met. (A similar prohibition applies under the alcohol misuse prevention program, 14 CFR part 121, appendix J). Information regarding such unresolved violations can be obtained only from the employee's records. In summary, the FAA does not view the need to ensure that an applicant is not subject to the permanent bar as materially different from the other requirements in this employer-based, employer-implemented program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has addressed one concern raised by commenters regarding the availability of records from previous employers. The confidentiality provisions have been revised to clarify that employers are required to release employee antidrug program records upon written consent of the employee. This revision precludes prior employers from refusing to release records and thereby frustrating the intent of this regulation. With respect to record retention, the FAA notes that the retention periods provided in this rule are minimums and employers may choose to retain any records for a longer period of time. Employers should consider longer retention of information regarding verified positive drug test results, refusals to submit to testing, evaluation, and rehabilitation, if for no other reason than to ensure that an individual previously terminated for violating the rule is not rehired for and impermissibly returned to the performance of safety-sensitive functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters also expressed concern that employees be provided with adequate notice of the implications of having a verified positive drug test result or using drugs while performing a safety-sensitive function. The FAA agrees that employees should be advised of the consequences of such actions, and of the consequences of refusing to submit to a required test (which, although it does not implicate the permanent bar, does necessitate removal from safety-sensitive functions and possible reporting to the FAA). The FAA has therefore revised the employee assistance program provisions of appendix I to include a requirement that the employer policy provide information on the consequences under the antidrug rule of illegal use of drugs, verified positive drug test results, and refusals to submit to testing. It should be noted that an employer may advise employees of any consequences imposed under the employer's independent authority (e.g., termination); however, the employer could not purport or imply that the FAA's antidrug rule required such actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The permanent bar following a refusal to undertake or failure to complete rehabilitation is further implemented by retaining the current requirement that prior to returning to duty performing safety-sensitive functions following a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated drug test or refusal to submit to such a drug test, the employee must be evaluated by the MRO on the specific issue of compliance with any previously-established treatment program. This rule retains the provisions regarding MRO recommendations for return to duty, with the modification that, based on the requirements of the Act, the MRO cannot recommend return to duty if an individual has failed to comply with a specified rehabilitation program. The FAA has chosen, however, not to impose a definite time period during which the employee must agree to undertake or complete the prescribed rehabilitation. This allows for the denial phase that most people go through when first confronted with evidence of a drug problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

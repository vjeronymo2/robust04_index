			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed station "special dispatch"; from the "Morning </F> News" program]    [Text] Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing said on 26 April  that the Chinese Government will draw a lesson from the recent  Qiandao Hu incident, and will intensify crackdown on crime and  strengthen the management of social order.    Li Lanqing made the above remark when meeting and discussing  tourism industry with An Tong-son, chairman of the Committees on  Commerce, Industry, and Resources of the Republic of Korea  National Assembly.    He said: The Qiandao Hu case was a chance occurrence. This  criminal case has been solved.    He expressed regrets and pains over the occurrence of the  incident. However, he believed that some people in Taiwan are  exploiting it to stir up a hue and cry and to pursue ulterior  motives.    He said the incident will have little effect on China's  tourism industry, adding that overall the safety rate of  sightseeing in China is relatively high as compared with other  countries in the world.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Floor leaders at the  National Assembly could not agree Tuesday on convening an  extraordinary session to discuss holding a public hearing on the  Uruguay Round trade accord and other pending issues.    The leaders of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] and  the main opposition Democratic Party [DP], however, did decide  to meet again Wednesday.    In addition to the Uruguay Round, the Democratic Party wants  to talk about invoking parliamentary rights to investigate the  "three major suspicious affairs."    These affairs include an opposition allegation that a large  slush fund created by a construction company for a buddhist  temple may have flowed into the political sector, to be used by  the ruling party during the 1992 presidential campaign.    The DP also wants to investigate the ongoing power struggle  at the nation's largest buddhist sect, the Chogye order, and  suspicions over political surveillance of the residence of  former DP leader Kim Tae-chung.    As for the Uruguay Round, the Democratic Party has joined  with student activists and farmers at "outdoor" rallies and  demonstrations protesting the government's weak-kneed  negotiating tactics at the round, which led to the opening of  Korea's market to rice and other foreign farm products.    The opposition party has vowed to block ratification of the  Uruguay Round accord unless the government renegotiates it.    But sensing a lukewarm public response and drawing sharp  criticism from the ruling party, the DP appeared to agree Friday  to bring the Uruguay Round issue "indoors" and discuss it at the  National Assembly.    After Tuesday's meeting, DP Floor Leader Kim Tae-sik  indicated that talks with his DLP counterpart, Rep. Yi Han-tong,  had made some progress toward holding an extra session.    Kim said, "I shared the opinion with Rep. Yi that the  National Assembly has to play a role in resolving all national  issues. When it can't, the nation is left with only one way to  go -- toward a crisis."    Yi also acknowledged that he had "detailed talks" with Kim,  but no conclusion was reached because his party had yet to set  clear policy goals on all pending issues.    "But in any event, we agreed that the National Assembly  should not proceed toward a dead-end," he said.    Yi is expected to consult with DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil  and  Secretary-General Mun Chong-su Tuesday afternoon, then rejoin  the opposition floor leader Wednesday morning to resume their  discussion.    Yi hinted that the ruling party might go along with  opposition moves to investigate pending issues, saying, "we will  study their (opposition) proposals positively, depending on  their attitude."</p>

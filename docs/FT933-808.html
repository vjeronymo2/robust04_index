			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / European Bonds: Volatility still the name of the game VOLATILITY will remain the name of the game in Europe's bond markets this week, although most analysts expect fundamental factors to gradually reassert themselves as the Russian constitutional crisis loses momentum. Bond prices see-sawed last week on reports of troop movements and civil-war warnings following President Boris Yeltsin's suspension of Russia's parliament. Germany, which is seen as being most vulnerable to upheaval in Russia due to its close political and economic ties, took the worst beating, with the currency plunging and yields on 10-year bunds climbing some 10 basis points on the week. Most continental European markets were dragged lower by Germany, though lagging its losses slightly. The main beneficiaries were those bond markets which had already fallen sharply prior to the Russian turmoil: UK gilts and Italian bonds. Moreover, US Treasuries saw heavy buying on the US currency's perceived safe-haven status. But unless the Russian crisis escalates, many of last week's flows may be reversed this week, with investors focusing again on Europe's fundamentals: anaemic growth and weak inflation fuelling hopes of further rate cuts. Expectations for Danish easing were met earlier than expected when key interest rates were cut by  1/2 point late on Friday. 'The currency remained strong after the rate cuts, which indicates Denmark can continue easing in coming weeks,' said Mr Werner Kramer, bond strategist with DB Research, Deutsche Bank's analysis subsidiary. 'That will continue supporting the Danish market.' Talk of French rate cuts was also rife ahead of the Group of Seven meeting in Washington, where France was expected to come under pressure to cut its rates, which have been kept high to protect the franc against the D-Mark. Moreover, the Bank of France probably took advantage of the franc's relative strength last week to replenish some of its foreign-currency reserves, facilitating an easing, said Ms Alison Cottrell, European economist at Midland Global Markets. The need to shore up its reserves, which were depleted heavily during the recent European currency crisis, has been seen as one of the reasons for the central bank's unwillingness to ease. According to the perverse logic of the currency markets, a rate cut will probably boost the franc, fuel further easing hopes and support the bond market. While German bonds will remain overshadowed by the Russian power struggle, investors will be cheered by the latest inflation data, which were lower than expected. On the basis of regional CPI data released on Friday, western German inflation is likely to be 4 per cent in September, down from 4.2 per cent in August. Mr Kramer at DB Research says long-term investors should seize upon bunds' current weakness to buy. 'The German markets will remain volatile in the short term, but on a three to six-month horizon we see 10-year yields going well below 6 per cent.' The 10-year bund yield closed at 6.16 per cent on Friday. He also favours UK gilts, where low inflation and economic growth prospects support the currency and yield outlook. Wednesday's auction of Pounds 3 1/4 bn of 6 3/4 per cent 2004 gilts is likely to meet strong international demand, he said. One way for investors to reduce exposure to near-term volatility is to switch to the short end, said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at market analysis firm IDEA. 'The short end of most yield curves is the safest area - the long end will get whipped around by further unrest in Russia,' he said.</p>

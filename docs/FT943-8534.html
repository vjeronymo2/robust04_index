			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Nigerian high court judge quits Abiola trial The judge presiding over the treason trial of opposition politician Chief Moshood Abiola walked out of the case yesterday, dashing union expectations he would be freed and prolonging Nigeria's political crisis. More protest strikes look imminent, especially among fellow members of Mr Abiola's Yoruba tribe in Lagos and south-western Nigeria, while the crippling oil industry strike enters its seventh week. Mr Abiola, on trial for treason after declaring himself president, remains in custody in Abuja after Mr Mohammed Mustapha ruled that the federal high court in the capital was competent to try him for offences alleged to have taken place in Lagos, but that he himself was not. Mr Mustapha said that he had lost the confidence of the defence lawyers and withdrew from the case. 'What he has done is judicial hara-kiri,' said Mr Alao Aka-Bashorun, a leading counsel for the defence. 'He has been found guilty of mishandling the trial. If so, how can he give this ruling? Since his incompetence in the case preceded today's ruling it becomes null and void.' At a previous hearing on August 3, the judge said he had to consult people outside the court before giving today's ruling and was promptly challenged by Mr Abiola and his defence. The federal high court in Abuja was set up just before the case opened in July and Mr Mustapha was transferred there from a court in Benin. On August 5 the judge granted bail in the absence of Mr Abiola and his lawyers on terms which were rejected by the defendant. 'It is clear that this judge is in collusion with the government,' said one of Mr Abiola's large team of lawyers after the hearing yesterday. 'The government wants a prolonged trial,' Mr Aka-Bashorun said. 'We are convinced that they have no evidence to convict him.' As well as undermining the judiciary, yesterday's outcome has further discredited the national leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress. Its president, Mr Paschal Bafyau, has three times delayed or suspended a general strike in protest at Mr Abiola's detention following assurances by General Sani Abacha's regime that the deposed winner of last year's presidential poll would be released. The oil workers' strike began unilaterally and has cut crude oil production by at least one quarter of its 2m barrels a day capacity and severely disrupted fuel distribution.</p>

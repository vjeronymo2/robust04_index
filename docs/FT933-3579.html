			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Roxboro to join market with Pounds 70m price tag ROXBORO, the Newmarket-based manufacturer of specialist electronic components, plans to come to market through an offer and placing next month which is expected to value the group at about Pounds 70m. The company grew out of the Pounds 29m management buy-out of the electronic components division, Cambridge Electronic Industries (now Graseby), in mid-1990. The buy-out, led by Mr Harry Tee, Roxboro's chief executive, was backed by Schroder Ventures. After the 'back-to-back' sale of the capacitor business for Pounds 9m to its management, Mr Tee has refocused Roxboro away from low-margin commodity components and towards production of higher-margin value-added devices. At the same time productivity has been improved and the workforce cut from 1,200 to 650. The group, which has operations in the UK and US, recorded profits before tax and interest of Pounds 4.3m last year on turnover of about Pounds 36m. Interim results will be published in a few weeks, however Mr Tee says that profitability in the current year is 'substantially' ahead of last year. In the US the group's existing operations have been restructured and consolidated into one plant at Roxboro, North Carolina which is a leading third party supplier of electro-optical indicators using LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes). These indicators, sold under the Dialight brand, are used extensively throughout the telecommunications, data communications and processing markets, and in the diversified industrial controls market. Because of their long life they are also increasingly replacing conventional light bulbs in control panels and displays. In Britain, Roxboro's two plants at Newmarket and Harlow manufacture specialist electromagnetic devices including relays, solenoids and filters which are sold under the Belling Lee and PED brands, mainly to the telecommunications, instrumentation and industrial markets. One new growth application for these devices is in the new generation of 'smart' utility meters for controlling electricity, gas and water supplies. Roxboro also designs and builds custom components for companies such as Schlumberger and Motorola. 'We have deliberately positioned ourselves as the number one two or three in our chosen markets,' said Mr Tee. Following the flotation the management is expected to retain about a 20 per cent stake in the enlarged company, which will then have a debt-free balance sheet. Mr Peter Smithan, a senior partner of Schroders Ventures will remain chairman of the group and two non-executive directors are expected to join the board. The issue will be sponsored by Samuel Montague with James Capel as brokers and the stock is expected to begin trading early in November.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ROD STEWART AT HOLLYWOOD BOWL -- WITH CONVICTION  </P> <P> What's gotten into Rod Stewart?  </P> <P> He's actually singing these days instead of shouting. What's more, he even  seems to care about what he's singing.  </P> <P> His sold-out show at Hollywood Bowl on Monday night was one of his best in  recent years. Right now, the gravel-voiced singer, backed as usual by an  excellent band, has one of the liveliest shows in rock.  </P> <P> His most recent album, the year-old, 2-million-selling "Out of Order," has not  only rejuvenated his sagging career, it seems to have rejuvenated him too.  </P> <P> Stewart's shows this decade have mostly been all frolicking and little serious  singing. Fun's fun, but his casual attitude was getting to be a bit much. He'd  sing off-key or blow lyrics and didn't seem to care.  </P> <P> A few years ago, Stewart seemed like an over-the-hill rocker having his last  fling. In those days, when he sang ballads such as Otis Redding's "Dock of the  Bay" and "Try a Little Tenderness," he appeared to be resting up from his  relentless, pointless prancing. But at the Bowl, he put some feeling into those  songs. You felt his conviction -- his genuine effort to interpret the lyrics.  </P> <P> These days, he's striking a balance between rollicking rowdiness and vocalizing  with conviction. On Monday, he very carefully sang the material from his  current album and had rip-roaring fun with oldies such as "Twistin' the Night  Away," "Every Picture Tells a Story" and "Hot Legs" -- songs that he can by now  sing with a minimum of effort.  </P> <P> Stewart still does some of his signature preening, prancing and fanny-wiggling  -- but not nearly as much as he used to. Maybe he thinks it's too undignified  for a 44-year-old man to spend a whole show cavorting like a Chippendale's  dancer.  </P> <P> When he did some leaping and prancing (he's amazingly limber for an old-timer),  it seemed to have more of a purpose. Maybe he just wanted to show that he can  still do it -- that's he's one rocker who's not yet ready for the rocking  chair.  </P></p>

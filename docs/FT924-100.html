			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Yugoslav army 'will stand up to west' MILITARY intervention by western forces in the former Yugoslavia would meet fierce resistance from the Yugoslav army, Gen Zivota Panic, the Yugoslav army's chief of staff, said in Belgrade yesterday. 'If intervention comes, we will defend our freedom, independence and territory with all means at our disposal,' he declared. 'Our forecasts show that the danger of military intervention has objectively increased in recent days. 'We must inform the world that this is a new genocide and we will not allow it.' Gen Panic's warning came as Britain moved a step closer towards backing military intervention against Serbia. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said in a newspaper article published yesterday that he could now 'imagine armed action against them to prevent a general Balkan war'. The Foreign Office emphasised Britain was losing patience with the Serbs, although the government still saw direct military involvement as far from inevitable. It stressed Mr Hurd had also said in the Daily Telegraph article that, 'democratic opinion would not support us in military occupation over years, with the inevitable costs and casualties.' General Panic, who commanded the Serbian operation last year that left the Croatian city of Vukovar a pile of rubble, asserted the West had conspired to break up Yugoslavia, but his forces could grow from a peacetime level of 120,000 to 600,000 in wartime. It was possible to mobilise up to 2m reservists, he said. The UN mediator Lord David Owen was in Belgrade yesterday in preparation for talks on the Yugoslav crisis this weekend in Geneva. Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, yesterday also condemned the threat of military intervention. 'The politicians will sit out military intervention secure in their bunkers,' he said. Speaking in Belgrade, he rejected as unconstitutional a parliamentary vote on Tuesday night naming a vice-premier to lead the Government until a newly-elected parliament is installed early next year. 'I will not run away,' Mr Panic said, dismissing as 'lunacy' calls by ultra-nationalists for his arrest. 'This is how fascism started in Nazi Germany. We have to stop this in our country.' Mr Panic, a Serbian-American millionaire returned to Yugoslavia in July to take up the premiership. Mr Panic lost presidential elections to the Serb leader Mr Slobodon Milosevic on December 20, but he has charged that the polls were unfair. Editorial comment, Page 10</p>

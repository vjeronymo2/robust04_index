			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- "The Russia's Choice  faction has not yet decided on whether it should oppose all the  government or not, but, in general, it has little optimism  concerning the cabinet's new composition," ITAR-TASS was told  today by faction member Kirill Ignatyev.    In his opinion, the new cabinet will prove to be a  government  of inflation. This is why the Russia's Choice faction cannot  assume the responsibility for all its work. "The faction,"  Ignatyev said, "will apparently oppose some steps of the  government, maybe even many, while supporting only two areas  --privatisation, for which Anatoliy Chubays is responsible, and  the international policy.    "When we recommended Andrey Kozyrev, who is a member of the  Russia's Choice movement, to stay on in the government, we were  guided by the conviction that the Zhirinovskiy policy called for  a serious, competent and balanced alternative, capable of  preventing extremism from getting the upper hand," Ignatyev  stated.    Economist Pavel Bunich, also a member of the Russia's Choice  faction, told ITAR-TASS that the the formation of the new  cabinet tended, without doubt, to reduce the vector of economic  reforms. But this, in his opinion, could partially produce some  rather sound results. "The point is," Bunich said, "that  inflation was slightly checked by means of both sound and  unsound means. Combatting inflation by not paying wages to  people was an impermissible method, while the restriction of  credits and subsidies to poorly functioning enterprises was a  positive measure. It will only be for the good of the nation if  the new government manages to do away with this harmful aspect  of combatting inflation," the economist believes.    "Radicalism's attenuation in this sphere should be  welcomed,"  he added. "However, regretful though it may be, the scales may  be tilted further towards greater inflation," Bunich stressed.  "Today," he believes, "there is a state of temporary balance.  There is now an axis between the president, premier, and  chairmen of the two chambers of the parliament. But as soon as  inflation soars up, attempts will immediately be made to find a  scapegoat. The parliament will point to the government, and so  will the president. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the  question of the cabinet's inefficiency will be raised within a  matter of four months from now. At present, the situation within  the government largely depends on the behaviour of the premier.  Whereas formerly we used to claim that it depends more on Yegor  Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, today we are witnessing the emergence  of a one-man theatre."    Leader of the Russian Communist Party faction Gennadiy  Zyuganov told ITAR-TASS that a very difficult struggle was being  fought over the new government. "At least two loyal associates  of Gaydar -- Anatoliy Chubays and Andrey Kozyrev -- are now  holding key posts in it," he added. "It remains to be seen  whether the new line will prevail, the line aimed at stabilising  and normalising our work, when workers and commodity producers  will be encouraged, or we shall again get a compromise hybrid,  which will not yield anything positive," Zyuganov stated. In  his opinion, this is the crux of the ongoing struggle. "For the  time being, it appears that the pragmatic line is getting the  upper hand," Zyuganov stated.</p>

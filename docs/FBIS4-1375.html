			<p>BFN     [Text] Security has somehow deteriorated once again in the  capital, Bujumbura. Although the operation of disarming people  possessing weapons illegally has already begun, these weapons  and people possessing guns continue to cause damages.  Yesterday, three rockets landed in the area of Ngagara, a  quarter neighboring the militias' stronghold of Kamenge where  the disarmament operation has begun.    One of the rockets reached a house and it smashed its roof  which collapsed into the living room but causing no casualties  although two persons were inside the house. The remainder of  the rocket touched another house across the street and made a  hole in the roof. The two other rockets exploded in the air and  made no damage.    In the southern part of the capital, gunfires heard over the  weekend had caused unrest in the areas of Musaga and (Kanyosha),  and some people may have already been killed. All began with  gunfires which were heard and compelled the Hutu population to  flee, thinking it was the militaries who were shooting. On  seeing this movement, the youth belonging mainly to the Tutsi  group began to loot the deserted houses. Then the Hutus came  back to retaliate and killed one young man, a killing which gave  way to generalised insecurity in the whole area. Until late  yesterday, tension remained high but the situation was calm this  morning.</p>

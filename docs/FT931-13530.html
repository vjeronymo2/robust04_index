			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / BA buys 19.9% stake in USAir BRITISH Airways yesterday announced it was spending Dollars 300m for a 19.9 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth-largest American carrier, just one month after it abandoned plans for a more ambitious Dollars 750m investment in the face of US controversy. The deal, approved yesterday by both companies' boards, forms an important part of BA's strategy of becoming the world's biggest global carrier. For the lossmaking, heavily debt-laden USAir, it means a valuable cash injection and greater access to the international market. However, while the transfer of funds to USAir took place yesterday, the deal still needs the backing of the US government and will face opposition from other US carriers. Rival airlines opposed the earlier BA deal, which would have given the British company a 44 per cent stake in USAir and a substantial say in strategic decision-making. They argued the pact should be blocked unless there was greater US access to London's Heathrow airport. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United Airlines, repeated this yesterday, saying the new BA investment 'must be carefully scrutinised by the US government and only sanctioned when the UK government lifts the barriers to competition . . . for US flag-carriers.' The new deal gives BA a stake well within the 25 per cent legal limit for foreign ownership of a US airline. It may be hard for the new Clinton administration to justify blocking it, since it is similar to two deals approved by the Bush government, which allowed KLM, the Dutch carrier, to take a minority stake in Northwest Airlines and Air Canada to do likewise at Continental Airlines. The new BA deal would allow BA the option - US law permitting - to inject up to Dollars 450m more into USAir, taking its equity stake up to 32.4 per cent. Three BA directors will join a 16-person USAir board, but they will not have the say in important company matters that was written in to the original agreement, nor will the two companies integrate their services as closely as first planned. They said yesterday they would first implement a new 'code-sharing' plan, under which USAir flights from US cities will link at key gateways with BA transatlantic flights.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Trade News: Coca-Cola of Korea files soft drink suit THE Korean subsidiary of Coca-Cola has filed a trademark infringement suit against Lotte Chilsung Beverage over its marketing of a soft drink similar to Coca-Cola's Sprite, John Burton reports from Seoul. Korea Coca-Cola launched Sprite in February. Lotte introduced a similar beverage two weeks later under the brand name Sprint with a package design resembling the Sprite product. Lotte has rejected the suit as 'groundless', claiming companies in the competitive Korean soft drink market often imitate each other's products. Lotte said Sprint was the latest development in its soda pop series. But in an apparent response to the Coca-Cola suit, Lotte has recently changed the name of the controversial drink to Sprinter. Coca-Cola claims Sprite is outselling Sprinter. Coca-Cola has complained about Lotte's marketing. It introduced its Hi-C orange juice into the Korean market in 1982. Lotte then sold a similar drink known as Heil-7. Coca-Cola did not contest that case. A decision on Sprite is due this week.</p>

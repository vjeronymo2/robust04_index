			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Tatarstan vote for self-rule poses challenge to Yeltsin PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin faces a challenge to the preservation of his vast Russian Federation following the weekend vote for self-rule by the oil-rich autonomous republic of Tatarstan. The 61.4 per cent majority for self-rule in Saturday's vote was decisive enough to embarrass the Russian government, especially Mr Yeltsin, who warned last week that the vote was 'aimed at isolation from Russia', and constituted a dangerous step that would delay Russian reforms. Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, the Tatar president, has denied his republic aims to break away from Russia. But Tatarstan is now likely to demand more economic and legislative autonomy than Russia can allow if it is not to set an awkward precedent. The vote came the day after a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which ended in acrimony and underlined the weak links holding ex-Soviet republics together. Mr Yeltsin's problem was underscored by the 37.2 per cent vote against Tatar self-rule, reflecting the influence of local Russians. These make up 42 per cent of the inhabitants and in Kazan, the capital, which has a Russian majority, the 'no' vote was 51 per cent. Russian first deputy premier Gennady Burbulis yesterday warned Tatarstan not to break away. 'We cannot allow ourselves to be indifferent to what is known as the territorial integrity of Russia,' he said on television. Mr Yeltsin's press office said the signing of a federative treaty between Moscow and 18 of the 20 autonomous republics had been postponed until March 31 because of 'organisational problems'. It was due to be concluded with a ceremony on Wednesday. But both Tatarstan and the Chechen republic - which has already declared independence - have refused to sign it, while the parliaments of the other republics have either still to approve it or have approved it only with amendments to be negotiated. The Russian constitution, of which the treaty would be a central part, is due to come before the next session of the Russian Congress of Peoples' Deputies starting on April 6. Many voices in that Congress and in the Russian leadership will seek strong measures against Tatarstan. Fault-lines spread, Page 17</p>

Shot-blasting, which consists of propelling small metal,  glass, or ceramic pellets against the surface of metal parts to  increase their resistance to fatigue, is finding wider  applications. Teknoson, a new PMI (small and medium-sized  enterprise) in the Paris region, has perfected a new method of  propelling the pellets to their target. The parts to be  processed are suspended in a metal bowl containing a handful of  steel pellets. The bowl is connected to an ultrasonic generator  which makes it vibrate at a frequency of 20,000 Hz. The pellets  thus set in motion will impact the parts in a totally random way  at approximately 20,000 times per second. Whatever its shape,  the part is treated evenly. It is even possible to shot-blast  hollow parts such as inlet tubing, where the shot enters through  one opening and exits at the other.    The depth of the process can reach 0.8 mm, depending on the  diameter of the pellets, the length of processing, and the power  of the ultrasonic transducer. Jian Lu, an engineer at the Cetim  materials department who has tested numerous samples prepared by  Teknoson, emphasized that "the shot used comes from ball  bearings. It is therefore very hard and perfectly spherical. As  a result, the surface condition obtained is better than the one  achieved with standard shot-blasting where the particles are not  always round."    The technique developed by the PMI in Saint-Soupplets  (Seine-et-Marne) is patented and was invented by a Russian  scientist for the particular purpose of shot-blasting  aeronautics parts and gun barrels.    In addition to these functions, the technique has the  advantage of being very economical: it does not require much  shot, does not need the installation of a shot-sorting system,  and does not use up much energy. Prestress shot-blasting  applications are very widespread: turbine blades, compressor  vane footings, springs, tubing, and so on. Furthermore,  shot-blasting can be used on steel or aluminum as well as on  titanium. Because of the excellent homogeneousness of the  process, thin parts do not warp. To achieve the same result,  standard machines must use two nozzles at the same time.    By adapting the shape of the ultrasonic transducer, it is  also possible to process hollow shapes such as rifle barrels. A  part can very easily be partially shot-blasted if so desired.  The surfaces to be protected just need to be covered with  masking tape, which will absorb the energy of the shot without  transmitting it to the metal. Teknoson specialists are already  formulating further developments for their process. For example,  by adding a powder to the bowl, parts could conceivably be  plated. But in this field, everything has yet to be invented.    Measuring particle velocity is one factor in predicting the  efficiency of a shot-blast operation. Until now, this parameter  was very difficult to establish. To solve the problem, the  Wheelabrator Allevard company, world leader in steel  shot-blasting, has joined Helispire, a startup company  specializing in measurement systems design, who has come up with  the solution: an optical process called Travel.    Yves Lecoffre, head of technology at Helispire and inventor  of Travel, explained that "until now, the only technique  available was Doppler laser anemometry, a very complex method  that is much closer to laboratory techniques than to industrial  ones." Not to mention that the laser-based device is costly and  must be operated by experts.    At present only enterprises like Snecma have invested in  such  an installation. Lecoffre pointed out that "our system makes it  possible to efficiently measure shot particle velocity by simple  means and at reasonable cost (about 120,000 francs)." His method  consists of illuminating the measurement area with a rectangular  beam of white light. When a particle crosses the beam, it sends  the light back to a lens that is placed perpendicular to the  light beam. This lens is fitted with a mask featuring two narrow  slits of different dimensions. The travel time of the reflected  light across the slits gives the speed and direction of motion  of the particle. Better yet, by doubling the beam through a  semi-transparent mirror and adding two more perpendicular slits,  two components of velocity are obtained (one horizontal, the  other vertical). The Travel device thus makes it possible to  measure particles whose diameter size is of the order of 0.5 mm  at velocities between 1 m/s and 100 m/s with a precision of the  order of one percent. A computer system collects all the results  and calculates an average velocity for the particles. As is only  fitting, the first shot-blaster equipped with the Travel system  is in operation at Allevard Wheelabrator, but future customers  have already expressed interest in a machine equipped in this  manner.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S A CAMP FOR EVERYTHING FROM;  </P> <P> A TO ZOO;  </P> <P> TRENDS: SPECIALIZED SUMMER PROGRAMS CATER TO CHILDREN'S INTERESTS IN EVERYTHING  FROM SPORTS TO MONEY MANAGEMENT. BUT COMPUTERS ARE PASSE.  </P> <P> Summer camp used to be simple. The kids went off for a week to Camp Cowabunga,  where they learned to swim, paddle a canoe and make potholders.  </P> <P> Now most head for day camp as Mom and Dad head for work. Camp might be anything  from an intensive week of gymnastics instruction to a two-week crash course in  drama ending with a production of "Peter Pan."  </P> <P> Summer camp has changed with the times. With increasing numbers of two-income  families, more day camps have sprung up not only to provide summer fun but also  to fill a need for summertime day care.  </P> <P> Also, more camps are specializing. By the end of a week, Junior may not know a  paddle from a potholder, but his tennis strokes could zing with precision.  </P> <P> In Ventura, the city's recreation department took the lead when it started  offering specialized camps five years ago. A budding tennis great can get two  weeks' worth of instruction and play for $120. Other weeklong sports camps  offered by the city include volleyball, gymnastics, fitness and soccer. Not to  mention beach camp -- complete with sailing, windsurfing and volleyball.  </P> <P> If your kid isn't a sports nut, he can plunge into arts, dance and nature  camps, or the popular "Camp Combo," which combines them all.  </P> <P> Travel camp buses kids daily to spots such as Universal Studios and the Santa  Barbara Zoo. If roughing it sounds appealing, residence camp offers a five-day  stay in cabins near Lake Cachuma in Santa Barbara County for $165.  </P> <P> The biggest hit is "Camp MTV," a mixture of music, theater and visual arts.  Working two weeks under the direction of artist Caryn Cheney and musician Jan  Palmer, 30 children, 7 to 12 years old, will produce "Snow White" this summer.  They'll rehearse daily, prepare sets from old refrigerator cartons and help  make costumes.  </P> <P> The specialized camps -- which originated because parents no longer have the  time to shuttle their children to lessons in one thing and another -- fill up  fast. Registration this year opens April 28.  </P> <P> Activities start at 9 a.m., "and parents get there at 7 a.m.," said Jenise  Heck-Rosene, senior recreation leader for the camps. "A lot of parents say they  wish they could go."  </P> <P> The camps run from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., from June 18 through Aug. 24. Kids  frequently migrate from camp to camp all summer, spending a week at one camp  and the next week at another.  </P> <P> Other Ventura County communities also offer daylong camps to accommodate  working parents. Some are an extension of after-school programs, such as those  offered by the Boys and Girls Clubs, but with a few added treats for summer  fun.  </P> <P> At $45 a week, Oxnard's Camp Serendipity is the most inexpensive. The children  swim, do arts and crafts, play sports and learn about drama. Boys and girls  learn how to bake bread, prepare Italian and Mexican dishes and put together  Mulligan stew.  </P> <P> Once a month, they visit Disneyland or Knott's Berry Farm. Each week, they're  off to ride horses, stroll around the Santa Barbara Zoo or play miniature golf.  </P> <P> "For 90% of them, it's their first time horseback riding," said Michelle Izay,  recreation supervisor for the city.  </P> <P> The Conejo Recreation and Park District in Thousand Oaks also offers a special  day camp for emotionally or physically disabled children. Twelve children, ages  6 to 12, spend four days paddling around a pool, playing ball and, in general,  doing what other kids do at summer camp.  </P> <P> "A lot of them are in wheelchairs," said Cindy Rocklein, recreation director  for the therapeutic camp. "They play volleyball with a beach ball. Volunteers  help move their arms. Nobody sits around."  </P> <P> Now that the children of baby boomers are swelling the camp-age population,  more kids than ever are going to camp, according to Gary Abell, spokesman for  the American Camping Assn. in Indianapolis. Five years ago, 4 million children  across the country struck off for overnight or day camp. Last year, the number  was up to 5 million.  </P> <P> Water sports, wilderness and fitness camps are big. But computer camp is  history, according to Abell. Computers are more accessible now; they're used in  schools, and the novelty has worn off.  </P> <P> In Thousand Oaks, Mitch Leichter first opened his Young Set Club to day campers  seven years ago. The five-acre grounds include an Olympic-size swimming pool, a  clubhouse with video games and an archery range -- all in a rustic setting  frequented by rabbits, squirrels and deer.  </P> <P> "It's the last of the dinosaurs in Thousand Oaks," Leichter said.  </P> <P> The camp is a big operation. About 150 to 200 kids are enrolled at a cost of  $85 a week. An equal number drop in for swimming lessons daily. Leichter has a  full-time staff of 25 to 35 counselors and 10 water instructors.  </P> <P> His campers take jaunts to Magic Mountain or Knott's Berry Farm. They go  horseback riding. They compete in creative songfests once a week for the most  energetic and inspired performances.  </P> <P> But the high point is an overnight camp-out on the grounds -- complete with a  visit from the legendary creature "Uncle Gor," an escaped "gorilla that  supposedly lives nearby."  </P> <P> "We light a bonfire to welcome Uncle Gor," Leichter said. When the creature  appears, the children throw bananas at him. They top off the evening with a  barbecue and roasted marshmallows.  </P> <P> Leichter likes to think of himself as doing a bit of social work in addition to  providing a healthy play environment. He recruited males for half his  counseling positions because about half of his children come from broken homes.  </P> <P> "They don't have a daddy figure," he said."  </P> <P> Not all camps are geared toward day care. Not all are affordable.  </P> <P> If your kid is into lions, lizards and lemurs, you might try zoo camp in Santa  Barbara. Kids 3 to 11 years old can attend camp at the Santa Barbara Zoo from 9  a.m. to 2 p.m. Under supervision, they can fondle a snake and mingle with  birds, goats, rabbits and other animals.  </P> <P> The highlight of zoo camp is a camp-out and nighttime safari through the zoo  grounds. During the day the children also learn crafts, games and songs -- most  of them revolving around animals and nature. It costs $20 a day, or $80 to $90  a week.  </P> <P> For overnight campers, the choices are slim in Ventura County. The YMCA and  other groups, such as Easter Seals, Scouts and Campfire, send kids to overnight  camps outside the county, in Lake Cachuma, Big Bear, Santa Catalina Island or  Frazier Park.  </P> <P> But a few specialized camps in the Ojai area take boarders. The theme at Tecuya  Shores, a Girl Scout camp near Oakview, is water sports -- windsurfing,  snorkeling and boogie-boarding.  </P> <P> For nine nights, the girls -- fifth-graders and older -- sleep on cots outside.  When they're waterlogged, they can go horseback riding. The sessions, at $270,  are popular, and already they are nearly full for this summer.  </P> <P> By far the most expensive overnight camp is at the Ojai Valley School, a  79-year-old boarding school offering a summer program that combines academics  and recreation.  </P> <P> "Mom and Dad pick our camp," said Gary Gartrell, director of the summer  program.  </P> <P> The camp draws mostly from Los Angeles, although its day camp attracts local  residents, Gartrell said. The cost is $2,825 for six weeks of resident camp --  or $1,670 for three weeks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DAY CAMPSA ROUNDUP  </P> <P> Day camps in Ventura County include:  </P> <P>  CAMARILLO  </P> <P> * Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District; starting June 18, two day camps  for kids 5 to 8 years, and 9 to 12 years.

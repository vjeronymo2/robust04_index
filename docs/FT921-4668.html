			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Aerospace industry calls for more government aid THE AEROSPACE industry, struggling under defence cuts and the downturn in civil business, is launching a campaign to coincide with the start of the general election to seek greater government support. On Monday the Society of British Aerospace Companies will send a series of briefing papers to potential parliamentary candidates from all parties warning them of the plight of the aerospace industry and the repercussions on jobs and technology in industry as a whole. The society warns that aerospace industry employment will fall as much as 25 per cent - or about 44,000 jobs  - between 1989 and this year because of defence cuts and the civil aerospace recession. It estimates employment in its 240 member companies will fall from 194,000 jobs in 1989 to about 150,000 by the end of this year. 'Further job losses will take place in small companies providing services and goods to the aerospace industry,' it says. A society official said yesterday that aerospace workers were voters in 340 constituencies. Of these, two thirds were regarded as among the top marginal constituencies in the forthcoming election. Sir Ralph Robins, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine group, yesterday stressed that the UK aerospace industry required the same 'level playing field' as rival aerospace industries, which were facing the same pressures of defence cuts and a downturn in civil orders. He told the Aviation Club of Britain: 'Some of our foreign friends receive considerable help from their governments. Either we have to stop these governments doing this or we must join them and help our industry in the same way.' The society is pressing for a closer dialogue between companies and government to ensure that the UK maintains the optimum defence industrial base and leading-edge technological competence in spite of restructuring. The decision to reduce defence equipment expenditure was taken by one government department, the Ministry of Defence, but the industrial restructuring has consequences for and requires action from several other government departments including trade, transport and employment, the society argues. It also urges: Increased government investment in new space and civil aerospace projects. Government launch funds for civil aerospace projects should be expanded to include components and avionics. European Community recognition that the defence industry is facing permanent change and use of structural funds to assist in the management of the transition. Government support for large aerospace companies considering investment in fields outside their traditional activities. A government policy on defence diversification to study possible conversions from defence to civil activities. A national technological assessment to be undertaken to identify core technologies, research and development priorities, and opportunities for technological transfer into new product areas. The society says that restructuring will have significant implications for the UK's technological and manufacturing base. However, it also emphasises that the industry does not want a return to direct government intervention in company decision-making but a more constructive dialogue with government. Other important warnings include the danger that reduced research and development expenditure in the UK would result in British companies losing their technological edge. This would weaken their position in negotiations to form joint ventures or collaborate in international partnerships by making them junior partners in such ventures. The society also warns of the impact of economic recession on the corporate acquisition process. Cash-rich companies may acquire new businesses but many hard-pressed defence companies would find it difficult to justify a rights issue to make a strategic purchase. It adds that if acquisitions do take place, they risk being in countries where business activity is recovering faster than in the UK. The society is sending to prospective parliamentary candidates three initial briefing papers. But it plans to maintain the pressure by producing a number of additional papers to underline what it believes is an urgent need for greater government support and understanding for the UK's leading manufacturing industry.</p>

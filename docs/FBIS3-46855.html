			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rolly San Juan] </F>   [Text] Moro rebel leader Nur Misuari yesterday denounced  the spate of bombings in Davao City and said he will not allow  saboteurs to disrupt the peace talks between the government and  the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).    The government, meanwhile, has agreed to meet  representatives  of the communist-led National Democratic Front (NDF) before  holding the next round of exploratory talks in Vietnam.    Howard Dee, chair of the government peace panel, however,  urged the NDF to remove all preconditions for the Vietnam talks,  saying these were contrary to The Hague Declaration signed by  the two parties last year.    "We...condemn the dastardly act of bombing sacred places,  the  church and the mosques of Davao City," Misuari said at the  resumption of government-MNLF talks in Timbangan town.    Misuari told Bangsa Moro [Moro Nation] supporters he will  not  allow anybody to sabotage the talks. He said the MNLF units in  Davao City were ready to go after the persons responsible for  the bombings of the Davao cathedral and mosques.    Also attending the affair were Representative Eduardo  Ermita,  government peace representatives, and observers from the  Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) of Six led by  Indonesian Ambassador Yusbar Jamil.    The perpetrators of the bombings "...will not succeed, as  unity and peace in Mindanao will be achieved and will reign," he  said.    Meanwhile, the GRP [government of the Republic of the  Philippines]-MNLF "mixed" support committees which convened  Tuesday noon named the cities of Zamboanga, Cotabato, Marawi,  General Santos and Manila as the next venues for the peace talks.    The schedules are: cease fire committee -- 5, 6, 7, January,  Zamboanga City; defense -- 10, 11, 12 January, Cotabato City;  administration -- 13, 14, 15 January, Manila; shariah -- 17,  18, 19 January, Marawi City, and 27, 28 29 January, General  Santos City; economics -- 20, 21 January, Zamboanga City; and ad  hoc -- 7, 8, 9 February, Zamboanga City.    The "mixed" committees will meet in Zamboanga City, but the  dates have not yet been agreed upon.    The ad hoc committee is headed by Interior Undersecretary  Alexander Aguirre, with Ermita, Makabankit Lanto, Baltazar Sator  and Department of Justice Undersecretary De Castro as members.    Heading the five MNLF committees are Lieutenant General  Thambayopha Manjoarsa, defense and security; Dr. Jawali Laja,  education; lawyer Jose Lorena, finance, mines and resources;  lawyer Didagen Dilangalen, administrative; and Ustadz Shariff  Zain Jali, judiciary and shariah.    The OIC was represented in the Timbangan meeting by  Ambassador Jamil, Libyan Ambassador Abdulaziz Azzaroukh and  Indonesian Consul Colonel Muhammad Zaini.    In a press statement, Dee cited as a "precondition" the  rebels' demand for the withdrawal of Executive Order (EO) No.  125, issued by President Ramos on 15 September 1993.    NDF peace representative Luis Jalandoni has said the order  threw "a monkey wrench into the peace process" and accused the  government of imposing the Philippine Constitution as framework  for the peace negotiations.    Jalandoni, in a statement issued in Utrecht, the Netherlands  in October threatened to pull out from the Vietnam talks if the  government did not recall the executive order.    Dee said the order "defines the approach and administrative  structure for the government's comprehensive peace efforts  and...clothes the government panel with its authority to  negotiate peace settlement."    He said it is the government's responsibility to follow the  "Rule of law and Constitutional processes" in pursuing a "just  and comprehensive and lasting peace."    Instead, Dee said, Jalandoni "takes issue with the reference  in EO 125 and insists on resolving this issue even before the  holding of the exploratory talks in Vietnam.    "Any disagreement on this issue should be elevated for  discussion ion the Vietnam exploratory talks as these talks are  intended precisely to reach common understanding for us to  proceed to the formal talks," he said.    Dee said that without the "preconditions," the preliminary  meeting can take place to prepare the agenda and ground rules  for the exploratory talks."    The former ambassador to the Vatican also urged Jalandoni to  "come to the negotiations table to implement The Hague  Declaration so that together we may give peace a chance."    "Our people deserve nothing less."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has said that  our country wants to increase cooperation and trade with other  countries in order to be adequately reincorporated into the new  international economic context, with the advantage that,  notwithstanding its setbacks, Cuba also has things to offer.    In his tour of Asian countries, Robaina said that economic  and trade prospects with Indonesia are very promising and that  the two countries are also interested in strengthening the  Nonaligned Movement.    Robaina added: During our visit to Bangkok we met with Thai  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri. The meeting allowed us to  study formulas to increase our economic ties. Our next visits to  Asia will seek the same objective.    Cuba is open to all forms of cooperation and, despite the  U.S. pressure through the blockade, is day by day demonstrating  its capacity to resist and its determination to succeed, Robaina  concluded.</p>

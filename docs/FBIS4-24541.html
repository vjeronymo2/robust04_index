			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Full Text of Jiang Zemin Speech at </F> Meeting With Third Group of Hong Kong Affairs Advisers"]    [Text] Beijing, 26 May (TA KUNG PAO)--President Jiang  Zemin today met with the third group of Hong Kong affairs  advisers and newly appointed members of the Preliminary Work  Committee [PWC]. Jiang Zemin made a speech, the full text of  which is as follows:    Time flies like an arrow, and the sun and the moon move back  and forth like shuttles. Today is only three years away from  China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and many  urgent things remain to be done.    The central authorities have already formulated a series of  important principles and polices toward the management of Hong  Kong after 1997. Ten years ago, Deng Xiaoping said to us  earnestly: We must believe that the Chinese in Hong Kong can  properly manage Hong Kong. Not believing that the Chinese have  the ability to manage Hong Kong properly is a type of thinking  left behind by old colonialism. We are fully confident that the  Hong Kong people can manage Hong Kong well. He said that Hong  Kong's current economic stability and prosperity is inseparable  from the Hong Kong people's diligence and creative spirit. It  was like this in the past, it is like this today, and the Hong  Kong people are certainly able to create a good future for Hong  Kong tomorrow.    There is an old saying which goes: "Bone is linked to  muscle," that is, Hong Kong's stability and prosperity is  closely linked to and inseparable from the economic development  on our mainland and interior, and I am afraid that the mainland  still must give great support to the many economic activities in  Hong Kong. But Hong Kong will remain different from the  mainland in the years to come, and Hong Kong will enjoy a high  degree of autonomy and will be different from the 30 provinces  and municipalities on the mainland. We must also realize,  however, that the mainland, with its socialism with Chinese  characteristics, gives great support to Hong Kong's one country,  two systems, to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, and to  Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.    In the next three years, the British Hong Kong authorities  will still be in charge. But the Hong Kong people must begin  participating today. One of the important reasons why we have  founded the PWC and have appointed Hong Kong affairs advisers is  to provide opportunities and channels for the Hong Kong people  to participate in the undertaking of Hong Kong's return and  smooth transition, and to lay a foundation for "Hong Kong people  ruling Hong Kong" after 1997. He [as published] expressed the  hope that the Hong Kong people would care about the matter of  China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and would care  about Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, for these  are closely linked to the interests of the Hong Kong people. He  [as published] hoped that the Hong Kong affairs advisers and the  members of the PWC would strengthen ties with the interior  through various channels and do a better job in involving the  Hong Kong people in the process of making full preparations for  the approach of 1997.    I wish everyone trouble-free work and good health.</p>

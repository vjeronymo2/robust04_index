			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: PHANTOMS OF THE BACK LOT;  </P> <P> FIRE LEAVES EMBERS WHERE MUCH OF UNIVERSAL'S MOVIE MAGIC WAS MADE  </P> <P> Once, years ago, when I was doing a story on the back lot at  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for West magazine here at the paper, I imagined what a  great location it would be for a mystery. With its crazy-quilt of streets and  structures and cultures, tumbled together like a child's dream, it seemed alive  with stories, and ghosts.  </P> <P> I even conjured up a quick synopsis about an old actor, crazed by a life of  failure, who dwelt undetected among those fragments of old plots and foraged  out to take his revenge on those he imagined had thwarted his career.  </P> <P> And as I watched part of Universal's great back lot go up in those fittingly  cinematic flames on television two nights ago, I thought of all my roamings on  Hollywood's back lots over the years, and it struck me again that the back lots  have always had an eerie, poignant and provocative life of their own.  </P> <P> If you are a movie buff, of course, it is engrossing to walk the back lots and  try to remember where you might have glimpsed that storefront, that seedy hotel  entrance, that waterfront cafe, that theater marquee, that picket fence.  (Didn't Andy Hardy park his first roadster there?)  </P> <P> Where there are embers now on the Universal lot, Robert Redford and Paul Newman  had conned their way through "The Sting." It had been Kansas City for Clint  Eastwood and Burt Reynolds in "City Heat" and any place you could wreck a car  for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd in "The Blues Brothers." It was made to shake  for "Earthquake" and Diana Ross filled it with sweeter sounds in "Lady Sings  the Blues." And most recently, it was the splashy big town backdrop for Dick  Tracy and his gal Tess Trueheart.  </P> <P> Most back lot sets change roles as frequently as the actors themselves. But the  Norman Bates "Psycho" house became a landmark, and there are still the false  fronts and the billboards that created turn-of-the-century Manhattan for  "Hello, Dolly!" on the lot at Twentieth Century Fox. But at Universal as  elsewhere there were also the generic shops that became a hundred different  cities or maybe a thousand, or the clapboard houses that stood on Main Street  in villages in every state in the Union, the boardwalks that heard the clink of  spurs and the sound of hoofbeats.  </P> <P> It was the closeness of one culture to another that made the back lots -- I  suppose Warners must be the most extensive one left -- so bizarrely enchanting.  Marseilles abuts Manhattan, which adjoined the jungle or who knew what else.  Tarzan, misjudging a swing, could have lit in Boston.  </P> <P> Walking a back lot should have been entirely destructive of illusion. The  doorways lead to nowhere. Squinting through the grimy shop windows you are  likely to see only some loose boards or a length of old rope or the ancient  leavings of some crewman's lunch. The buildings are all sham -- fronts and an  occasional side, and the enduring granite of the bank building is seen to be  gray-painted plywood that has begun to curl at the edges.  </P> <P> All illusion, all fakery. But that turns out to be the peculiar and alluring  charm of back lots like Universal's. Even more than real places, they somehow  remain suffused, or haunted, with the presences of all those who acted out  their celluloid tales in those spaces, taking their pratfalls, tearing their  hearts out, running to embrace lovers, fleeing the stalking peril -- making the  illusions believable because we wanted to believe them.  </P> <P> In a day that wants even heavier infusions of reality, the back lots have been  relatively less used. Many of the structures, as you stroll about, look long  abandoned and perilously dry in a dry climate. It is not surprising that all  back lots have been prey to fires, despite the fact that the studios maintain  their own fire departments.  </P> <P> What goes up in flames, or, as at MGM, under the developers' bulldozers, is not  necessarily that valuable in dollars. But it was the priceless proof of a  special kind of genius. The "Once upon a time," "Tell me a story" tradition  that is as old as speech itself was brought up to date in the 20th Century by  wizardly men and women who imagined how to find Tahiti in a bucket of sand,  fashion ancient Rome with some plaster of Paris and carved linoleum or create  the whole world, plus occasional glimpses of heaven and hell, on a chicken  ranch in the Valley.  </P> <P> The films live on in their ghostly ways, but the ghosts themselves will need  new quarters.  </P></p>

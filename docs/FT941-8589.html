			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rice - the next generation / Scientists are pinning their hopes on an entirely new variety that could increase yields by 20-25 per cent While the dramatic rise in the world price of rice - by almost 100 per cent since last September - could stimulate increased production, scientists at the Manila-based International Rice Research Institute are warning that existing rice varieties are unlikely to yield more. The high-yielding varieties developed in the late 1960s - under the so called 'green revolution' - have peaked, the scientists say. 'Increases in rice production have flowed dramatically since 1985 in the 10 countries that account for 85 per cent of world production,' says IRRI economist Mr Mahabub Hossain. Nearly 90 per cent of all the world's rice is grown and eaten in Asia; about 60 per cent is under irrigation. Only about 3 per cent of global output is traded internationally. Scientists are now pinning their hopes on a completely new rice plant that could yield 20-25 per cent more than existing irrigated varieties. According to the IRRI's estimates, rice output will have to increase by 70 per cent in the next 25 years to keep up with demand. This means that an extra 350m tonnes a year will have to be grown. But because of competing demands on resources in the year 2020 rice will have to be grown on less land, using less water. Most rice in Asia grows standing in water, but it appears that the water robs soil of oxygen and eventually erodes its fertility. IRRI scientists estimate that in southern Asia alone, about 10m hectares of highly productive rice land - 10 per cent of the global area under irrigated rice - is showing signs of fatigue. 'Under submerged conditions, there appears to be a reduction in the amount of nitrogen the soil can provide to the crop,' explains Mr Ken Cassman, head of IRRI's agronomy, plant physiology and agroecology division. The new rice could help solve this problem. To develop the variety IRRI scientists searched the Institute's extensive collection of germplasm for the characteristics they wanted in the new plant. Some samples, for example, can make good use of naturally available nitrogen; some can produce a larger number of grains per panicle - the part of the plant that carries the rice grain; others have good resistance to pest and plant diseases. By crossing these samples, scientists combined the traits to produce the plant they wanted. This is now being tested in IRRI's fields and the crop is due to be harvested this May. IRRI's chief plant breeder, Mr Gurdev Khush, says that the new rice plant 'differs from existing varieties in several ways. It has fewer tillers (stems) but larger panicles'. He hopes that the new plant will yield up to 12-12.5 tonnes a hectare under irrigated conditions. Mr Khush admits there are several problems the new plant may face - taste, for example. As taste preferences vary from country to country the new rice will have to adapt to local requirements. IRRI's deputy director-general in charge of research, Mr Ken Fischer, believes that with more research the new rice could yield up to 15 tonnes a hectare within a decade, half as much again as existing varieties. There could be even larger gains from rain-fed lowland areas. Some 38m hectares of lowland rice in Asia - 40 per cent of the total area under rice  -have no irrigation. Rice production in most of Bangladesh, Cambodia, Eastern India and Laos depends on the rain. The 'green revolution' has bypassed farmers in these areas. They continue to grow traditional varieties that yield only 1.5 to 2.5 tonnes a hectare. Poor soils and adverse climate - sometimes both drought and floods in the same cropping season - make for limited incomes, which means farmers cannot afford to purchase inputs such as fertilisers. A variation of the new rice plant is being developed for these areas. Because local conditions vary a great deal, research for this plant has been done by rice institutes in the countries where lowland rice is dominant. The first plant will be tested later this year in Eastern India. Mr Robert Zeigler, leader of IRRI's rain-fed lowland rice ecosystem programme, says the rain-fed area plant will need to yield well, develop a good root system, tolerate drought and submersion under water and be able to cope with weeds. 'If we can develop the right traits,' he says, 'then farmers will be more inclined to invest in fertiliser and increase their yields.' He believes that the research could bring significant results within the next five years and that yields from rain-fed lowlands could triple, to over 5 tonnes a hectare.</p>

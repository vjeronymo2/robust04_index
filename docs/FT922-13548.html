			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Sale of Circle K opposed in court THE official bondholders' committee at Circle K, the bankrupt US convenience store chain, yesterday filed papers in the Arizona courts opposing aspects of the proposed sale of the business to a group of investors, writes Nikki Tait. The Dollars 425m deal was announced last month. The international group of investors is led by Investcorp, the Arab finance organisation which already owns Saks Fifth Avenue. The bondholders committee alleges that there was lack of informed decision-making by the board, and claims that the entire board never received a written valuation of Circle K's worth. As a result, it suggests, the board could not make an informed decision on the offer and breached its fiduciary duty.</p>

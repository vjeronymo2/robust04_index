			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINE PINS HOPES ON WOMEN IN BUSINESS  </P> <P> Role models are more important to women than to men. Personalities and life  styles are more interesting to women than to men. Men are more practical, women  more romantic.  </P> <P> Although they may sound like sexist stereotypes, these conclusions are part of  the marketing strategy for a new Irvine-based magazine whose overall  orientation is anything but chauvinist. Entrepreneurial Woman, which hit the  newsstands Tuesday, is in fact also based on the premise that women will soon  be running half of all businesses in the United States and form an affluent and  fast-growing market for a new publication.  </P> <P> And the publishers of Entrepreneurial Woman, who also publish Entrepreneur,  believe this market isn't being addressed by either the myriad women's  magazines or the mainstream business magazines.  </P> <P> "There aren't any direct competitors," Publisher Clare N. Thain said. "There  are some out there -- Working Woman, Working Mother, Savvy Woman -- but they  tend to be more oriented to the corporate businesswoman. Ours is a niche book."  </P> <P> Thain said this niche already contains 3 million to 4 million female  small-business owners, and he cited U.S. Small Business Administration figures  showing that more than half of all new businesses today are started by women.  Initially, Entrepreneurial Woman will aim to reach 200,000 of them, half  through subscriptions and half through newsstand sales.  </P> <P> One key question is whether women really want anything different from men in a  business magazine. Editor Rieva Lesonsky, who like most of the 86 employees at  Entrepreneur will do double duty with both magazines, said Entrepreneurial  Woman will differ from its older sibling by focusing more on personalities.  </P> <P> "Women don't have as many role models as men," she said. "They want to hear  about who is doing these things, as well as what they're doing."  </P> <P> Thane added that "men tend to be more oriented towards the how-to," while women  have "stronger emotional ties" to people-oriented activities, such as  networking groups. These conclusions, he said, came from focus groups and  discussions with organizations such as the National Assn. of Women Business  Owners.  </P> <P> Judith Daniels, a New York magazine consultant and founder of Savvy Woman  magazine, agreed that women's concerns generally are neglected by mainstream  business magazines such as Business Week, Fortune, Forbes and Inc. "If you're a  woman, you like to see your work life addressed, and you just don't see it in  the business press," she said.  </P> <P> Daniels added, however, that most women's magazines now recognize that their  readers are working, and they make an effort to address those concerns. She  noted that even life style magazines such as Glamour, for which she is a  contributing editor, now contain articles about the working world.  </P> <P> Savvy Woman and Working Woman, moreover, are well-established magazines with  large circulations. Working Woman alone has a circulation of nearly 1 million,  outstripping even the major business magazines.  </P> <P> But Lesonsky claimed that these publications are strictly aimed at the  corporate  </P> <P> and professional women, not entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> "Working Woman gives maybe six pages out of 130" to women who own their own  businesses, she said. "I don't consider it a competitor."  </P> <P> From an advertiser's point of view, though, professional women are an  attractive, affluent market. Entrepreneurial Woman still must persuade people  that its readership is made up of established businesswomen and not struggling  would-be entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> A heavy presence of ads from franchise operators, mail-order houses and  little-known companies promoting "get-rich-quick" schemes has long  characterized Entrepreneur, and the premier issue of Entrepreneurial Woman  appears to follow that pattern. Such ads might bring in revenue, but they don't  impress more desirable national advertisers such as automobile, computer and  luxury goods companies.  </P> <P> Still, Entrepreneurial Woman has some strong advantages starting out, not the  least of which is the existing infrastructure of Entrepreneur. Company Chairman  Peter Shea said just eight people are dedicated solely to the new publication,  with the rest of the staff coming from Entrepreneur. Similarly, the new  magazine will be able to call on many of the same advertisers and generally  take advantage of the network of contacts already built by Entrepreneur.  </P> <P> Entrepreneurial Woman also had a very strong response to its May pilot issue,  Shea said. Of the 100,000 people who received the pilot, 12,000 responded  either to a subscription request or a survey. Shea called that response  "phenomenal."  </P> <P> The launch costs for the new magazine have been kept to $1.5 million, Shea  said, and profits are expected in the first year. Making money that quickly  would be highly unusual for a new magazine.  </P> <P> The first issue of Entrepreneurial Woman contains 128 pages -- a roughly 50-50  mix of editorial and advertising -- and features a cover profile of Rachel  Perry, who built a $10-million skin-care company. Shorter columns bear titles  such as "Management Smarts," "Family Matters" and "Role Model."  </P> <P> Daniels, the New York magazine consultant, said she hadn't seen a copy of  Entrepreneurial Woman but said the response to the pilot issue sounded  "incredible." And though she is generally skeptical about the prospects for any  start-up magazine -- the great majority of them fail -- she agreed that  Entrepreneurial Woman may have found a niche.  </P> <P> "It's another slice of a slice of a slice of the pie," Daniels said. "The  largest category of circulation is women's magazines, and it's always in flux.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS  </P> <P> Small Businesses owned by women.  </P> <P> In millions:  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.67IN:2.22IN:2.33IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Women-owned  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> % of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> businesses  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> businesses  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1977  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 23%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1982  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 26%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 29%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 38%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 2000*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 30.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 50%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Estimate  </P> <P> Sources: IRS, U.S. Bureau of the Census, Small Business Administration  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAGAZINE MARKET  </P> <P> Total circulation for six month ending Dec. 31, 1989.  </P> <P> Black Enterprise*: 233,458  </P> <P> Business Week**: 889,535  </P> <P> Elle: 826,336  </P> <P> Entrepreneurial Woman***: 200,000  </P> <P> Fortune: 668,972  </P> <P> Inc.: 630,203  </P> <P> Savvy Woman: 456,712  </P> <P> Working Mother: 538,072  </P> <P> Working Woman*: 903,704  </P> <P> * Six months ending June 30, 1989.  </P> <P> ** North America only  </P> <P> *** Guaranteed six-month circulation for advertisers.  </P></p>

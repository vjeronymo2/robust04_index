			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Prague, Jan 13 (CTK) -- All Czech papers today  highlight the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Prague and  the talks of the Visegrad Four.    In the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY Adam Cerny comments  on  Clinton's meeting with the presidents of the Czech Republic,  Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, saying that "it is a subtle game,  in which a most significant question is asked: whether or not a  new curtain will be put up in Europe and where if the answer is  in the affirmative. NATO is most cautious to avoid anything  that could be interpreted so that it is the Alliance which  erects and rings it down."    In the independent MLADA FRONTA DNES Viliam Buchert writes  that one possible interpretation of the problem of NATO  membership can be as follows: "After it lost its enemy from  `the empire of the evil,' the Alliance is changing substantially  and striving to cooperate with Russia rather than to contain it.  With regard to Moscow's nuclear potential this is  understandable. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe do  not often share this view and are thus backing the old NATO. He  who will be quicker to comprehend this will have more chances to  see his wishes met more quickly. NATO just as its Partnership  for Peace is only for partners, not for competitors and rivals,"  Buchert writes.    The farmers' daily ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY says that Clinton's  visit has been the most complex venture of Czech diplomacy thus  far. "The importance of the visit resides in the fact that it  practically ruled out any further speculation about the attitude  of the United States and NATO to Central Europe with reference  to this or another separate negotiation, opinion or  interpretation.... But now the ball is on Visegrad's side of  the playground after all."    In the right-orientated daily CESKY DENIK Josef Landergott  says that "only the Moscow talks of the president will be  interesting for the superpower, America. Seen from this point  of view his Prague stay is but a visit to the `U Tygra' pub."    The trade union daily PRACE says that "Bill Clinton's stay  of  24 hours in Prague has revealed that overseas we are still  considered a suspected jungle," which is at variance with "the  endlessly repeated words that for the West we are the best of  all post-communist countries in all aspects."    "But if this were so, it is good that Clinton did not visit  a  capital situated more eastwards," the paper writes and adds that  there the security services' agents "would probably take off the  domestic journalists' slips."

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GRACE TO EXPAND CHEMICAL BUSINESS  </P> <P> W. R. Grace &amp; Co., the leading U.S. maker of specialty chemicals, said  today that it plans to sell minority stakes in its far-flung specialty units  and energy holdings to generate funds to expand its profitable chemical  business.  </P> <P> The New York-based company expects the sales to generate at least $300 million,  a spokesman said. Grace's specialty businesses include cocoa, specialty  textiles and specialty agricultural activities.  </P> <P> Grace, which has sold $2 billion in assets in the last two years, said it is  considering the partial sale of a minority interest in Grace Specialty  Businesses and the sale of a minority stake in Grace Natural Resources Group.  </P> <P> Grace said it would use proceeds from these sales to support both its core  specialty chemical business -- which has high capital requirements -- and its  nonspecialty chemical business in a restructuring that hopes to boost 1989  profits.  </P> <P> Grace has been shedding businesses to improve profits and to thwart potential  takeover attempts. The conglomerate focuses on specialty chemicals, natural  resources, specialty businesses and chemicals.  </P></p>

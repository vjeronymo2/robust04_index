			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Councils to fight abolition in court Avon and Cleveland county councils were yesterday given leave to mount High Court challenges to government proposals for their abolition and replacement with four unitary authorities. A High Court judge gave permission for both authorities to bring judicial review proceedings aimed at quashing the recommendations of the Local Government Commission. The move follows last Friday's High Court successes of Lancashire and Derbyshire county councils in overturning the revised guidance on plans to replace the two-tier system of local government with unitary authorities.</p>

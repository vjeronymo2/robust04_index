			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOLS TUNING IN TO POWER-SHARING PLAN;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: THE DISTRICT TAKES TO THE AIRWAVES TO EXPLAIN HOW SCHOOLS CAN  INITIATE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN CURRICULUM, TEACHER HIRING AND OTHER AREAS.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District took to the airwaves Thursday with a  live telecast touting the nation's most ambitious experiment in school  power-sharing, amid complaints by parents that teachers have grabbed the lion's  share of the power.  </P> <P> The teleconference to explain the district's move into the second phase of  school restructuring -- which will broaden the influence of the local  shared-decision-making councils -- drew education experts from around the  country who are eagerly watching Los Angeles to see if this plan can help  revive the nation's ailing public education system.  </P> <P> It also attracted a protest from about 50 parents, who marched outside the  district-operated television station near downtown while the show aired. The  protesters carried placards complaining that parents have not been given equal  status on the leadership councils that will ultimately run each school.  </P> <P> The power-sharing councils were formed as part of the settlement of last May's  nine-day teachers' strike. Each school has elected a council of six to 16  members, with half the seats held by teachers and the remaining spots divided  among parents, community members, the school principal and other school  employees.  </P> <P> The second phase, called School-Based Management, begins Monday. Under it,  schools can apply to broaden their influence beyond the five limited areas  covered by the plan thus far, and can initiate fundamental changes in areas  such as curriculum and teacher hiring and assignment.  </P> <P> So far, most of the changes made by the councils have been rather mundane:  Lunch and recess schedules have been changed, first-graders allowed to perform  in the school talent show, teachers granted access to copying machines.  </P> <P> But for the up to 70 schools that will be chosen to move into the School-Based  Management phase next fall, the chance is at hand to make meaningful changes  that will improve student achievement.  </P> <P> Schools could hold classes into the night and on Saturdays. Grades could be  eliminated in some classes. Businesses could be invited on campus to teach  entrepreneurial skills. And the councils could reorganize to include more  parents.  </P> <P> Each school council will have a chance to devise its own plan to restructure to  better meet the needs of its students.  </P> <P> Already, parents at many schools are agitating for equal representation with  teachers on the decision-making councils. Some parents have complained that  teachers have been more concerned with improving their own working conditions  than student achievement -- the ultimate aim of the restructuring program.  </P> <P> "The (teachers) union is running the program to their own benefit," said Bea  Stotzer, PTA president at Kester Avenue Elementary in Van Nuys, who is not a  member of the school's elected council and has been at odds with the group.  </P> <P> But teachers' union Vice President Helen Bernstein, who helped negotiate the  shared-decision-making pact, said working conditions must be improved before  the councils can move on to bigger issues.  </P> <P> "In a way, only the teachers, who have been directly involved with those  problems, have an interest," she acknowledged. "But first you take care of  who's monitoring the halls and what times the bells will ring, then you get  beyond that and get down the real hard issues."  </P> <P> On Thursday, children were sent home early and principals and teachers -- and a  sprinkling of parents -- gathered in each school to view the telecast on  Channel 58 during which the second phase of the power-sharing plan was  explained. Viewers could phone in questions to a panel of district and union  officials.  </P> <P> Most of those questions were from teachers and many concerned such issues as  how schools would finance the changes and how the process would affect future  contract negotiations with the district.  </P> <P> Though the district's shared-decision-making process is already 8 months old,  many teachers' queries Thursday seemed to reflect a lack of understanding about  just how it is supposed to be working and skepticism about what it can  accomplish and whether it has district support.  </P> <P> At Belmont High School, west of downtown, about 200 faculty members, joined by  a few parents and students, crowded into a large third-floor classroom to watch  the telecast.  </P> <P> Most listened attentively -- though a few dozed through portions of the  90-minute telecast and others expressed skepticism at the upbeat presentation  of the upcoming changes.  </P> <P> Teacher Elizabeth Sawyer, who sits on Belmont's council, said parents, teachers  and the principal are "really working well together" in the shared  decision-making process, and parent participation is high, despite the fact  that three-fourths of Belmont's 4,100 students are foreign-born and 80  languages resound in its hallways.  </P> <P> At other schools, however, Spanish-speaking parents have complained that -- in  a district where nearly a third of the students speak little or no English --  they have been shut out of the process because meetings and materials are often  not translated.  </P> <P> Thursday's broadcast was only in English, though a repeat of the program  Thursday night was accompanied by a Spanish radio simulcast. The television  program will be repeated over the district's station at 3 p.m. Sunday, but only  in English.  </P> <P> After the broadcast, school board President Jackie Goldberg acknowledged that  the district has to do more to involve parents in the power-sharing plan.  </P> <P> "It is one of our most difficult challenges," she said. "We have a  multi-ethnic, multi-linguistic population. But we have to keep trying, we have  to keep reaching out to these parents, with translators and whatever else it  takes."  </P> <P> Because schools can only apply to move into the school-based management phase  if two-thirds of the faculty and a majority of the parents at a school agree,  it is necessary that parents support the leadership council if the program is  to succeed, she said.  </P> <P> "They won't support something they don't understand. If they don't want it and  if they don't agree with it, they can stop it," she said.  </P> <P> Schools have until April 20 to apply to expand their restructuring program, and  a central council and district officials will decide by the summer which  schools can put their new plans in place this fall.  </P> <P> The process is a difficult one -- schools must show that their  shared-decision-making councils are working well and have the support of the  school and community. They must explain the rationale behind the changes they  propose and how they will improve student achievement. And they must devise  ways to measure that achievement.  </P> <P> Some of those changes may run counter to district policy or even violate  teachers' contracts, but waivers could be granted by the central council or  school board.  </P> <P> Because the step is such a drastic one, officials estimate that not many of the  district's schools will be ready to move forward this year.  </P> <P> "I don't think we'll have too many applications this year," Goldberg said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Last summer, as a part of its settlement of a teachers strike, the Los Angeles  Unified School District agreed to give parents, teachers and community leaders  greater say in how local schools are run. Each school has elected its own  leadership council and they have been making decisions in areas such as student  discipline, scheduling and use of school equipment. The ultimate aim of the  power-sharing plan is to improve student achievement by restructuring schools  to better meet students' needs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LOS ANGELES' SCHOOL RESTRUCTURING PLAN  </P> <P>  Los Angeles Unified schools are being restructured to better serve the needs  of students. This can take many forms and include such steps as redesigning  curriculum and class schedules, hiring outside consultants to provide special  courses or establishing ungraded classrooms. In Los Angeles, the restructuring  plan has two phases:  </P> <P> Phase 1 is shared decision-making, which began last July with the election of  school councils. Most schools will remain in this phase for several years. It  allows parents, teachers, staff and community leaders to make decisions in  specific areas that were formerly the purview of principals and central  administration. In the Los Angeles district, those decisions are made by  consensus, with proposals tailored to win everyone's support, rather than by a  vote of decision-making council members.  </P> <P> Phase 2 is school-based management, under which parents, teachers, principals,  staff and community representatives can make fundamental changes in virtually  every area of school operation -- including budget, teacher hiring and  assignment and curriculum and teaching methods -- with approval of the school  board. Up to 70 schools can begin the school-based management process this  fall, once their proposals for change are approved next month.  </P></p>

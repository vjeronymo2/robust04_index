While the  people across the province were celebrating their festival,  Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee;  Governor Ye Liansong; Li Zhanshu, member of the provincial party  standing committee; and Guo Hongqi, vice governor of the  province, inspected markets in the seat of Yuanshi County.  Riding in the same bus for the inspection tours were leading  personnel from Shijiazhuang city and responsible comrades from  the provincial industry and commerce bureau, the provincial  grains bureau, and the provincial commodity price bureau.    At 0830 yesterday Cheng Weigao said to the accompanied  personnel as soon as he got on the bus: Our inspection emphasis  will be concentrated on the problem of injecting water into  meat. Ye Liansong said: Regardless, injecting water into pork  or chicken is illegal. Cheng Weigao said: He never knows the  water injection of pork and it is a really fantastic story.  Injecting water into pork means to replace meat with water and  to use trickery. Such cases must be strictly handled as soon as  they have been exposed.    At about 0900 that day, the bus arrived at the seat of  Yuanshi County. Cheng Weigao, Ye Liansong, and the accompanied  personnel walked along the street after they were off of the bus  and inspected, one by one, the stands and shops on both sides of  the street. When inspecting the pork markets, Cheng Weigao and  Ye Liansong held talks with the butcher, named (Cui Kou), who is  more than 60 years old and has been in the meat business over  the past twelve years. All meat he has sold is from his own  hogs and bought by him from outside places. He was not aware of  the inspection conducted by the provincial leadership. Cheng  Weigao asked him whether his pork had been injected with water.  While continuously chopping his meat, (Cui Kou) answered: No,  no, I never do that and never do things mean. Ye Liansong asked  him whether he has bought diseased hogs. (Cui Kou) said: I  have bought two hogs of that kind. Ye Liansong asked how he  handled them and whether he had sold them. He stopped chopping  his meat this time, (Cui Kou) said: Such pork must not be sold  and I have handled all of them. I would lose a family fortune  if such a sale were exposed.    After consecutively inspecting several meat stands and  shops,  the leading personnel discovered no meat with injected water and  the meat prices were relatively rational.    After leaving the meat markets, Cheng Weigao and other  personnel went into a meat foodstuffs center run by a couple  whose boss is called (Zhang Liguo). After inquiring about the  channels of ordering goods, pork prices, and profit situation,  Cheng Weigao said to him: Being the managers of an  individually run business, you should first pay attention to  stressing professional ethics, food sanitation, and credit.    On the afternoon that day, leading personnel including Cheng  Weigao entered the first grains and cooking oil center under the  Yuanshi County Grains Storehouse just as soon as its doors were  opened. They discovered a plate with rational prices of grains  and cooking oil and were satisfied with the center's genuine  goods at a fair price.    After their inspection activities, Cheng Weigao and Ye  Liansong were interviewed by the reporters. Cheng Weigao said:  Today is New Year's Day. During the new year the central  authorities will accelerate their pace in reform that is aimed  at developing productive forces and upgrading the people's  living standard. Therefore, in conducting reform, units at all  levels should safeguard the vital interest of the people and do  a good job in dealing with the problems that should not occur.  For example, pork has been injected with water and steamed buns  have been cooked with sulfur. All of this has been caused by  the bureaucracy. There are almost 1,000 personnel in the  Shijiazhuang city industry and commerce bureau and how could  these personnel fail to successfully deal with these problems?  He declared on the spot that we will find the industry and  commerce bureau to blame for the recurrence of such problems and  that will prove that leadership has not performed its duties  totally and effectively.

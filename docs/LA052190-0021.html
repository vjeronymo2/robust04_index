			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EDGAR MARTINEZ ALSO GETS KEY HITS FOR SEATTLE  </P> <P> At 20, Ken Griffey Jr. has already experienced much success at the major league  level. His Seattle teammate, Edgar Martinez, 27, has had a difficult time even  making it in the majors.  </P> <P> Griffey and Martinez both had big games Sunday at Cleveland to lead the  Mariners to an 8-7 victory in 10 innings.  </P> <P> They both hit two home runs. Martinez hit his second of the game and fifth of  the season after Griffey singled in the 10th, and it gave Seattle a big enough  lead so that Sandy Alomar's homer in the bottom of the inning left the Indians  a run short.  </P> <P> Martinez also tripled and singled in five at-bats to raise his average to .358.  Griffey, who has nine home runs, raised his league-leading average to .375.  </P> <P> It has been a struggle for Martinez, a third baseman. He began his pro career  at Class-A Bellingham, Wash., in 1983. This is his fourth attempt to become a  regular for the Mariners.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago he made four errors in one game to tie an American League record  shared by 21 other third basemen. He had the sympathy of his manager, Jim  Lefebvre, who performed the same feat at third when he played for the Dodgers.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 5, Oakland 2 -- Chris Bosio pitched a four-hitter at Milwaukee and  the Athletics lost for the sixth time in eight games.  </P> <P> Although the Athletics still lead the West by 2 1/2 games, they have lost their  aura of invincibility.  </P> <P> Dave Parker, who played a major role in the Athletics' drive to the world  championship last season, delivered the big hit in the five-run fourth that  broke it open. He drove in two runs with a bases-loaded single.  </P> <P> Bosio was 3-0 in five April starts with a 1.39 earned-run average, but went  into this game with an 0-2 record and a 4.09 ERA in three May starts.  </P> <P> Oakland Manager Tony La Russa was ejected for the first time this season in the  fourth inning. La Russa was tossed by home plate umpire Jim Joyce for arguing  ball and strike calls.  </P> <P> The Brewers lead the East by 2 1/2 games.  </P> <P> Detroit 3, Chicago 2 -- Cecil Fielder, who hit his 16th home run in the fourth  inning, singled in the 10th to set up the winning run at Chicago.  </P> <P> Fielder's single put Dave Bergman on second with two out and Lloyd Moseby sent  Bergman home with a single.  </P> <P> The Tigers have won six in a row, including three to sweep the White Sox.  </P> <P> Mike Henneman pitched a hitless 10th to earn his 10th save in 11 chances.  </P> <P> Minnesota 5, Boston 4 -- Oakland's skid has enabled the Twins to move to within  four games of first place in the West.  </P> <P> Kent Hrbek hit the right-field foul pole, just 302 feet away in Fenway Park,  for a two-run home run in the fifth inning to snap a 2-2 tie.  </P> <P> The Twins 13 of the last 17 games. Roy Smith settled down from a rocky start to  get his second victory in six decisions. Rick Aguilera got the last four outs  for his 11th save.  </P> <P> Baltimore 4, Texas 0 -- About the only disappointment for the Orioles during  their successful 1989 season was pitcher Pete Harnisch. The right-hander,  expected to become a star, pitched so poorly that he wound up in the minors.  </P> <P> Harnisch is making up for it this season. He held the Rangers to two hits in  seven innings at Baltimore to improve his record to 4-1.  </P> <P> Mickey Tettleton hit his third home run in four games. In the last five games,  Tettleton is 11 for 14 and has raised his average from .167 to .245.  </P> <P> Gregg Olson pitched the last two innings for his ninth save.  </P> <P> Kansas City 4, New York 3 -- When sliding home with the winning run Saturday at  New York, Steve Sax hurt his ankle and had to skip this one.  </P> <P> The Yankees could have used their sparkplug in this one.  </P> <P> In 10 innings, the Yankees were outhit, 17-2, but their second hit of the game  was a two-run home run by Don Mattingly in the ninth to tie the score, 3-3.  </P> <P> The Royals won it with three singles in the 10th. Kevin Seitzer had the third  hit with two out to drive in the winning run.  </P> <P> Storm Davis of the Royals gave the Yankees just one hit before leaving in the  eighth. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHAEL OAKESHOTT; POLITICS PHILOSOPHER  </P> <P> Political philosopher Michael Oakeshott, whose stress on personal  responsibility and freedom was said by some to have laid the foundations for  Margaret Thatcher's social policies, has died at 89.  </P> <P> Oakeshott died Tuesday at his home at Acton in southwest England, his family  announced Saturday.  </P> <P> No cause of death was given.  </P> <P> In 1951, when he became University Professor of Political Science at London  University's London School of Economics, his conservative ideas were a sharp  contrast with socialist Harold Laski, whom he replaced.  </P> <P> Oakeshott was credited with turning conservative opinion away from social  planning and back to personal responsibility and freedom.  </P> <P> The Times of London noted Saturday: "More than anybody else Michael Oakeshott  articulated the real philosophical foundations of Mrs. Thatcher's policies. Yet  he had no direct influence on her and she was disposed to consider him  irrelevant for her purposes because unlike Hayek, he made no practical  recommendations."  </P> <P> Mrs. Thatcher claimed that her philosophy of individual self-reliance was  influenced by the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek and his 1944 book "The  Road to Serfdom," a critical study of socialistic trends in Britain.  </P> <P> Oakeshott once said in an interview: "I am a member of no political party. I  vote, if I have to vote, for the party which is likely to do the least harm. To  that extent, I am a Tory."  </P> <P> Oakeshott's books included "Experience and Its Modes," published in 1933, and  "The Voice of Liberal Learning," which came out last year.  </P></p>

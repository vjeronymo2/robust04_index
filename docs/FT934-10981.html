			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Standards authority faces criticism PLANS BY the British Standards Institution to make sweeping changes to its constitution are expected to provoke a heated debate at its annual meeting tomorrow, Charles Batchelor writes. BSI, which co-ordinates the writing of standards for British industry, has announced plans to give stronger executive powers to its board, and to modify its charter and by-laws to give the board greater freedom to increase directors' fees and to award directors additional payments for duties carried out beyond their normal board responsibilities. The proposed changes have prompted criticisms that BSI's board is seeking exceptional powers to the detriment of its members, the 29,500 companies and individuals who use its standards. Mr Michael Sanderson, BSI chief executive until he resigned in June following a disagreement over policies and management, said the changes proposed were against the recommendations on good corporate governance proposed by the Cadbury committee. They would reduce the powers of ordinary members, he said. Mr Vivian Thomas, non-executive chairman, said BSI's board had to respond rapidly when Mr Sanderson resigned. 'We faced a stark choice. We just didn't have the time to take a six-month holiday from executive action.' BSI plans to recruit a chief executive next year but until then its affairs are being run by an executive board of three, headed by Mr Thomas. Mr Thomas said the changes to give the board greater powers to decide its own remuneration would also bring it more into line with normal corporate practice.</p>

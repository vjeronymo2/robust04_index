			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "USDP: `We Are Waiting for Salutary </F> Legislation'"]    [Text] The Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party [USDP]  believes that the new Supreme Council body is a step forward --  the parliament was joined by outstanding activists of the  national democratic movement, leading economists, lawyers,  experts in many branches, and statesmen. For the first time,  legislators include Ukrainian nationalists who are the people of  the future. At the same time, the session of the USDP Grand  Council, which was held recently, posed an anxious question:  With what will the new parliament begin? In this connection,  participants in the session adopted an appeal to people's  deputies which recounts "emergency" bills or, to be more  precise, salutary bills for our economy and state.    In the first place, these include a law on equal trade of  products with Russia, a law on progressive taxes, and a law on  stopping profiteering off "cheap" Ukrainian goods on  international markets. The USDP supports those experts who  believe that it is necessary to temporarily cancel all quotas  and licenses save one -- on internal consumption, that is, to  ban exports of state commodities and property by commercial  structures. According to peasant democrats, the new parliament  has to stop the activity of those "joint ventures" which work  only for the export of goods abroad. They think it is extremely  necessary to adopt a law on private property, which would  provide for the preservation of reasonable state control, and to  launch obligatory privatization in the sphere of trade and  consumer services.    Such "emergency" laws, the appeal notes, are intended to  create a state budget and abolish destructive economic scissors,  that is, the situation in which commercial structures are able  to plunder the state, while the state, in its turn, robs the  people -- in the first place, industrial workers, pensioners,  and, particularly, peasants. Only after the economy is  stabilized, will one be able to introduce the hryvna [Ukrainian  currency], form a government, and set about on a  still-more-difficult task -- the promulgation of a new  constitution. In the unanimous opinion of the USDP Grand  Council, the new parliament should not start with the  promulgation of a new constitution, notwithstanding the nudges  from reactionary forces and even some democrats, as well as  President Kravchuk himself. Supreme Council deputies differ in  their views very much, therefore discussion on a draft  constitution may provoke a permanent and fruitless political  argument. "People's deputies will argue, while, without a  budget, the state will go to pieces." Whereas the budget is an  issue, on which "leftists, rightists, and centrists may come to  terms."    The USDP also appeals to the Supreme Council to not postpone  presidential elections. "One more day of L. Kravchuk in his  presidential post,'" the appeal notes, "is one more blow to  Ukraine, one more step back to neocolonialism."    The appeal was signed by USDP Chairman Serhiy Plachynda,  Deputy Chairman Orest Barabash, academician at the Ukrainian  Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and Vasyl Shust, member of the  Grand Council and a farmer.</p>

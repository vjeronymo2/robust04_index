			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row over cuts in military reserve FRESH controversy over cuts in Britain's military strength was stirred up yesterday after the government announced a reduction of more than 4,000 in the country's volunteer reserve forces. Measures announced in the Commons by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, involve cutting naval reserves by more than half, with a smaller reduction in RAF part-time forces. The number of volunteer reserve organisations will be reduced to five with the scrapping of the 2,700-strong Royal Naval Auxiliary Service. In addition, the Royal Naval Reserve, already cut from 5,900 to 4,700 under the Options for Change programme, is to lose a further 1,200 posts. Its squadron of River Class minesweepers, which Mr Rifkind said had been overtaken by advances in mine technology, will be withdrawn. The defence secretary said RNR personnel would be able to serve on more modern minehunters and announced plans to allow more reservists to join Royal Navy ships. The naval cuts will affect almost 300 civilian jobs. Mr Rifkind said not all would be found alternative work. The RAF's 1,800-strong volunteer bodies - the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the smaller RAF Volunteer Reserve - are to lose about 180 posts. Mr Rifkind - who also raised the possibility of Territorial Army soldiers volunteering to join regular army deployments - came under fire from his own backbenchers. Mr Julian Brazier, Tory MP for Canterbury, said territorial soldiers would be put in 'an impossible position' with their employers if they were asked to volunteer for assignments rather than being called out. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, asked how much money the proposals would save. He added: 'At the back of our mind, many of us feel that this is not a strategic decision based on defence requirements' but was rather based on the Treasury's decision to screw money out of the Ministry of Defence.</p>

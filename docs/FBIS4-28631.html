			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government expressed regret Saturday over the underground  nuclear test China conducted in the Xinjiang-Uygur Autonomous  Region on Friday.    In an official statement, the Foreign Ministry said it was  regrettable that China had again carried out a nuclear test at a  time when all other major nuclear powers are refraining from  conducting such tests and as active negotiations have been  underway for a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) since  January.    The Chinese test does not contribute to efforts to maintain  international peace, it said.    The South Korean Government urges all nations that possess  nuclear weapons to stop testing nuclear devices to ensure early  conclusion of the CTBT, and to refrain from undertaking any  action that may have a negative impact on the nuclear  nonproliferation regime, the statement said.</p>

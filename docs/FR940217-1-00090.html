			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are those resulting from statutory requirements and those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs effectively and efficiently. Burdens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically associated with information collection requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the heading  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations justify the costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Department in complying with the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient administration of the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of small entities. The small entities that would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by these regulations are small institutions of higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education; small organizations that contract with educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions to administer aspects of the institutions'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs; and small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations that contract with lenders or guaranty agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer aspects of the lenders' or agencies' participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FFEL programs. However, the regulations would not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant economic impact on these small entities because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 668.13, 668.23, 668.25, 668.90, 668.96, 668.113,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 682.414, 682.416, and 682.711 contain information collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Educational institutions that are public or nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions or businesses or other for-profit institutions may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. State entities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit institutions, businesses or other for-profit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations, or individuals may contract with educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions to administer aspects of the institutions'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the programs and may contract with lenders and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agencies to administer aspects of the lenders' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies' participation in the FFEL programs. Individuals may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply for student financial assistance under the programs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Education needs and uses the information to enable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary to determine whether the States, institutions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations, businesses, and individuals comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for eligibility and participation in the programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the collection of information proposed in these regulations is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to be 2,786 hours, including the time for searching  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completing and reviewing the collection of information, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitting materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the information collection requirements should direct them to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Daniel J.

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Letter: Independence would put principle at risk Sir, Peter Norman's call for an open debate on the independence of the Bank of England (Economics Notebook, January 4) is all the more pressing given that the UK government remains without a credible, medium-term framework for economic policy three months after sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism. What has passed for debate so far has been little more than the populist assertion that politicians cannot be trusted to stand above their narrow political interests. This insidious precept implies the electorate cannot be trusted to make choices in its own interests. If the electorate is so incompetent at making choices, why stop at an independent monetary policy; why not an independent fiscal policy too? Certain characteristics of monetary policy lead many to suggest that it deserves special treatment. However, independence must be seen to pass stringent tests of economic performance before being adopted. The international evidence remains ambiguous as to the impact of independent monetary policy on easing the burden of disinflation. The country with the best inflation performance among the industrial economies in the past 15 years has one of the least independent central banks - Japan. One of the most dramatic disinflations in the industrial world in the 1980s occurred in a country notorious for politically motivated monetary policy - the UK. In 1992, the independent Riksbank in Sweden was unable to maintain its Ecu link in the grip of intense currency speculation, while this year the G3 country generally forecast to score highest on the 'misery index' (unemployment plus inflation) has the most independent of central banks  - Germany. Monetary policy independence is no panacea. The evidence suggests that, on its own, central bank independence is neither a sufficient nor a necessary ingredient of economic success. Independence, then, appears to offer little compensation for the abandonment of an important principle of democratic accountability in public policy.

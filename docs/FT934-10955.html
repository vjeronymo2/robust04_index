			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Pay tribunal runs out of patience AN industrial tribunal has taken the unusual step of ordering a company to speed up its response to an equal-pay claim. Vauxhall Motors has been told by the Bedford industrial tribunal to respond by the end of the month to an independent report into an equal-pay claim by sewing machinists at the company's Luton plant. The company said last night that it had offered to respond at the end of December. The TGWU general union said it was 'delighted' that a timescale had been set. The Equal Opportunities Commission argues that equal pay laws are ineffective because of the complexity and length of cases which puts off many potential applicants.</p>

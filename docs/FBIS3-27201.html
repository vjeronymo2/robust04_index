			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Qin Wenjun Says Sino-British Talks Are a Matter </F> Between the Two Governments; Hong Kong Government Has No Right  To Publish Contents of Talks"]    [Text] Qin Wenjun, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong  Branch, pointed out yesterday: The Sino-British talks on the  1994- 95 electoral arrangements are a matter between the Chinese  and British Governments. If the Hong Kong Government wants to  publish the contents of the talks, this should be conducted  through diplomatic channels. It should not violate the  principle of confidentiality agreed upon by the two governments.    Qin attended the "Hong Kong United Association for the  Advancement of Feminism in All Walks of Life" Spring Festival  get-together yesterday evening. When asked by reporters about  the British Hong Kong Government's claim that it would publish  the contents of the 17 rounds of Sino-British talks, he said:  On this issue the British Hong Kong Government should  understand three points: First, the Sino-British talks on the  1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements are a matter between the  Chinese and British Governments and the Hong Kong Government has  no right whatsoever to publish the contents of Sino-British  talks; second, at the beginning of the talks, the Chinese and  British Governments agreed on a common principle--the principle  of confidentiality, and the Hong Kong Government should take  this into consideration prudently; and third, if the Hong Kong  Government wants to publish the contents of Sino- British talks,  this should be conducted through diplomatic channels. Qin  stressed: If the Hong Kong Government unilaterally publishes  the contents of the talks, it will violate the principle agreed  upon by the two governments and he asked that the Hong Kong  Government take a prudent attitude.    Regarding the appointment of the third group of Hong Kong  affairs advisers, Qin said: It is hoped that the list of the  third group of Hong Kong affairs advisers can be made public in  March. He said: We hope to expand, as far as possible, the  channel for soliciting the views of Hong Kong people and unite  with Hong Kong compatriots to ensure a stable transition for  Hong Kong.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Pledge by leaders at Ulster talks NORTHERN Ireland leaders yesterday pledged to try to make speedy progress towards finding an acceptable formula for governing the province. After more than four hours of talks in Belfast they issued a joint statement underlining their commitment to the inter-party talks process. Unionist leaders Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, Alliance leader Dr John Alderdice and Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, met for their first substantive exchange of views since Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, halted the first round of negotiations eight months ago. A business committee has been set up to look after the day-to-day running of meetings. The four leaders will not meet today and the process will be suspended as soon as the general election is called. Yesterday's meeting was understood to have concentrated on the timetables and composition of delegations to be used in the coming weeks.</p>

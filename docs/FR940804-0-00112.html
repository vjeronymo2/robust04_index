			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two Department of Justice components commented that the definition of ``attorney for the government,'' which explicitly covers attorneys employed in the six main divisions of the Department, should be amended to cover all attorneys working in the legal offices of the various Department agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Department agrees that the definition of ``attorney for the government'' should not distinguish between attorneys employed in the Department's divisions and attorneys employed in the Department's agencies, given that both sets of attorneys exercise similar functions and responsibilities with respect to criminal investigations and prosecutions. Accordingly, the definition of ``attorney for the government'' has been modified to include explicitly ``the Chief Counsel of the DEA and any attorney employed in that office, the General Counsel of the FBI and any attorney employed in that office or in the Legal Counsel Division of the FBI, and, in addition, any attorney employed in, or head of, any other legal office in a Department of Justice agency.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Civil Law Enforcement Investigation.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This term includes any investigation of potential civil violations of, or claims under, federal law that may form the basis of a civil law enforcement proceeding, as defined in paragraph 77.2(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Civil Law Enforcement Proceeding.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``civil law enforcement proceeding'' encompasses a variety of activities beyond the particular areas identified in the definition, which are intended only to be illustrative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exclusion of proceedings related to the enforcement of an administrative subpoena or summons or a civil investigative demand (CID) is intended to ensure that the filing of such a proceeding does not trigger the limitations of section 77.5, which generally prohibits  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  communications once adversary proceedings have commenced against a represented ``party.'' Thus, the filing by the United States of a proceeding to enforce a subpoena, summons, or CID will not prohibit further investigatory communications regarding the underlying substantive violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final sentence of paragraph 77.2(c)(2) ensures that the United States need not be the plaintiff in order for a civil action to be ``brought by the United States,'' but may be a counterclaimant or cross-claimant if the counterclaim or cross-claim otherwise fits within the description of civil law enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cooperating witness or individual.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A ``cooperating witness or individual'' is defined to include informants, witnesses, and other persons who are not law enforcement agents, but only to the extent that such a person is acting ``to assist the government in an undercover or confidential capacity.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Employee. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' The term ``employee'' is not limited to its literal meaning, but also includes officers, directors, partners, members, and trustees.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &sect;77.10 (communications involving organizations). An independent contractor would not be considered an ``employee'' for purposes of these rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Organization. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' The term ``organization'' includes any corporation, partnership, association, joint-stock company, union, trust, pension fund, unincorporated organization, state or local government or political subdivision thereof, or non-profit organization. It does not, of course, include groups of individuals ``associated in fact'' within the meaning of the racketeering statutes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  18 U.S.C. 1961(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Communications with organizations and their employees are governed generally by section 77.10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Person.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``person'' includes individuals and organizations as defined in paragraph 77.2(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Undercover investigation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' Under this definition, the hallmark of an ``undercover operation'' is an investigation in which an individual ``whose identity as an official of the government or a person acting at the behest thereof is concealed or is intended to be concealed.'' This definition is intended to be read broadly to include every type of law enforcement investigation in which the identity of a government employee, or the fact that an individual is cooperating with the government, is concealed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 77.3: Represented Party; Represented Person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section differentiates between a represented ``party'' and a represented ``person.'' This distinction is fully consistent with the language of and principles underlying DR 7&hyph;104(a)(1) and Model Rule 4.2, which establish general prohibitions against  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contacts with a represented ``party.'' Section 77.5 of this part generally prohibits government attorneys from initiating  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contacts with represented parties, but does not prohibit  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contacts with represented persons. (However, sections 77.8 and 77.9 also prohibit certain contacts with represented persons).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An individual is considered to be a ``represented party'' under paragraph 77.3(a) if: (1) the person is represented by counsel; (2) the representation is current  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  concerns the subject matter in question;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (3) the person has either been arrested or charged in a federal criminal case or is a defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding concerning the subject matter of the representation. If the person is currently represented in fact regarding the subject matter in question, but has not been charged or arrested, that person is considered a ``represented person.'' Thus, witnesses, suspects, and targets of investigations who have not been indicted or arrested, but are represented regarding the subject matter in question, are considered represented persons under this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters argued that this section's basic distinction between represented ``persons'' and represented ``parties'' runs counter to the policy considerations underlying DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2. However, as discussed in the ``General Comments'' section, this distinction is consistent with the vast majority of federal court opinions interpreting DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2., as well as the text of those rules. Furthermore, this distinction is grounded in logic and common sense, given the legitimate necessity for attorneys for the government to be able to direct agents and cooperating witnesses to contact represented persons during undercover investigations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

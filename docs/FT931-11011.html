			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses climb as Bundesbank caves in THE Bundesbank's decision to announce a late cut in interest rates, while it supported an earlier, Italian rate cut, was not met with unanimous acclaim, writes Our Markets Staff. Politicians and stock market traders seemed to like it. The French finance ministry said that it was a gesture which should help stabilise the EMS; and the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index moved from a gain of just 3.93 at noon to one of 16.32, to 1,113.35, at the close. However, German businessmen worried about the new threat that the rates decision implies to price stability, and some of their stockbroking counterparts criticised Bundesbank council members for saying one thing, and doing another. FRANKFURT did little before the Buba news, closing the official session with the DAX index just 0.08 higher at 1,601.61 in turnover up from DM6.6bn to DM7.1bn, but it reacted manfully in the post-bourse with indications of a 0.75 point percentage gain in the late afternoon. Domestic analysts and strategists had their reservations, saying that this was the second time that the Bundesbank had caved in to political pressure, and that its method of doing so made the council sound more like politicians than central bankers. There was a case, they said, for expecting dollar-sensitive shares, and the interest rate-sensitive banks to rise tomorrow. In the meantime, Allianz, the insurer, reflected its strong beta factor, exaggerating the market move with a 1 1/2 per cent gain in London post bourse trading; but MAN, with its truckmaking interests, was more concerned with the Daf debacle as it fell another DM6 to DM284. PARIS did not get all that it wanted and the CAC-40 index came back from a high of 1,869.01, up 2.5 per cent in mid-afternoon, to close 30.24 or 1.7 per cent better at 1,854.38. Mr John Fordyce of Ferri International said that the bourse took the view that the Bundesbank had done only a little over the minimum - but that this should be still be enough to bring French interest rates down, too. Money piled into interest rate sensitive stocks as market turnover climbed again, from FFr3.45bn to a 'colossal' FFr4.7bn. In financials, Cie Bancaire rose FFr23, or 5 per cent, to FFr464 in 200,000 shares and Axa rose FFr30 to FFr1,150 after FFr1,159. Other features included Matra-Hachette, up FFr5 to FFr109, or 15 per cent for the week so far, on buying enhanced by the American appeal of the media and defence group. MILAN took heart at the opening from a rate cut of its own - the Bank of Italy's decision to cut discount rate by half a percentage point to 11 1/2 per cent - and the mood was enhanced late in the trading day by speculation about the Bundesbank move. The Comit index ended 7.15 higher at 498.14. Analysts were heartened by the timing of the Italian cut which demonstrated, they said, that the Bank of Italy was taking a lead in setting its own rates, rather than holding on to the coat tails of the Bundesbank. The German cut, however, would leave the way open for another cut soon. Montedison added L93 to L1,240 amid continuing speculation that it would soon sell its Farmitalia Carlo Erba pharmaceuticals unit to Kabi Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical arm of Sweden's Propcordia. Fondiaria firmed L2,037 to L30,990 on further expectations of a reorganisation of the group. AMSTERDAM ended mixed, but higher it was at midday. The CBS Tendency index finished 0.9 lower at 95.9 after exposure to more gloomy corporate news. Daf was suspended from trading again, this time on the unofficial, 'punishment bench' section of the market for part of the afternoon session. The bourse gave no reason, but the announcement came after the company said that agreement had been reached between banks and the Dutch government on short-term bridging finance to allow its Eindhoven plant to carry on working. The shares moved 15 cents ahead to Fl 1.95 in active turnover of more than 2m shares. KLM fell Fl 2 in the immediate aftermath of announcing third quarter losses of Fl 437.8m. However, the shares picked up later to end 20 cents higher at Fl 195.90 when it became clear that the figures included a Fl 305m charge against KLM's Northwest Airlines stake. Fokker continued its decline but picked up from a day's low of Fl 8.10 to finish Fl 1.50 lower Fl 8.70, amid concern that Germany's Deutsche Aerospace would press for new terms if it were to go ahead with the plan to acquire a majority stake. In the chemicals sector, DSM dipped Fl 3.90 to Fl 72.30 on market rumours that the company would cut or omit its 1992 dividend. The company said later that no decision on the dividend had yet been reached. ZURICH ended steady, apparently not overly impressed by the German rate cut. Prices opened easier amid some profit-taking but the SMI index erased the early losses to close 3.1 higher at 2,123.7. COPENHAGEN's KFX index closed 0.77 higher at 86.17 in spite of a slight dip from 86.34 at the end of the day on the Bundesbank news, and the receding possibility of a the Danish crown devaluation which had taken equities higher in the first place. Turnover was high at DKr1.4bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- February 4  THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1103.90  1103.86   1103.30  1100.96 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1178.43  1175.84   1176.08  1173.90                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1105.79  1113.80   1113.59  1113.35 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1176.20  1184.63   1184.63  1183.60  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Feb 3     Feb 2     Feb 1    Jan 29   Jan 28 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1097.03   1089.43   1088.01   1079.18   1072.70 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1171.25   1155.59   1158.83   1148.15   1148.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1114.59; 200 - 1186.70 Low/day: 100 - 1099.72  200 - 1173.14.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

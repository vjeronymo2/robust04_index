			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir  yesterday presented Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres with the  ministry's working plan for 1994. The plan for the first time  sets goals for the ministry's units and Israel's representations  abroad. The most prominent political goal is the establishment  of full relations between Israel and Muslim countries:  Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, and Pakistan -- in Asia;  Tanzania, Senegal, and Djibouti -- in Africa; and the North  African and Gulf countries of the Middle East. The Foreign  Ministry aspires to establish normalization and economic  relations even before full diplomatic relations are established.    Political sources have said that it is important that ties  with the large Muslim countries be established before  negotiations on the future of Jerusalem start. Progress in  establishing ties with the Muslim and regional countries will  depend on progress on and the implementation of the agreement  with the PLO and the peace negotiations on the other tracks.    The plan sets two economic goals for the Foreign Ministry:  Reducing trade deficit between Israel and the European  countries, and fortifying the spread of Israeli economic  representatives around the world, with a focus on East Asia.  Negotiations on drafting the new agreement between Israel and  the EC will begin next month, according to the mandate the EC  Council issued in December.    The plan urges increasing the incorporation of the private  sector in economic activity abroad, and calls on Israel's  representatives abroad to assist in the establishment of ties  between Israeli and foreign businessmen to give trade a boost.

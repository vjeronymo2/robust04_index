The LDP which won over 20 percent of the vote in this  month's  elections, more than any other party, will hold 60 seats in the  new Russian parliament.    The LDP proposes that the trial over members of the 1991  coup  attempt be ceased and criminal charges lifted against anyone  taking part in this October's events including the siege and  defence of the White House and other facilities.    It also wants leaders of the parliamentary revolt, now at  Moscow's Lefortovo prison, to be placed under house arrest with  some of them barred from any political activity for a period of  three years.    The measure must be seen as a step on the way to public  unity, the LDP statement says.</p>

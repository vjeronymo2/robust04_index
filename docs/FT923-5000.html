			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Johnston Press buys Sussex publisher JOHNSTON PRESS, the Edinburgh-based publishing group, plans to add to its stable of newspaper titles south of the border with the acquisition of TR Beckett, the Sussex-based newspaper group which publishes seven paid-for local weekly newspapers and three free distribution titles. Johnston, which also announced a 25 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 3.88m), has agreed to acquire a 91.85 per cent stake in Beckett for Pounds 11.95m in cash, shares and loan notes. The remaining Beckett shareholders will be offered the same deal, valuing the company at about Pounds 13m. Beckett shareholders include Emap, the UK media group with a 37.1 per cent stake, and the Hale family with a 15.5 per cent stake. They will receive 1.08m Johnston shares, Pounds 7.75m in cash from the proceeds of a share placement, and Pounds 1.34m in loan notes. In addition, a special dividend of Pounds 2.25m net will be paid by Beckett to its shareholders on October 1. Johnston plans to raise the Pounds 7.75m cash through a placement of 2.5m shares at 310p each. The shares will be offered on the basis of one for every 10.7932 ordinary held. The shares closed up 5p at 333p yesterday. Beckett's main newspaper titles include the Eastbourne Herald and Worthing Herald. Its 1991 pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 1.16m) on turnover of Pounds 9.06m (Pounds 9.51m). The newspaper group has seen both its turnover and profit decline in recent years, a drop blamed on the recession and consequent decline in newspaper advertising revenues. Mr Marco Chiappelli, Johnston's finance director, said that the acquisition fitted the company's strategy of steadily building up its newspaper and media interests. The group already owns 61 titles including the West Sussex County Times which was acquired shortly before the company's stock market flotation in April 1988. Johnston's pre-tax profits increase for the six months to end-June was achieved on turnover up 7.7 per cent to Pounds 33.7m (Pounds 31.3m). The company's cash position continued to improve and at the end of June it had net cash of Pounds 3.76m after taking account of all borrowings. As a result the company lifted the interim dividend from 2p to 2.25p. Earnings per share were 11.6p (9.4p). Mr Fred Johnston, chairman, said the company's performance had been achieved 'through a vigorous programme of cost cutting and operational improvements.' COMMENT The price paid for Beckett may look a little high but Johnston has a good track record of making newspaper acquisitions and squeezing more profits out of them. Underpinning the interim profit increase was a 31 per cent profit rise from its English titles, albeit from a depressed base. Beckett's recent results have been disappointing, but Johnston is expected to cut costs and improve margins quickly. In the longer term it may be able to combine the production facilities for the East and West Sussex titles, generating significant savings. Full-year pre-tax profits are forecast at about Pounds 9m for a prospective p/e of about 15. The shares are good value if Johnston can maintain its acquisition record.</p>

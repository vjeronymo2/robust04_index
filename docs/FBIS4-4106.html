			<p>BFN     [Text] A provincial rural work conference was convened in  Kunming yesterday.    The conference was devoted to profoundly implementing the  spirit of two recently concluded central rural work conferences  in light of the provincial realities; acquiring a clear  understanding of the province's current rural situation and  tasks; emancipating the mind; deepening the ongoing rural  economic structural reform; increasing comprehensive  agricultural strength; pushing ahead with economic growth;  increasing peasants' incomes; maintaining rural stability; and  laying a solid foundation for smooth implementation of each and  every major reform measure and for a sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic growth across the province.    Provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu and  provincial Governor He Zhiqiang both delivered important  speeches at meetings held yesterday morning and afternoon.    In his speech, Secretary Pu Chaozhu first and foremost  analyzed the current excellent rural situation across the  province, saying that the province is now confronted with  another round of drastic industrial structural readjustment. He  emphatically pointed out: Under no circumstances should we  overlook the fundamental position and important role of  agriculture. The basic ideology guiding rural work in the new  historical period should be boiled down to emancipating the  mind; grasping opportunities; deepening reforms; expanding  opening up; promoting development; and maintaining stability.  We should strive to work out new rural reform measures suited  to the ongoing socialist market economic development; embark on  a new road of rural economic development; and resolve such  existing problems plaguing rural economic growth as insufficient  investment in and huge debts regarding farmland capital  construction, water conservancy, communications, electricity  supply, and infrastructure construction. We should devote more  energy to educational, scientific, and technological development  and labor quality improvement in the province's rural,  mountainous, and ethnic minority areas. The leading organs at  and above county level should work out plans and goals aimed at  bringing about a comfortably well-off livelihood and make a  comfortably well-off livelihood a common goal for all.    Speaking of the ongoing profound rural reform, Secretary Pu  Chaozhu pointed out in no uncertain terms: We should strive to  readjust the existing unitary economic structure and ownership  structure; transform the existing rural production and  operational patterns; develop socialized production; reform the  existing rural operational structure; and actively publicize  successful experiences in integrating and unifying three key  links, namely, production, operation, and marketing.    Speaking of the ongoing rural economic growth, Secretary Pu  Chaozhu cautioned against overlooking grain production and  called for continually readjusting rural industrial structure;  fostering superior rural industries; increasing investments in  rural infrastructure facilities construction; actively assisting  township and town enterprises; vigorously pushing ahead with  township and town enterprises development; maintaining the high  development speed seen in the last few years; invigorating the  rural economy with advanced science and technology; expanding  opening up to the outside world; and promoting rural growth by  incessantly opening up to the outside world.    Secretary Pu Chaozhu emphatically noted: A pressing task at  the moment is to mobilize the whole party to make a success of  spring plowing production in order to reap another good  agricultural harvest this year. To this end, we should  earnestly strengthen the party leadership over rural work. The  party committee members with special responsibilities for  different types of work at all levels across the province should  show concern for, find out about, and study rural work;  contribute more to rural development; and guide the people of  all nationalities across Yunnan to achieve a comfortably  well-off livelihood.    Provincial Governor He Zhiqiang delivered at yesterday  afternoon's meeting an important speech in which he pointed out:  Yunnan's rural reform tasks at the moment are as follows:    1.

To mobilize collectives, individual operators, and  private enterprises to jointly harness and exploit barren hills,  slopes, valleys, and shoals across the province and allow  individual operators and private enterprises to contract with  compensation relevant projects for up to 50 or 70 years;    3. To vigorously develop the rural individual and private  economies while consolidating and developing the rural  collective economy; actively implement a joint-stock cooperative  system in the rural areas; transform the enterprise property  rights pattern; and develop commodity production as well as  township and town enterprises;    4. To push ahead with operative structural reform; improve  management methods; develop economic organizations specializing  in simultaneous agricultural, industrial, trade, and scientific  development; and further perfect socialized rural service  systems.

To ensure a sufficient supply of agricultural goods and  materials; purchase sufficient farm and sideline products; and  stop issuing IOUs to peasants;    7. To energetically promote scientific and technological  progress as well as agricultural development by relying on  advanced science and technology;    8. To continually and successfully provide poverty-stricken  areas with all kinds of necessary assistance;    9. To make a success of family planning, improve medical and  health work, and strengthen ecological protection in the rural  areas in a down-to-earth manner;    10.

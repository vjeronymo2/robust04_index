According to our correspondent, the decision was made after  the resolution of the racial discrimination problem in South  Africa, which was realized as a result of the indefatigable  struggles by that country's blacks as well as a decision by the  African Unity Conference and requests by South African Muslims  and political groups, especially Nelson Mandela, and the Front  Line states.    The cabinet has instructed the Foreign Ministry to pave the  way for lifting the trade embargo against that country and  regulating relations between the two countries. [passage omitted]</p>

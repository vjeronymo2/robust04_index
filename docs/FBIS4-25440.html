			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive News": "Qian Qichen Reportedly To Resign March </F> Next Year, His Post To Be Taken Over by Luo Gan"]    [Text] According to well-informed sources in Beijing, the  Chinese top leadership is preparing major personnel changes in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Current Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen may resign from the office in March next year and Luo  Gan, current secretary general of the State Council, may take  over the post. It is also said that Wu Jianmin, current  director of the Foreign Ministry Information Department, will be  transferred to the Netherlands and named Chinese ambassador to  that country. Chen Jian, China's deputy representative to the  United Nations, may take over Wu Jianmin's current post.    The informed sources in Beijing said that Luo Gan has  recently appeared on more diplomatic occasions and that this was  irrelevant to his current duties as secretary general of the  State Council. Therefore, it is believed that the central  leadership is making preparations for transferring him to the  foreign ministry.    However, diplomatic circles in Beijing are doubtful about  the  appointment of Luo Gan as foreign minister. An official who has  good knowledge about the operation of China's foreign affairs  system said that Luo Gan is Premier Li Peng's right-hand man,  but Luo has no foreign affairs experience. It will be difficult  to convince people if he is named foreign minister.    He said: At present, in the State Council, Li Peng takes  charge of foreign affairs. The rumor about the transfer of Luo  Gan to the Foreign Ministry may be related to Li Peng's  intention to strengthen his control over the ministry. As Zhu  Rongji is now in charge of economic affairs in the State  Council, it is normal that Li Peng wants to designate his own  right-hand man to control the Foreign Ministry.    Qian Qichen, who is now rumored to resign from office, is 66  years of age. He was born in Jiading, Jiangsu (now in  Shanghai). He was a second secretary at the Chinese embassy in  the Soviet Union in 1955 and then in succession became director  of the Education Ministry Student Affairs Section, deputy  director of the Education Ministry Foreign Affairs Department,  counsellor at the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union,  ambassador to Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, director of the Foreign  Ministry Information Department, and vice minister of foreign  affairs. In 1988, he became foreign minister and in 1991, he  became state councillor and concurrently foreign minister.  Inside the CPC, he was elected alternate member of the 12th CPC  Central Committee and became full member of the Central  Committee at the party's national conference of party delegates;  at the 13th party congress, he was again elected a member of the  Central Committee; and at the 14th party congress, he was  elected a member of the Central Committee Political Bureau.    Luo Gan, 59, was born in Jinan, Shandong. He was a research  group leader in the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry  Machinery Research Institute in 1960 and then successively  became deputy director of the Machinery Science Research  Institute in Zhengzhou City, deputy director of the Henan  Provincial Import and Export Management Commission, director of  the Henan Provincial Science and Technology Commission, vice  governor of Henan Province, and secretary of the Henan  Provincial CPC Committee. He was then appointed minister of  labor in 1988 and secretary general of the State Council in the  same year. He was vice chairman and a member of the secretariat  of the 10th National Federation of Trade Unions and deputy  chairman of the Executive Council of the Foundry Branch of the  Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society. At the 12th CPC  National Congress, he was elected alternate member of the  Central Committee; at the 13th and 14th party congresses, he was  elected a member of the Central Committee.    Wu Jianmin, 55, was born in Chongqing, Sichuan. After  graduating from Number Two Middle School, Nanjing, in 1955, he  studied in the French Language Department of the Beijing Foreign  Languages College. In 1961, he was sent by the Communist Youth  League Central Committee to Budapest as a French interpreter for  the Chinese representative to the World Democratic Youth  Federation. He returned to China in 1965. In his 30-year  diplomatic career he worked in the UN headquarters for about 10  years and with the Chinese delegation to the United Nations on  two occasions. He first worked there in the early 1970's as  third secretary and second secretary and was responsible for  Middle East and Southern African affairs.    In 1979, Wu Jianmin was transferred to the Chinese People's  Institute of Foreign Affairs and took charge of European affairs  and protocol affairs. Four years after that, he returned to the  foreign ministry and worked with the political research group.  On 21 March 1991, Wu Jianmin appeared for the first time in his  capacity as spokesman at a routine foreign ministry news  briefing, which was held in the Beijing International Club.    Wu Jianmin's wife Shi Yanhua is currently director of the  translation office in the foreign ministry. She graduated from  the English Department of Beijing Foreign Languages College and  was assigned to work with the foreign ministry education  department translation section on graduation. Between the late  1970's and the early 1980's, Shi Yanhua was Deng Xiaoping's  interpreter at almost all meetings with important U.S. officials.</p>

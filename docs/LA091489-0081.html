			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LARGER ROLE IN THE SCHOOL IS WORTH LONGER HOURS, TEACHERS SAY  </P> <P> Teachers at Hillside Junior High School in Simi Valley aren't likely to  complain about the hiring of Kathy Scroggin, the woman selected this summer to  be their new principal. That's because they chose her. They also picked their  new assistant principal, Steve Kalan.  </P> <P> At Conejo Elementary School in nearby Thousand Oaks, the faculty had a say in  hiring two new teachers, a custodian and the office secretary. Teachers there  also want to replace state-mandated special education classes with their own  method of teaching the school's educationally and emotionally handicapped  students.  </P> <P> As Los Angeles school administrators begin this fall to share for the first  time some of their power with faculty and community members, staff members at  Hillside and Conejo say the transition is unlikely to be easy. But they say the  results are worth the effort.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pilot Project  </P> <P> Now in the fifth year of a five-year pilot project that allows teachers a much  larger voice in running their schools, teachers at those schools say they have  paid for their increased power with more work and longer hours.  </P> <P> They said extensive training and seasoning are required to make the  power-sharing work. Their ideas have been turned down by district authorities  at least twice. And a handful of colleagues have decided not to participate,  saying that they would rather not be bothered with more duties than they  already have.  </P> <P> But for most of the teachers, who formerly had near total control in their  classrooms but next to none outside of it, the experiment has provided a new  appreciation for what they can accomplish.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't give up the power and neither would others who are seriously  involved in the project," said Denise Byrnes, a Hillside teacher.  </P> <P> The two eastern Ventura County schools are among 26 in the nation -- and the  only two in California -- taking part in the National Education Assn.'s Mastery  in Learning project. Officials from the NEA, the nation's largest teachers  union, as well as administrators in the Simi Valley and Conejo Valley unified  school districts, will evaluate the project's results next spring.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Helped Schools  </P> <P> The NEA helped the participating schools raise money from private foundations  to help support the training of teachers, as well as the educational research  needed to implement changes sought by the faculty.  </P> <P> Project consultant Bob McClure said the NEA's goal was to allow teachers at  each of the schools to decide for themselves what changes to make in  instruction. But the union offered virtually no guidelines about what issues  teachers should take up.  </P> <P> "The idea was to extend the leash and see what the faculty could do with their  school," McClure said.  </P> <P> At least one measure, test scores of the California Assessment Program, shows  that significant academic improvement occurred at both schools during the past  three years. Hillside, for example, moved from last to first among Simi  Valley's four junior high schools in the reading and writing portions of the  test.  </P> <P> "It would be difficult to really explain the increases but we have to assume  that something was happening at the school to make a difference," said Robert  Isenberg, the Simi Valley district's director of testing.  </P> <P> Whether the districts allow the teachers to retain expanded decision-making  powers or broaden the program to other schools will depend largely on what  happens this year, district officials and teachers said. At both schools,  teachers hope that parents and students will give good reviews to the teachers'  experimental classroom programs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Matter of Time  </P> <P> But regardless of the outcome of those evaluations, local teachers union  representatives say it is only a matter of time before greater management  powers become a common element in teachers' contracts.  </P> <P> "This is the wave of the future," said Hal Vick, executive director of the Simi  Educators Assn. and the United Assn. of Conejo Teachers.  </P> <P> In addition to seeking raises, teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School  District went on strike for nine days last spring to win the power to overrule  school principals in some cases.  </P> <P> But even though he supports the Mastery in Learning project, William Seaver,  Conejo Valley district superintendent, is skeptical about granting teachers  similar powers in his district.  </P> <P> "I think it's good management for the principal to work with teachers but the  principal has to have the ultimate authority," Seaver said. "There are areas of  responsibility that the administration has and I don't see any strong need to  change those."  </P> <P> Seaver said teachers in his district have for many years had a say in school  management through their membership with parents and administrators on school  councils. Traditionally, however, those councils have lacked power over the  most important of school decisions -- those involving budgets, curricula and  hiring.  </P> <P> Now that the district has relinquished power to teachers in even those areas,  teachers are using it to address what they see as key issues at their schools.  NEA officials said most of the 26 schools in the program chose to address  curricular issues, but some, as at Hillside, have made key personnel changes  and even adopted changes in school budgeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Veto Power  </P> <P> Nevertheless, principals at both California schools in the NEA project, as well  as school board members, retain the power to veto any faculty idea. But  teachers say they also have real power because they behave as if they do.  </P> <P> "The principal has the final say and I'm not reluctant to use it," said Neil  Snyder, Conejo Elementary School principal. But he said he uses his veto power  only after discussing the issue with teachers. "The era of one guy leading the  posse is over."  </P> <P> Snyder has, for example, worked with teachers to raise money for major school  repairs and renovations, one of the top priorities adopted by the faculty after  joining the NEA program. They worked together and were successful on that  issue.  </P> <P> But even the principal's endorsement doesn't always guarantee success. The  teachers at Conejo, for example, have learned some hard lessons over their plan  to allow the school's 20 or so educationally and emotionally handicapped  students to spend most of their classroom hours with regular students.  </P> <P> Mixing special education students with regular students is not completely new.  Special education students already mix with regular students in single subjects  such as reading and physical education. But teachers at Conejo proposed  restructuring the entire fifth and sixth grades so that special education  students and their teachers would join regular classes for all the basic  subjects, such as math and English.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reduce Class Size  </P> <P> The idea, according to the teachers who proposed it, would allow special  education students a chance to mingle with regular students and would reduce  class size for all students. Teachers would share teaching duties, each giving  lessons in the subjects they know most about.  </P> <P> "Some of the students have expressed some concerns," said special education  teacher Marsha Siever. "But most said they wanted to be with the regular kids."  </P> <P> A majority of the parents in the grades affected by the proposal were in favor  of it. And teachers said they believed that they had the go-ahead for beginning  the restructuring this fall. But district officials told the teachers in August  that state law requires the plan to be approved by the local and state boards  of education.  </P> <P> "It's good to mainstream children with special needs into other classes, but  the concern is that in special education classes you have teachers with very  specific skills," Supt. Seaver said. "You don't want the children to lose  anything."  </P> <P> Teachers at Conejo Elementary say they are preparing a formal proposal on the  idea to present to the school board. They said they are optimistic that the  board will approve it in time for the restructuring to occur this year.  </P> <P> At Hillside, teachers last year also met obstacles when they proposed opening  school a week early and adding additional vacation days during the year. A  majority of the school's parents opposed the idea.  </P> <P> But the faculty got no opposition to a new program that this year will change  the way 120 seventh-graders are taught at the school. Those students, instead  of going to separate English, science, history and math classes, will stay in  the same classroom and their teachers will come to them. The change allows  teachers to combine lessons in different subjects and to schedule two- and  three-hour blocks of time for instruction instead of the traditional one-hour  period.  </P> <P> "The history teacher starts the year teaching the fall of the Roman Empire, and  I can be teaching Greek and Roman mythology," said Hillside English teacher  Kimberly Lee. "The difference here is that teachers don't have to be in  complete isolation from each other."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extra Time  </P> <P> Teachers put in extra time, routinely meeting two and three times a week to  discuss such projects. Grants from the nonprofit Stuart Foundation of San  Francisco have paid for substitutes to take over classes when teachers attend  meetings and training sessions, and for some overtime pay.  </P> <P> But many of the teachers interviewed at both schools say that since the program  began they have routinely put in extra hours without pay. They are motivated to  work harder, they said, because their ideas are taken seriously by school  administrators.  </P> <P> The extra work put in by teachers, as well as the improved test scores,  persuaded Simi Valley Supt. John Duncan to approve a request last year by  Hillside teachers to hire their new principal and vice principal. Duncan also  approved a request by teachers to draw up a plan to further expand their power  at the school.  </P> <P> "There was some suspicion, some fear of the unknown when this started," Duncan  said. "It was the NEA and no one was sure what the desired outcome was." But  apparently, he said, the goal was "more enthusiastic and effective teachers."  </P> <P> Former NEA project consultant Joyce Tambor, now a professor of education at Cal  State Northridge, said the experiment's purpose has been to show that school  staff members know best which programs will work for their students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Far From Classroom  </P> <P> The problem with much school reform, Tambor said, is that it originates far  from the classroom.  </P></p>

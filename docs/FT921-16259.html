			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Serbs in push for rump Yugoslavia MR Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, yesterday rallied Serbs from neighbouring republics in a drive to form a smaller, rump Yugoslavia dominated by Serbia. The meeting of Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, which took place in Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital, coincided with the implementation of another ceasefire. Forged earlier this week by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy, the latest ceasefire is the 15th. Its success is a precondition for the dispatch of UN peace-keeping troops to Croatia. Croatia wants the troops in place as soon as possible, preferably before January 15, when the European Community recognises the independence of those republics which want it. With the exception of Serbia and Montenegro, all the republics - Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia - have applied for EC recognition. Yesterday Mr Mario Nobilo, an adviser to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, said the chances for a lasting ceasefire were greater now because of a 'shift in policy from the US following the break-up of the Soviet Union. The US now recognises that Yugoslavia cannot be held together.' But he expressed concern that if UN peace-keeping forces were not sent soon fighting would spread to other parts of the country. These fears were confirmed during the conference of pro-Yugoslav political parties in Belgrade, an attempt by Serbia to unite under one roof the country's Serb communities. 'Let us as soon as possible reconstitute the Yugoslav state community and form a stable state with organs and institutions which are efficiently going to protect the interests of all citizens,' Mr Brank Kostic, the vice president of the Serb-dominated collective presidency, said. The congress, not attended by Serbia's main opposition parties, is expected to agree on a draft resolution on establishing a new parliament for a rump Yugoslavia, and create a framework for establishing its borders. The EC peace conference on Yugoslavia is to resume on January 9 in Brussels, the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports from Lisbon.</p>

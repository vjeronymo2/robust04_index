			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Supermarket floorspace grows rapidly SUPERMARKETS are building outlets more quickly than the grocery market is expanding, but this is unlikely to produce an all-out price war, says a survey published today by Verdict, the retailing research company. Grocers and supermarkets have seen cumulative volume sales growth of 1.1 per cent over the past three years, the report says, but floorspace has increased by 7.8 per cent in the same period. Verdict blames weak sales growth on the recession and the increasing maturity of the market. It says that with 800 superstores in the UK, and the big retailers opening about 80 new stores a year, the opportunity to find new sites with little competition is diminishing. These factors may explain why the biggest food retailers have resorted to more aggressive price promotions. Verdict says the price skirmishing is unlikely to escalate into a war. The big three retailers, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway, are investing too much in new stores to be able to cope with the repercussions of heavy discounting.

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (8): Second only to Mount Fuji - Tourism To arrive at an overall picture of what tourism means to Derbyshire in economic terms is difficult. Although the Peak National Park has 75 per cent of its area within the county, it by no means occupies all of Derbyshire. The park, which covers 550 sq miles, impinges on five other counties. But some of the Derbyshire's best-known tourist attractions lie outside its boundaries. Buxton and Matlock, two well-known spa towns in Derbyshire, are both outside the park. Buxton was once known as the Bath of the north. Today, it is regrettably blighted and its famous 'Crescent' - John Carr of York's terrace built in 1784 - is now boarded up and decaying. But, using its famous opera house, it holds a festival each July. Buxton also has a number of hotels. Matlock Bath has a cable car, the Heights of Abraham Park and nature reserve and Gulliver's Kingdom, a theme park. These attractions pull in visitors over and above those going to the Peak National Park, as does Derby itself with its art gallery and museum. However, the county council does not concern itself greatly with the promotion of tourism, leaving this to the district councils. The authorities who run the national park do not involve themselves with mass or popular tourist products such as theme parks. They believe these are antithetical to the goals of running a national park. These goals, they feel, are: preserving and improving the landscape, encouraging the right kind of environmentally-concerned visitor and looking after the interests of people who work and live in the park. There are 38,000 living and working there. Neither the county council nor the Peak National Park has figures for tourism for the county as a whole. The East Midlands Tourist Board said three years ago it thought that tourism earned Pounds 120m for Derbyshire and employed about 9,000 people. The Derbyshire Dales District Council is heavily involved in tourism promotion. Part of its area is within the national park and part outside. The attractions it extols include the historic houses of Chatsworth and Haddon Hall, the homes of the Dukes of Devonshire and Rutland respectively. These are inside the park. The council also covers Matlock. In 1990, Derbyshire Dales council estimated that it had 17m day visitors and 1.5m staying visitors. Estimated spending by visitors was Pounds 107m and the number of people employed in tourism was 7,100. The council estimated that this number represented 25 per cent of total employment opportunities in the district of 66,000 people Derbyshire is where Isaak Walton, a renowned angling writer, once fished trout streams. It is where Charlotte Bronte set Jane Eyre. Clearly, the county has a tourist industry apart from the national park, even if it is difficult to quantify how big it is. But it is the Peak National Park which is overwhelmingly the greatest visitor attraction. The latest survey undertaken by the park estimates that in 1991 it had 22m visitor days. According to Mr Roland Smith, spokesman for the park, this makes it the second-largest visited national park in the world. Only Mount Fuji in Japan attracted more visitors, he says. The Peak National Park attracts far more visitors than any of the other 10 national parks in England and Wales. It is much more heavily used than any of the famous parks in the US. It is not hard to see the reason why. The Peak district is surrounded by large conurbations. Sheffield and Manchester to the north, Derby and Nottingham to the south. It has been estimated that half the population of England is within two hours' drive of the park. Apart from the historic houses and pretty country towns, visitors go to explore the huge subterranean caverns, and for walking, bird watching, and other outside pursuits. The Pennine Way begins in the park. It starts at Edale and winds 250 miles to the Scottish borders. The proximity of large cities and the ease of access puts the park's authorities in a dilemma. The sheer volume of visitors means great wear and tear on often fragile terrain. Moreover, although there are 22m visitor days there are only 500,000 'staying guests' visitors. This means the park does not make as much income as it might. In 1991 it was estimated that the park made Pounds 75m. The town of Portsmouth on the south coast makes three times as much from a fraction of the number of visitors. This figure does not include those staying in hotels in places like Buxton. The aim is to diversify the kind of visits to increase income and to ease the pressure. The pattern has been changing. Mr Smith says: 'A few years ago visitors were people having a day out. They often didn't leave their cars. They drove around, drank tea from a Thermos and threw litter out of the window. They spent little and usually didn't even buy petrol in the park. I have noticed that recently the number of walkers has crept up to the point where they are probably as many as the drivers.' To encourage more environmentally-friendly tourists who stay longer, the Peak authorities have tried to open up the district. They have negotiated between 20 and 30 access agreements with private landlords. These agreements now cover 80 sq miles. They have signposted trails and footpaths and published literature on walks. They have have set up visitor information centres and have encouraged cycle hire centres. The park has a number of park rangers who have a policing role, although they do not like to be called police. There is a constant programme of repair and improvement of footpaths and the landscape. In terms of increasing accommodation, the park is not the planning authority. That task falls to the High Peak District Council and the other district councils. But it has been closely involved with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff), the Rural Development Agency (RDA) and other bodies in helping farmers diversify into farmhouse holiday accommodation. It has also been active in converting barns to provide basic camping facilities for school groups and similar visitors. Mr Smith emphasises that any building has to be sympathetic to the local environment. Local materials have to be used and planning applications are expected to be in tune with the park. He says: 'A scheme for a time-share project was turned down by the council. We are not here to encourage mass tourism. We are here to look after the landscape and conserve the environment and to encourage the kind of tourists who will appreciate what is on offer. 'Increasingly, we must look after the interests of people who live here.'</p>

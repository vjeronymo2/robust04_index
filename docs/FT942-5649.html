			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Tiger cub starts to find its feet: Hefty obstacles remain, but the Philippine economy could be on the road to recovery A year ago the Philippine capital Manila was a miserable place even for the rich. Executives sat sweating and cursing in their offices through frequent 12-hour power cuts without air-conditioners or fans to combat the summer heat. Factories were often idle, and the economy, long since left behind by fast-growing Thailand and Malaysia, was stagnant. The previous government of Mrs Corazon Aquino had failed to invest in new power stations. Hardly anyone dared hope that her chosen successor, President Fidel Ramos, would succeed in turning on the power and launch an economic recovery by mid-1994. But he did both. 'Fast-track' power station projects have restored electricity to the industrial centres of the Philippine archipelago, and economic growth is accelerating after a series of reforms to liberalise finance and industry. 'That is what I predicted from day one of my administration,' said the cigar-chomping Mr Ramos in an interview with the Financial Times at the Malacanang palace in Manila. 'We have started to reverse the downtrend of the past.' For years the Philippines has been a notorious laggard among south-east Asia's tigerish economies. Since 1980, according to the International Monetary Fund, real gross national product has increased by only 1.5 per cent a year (below the population growth rate of 2.5 per cent) compared with an average 7 per cent for the other five members of the Association of South East Asian Nations. This year, GNP growth in the Philippines could reach about 4 per cent, and economists say the government should soon be able to achieve its target of sustained 6 per cent annual growth. Mr Ramos and his cabinet maintain that the Philippines has finally turned the corner. 'Think of the Philippines as a tiger cub,' Mr Roberto de Ocampo, the finance secretary, told a business conference recently in Singapore. 'The Philippines is back in business.' Financial institutions have endorsed Mr Ramos's optimism. 'On the road to recovery,' declared a report from CS First Boston, the investment bank. 'Go towards the light]' said UK investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'It really is about to happen.' Investors in the local stock market, Asia's top performer last year with a rise of 132 per cent in US dollar terms, clearly think so, too. Scepticism, however, lurks beneath the surface. Some Filipino and foreign investors in Manila say their hopes have been raised and then dashed so often in the past that they refuse to be euphoric now. Corruption and bureaucracy are still rampant. And economic growth, the sceptics say, could easily be stalled by militant workers demanding higher wages - already high by south-east Asian standards - as soon as recovery appears. Earlier this year, in the face of demonstrations, the government withdrew a levy of one peso (about 2 1/2 p) per litre on petroleum products to help plug the budget deficit. It may be true, the critics add, that the IMF is poised to approve Manila's economic policies with a three-year, Dollars 650m loan this month, but the country has implemented no fewer than 22 IMF programmes in 30 years, with little sign of improvement. 'We would like them to be Switzerland by now, after all those programmes,' said one foreign banker. Mr Ramos and his government colleagues say the pessimists have forgotten to take into account the country's peculiar history. Much of the blame for its poor performance can be laid at the door of the late dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, who came to power in 1965. He mired his country in debt and fostered a culture of protectionism, import substitution and monopolies for his friends - a 'crony capitalism' that contrasted sharply with the export-led growth of other economies in the region. Mrs Aquino toppled Marcos in the popular uprising of 1986, but restoring a measure of political stability has taken nearly a decade; while still armed forces chief, Mr Ramos had to protect Mrs Aquino from seven attempted right-wing coups d'etat. 'Her job really was to ensure the political empowerment of our people, and I was part of that,' said Mr Ramos. 'But the economic side was not really attended to. Evidence: electric power.' Mr Ramos, a methodical man known as 'Steady Eddie', was himself elected president two years ago for a six-year term. Even those who doubt that the Philippines can catch up again with its Asian neighbours - the economy was one of the strongest in the region in the 1950s - give credit to Mr Ramos for his achievements so far. Apart from restoring electricity to Manila by farming out power station contracts to private investors, such as Hopewell of Hong Kong, his administration has ended foreign exchange controls on current transactions, relieved the central bank of debt accumulated during the Marcos era, and continued the privatisation programme begun under Mrs Aquino. Among the assets sold to raise much-needed revenue for the state are stakes in Philippine Airlines and in Petron, the oil refiner and fuel distributor. The telecommunications sector, once the protected fiefdom of Philippine Long Distance Telephone, has been opened up to foreign and local competitors, a move expected to improve the country's inefficient telephone network rapidly. In the past few weeks, the government has liberalised the banking sector, by ending a 45-year ban on the entry of foreign banks. It has also pushed through the two houses of Congress a measure to increase the scope of value-added tax and other revenue-raising measures which claw back money lost by the failure to maintain higher fuel prices. 'These are laws that should have been put in place 40 years ago, but we are doing it now,' Mr Ramos said of his economic legislation. Unlike Mrs Aquino, Mr Ramos has so far been able to cope with the political system inherited from the US, which succeeded Spain as the country's colonial power in 1898, and to work through the Congress to enact legislation. 'I'm not experiencing the gridlock that you (foreign commentators) always accuse the Philippine leadership of having,' he said. The economic reforms that have been enacted have been achieved in an atmosphere of political stability not witnessed for 15 years. Negotiations have dragged on with rebel right-wing military officers, communists and Moslem separatists in the south, but none of these groups seems as formidable today as when the economy was in decline. 'Sometimes you go for stability but you lose out on growth,' says Mr Erico Claudio of stockbrokers James Capel in Manila. 'Now we're getting both.' Some hefty obstacles still need to be overcome if economic reforms are to succeed. Each year the population of this predominantly Roman Catholic country increases by 2.5 per cent, which means that the economy has to grow at the same rate just for per capita income to hold steady. Natural resources - trees, fish, soil, fresh water - are being consumed or damaged at an alarming pace by the country's 66m inhabitants. Compared with its neighbours, the Philippines has low rates of saving and investment. And although the budget deficit has been held at less than 3 per cent of gross domestic product for the past three years, so much of the revenue is spent paying salaries for the bloated civil service and on servicing foreign and domestic debt that little is left for capital spending on roads and other infrastructure required to support economic progress. Mr Ramos nevertheless believes he can put the Philippines firmly on the road to recovery by the end of his term in 1998. He says, further, that he can do this within an argumentative democratic system regarded as too weak and divisive by successful Asian authoritarians such as Mr Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore. 'Stick with us. We'll show you in two or three years,' said Mr Ramos. 'The Philippines is still the model of respect for human rights and democracy in south-east Asia.' Fostering rapid economic growth and ensuring a constant supply of electricity are considered routine government tasks in south-east Asia these days. But to do so in a liberal democracy, complete with a free press and the sort of unlimited public debate found in the Philippines, would be a memorable achievement.</p>

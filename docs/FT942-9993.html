			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tornado hints lift BAe Defence and industrial giant British Aerospace (BAe) rose strongly on reports that it was about to announce a lucrative Tornado fighter aircraft order. There were also positive reports from an analysts' visit to the company's defence operations. The shares closed 23 ahead at 499p after volume of 6m. Rumours that BAe was about to sign a contract with the UK Ministry of Defence to upgrade the Tornado aircraft swept through the market in the last hour of trading, further strengthening an already impressive performance by the shares. Earlier, the stock had moved against the trend as favourable reports filtered back to London from a two-day tour of the group's defence operations by City analysts. One specialist said: 'It has become clear that profits from the defence division will rise significantly over the next few years.' Confidence was further boosted by Tuesday's confirmation that Canada is to buy 35 Airbus aircraft worth Pounds 950m. BAe is a 20 per cent stakeholder in the Airbus consortium and builds the wings for the aircraft.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Mexican bank float draws Dollars 846m THE MEXICAN government has sold nearly 82 per cent of the equity in Banco Mexicano Somex, the country's sixth largest bank, for Dollars 846m, equivalent to 29 times last year's earnings, and a record 4.63 times book value. A group of investors headed by Mr Eduardo Creel, the former Inverlat broker, and Mr Vicente Aristegui, the former Chrysler Mexico chief, paid Dollars 3.42 a share for a controlling 51 per cent at 5.2 book value. The group has the option to buy a further 30.62 per cent of Series B stock at a lower price, which would bring total revenues from the privatisation to Dollars 846m. Somex has assets of Dollars 5.38bn, and had profits last year of Dollars 36m. It has 329 branches across Mexico, less than half the number operated by Banamex, Mexico's largest bank. The bank has had difficulties with poor loans and a high proportion of subsidised (and often non-performing) mortgage loans. The second and third bids for Somex were at 4.15 and 3.73 book value respectively, greater or equal to the winning bids for the four largest banks already sold. ***** ARGENTINA began yet another foray into the world equities market yesterday when the government kicked-off an international marketing campaign to sell its 30 per cent stake in Telecom Argentina, one of the country's two privatised telephone companies, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. The sales offensive began in Paris and will end in San Francisco on March 14, a few days before the offer closes. The government has set a minimum price of Dollars 640m for the shares, but they are expected to fetch Dollars 800 to Dollars 900m. Telecom was created in November 1990 when the national telephone network was privatised and split in two. Telecom, which operates in northern Argentina, is managed by the French and Italian state telephone companies. The flotation is expected to repeat last December's successful sale of the government's 30 per cent stake in Telefonica de Argentina, which runs the phones in southern Argentina. It raised Dollars 850m for the government, due largely to strong demand in Argentina. Telecom reported net profit of Dollars 52.3m on sales of Dollars 862.4m in 1991. ***** MR YA'ACOV Nimrodi, the Israeli businessman who last week bought the daily newspaper Ma'ariv from the administrator of Mr Robert Maxwell's Israeli assets, has sold on half his holding in a deal which gives a rival publisher a large stake in the company, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. Mr Nimrodi sold a 22 per cent stake in Ma'ariv Modi'in, publisher of Ma'ariv, for Dollars 3m to the Schocken family, which publishes the rival Ha'aretz and Hadashot daily papers. Another 22 per cent stake in Ma'ariv was sold by Mr Nimrodi to Mr Jack Lieberman, an Australian with investments in Israel, and a local partner.</p>

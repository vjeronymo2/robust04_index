			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Equal Justice for 'Equalizer' Suit: Hollywood writer and producer Lou Shaw has  a legitimate right to pursue a copyright infringement suit over the pilot  script for the "Equalizer" television series, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  Appeals in San Francisco ruled Tuesday. The appeals court said there was  "substantial similarity" between a copyright script called "The Equalizer,"  written by Shaw in 1979, and the series pilot that appeared in 1985, allowing  Shaw to sue the show's creators. The decision sent the case back to U.S.  District Court in Pasadena, which had previously dismissed Shaw's claims. BETH  KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bao Yueyang (0545 2588 7122): "Macroeconomic Regulation </F> and Control Arrives At Crucial Stage"]    [Text] According to the State Statistical Bureau, in the  first quarter of this year our country's GDP increased by 12.7  percent over the same period of last year. The growth rate  still seemed to be too high but, because of the low proportion  of agriculture and the high proportion of industry in the first  quarter, the figure could be turned into an annual growth rate  of 9 to 10 percent. That is to say, the economic operation  moved into the target scope of macrocontrol. The comprehensive  assessment of the economic operation by the State Statistical  Bureau was changed from somewhere between the "red light" and  the "yellow light" to the current condition between the "yellow  light" and "green light." As far as the internal economic  structure was concerned, the growth rates of production,  construction, and sales, which were too fast, declined somewhat  and the economy as a whole maintained an appropriate growth rate.    From the somewhat overheated condition of the economy in the  first half of last year to the basically normal condition in the  first quarter of this year, an arduous and great change was  effected. An authoritative economist stated at a recent  symposium with deep feelings that, if the central authorities  did not make a timely decision on macroeconomic regulation and  control, it is certain that major problems will occur in our  economy and we might not be able to sit here quietly to discuss  things. A few months ago, people in some localities and  departments still held various different opinions on  macrocontrol but people now see things clearly and have agreed  that macrocontrol is necessary.    In general, however, we still cannot say that a decisive  success has been scored in macrocontrol; what we can say is that  results in the initial stage of macrocontrol have been achieved.  This is because, at present, our economy is still facing  prominent difficulties and problems and the task of carrying out  further macrocontrol remains rather arduous.    According the main economic indicators in the first quarter,  the current macrocontrol is at a key stage: The economic growth  rate has basically fallen to the target scope of macrocontrol  and the value of the economic boom is also at an appropriate  level, so no major fluctuations should be caused; on the other  hand, the price increase rate at the present stage is still far  from the macrocontrol target, so price control should still be  intensified. Therefore, macrocontrol should still curb price  increases while preventing major fluctuations of the economic  growth rates. However, the complexity of the issue lies in the  fact that price increases and economic growth are two  interrelated indicators. In the 15 years of reform and opening,  high economic growth rates have always gone with high inflation.  We can also say that, to a certain degree, we are in a dilemma  trying to curb the price increases at the same time as  mitigating the difficulties in enterprise operation. If our  measures for curbing price increase are too serious, economic  growth can be upset and the state-owned enterprises which are  operating in difficult conditions may encounter even greater  difficulties; if we relax control over such major factors of  economic growth as investments and loans, prices may continue to  increase.    As there is a synchronistic relationship between economic  growth and price increases, then our macrocontrol guideline  should, in general, seek the most favorable conjunction of the  economic growth rate and the price increase rate. That is, to  keep the economic growth rate between 9 and 10 percent and to  keep the price increase rate below 10 percent. In the course of  pursuing this guideline, we should try to restrain the  disadvantageous and boost the advantageous by curbing the rate  of price increases and striving for the highest possible rate of  economic growth.    We may first see the possibility of curbing the excessive  price increases. At present, price increases are mainly caused  by the following factors: First, owing to the fast economic  growth, investment-led demand becomes strong and this drives up  the prices of producer goods and then affects the prices of  consumer goods; second, in the price reform, the changes in the  price-forming mechanisms inevitably cause a certain degree of  price increases; third, in the tax reform, enterprises may shift  part of their additional tax burdens onto others by raising the  prices of their products, and some even take advantage of this  opportunity to reap additional profits by turning some in-price  taxes [jia nei shui 0116 0355 4451] into out-of-price taxes [jia  wai shui 0116 1120 4451]; fourth, since price decontrol, the new  price management mechanisms have not been established and some  merchants irregularly raise prices when people generally expect  price increases; and fifth, the unification of the exchange rate  system has also caused certain price increases. As long as we  take the right measures to offset the effects of these factors,  we will be able to bring the upward tendency in prices  completely under control.    First, it is necessary to control the general valve. This  year, the size of investment in fixed assets is not very large  and some new projects will soon be started because the size of  the ongoing construction projects is already too large.  Therefore, there will be great pressure for the expansion of  investment. So, it is necessary to strictly control new project  starts, to control the overall amount of investment, and to  prevent the further widening of the gap in the working funds.  This is the key to whether or not this year's macroeconomic  adjustment and control will score further successes.    Second, grasp the opportune moment for the adoption of the  price reform measures, and prevent the excessive intensiveness  of such measures which can cause substantial price fluctuations.    Third, strive to mitigate the impact of the tax reform on  prices. It is necessary to properly explain the new tax systems  to the enterprises, help them understand the details and the new  calculation methods in order to prevent misunderstandings and  operation errors which can push prices upward. At the same  time, we must adopt corresponding measures to stabilize prices  when the new tax system is adopted and help the enterprises  offset the impact of the additional tax burdens.    Fourth, adopt rigorous legal and administrative means to  resolutely ban the practice of irregularly raising prices in  order to seek illicit profits and to punish shops and merchants  involved in such activities. This is a pressing current task.  Some merchants wantonly charge exorbitant prices without  following any rules when fixing prices and their behavior cause  the general public to panic. If such disorder is not removed in  good time, it can seriously affect the market stability. At  present, people in the economic circles generally hope that the  State Council will adopt the "Antiprofiterring Law" and the  "Price Law" and rigorously supervise their enforcement.    We can also see another key point in the macroeconomic  policies, that is, how to maintain appropriate high-speed  economic growth while curbing price increases. This cannot be  controlled as easily as the price issue, nor is it easy to work  out an effective and pertinent remedy. Generally speaking, it  is necessary to keep the basic balance between gross supply and  gross demand and to prevent the excessive intensiveness of the  measures for controlling demand. The investment in fixed assets  should be restrained and should also be preserved. On the basis  of optimizing the investment structure and raising the  investment efficiency, we should ensure an appropriate increase  in investment and should also guarantee the key construction  projects and meet the needs of the basic industries and the  infrastructural projects. When providing working funds for  enterprises bogged down in a predicament, we should pay  attention to the orientation of the fund flow. It is  inadvisable to taking only stopgap measures without thoroughly  solving problems. A set of comprehensive measures should be  worked out as soon as possible in order to solve the problem  whereby state-owned enterprises are short of dynamism in their  operation. Consideration should be given to this issue when the  comprehensive plan for establishing a modern enterprise system  is being formulated this year.</p>

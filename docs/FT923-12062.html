			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Damages over cheques row LLOYDS BANK agreed to pay damages yesterday to a business couple for wrongly failing to honour their cheques. The 'substantial' undisclosed damages, plus costs, were announced in the High Court in settlement of libel actions brought by Mr Brian Allen and Mrs Margaret Allen and their company. Mr Justice Drake was told the Allens were on holiday when the cheques were dishonoured at the end of 1983. Lloyds acknowledged the cheques should have been met.</p>

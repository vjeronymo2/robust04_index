			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS OF BOY PARALYZED IN CARE CENTER POOL ACCIDENT SUE;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: THE COUNTY IS A PARTY TO THE SUIT ON THE GROUND THAT IT SHOULD HAVE  CLOSED OR TAKEN SOME OTHER ACTION AGAINST THE UNLICENSED FACILITY.  </P> <P> The parents of a 2-year-old boy left paralyzed and brain-damaged after tumbling  into a swimming pool at an unlicensed North Tustin day-care center sued the  center's owners, the county and the state Thursday, contending that stricter  regulation of the facility could have prevented the accident.  </P> <P> Christy Kolbet, 40, and Derek Weston, 29, of Santa Ana seek unspecified damages  for the March 30 accident at the Cowan Heights home of Diane and Orvel Brooks.  The lawsuit also names the Brooks' daughter, Carol, who was in charge of the  children when the accident happened.  </P> <P> "This was a terrible catastrophe which we believe could have been prevented had  county and state authorities intervened in a timely and appropriate manner,"  said Gloria Allred, the lawyer who filed the Superior Court lawsuit.  </P> <P> Jonathan Derek Weston, who will be 3 in May, and two other children fell into  the Brooks' pool when Carol Brooks allegedly left them unattended for a short  period of time.  </P> <P> A 14-month-old boy, Arthur M. Griese, died about 24 hours after Orvel Brooks  pulled him from the water. Jonathan was brain-damaged and paralyzed. Another  2-year-old, Melissa Dianne Polsfoot, also suffered permanent brain damage.  </P> <P> Diane and Carol Brooks were charged with willful failure to obtain a day-care  license, a misdemeanor. They face a January trial in Municipal Court in Santa  Ana. Deputy Public Defender Deborah Barnum said the women had done everything  that they were instructed to do by county day-care regulators to ensure the  safety of their charges.  </P> <P> Derek Weston said he has to fight tears when he thinks of the "gorgeous,  bright, active" little boy Jonathan used to be. The bouncy child who used to  help his father rake leaves in the yard now requires round-the-clock medical  care. His lungs must be suctioned hourly and medications administered through a  gastrointestinal tube, Weston said.  </P> <P> Weston and Kolbet care for Jonathan in the evenings, then a hired nurse arrives  at their home to supervise him while his parents sleep. When they leave for  work in the morning, they drop him off at a specialized care center in Santa  Ana, Kolbet said.  </P> <P> "If we had just known the place was unsafe, this never would have happened  because we would have taken Jonathan out of there," Kolbet said. "This has  completely destroyed our lives. We've suffered emotionally, financially. Our  relationship and our jobs suffer. No one can ever fix what's happened to us."  </P> <P> Kolbet and Weston said in the lawsuit that the Orange County Department of  Social Services should have made sure that the day-care center was shut down.  Prompted by calls from a concerned neighbor, the agency twice visited the  Brooks home and ordered the family to halt its child-care operations. But  Weston and Kolbet blame the agency for failing to take stronger measures such  as obtaining a court order or levying fines.  </P> <P> "We believe the county should have done more than simply fill out a form and  have the Brooks sign the cease-and-desist order," Allred said.  </P> <P> At the very least, the agency should have warned parents that the facility was  unsafe, Allred said. But because that was not done, "every parent's worst  nightmare became a reality for Jonathan and his parents," she added.  </P> <P> State and county social services officials were unavailable for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with president of IRE-POLUS Company] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The attention received by Russian lasers at INTEROPT '93 is  fresh in our memory. Recently Valentin P. Gaponchev, president  of the Russian laser manufacturer IRE-POLUS, visited Japan and  spoke with our editors about the history and present status of  laser research in Russia and about his company's business  strategy.    OPTRONICS: Tell us about the history of laser  research in Russia.    Gaponchev: Laser research in Russia began about  the same time it did in the U.S. Many kinds of research were  conducted beginning in the early 1960s by scientists at  universities, government research institutes, and businesses.  Until about 10 years ago we obtained many outstanding results  and possessed very advanced technology, but hardly any of that  information was conveyed to Western nations. The fact was that  strict secrecy was maintained in the country, and even our own  researchers did not know what other Soviet researchers were  doing in detail.    For example, researchers at my company developed a 100 kW  class YAG laser 10 years ago, and I myself developed the  phosphite glass used in glass lasers in 1969. Furthermore, eight  years ago we had already developed a Q-switched Cr:YAG laser  used in range finders, etc., with better performance than those  used by Western companies today.    At that time 200-300 large companies, and it becomes a vast  number if we include all the small companies, were involved in  laser research. Research on laser technology was also heavily  emphasized at universities and government research institutes.  There were a lot of laboratories doing research on solid state  lasers, but only a few were working with semiconductor lasers.  Furthermore, all this R&amp;D was essentially for military use,  and  no thought was given to converting lasers to civilian use.    OPTRONICS: What is the present status of laser  research?    Gaponchev: Researchers are suffering from monetary  problems because beginning last year government research  spending, especially military spending, was cut considerably.  Because government funding was determined in the past by the  size of the organization and number of people employed rather  than the content of the research, the major research  organizations hired more and more people in their desire for  funding. Actually, however, about 90 percent of the personnel  were unnecessary, and those conducting research accounted for  only about 10 percent of the total, so there were only a few  researchers in the true sense of the word.    The way for our scientists to survive from now on will be to  jump feet first into the free market economy on their own and  actually compete with Western products. We can't expect that  kind of change from large companies, however. The fact is that  they are not investing capital in developing new technology.  Almost all their money is used to pay researchers' salaries, so  research is not adequately funded.    Therefore, from a practical standpoint, the most effective  solution is to start a new company and assemble researchers.  Government funds will just be wasted if they are sent to places  operating under the old system, so they are now being directed  to new companies instead.    These past few years more than 100,000 companies have  requested government funding to carry out high-tech development,  and in laser-related fields there are more than 1,000 companies  requesting startup funds. However, almost all of them are just  companies on paper and all they really want is government funds.  They are insipid companies that merely want to sell the  technology that the nation has already developed. As far as I  know, only about 10 companies at most are actually developing  commercial products.    Almost all the companies involved with lasers were  established by groups from departments in government research  organizations. Their product lines are small, so they do not  receive funding from the government, and it is difficult for  them to develop new products.    Our best human resources, technology, and equipment are  leaking away into foreign countries. The companies that remain  have already lost competitive strength, and that puts Russian  companies in a dangerous fix. There is a small number of  companies, however, that are investing in new equipment, and in  fact, some strong companies are emerging. IRE-POLUS is one of  those companies.    OPTRONICS: Tell us the history of IRE-POLUS.    Gaponchev: IRE-POLUS was established in 1990 by  the merger of two groups of scientists. One of them was the IRE  group, where I was conducting research on laser materials. The  other was a group from POLUS, one of Russia's leading solid  state laser research organizations, and is led by Alexander  Chestakov.    Our researchers and their friends supplied 89 percent of the  capital, and the remaining 11 percent came from the government.  Because only a small amount of our capital is from the  government, we can do research, development and sales with  almost complete freedom. Our capital was originally about  $2,000, but now we have about $20,000,000, and we have invested  about $15,000,000 of that money in new technology such as  equipment and facilities. Over the past three years we have  reinvested 90-95 percent of our profits in new technology. These  investments are for the development of high quality items to  meet our unique specifications such as the materials and optical  parts necessary to develop laser equipment.    Our goal is to develop new solid state lasers and systems.  We  plan to proceed with development to the prototype and  small-volume mass production level in response to the market,  and if the market demands a large quantity of our products, we  will license the manufacturing out to Western companies. We  started with a staff of 27, and now we have about 250 people  working for us with about 50 Ph.D's.    OPTRONICS: Tell us something about your products.    Gaponchev: For example, our Er:fiber amplifier has  a high output of 150 mW and is very compact. Right now we are  developing a 500 mW model, and we have achieved oscillation at  the experimental level.    Our Er:fiber laser has a high output of 200 mW and uses  direct diode excitation. We have finished development of a 500  mW prototype. We have also developed green and blue lasers that  employ nonlinear optic crystals and up-conversion for use at  wavelengths of 1.5 m and at 1 m with Nd, Yb, etc. We  have  developed fiber lasers in the 20-30 W class and in the future we  expect output of several hundred W. Compared with lamp and diode  excitation formats, our lasers are compact, highly efficient,  low in cost, and do not require cooling, so we expect  applications for them in industry and medical therapy.    Our Nd:YAG lasers have achieved high outputs of up to 3 kW,  and we also manufacture a single mode type. Our 1.5 kW class  laser has a compact resonator of about 40 cm, and our single  mode type has an efficiency almost as good as multimode types.    We still have to address problems with the power source and  chiller, however. Because there are no good suppliers in Russia,  and we have not developed these items in-house, we want to do  business with a reputable manufacturer from a Western nation.    We are also working hard on tunable lasers such as the  Ti:sapphire laser. We started with high quality crystals and  proceeded with development of green Nd:YAG lasers. We have  completed development of a green laser with an output of 10 W CW  and 30 W Q-switched. In addition, we have developed a Cr:YAG  laser that can cover the range from 1.35 m to 1.6 m,  and a  diode pump Yb:fiber laser capable of continuous variation from  1.04 m to 1.18 m. We are now building prototypes of  both.    We are also working on development of Ho:YAG lasers and  Er:YAG lasers for medical equipment. These perform as well as  the most advanced lasers in Western nations, and we have begun  our activities in this field by setting the prices low enough  that they can be used in medicine and establishing a subsidiary  for dedicated sales.    OPTRONICS: What about semiconductor lasers?    Gaponchev: We are thinking of developing  semiconductor lasers for excitation purposes. We have developed  semiconductor lasers for the fiber lasers, and we hope to become  as strong in the field as Western semiconductor laser  manufacturers.    We are also working on the development of E/O and A/O  devices  and fiber sensors. Our fiber thermometers are compact, have a  precision of +/- 0.01C, a range of -50 to +150C, and  their cost is about the same as high precision thermocouple  thermometers. The catheter internal insertion type with a 200  m sensor head can be used to control temperatures in heat  therapy for cancer. The cost will be only one-tenth those made  in the U.S., and we are looking for companies in Japan and  elsewhere to do mass production.    Another item we are working on is the fiber gyro, and we  want  to form a partnership with a Japanese company for manufacture  and sales. As far as price is concerned, we have supplied them  for communications satellite attitude control for about $1,000,  and we expect they will run about $100 for use in automobiles.    OPTRONICS: Low prices are your strength, but do  you expect them to stay that way?    Gaponchev: I think there are two reasons why  products from the old communist bloc were inexpensive. The first  is that their performance was inferior to products from the  West. The second is that their initial cost was extremely low  because they came out of government research institutes.  Therefore, it was possible to price them low and make a good  profit.    However, when we think about supplying stable quality and  performance and establishing a service system, the market prices  of Russian lasers will probably approach those from the rest of  the world before too long. It is true that in the past there was  a major price difference because material and labor costs were  low, but the gap with the West has been steadily closing.  Because the prices of Russian products are rising, there may be  cases in the future where it will be less expensive to buy  something made in the West.    Actually, the price of metal has gone up 30 times already  this year. The frames for our equipment that we used to make for  $200-$300 now cost 10 times more, and the cost of manufacturing  an Nd:YAG rod has jumped from $50 last year to about $200 today.    OPTRONICS: What was the purpose of your visit to  Japan?    Gaponchev: I visited at the invitation of TEM for  installing laser equipment and strengthening our cooperative  relationship. At the same time I wanted to sound out the  possibilities for joint ventures with Japanese companies and  having them provide OEM. Right now our main market is Europe,  then the U.S. We have subsidiaries in both places. As far as the  Japanese market is concerned, there are still a lot of unknowns,  but we would definitely like to enter it.    It is true that the situation in Russia today is unstable.  Inflation is out of control, the interest rates at lending  institutions are very high, and there is a limit to how much we  can borrow. Therefore, we have high hopes for financial aid and  support from Western nations. Unfortunately, it is my impression  that Japanese companies are not very eager to invest. Contrast  that with China. China is building its own plants for  development and manufacturing based on Russian technology, and  it looks like their purpose is for military use.    OPTRONICS: Thank you very much for speaking with  us.</p>

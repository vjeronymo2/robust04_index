			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just learned that Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime  Minister Haris Silajdzic has sent a letter to the UN Security  Council [UNSC] chairman. The letter reads:    You are aware that the aggressor has been attacking the  protected zone of Gorazde for 20 days now, using troops and  military equipment brought from Serbia and Montenegro. The  aggressor's forces have occupied a large part of the protected  zone and destroyed and burned down 21 villages around Gorazde.  Some 230 people have been killed and 800 wounded in the town  center. Civilian facilities in the centre of Gorazde are being  destroyed with all available weapons. Tens of thousands of  people are facing death from shooting or starvation, the letter  says.    It is a fact that the United Nations and its representatives  in Bosnia-Herzegovina did not use their mandate and powers  granted to them by UNSC resolutions 824 and 836. As a  consequence the population which -- through the arms embargo --  has been denied the right to self-defense has been left without  any protection. We therefore consider those who make decisions  within the UN as being responsible for what has happened, the  letter says.    We demand that the UNSC urgently take appropriate measures  in  keeping with Article 7 of the UN Charter, which means to use  force to stop the attacks by Serb aggressor's forces against  Gorazde. We repeat that this is an aggression by Serbia and  Montenegro against the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has  been going on for two years. We demand the urgent establishment  of an exclusion zone around Gorazde, from which the aggressor's  troops and military equipment must withdraw.    Mr. President, we are talking about tens of thousands of  civilians who, together with the rest of the world, expect that  the peace-keeping forces will fulfill their duty, the letter  says.</p>

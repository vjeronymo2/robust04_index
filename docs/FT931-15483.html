			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hints of switching in BT HUGE turnover in both classes of BT shares dwarfed the rest of the London market yesterday and prompted renewed speculation over institutional manoeuvring ahead of the expected sale of the remaining tranche of shares held by the government. Broker Smith New Court conducted the business, which saw three blocks of 9m shares and one of 4.5m in the partly-paid traded at 285 1/2 p. Turnover reached 35m as the stock added 2 at 285p. In the fully-paid, 4 blocks of 9m traded at 399p, a large premium to the then ruling market price, which closed 2 up at 390p after volume of 36m. There were suggestions of switching from the partly to the fully-paid. The government announced its intention to sell its remaining 21.8 per cent stake  -1.34bn shares, dubbed BT3 by the City - two months ago. Speculation has been made about a July sale date, which at yesterday's price would raise in the region of Pounds 5bn for the government. Guinness tumbles The surprise announcement by Guinness of a Pounds 125m provision to fund rationalisation sent its shares tumbling and reinforced nervousness surrounding current trading, due to be detailed to analysts from tomorrow. While the provision is to be made against the year ended December 1992, analysts were preparing to reduce estimates for 1993 and predicted that the shares would remain weak for the next 18 months. Yesterday they dropped 21 to 473p in turnover of 7.9m. Further pressure came as news broke that Spanish beer sales fell 5 per cent last year. That will increase the gloom surrounding Guinness's Spanish subsidiary. In addition, LVMH, in which Guinness has a 24 per cent crossholding, had its shares suspended yesterday on the Guinness announcement and said 1992 sales would be 'slightly lower' than in the previous year. Reckitt tussle A clash of views erupted in the market over health and household goods group Reckitt &amp; Colman. Agency broker James Capel decided it was time to buy the shares, while Smith New Court wanted little to do with them. The Capel view was based on the stock's recovery potential. It said the company's price-earnings ratio was at a 25-year historic relative low and argued that Reckitt, which derives about 70 per cent of its profits from overseas, will have currency-related gains in 1993 but will also see underlying growth in 1993 and 1994. Meanwhile, Smith New Court decided that there was more value to be found in SmithKline Beecham. Pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Paul Woodhouse shaved his 1992 Reckitt profits forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 248m and advised clients to switch their investments into SmithKline, which he feels offers better growth potential. Reckitt showed a healthy 12p gain at one stage but the tightly traded shares were sold down later to close only 4 higher at 642p. SmithKline 'A' ended 6 ahead at 475p and the Units 4 up at 416p. A trade press report that German group Knauf was expanding its first plasterboard production plant in the UK hit shares in rival BPB Industries, which supplies 90 per cent of British plaster. Details of the Knauf plan remain sketchy and analysts downplayed the significance of the move. The shares fell 13 to 187p. The shares were also said to be suffering after a good run and fears that the French economy will be slow to emerge from recession. BPB has significant French interests. Also dragged down with BPB were RMC Group, off 6 at 557p, Redland, down 9 at 422p, and English China Clays, 18 adrift at 449p. Rank Organisation's categorical refusal to consider any offer for its film business disappointed some in the market and the shares retreated 10 to 701p. A consortium had been put together to mount a bid, which some analysts thought Rank might consider given its debt position. Although a deal looks unlikely, leisure specialists said Rank may consider a Pounds 100m-plus offer for its Odeon chain of cinemas. Weakness in Thorn EMI was attributed to talk of poor UK music sales figures for December, although analysts pointed out that the more important US market had had a good Christmas trading period. Thorn is said to be due to start briefing analysts next week on its overall trading position and rumour has it that sales are slightly ahead of market expectations. The shares retreated 11 to 840p. Conglomerate Hanson was slightly firmer against the trend following meetings with about 165 analysts in New York on Monday. Hanson observer Mr Jack L. Kelly of Goldman Sachs said the company had moved from being 'cautiously optimistic' to 'optimistic' on the potential in the US, where it generates half of its earnings. It had also signalled a commitment to returning to its core businesses, a move expected to make the company more comprehensible to US investors. The shares firmed 1 3/4 to 237 3/4 p. ICI slid 11 to 1087p after falling on Wall Street. Shell Transport eased 3 to 530p, with both NatWest Securities and Strauss Turnbull issuing bearish notes. Reports in an authoritative US trade journal that the State of California planned to stop reimbursements for ulcer drugs gave an opportunity for heavy selling of Glaxo shares. The stock opened higher on the back of heavy buying on Monday but turned round to record a fall of 17 at 723p with unusually heavy turnover of 11m shares. UK analysts said the Californian decision was worth about Dollars 50m in total and substantially less with regard to Glaxo's key drug Zantac. Most specialists said worries that the West Coast move would start a nationwide trend were groundless. However, they suggested that UK institutions were looking for an excuse to sell the shares. High Street bank Lloyds fell 12 to 506p on speculation that it might be poised to take up the remaining stake in its Abbey Life subsidiary when it announces results in early February. Profit-takers were also at work. Hong Kong bank HSBC saw heavy turnover with investors switching from the ordinary to the Hong Kong registered. The latter advanced 7 1/2 to 505p with 9.7m traded, while the ordinaries closed 4 up at 523p on volume of 12m. The nature of the shares means that UK institutions are automatically under weight and selling is easily mopped up. A warning from Dalepak Foods that this year is likely to be worse than last year sent the shares plunging 66 to 317p. Asda shares edged forward 2 1/4 to 65 1/4 p in steady volume of 13m. Talk of executive moves was again heard. Tomkins added 4 at 249p in the wake of a recommendation from NatWest Securities. British Airways declined 6 to 268p on US selling. Lehman Brothers became the latest house to reduce current year estimates, shaving Pounds 50m off its previous forecast to reach a new figure of Pounds 240m. However, Mr Chris Will, European airlines analyst at Lehman, said: 'It is time to buy BA again.' The Pounds 14.2m disposal of its water and waste treatment helped Simon Engineering to bounce 11 to 121p. Swiss Bank Corporation was a big seller of British Aerospace amid suggestions of problems with the proposed deal between Taiwan Aerospace and BAe on its regional aircraft division. The shares relinquished 9 to 176p, with selling of the stock in the traded options also a feature. Shares in Rolls-Royce gave up 6 to 108p, with Henderson Crosthwaite said to have downgraded profits expectations. Vosper Thornycroft was wanted and among a handful of stocks that bucked the market trend, climbing 8 to 457p to set an all-time high. Strong bid speculation returned to Lucas Industries. The shares moved forward 6 to 144p, with suggestions of an offer in the near future at around 175p. Radio station GWR advanced 12 to 310p after a 12.6 per cent placing of the company's shares at 310p apiece. Property development group Shaftesbury was one of the few property stocks to gain ground, finishing 6 stronger at 45p after recent news that Lloyds Investment Managers had increased its stake in the company from 17 per cent to 21 per cent.

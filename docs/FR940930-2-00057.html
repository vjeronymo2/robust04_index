			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to develop partnerships with and among national organizations to effectively extend the reach of CDC's HIV Prevention strategies (Prevention Marketing Initiative and the Business and Labor Workplace HIV/AIDS Program) into communities to strengthen social norms that contribute to the prevention of HIV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient will be responsible for the activities under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for the activities under B. (CDC Activities).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Recipient Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant must develop a program plan based on realistic, specific, time-phased, and measurable objectives for proposed activities and services, including technical assistance, for their affiliates, constituents or members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The most successful comprehensive social marketing/health communications programs make individual-level behaviors the central communications focus while addressing both the individual and the social systems and networks that influence (predispose, enable, and reinforce) the behaviors of individuals. Applicant may choose to conduct one, several, or all of the three Priority Activities listed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs developed under any Priority Activity area must be implemented at the national level, and must be designed to have an impact, ultimately, at the local level. All programs must be coordinated with CDC, national, regional, State, and existing social marketing/health communications programs to prevent duplication of efforts, i.e., the Prevention Marketing Initiative and the Business and Labor Workplace HIV/AIDS Program. In addition CDC is currently working with its national, State, and local HIV prevention partners to implement the HIV Prevention Community Planning Initiative. An outcome of this initiative is that each health department recipient of an HIV prevention cooperative agreement is to develop a comprehensive HIV prevention plan for its jurisdiction. Programs funded under Announcement 502 should be consistent with these State and local comprehensive HIV prevention plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This announcement includes provisions to fund national minority organizations to develop, produce, disseminate, and market health communications messages on HIV prevention. All such efforts must be culturally competent and linguistically appropriate for the intended audience segments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Priority Activity 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participate in a comprehensive prevention marketing program targeted initially to persons 18 to 25 years of age designed to decrease HIV risk behaviors, and/or to the social systems and networks, including communities, that influence, support, and reinforce their sexual behaviors. Such efforts, including training and technical assistance, must be undertaken in direct support of, and coordinated with, CDC's existing Prevention Marketing Initiative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program activities may include the creation or utilization of systems, activities, and interventions that directly influence individual behavior (these behaviors are those that place individuals at risk for HIV transmission). They may also include activities designed to change or sustain individual behaviors by influencing social systems and networks in relevant sectors of society that will affect individual behavior. These programs should strengthen the abilities of public and private national, regional, State, and local organizations and consortia to provide information, training, and/or technical assistance to their members, affiliates, or constituencies, and to apply available resources creatively and effectively to reduce risk behaviors which contribute to the further spread of HIV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A national program to demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of an established social marketing program relevant to CDC's Prevention Marketing Initiative may be undertaken. This program, must be undertaken in not less than three communities across the country and must be based upon an already established, on-going, or recently completed social marketing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An example of such a program would be one that uses proven methods for community engagement and collaboration to involve critical social/civic community leaders in promoting awareness of condom effectiveness in preventing disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Priority Activity 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Build the capacity within relevant social systems and/or networks within a sector of society, and ultimately coordinate with these systems, to participate in HIV prevention efforts. This can be done by providing technical assistance, training, and/or information to organizations representing key sectors of society addressed in this program announcement (e.g., business and labor, religious, voluntary, and media).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Execution of this activity would involve the development and operation of HIV/AIDS technical assistance and training programs to assist national, regional, State, and/or local organizations within defined social systems to implement comprehensive, effective HIV prevention efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of Priority 2 activities would be participation in one or more of the following programs: (1) the Business and Labor Workplace HIV/AIDS Program, designed to assist the business and labor sector in developing and implementing comprehensive workplace HIV/AIDS programs and to assist business and labor leaders in supporting and participating in community HIV prevention efforts; (2) a broad effort to engage and develop the capacity of religious institutions to participate in HIV prevention and services at the community level; or (3) a broad effort by a national voluntary or media organization to educate its constituents, affiliates, and volunteers to participate in local HIV community planning, education, and service activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

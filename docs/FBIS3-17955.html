			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" from an interview with Lieutenant General </F> Mamedrafi Mamedov, Azerbaijan defense minister, by Beshir  Sherifov; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Sherifov] We systematically broadcast the Defense  Ministry's reports every day. But, in the present conditions it  would be more interesting to hear about the situation from the  minister himself.    [Mamedov] At present the situation on our borders is  favorable. We have strengthened our positions. We want to  create an army. It must be created whether or not there is a  war. A strong country and state should have a strong and proper  army. The entire people and society should be involved in the  war. We should have evicted the Armenians a long time ago. I  would like to ask: Who is to defend the Azerbaijani soil? We  ourselves, the Azerbaijani people. Where are they [deserters]  trying to flee? Why and from whom they are escaping?. From  ourselves, our own country, mothers, sisters, or brothers?  Therefore, availing myself of this opportunity I am informing  all the deserters, both soldiers and officers, that in 15 days  we will start changing the military certificates and personal  documents. All military personnel must carry their document  with them. Those who do not will be regarded as deserters, be  they soldiers or officers. Therefore, I am informing them that  they still have time, until 15 April. They must return to their  military units by 15 April. After that, we will issue no  military documents to anyone. The state will take a very stern  approach to them.    [Sherifov] The military laws must be obeyed unconditionally?    [Mamedov] Of course. I would very much like for you to put  them on television so that their fathers, sisters, brothers,  friends, and relatives could see these deserters. There are  cases when the son escapes and his father comes and takes his  place at the front. Beloved son, where is the morality in this?  Who will defend this country? The war will end sooner or later.    I now ask the deserters: How will they dare to look in the  faces of their friends and acquaintances serving in the same  unit?    [Sherifov] Finally, many are trying to forecast the duration  of the war--that is, when and how it will end. As defense  minister, what is your forecast, and do you believe such a  prognosis can be made?    [Mamedov] I cannot say that the war will end in a month or  within six months. It is not possible to make such a forecast,  because the enemy cannot be regarded as weak. We cannot say:  The enemy is weak so let's launch an attack. We must gather  information on the strength of the enemy and then launch an  attack. I do not approve of sending our beloved sons to  martyrdom for no reason at all. Therefore, it is not possible  to state definitely that the war will end in one or two months.  It would be inappropriate to say such a thing. Whether the war  ends in one month, half a year, or eight months depends on our  deserters, the entire nation, and society. Some think that the  war is something apart from the people. No. The war is a  question of the honor of the people.    [Sherifov] One should rely on one's own people?    [Mamedov] A country relies on its people during wartime. If  the people hide their sons, then who is going to take part in  the war? We cannot expect people to come from other countries,  from Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan, and participate in it and  defend Azerbaijani soil. This cannot be. That is the answer to  your question.</p>

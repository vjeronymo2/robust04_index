			<p>BFN     [Text] From 15 to 18 April, President Le Duc Anh paid a  working visit to the northeastern border Province of Quang Ninh,  which belongs to the targeted economic development zone formed  by Hanoi, Haiphong, and Quang Ninh.    After being briefed by leading officials of the provincial  party committee and people's committee on socioeconomic  development projects for the years ahead, President Le Duc Anh  pointed out the great potential and important role of Quang Ninh  in the renovation process and construction aimed at turning the  province into a prosperous and beautiful part of the country.    The tasks and objectives of the Quang Ninh Province party  organization and people are well-defined and aimed at promoting  key economic sectors, namely production of coal, cement, and  construction materials; processing of agro-forestry-sea  products; and development of a sea-based economy, tourism, and  service industries. Concentrated efforts are needed to help  local coal producers and industrialists overcome difficulties in  capital, technology, and marketing. First of all, it is  necessary to invest in infrastructure building projects  involving communications and transport, water conservancy, power  transmission, and information and communications. It is  necessary to accelerate the movement for wasteland reclamation  and aquaculture as well as to create sources of raw materials  for processing industries and exports. It is important to step  up external economic relations, attract investment capital from  local and foreign investors, increase export indexes of  traditional and local products, and work out adequate plans to  exploit tourist attractions. At the same time, it is necessary  to step up the campaign against corruption and smuggling,  restore order and discipline, and maintain political stability.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Japan trade surplus falls back from peak Japan's trade surplus has peaked after three years of uninterrupted expansion, as import growth outpaced exports during November and the surplus fell 2.2 per cent year-on-year to Dollars 7.398bn (Pounds 4.95bn). The Ministry of Finance said the turnround reflected the influence of the yen's appreciation by 14 per cent against the dollar this year, adding that the surplus should continue to shrink in coming months. Japanese trade officials hope the contraction of the surplus will be matched by an easing of trade friction, as the large and growing figure had been a target for criticism by the US and Europe. The fall in the surplus follows a gradual reduction in year-on-year increases in recent months. In July, the surplus expanded by 28.7 per cent, in August 6.7 per cent, September 3.8 per cent and October 0.91 per cent. Exports during November rose 4.1 per cent to Dollars 28.38bn, while imports rose 6.4 per cent to Dollars 20.99bn, reflecting an increase in component imports from the east Asian factories of Japanese manufacturers. Trade with China continued to expand rapidly, regardless of Beijing's attempts to cool its economy. Japan's exports to China rose 19.6 per cent, while imports from China rose 33.3 per cent, including a 62 per cent increase in machinery imports. Japan's seasonally-adjusted exports slipped 3.9 per cent, while imports rose 2.9 per cent from a month earlier and the surplus was Dollars 8.81bn, compared to Dollars 10.51bn in October. The surplus in trade with Washington continued to expand during November, as exports to the US increased 8.3 per cent to Dollars 8.84bn and imports rose only 4.3 per cent to Dollars 4.54bn. However, the surplus with the European Union decreased for the 10th consecutive month, falling 36.2 per cent to Dollars 988.1m. Demand from the US computer industry lifted exports of semiconductor parts by 42.5 per cent, while exports contracted of colour television sets, videocassette recorders, and audio equipment, all of which are increasingly produced elsehwere in Asia by Japanese manufacturers.</p>

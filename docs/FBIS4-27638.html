			<p>BFN     [Text] President Suharto considers the current global  situation as worrisome, even though there are some heartening  issues such as the end of apartheid in South Africa and progress  in the Middle East peace process.    Speaking at a state banquet hosted in honor of the visiting  Turkmenistan President Saparmurad Niyazov at Istana Negara  [state palace] in Jakarta tonight, the head of state expressed  his concern over the outbreak of conflicts in numerous regions.  He said the conflicts have resulted in the loss of human lives  and the suffering of the innocent. This is due to power  politics, ethnic conflicts, and lawlessness.</p>

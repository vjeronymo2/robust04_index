			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview With Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr </F> al-'Attas by AL-KHALIJ in Sanaa; date not given]    [Excerpt] Yemeni Prime Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas has noted that the situation in Yemen is difficult,  that any clash could turn into a catastrophe, and that each  province or tribe can move on its own. He has called for  dialogue on all opinions, regardless of how disturbing, until  the ideal unity formula is developed. Speaking of Salim Salih's  statements on "federalism," al-'Attas said that before unity,  the north demanded federalism, whereas representatives of the  south demanded merger.    Even though al-'Attas reasserted that Yemen is well and that  it can overcome its ordeal if the will and the desire are there.  However, he has expressed his concern for the absence of frank  dialogue and over "things hatched in the dark." Al-'Attas has  also warned that a continued crisis could lead to an end of all  the coalition forces.    Al-'Attas has revealed the details and secrets of the  kidnaping of the U.S. information attache and of other acts of  violence to which he personally and other party leaders have  been subjected. He further revealed the details of proposals and  timetables that he personally, and other party leaders, have  submitted to end the crisis, including practical measures to  prevent revenge and the use of revenge politically, to apprehend  those responsible for violence, and to evacuate armed forces  from the cities. The Yemeni prime minister has also noted the  presence of forces determined to engage in sabotage and of  organizations opposed to unity. But he reaffirmed that he is  confident that the union will continue and that Yemen can deal  with the ordeal.    He also touched on details of the financial issues and on  the  economic and social problems. All this is contained in a lengthy  interview which AL-KHALIJ conducted with al-'Attas at his home  in Sanaa. Following are the details.  <H5>  Economic and Political Crisis </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] Yemen's economic and social crisis seems to be  extremely severe. The riyal has been sliding so swiftly that a  dollar is worth 56.5 riyals now. Development seems to be  suspended, and even normal growth seems to be nonexistent. Even  though land development in the capital continues, the  manifestations of poverty seem to have grown worse for somebody  who visited Yemen a few years ago. Is this a reflection of the  ongoing political crisis, or are there other reasons?    ['Attas] The economic crisis is not caused by the current  political crises but is an old crisis. Many wagered in the past  on the collapse of the united Yemen. But the government has made  very great efforts in recent years, especially in 1991 and 1992,  and it gained strong control over the economic conditions. In  1991, the government was able for the first time to control the  general deficit of the general state budget, reducing that  deficit from 15 billion to five billion riyals, a figure that  aroused a great deal of optimism among us. The 1992 budget was  drafted on the basis of that success, and an investment program  was drawn up for the first time.    We held a joint meeting with the Presidential Council at the  beginning of 1992, in the wake of political tensions that  surfaced at the end of 1991. A number of economic measures  capable of improving the conditions and of neutralizing the  negative effects of the political developments were taken.    But regrettably, political tensions and security violations  increased, and those developments swept away numerous  aspirations. The crisis climaxed in December 1992, thus forcing  the government to address a strongly worded message to the  political leaders. We also discussed the crisis at the House of  Representatives.    What happened during those crises could have been overcome  if  it had not been for the absence of a united political will at  the leadership--an absence which led to exploiting the  conditions and manipulating the economy.    Even if professional merchants respect their trade and  operate in a sound economic manner, intruders corrupt  everything. The fluctuating prices that we are experiencing are  the result of the activity of these intruders and corrupters.  <H5>  Fabricated Operation </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] Do you mean that the drop in the value of the  national currency is a fabricated thing that does not reflect  the true economic conditions?    ['Attas] Yes, it is fabricated. It is also tantamount to  exploitation of the crisis for illicit gain. Last December, we  started organizing a currency exchange rate list compatible with  our tendency to move toward a free-market economy. But even that  list has been nullified. However, we continue to try to  implement it. I met with the Central Bank management a few days  ago. The unsound approach to exchange rates and to currency  should be ended by the end of this current month (November).  Severe penalties will be imposed on any illicit transactions  violating the official list.    Regrettably, there are large numbers of merchants who are  engaged in the money-changing trade.    [AL-KHALIJ] Frankly, can merchants play such a serious game  without being backed in one way or another?    ['Attas] I will emphasize that good merchants, including the  Federation of Chambers of Commerce and well-known merchants,  have taken a good position. They are opposed to what is going on  in the market. But intruders are exacerbating the crisis. There  are also responsible citizens who, regrettably, engage in the  money-changing trade in a faulty manner.  <H5>  Fearful Spending </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] More frankly, I have learned that the people's  hardship has reached such a phase that people are disavowing the  coalition, unity, and democracy.    ['Attas] The economic condition is the main issue, of  course.  All political accomplishments mean nothing if the citizen  experiences problems in his daily life. This is why, when  drafting the 1992 budget, we were eager to curtail inflation and  the economic problems. A main cause of inflation is the general  state budget. It so happens that I was talking to the finance  minister a short time ago. Vast sums of money are spent without  even consulting the prime minister. A short time ago, I was  reminding the finance minister that he is not entitled to spend  such immense sums, even if he receives instructions from any  other authority.    State spending is fearful, especially the military  establishment's spending. I do not believe that all that is  spent in the name of this establishment is used for its benefit.    [AL-KHALIJ] It is normal that the military establishment's  spending grows under the circumstances of the political crisis  and when the conflicting forces rely on their own military  forces.    ['Attas] The truth is that this spending is not a  consequence  of the crisis. The volume of spending on the military  establishment has been a subject of dispute since 1991. At the  outset of 1992, we tried to curtail this spending, but to no  avail. In July this year, prior to the crisis, I held a meeting  with the finance minister, defense minister, and the military  establishment, and the focus was on the problem of food supplies  and on spending on personnel.    [AL-KHALIJ] What are the figures that can be made public in  the military sphere?    ['Attas] Our armed forces are 246,000-strong. But we have  taken an official decision that they will not exceed 150,000.  <H5>  Smuggling Problems </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] Why has Yemen's currency not been unified to  date, despite the announcements on such a step?    ['Attas] To begin with, I would like to say that the  economic  situation can be brought under control, that the riyal can  regain its strength, and that the standard of living can be  enhanced if two things are achieved: first, control over state  spending and, second, control over state revenues. A total of 50  percent of the state revenues are not collected, and smuggling  is growing by bounds and leaps. Whenever we move to seize  smuggling cases, our movement is thwarted.    [AL-KHALIJ] I have heard merchants and sellers say that high  prices in interior towns are due to the fact that merchants are  forced to pay large sums of money, which are levied on them  between the coastal towns and the interior.    ['Attas] Those who guard smuggling are the people who  collect  these enormous sums.    [AL-KHALIJ] Does not a part of these sums end up in the  state  budget, in the form of official taxes?    ['Attas] No part ends up in the state budget, and this is  one  of the most significant problems.    [AL-KHALIJ] But we have heard that the people who make the  collection are people in an official capacity?    ['Attas] These people use some facilities; they permit  smuggling; they gain and the country, the economy, and the  government lose the revenues to which they are entitled. What is  more important is that the majority of the imported goods are  outside the program adopted by the Council of Ministers. This  importing increases the demand for dollars puts more pressure on  the national currency. But in spite of this, I emphasize that  Yemen has the resources to control the economic situation. Oil  revenues are increasing. If the other resources are brought  under control, there will be no deficit in the Yemeni budget.  <H5>  Unified Currency </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] A lot of reports were disseminated prior to the  latest crisis, indicating that the disbursement of salaries  would be held up by numerous state institutions. At times, these  reports led to strikes and demonstrations staged in the face of  an unconvincing explanation which used the lack of printed  currency as an excuse. What is the true explanation concerning  this issue?    ['Attas] This confirms the opposite of what some brothers  allege, namely that the crisis is the result of the current  circumstances. During the 1992 crisis, these brothers hoarded  money in their homes and kept it away from banks because of some  steps taken by the Central Bank to counter speculation in  riyals. It was especially noticed then that large-scale bank  credits were acquired not to import, set up plants, or invest in  agriculture, but to speculate in currency. This is why the  Central Bank hastened to suspend the credits, thus causing a  reaction among speculators and a liquidity problem. This was a  temporary problem, which we tackled promptly. Beyond this  framework, the problem also materialized due to administrative  reasons, considering that the paperwork is heavy and saddles the  administration. We seek to eliminate this paperwork.    [AL-KHALIJ] Both currencies of Yemen have collapsed. But  relatively speaking, the dinar has collapsed by a much greater  degree. Why?    ['Attas] The exchange rate has been set at 26 riyals per  dinar. But sellers and merchants deal on the basis of an  exchange rate of one shilling per riyal.    [AL-KHALIJ] How?    ['Attas] (With a laugh) Just like that. They even try khat  [to set the exchange rate]. But citizens in the southern and  eastern governorates have been affected by this drop.    [AL-KHALIJ] Which means that the people are more determined  than the government to unify the currency.    ['Attas] This is why we have decided to withdraw the dinar,  why we have actually decided that the riyal is the state  currency, and why we have printed enough riyals to meet the need  throughout the republic.    [AL-KHALIJ] We know that there has been a decision to unify  the currency. But both currencies continue to be in circulation.    ['Attas] Yes, the decision to unify the currency was made in  1991. But the 1992 liquidity crisis forced the Central Bank to  put the dinar, which it had begun to withdraw, back in  circulation. The consequences of this problem have persisted in  spite of the decision to adopt the riyal. Now, we are actually  thinking of adopting a new currency.    Here we would like to remind those who accuse the YSP  [Yemeni  Socialist Party] of seeking to secede that this party is the  party that demands a new currency, which represents the united  state. How could a party demanding a single currency adopt  secession? A party that wants secession does not try to abolish  its own currency.  <H5>  Conflict and Sedition </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] Thank God that you are the one who has brought  up  the subject of secession. Perhaps you are aware of brother Salim  Salih's message, which has been circulated by fax throughout all  parts of Yemen. This message calls for a federalist formula,  which some people, especially in the GPC [General People's  Congress], have considered a test balloon to probe the  consequences and possibility of backing away from unity.    ['Attas] The fact is that in crises like these, all are  supposed to have enough wisdom and steadfastness to deal with  all developments, except backsliding and confrontation.    With opinion and intelligence, dialogue can be held on  everything. If the leadership itself prohibits discussing any  issue, it denies itself the means and the possibilities of  developing the right position.    A lot is, of course, being said all over Yemen and in Sanaa  itself. What brother Salim Salih has said is personal and does  not represent the [YSP] party. Currently, things a whole lot  more serious than this are being raised in Sanaa. Such things  can be concluded from the campaign against the YSP. Last month,  a statement was distributed by the GPC, entitled "YSP  Provocations on the Path of Secession." Those words were an  intelligence report, fundamentally, and we familiarized  ourselves with that report when the Political Bureau acquired a  copy prior to the Central Committee meeting. The whole statement  is nothing but lies. The more serious part of that statement is  the second part, which contains the recommendations. Whoever  reads this statement can see what the premeditated plans are.    The statement says that the YSP sells weapons and military  equipment and vehicles, and that it seeks secession. Can this be  true? What kind of contradictions are these? Does one who seeks  secession sell his strength and get rid of it, or does he insist  on maintaining it? These are contradictory and irrational words.    [AL-KHALIJ] Unless money becomes more important than weapons  in the conflict.    ['Attas] (Laughing) Of course, all weapons are used in  conflicts. But not insofar as we are concerned. What I meant by  citing this instance is to point out that there are things that  fan the fires of conflict and sedition and that do not bring  people together and unite them.    In light of brother Salim Salih's statements, I had an  appointment yesterday to meet with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani  and with brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi. Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim  didn't show up. He then called me and said: Have you seen Salim  Salih's statement? I said: No. He then came and brought the  statement, which I had not read, with him. So, I said to him:  Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim, have you contacted Salim Salih and others and  told them we "either hold together on equitable terms, or  separate with kindness" [Koran 2:229].    When I talked to Salim Salih, he responded: 'Abd-al-Karim  says such things, so why do not you protest against him?    Frankly, I personally am not worried by any opinion  expressed  openly to be debated. I worry when things are hatched in the  dark.  <H5>  Confrontation Is Catastrophic </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] There are those who see that the most  significant  reasons of the crisis are the conflicting opinions within each  of the coalition parties. They also believe that internal  conflicts within each party, whether the YSP, the GPC, or the  YGR [Yemeni Grouping for Reform], paralyze dialogue and reflect  on it negatively and that all these parties include forces that  support unity and forces that oppose it. What is your opinion?    ['Attas] This is a fact. If you examine the pre-unity  positions, you would find that there were anti-unity forces in  the parties. I believe that many of those forces have not  changed their positions.    [AL-KHALIJ] But does not this mean that should, God forbid,  conditions move in the direction of confrontation and secession,  then not only the two parts that existed in the past will be  brought back into existence, but a hundred catastrophes will  arise?    ['Attas] This is a foregone conclusion. We are aware of it,  and we all work to prevent such a development, because nobody  will be able to control any military confrontation. Numerous  forces will enter into the conflict. Each province or tribe will  be able to move on its own and all will be destroyed.    This is why we are eager to control matters and to prevent  any conflict. Let people carry on with the dialogue until they  develop solutions to all problems.    [AL-KHALIJ] What point has the joint Council of  Ministers-House of Representatives Committee reached in its work?    ['Attas] In the latest meeting, the committee's concern was  to prevent an escalation of the crisis, to contain this crisis,  and to create the conditions for dialogue.    The House of Representatives really planned to take steps to  deal with the crisis. The house protested a statement I made  against this tendency when I was in Aden. I reiterate now that  such a decision is tantamount to a war declaration [as  published]. It would be a positive step on the house's part to  back away from this line, to understand its responsibility, and  to realize the dangers that would emanate from this tendency. I  intended my aforementioned statement to clarify matters. But it  "upset" the House of Representatives, and it would have behooved  the house not to get upset. It has been proven to it now that  this line is destructive and that it may actually lead to  secession.  <H5>  Unity and Federalism </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] Do we understand from your words that the joint  Cabinet-House committee has stopped its effort to solve the  crisis?    ['Attas] No, it continues to work to contain the crisis. I  believe that the best way is to continue the dialogue and to put  everything, regardless of how disturbing, on the table.  Yesterday (Saturday), I advised the brothers in the coalition  not to be provoked by Salim Salih's statement and not to respond  to him inappropriately. Otherwise, they will contribute to the  escalation. Permit me to say that the media have played a  fundamental role in this issue and that we have to discuss  everything now.    It is true that when we discussed the unity issue, the plan  of the brothers here (meaning the former North Yemen) was a plan  for a federal union. But the south demanded a merger, and the  brothers here acknowledge this fact. It is true that it seems  that we did not study the conditions in Yemen carefully and that  we could have embraced the procedure gradually. But emotion had  its influence, and there actually was a rush to accomplish unity  when the accord was signed in November 1989, with the  determination to accomplish unity the following November.    [AL-KHALIJ] Do you mean that problems were carried over to  the united Yemen and that you agree with those who believe that  the YSP and the GPC rushed to unity in order to escape from  their regional problems, thus trying to gain the sympathy of the  unity-minded Yemeni public, and that, consequently, the  preparations necessary for unity were not made?    ['Attas] Yes.    [AL-KHALIJ] But observers of the situation in Yemen believe  that it is no longer possible to back away from the unity  formula.    ['Attas] This is one of the problems facing us. I have no  decisive opinion on how to deal with issues. But one is forced  to swallow a bitter pill at times.    [AL-KHALIJ] But every force in the coalition wants the  others, but not itself, to swallow the bitter pill.    ['Attas] Yes, this is the problem. If it persists, they will  all perish.  <H5>  Brink of Abyss </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] Even the dialogue is about to come to a halt.  Dialogue sessions have been postponed repeatedly. Meeting dates  have been announced repeatedly. But no meetings have been held  by the committees or between the president and his vice  president.    ['Attas] We do not know who schedules these meetings! The  meeting between the president and his vice president is  something else.    Let me reveal to you here a dialogue program which we (the  YSP) presented but which was rejected by the GPC. It is a  three-part program: The first part deals with the constitutional  amendments and calls for abolishing them for the time being. The  second part concerns the Presidential Council election, and the  third deals with controversial issues. We have made this  proposal: We cannot discuss all issues now in a tense climate.  So let us define and list the issues and then commit ourselves  to discuss them two weeks after the crisis eases. Now let us  focus on one issue, namely the security issue. Three things  emanate from this issue: suspicion; revenge, which must be  outlawed; and the armed forces' presence in cities. We delivered  this proposal to them [in the GPC] but they rejected it. Now,  they want to return to the proposal. But frankly, we find that  its time has passed.    So, let us ask: Does he who submits these proposals want to  solve the problem or not? I asked them this question and  delivered to them the program in the YSP's name. I, Jarallah,  and Dr. Yasin debated with them. I personally wrote the minutes  of the meeting when I noticed that the debate was getting  complex and that things were being done outside the committee to  obstruct the committee's work. At times, one wonders about their  logic and about how they could reject such proposals. What is  more, they come now to tell us: We agree to the 18 points! Why  did they not agree to them when they were announced? I cannot  understand what is going on.    [AL-KHALIJ] It is obvious that what has happened to date  between the coalition forces is a dialogue of the deaf. Despite  the small degree of relaxation created by the U.S. statements  and by the U.S. definition of the controls of the conflict, the  question that persists is: Until when will Yemen be able to  withstand the brinkmanship policies? Is it logical to wager more  on outside forces than on internal dialogue?    ['Attas] I answered this question with a public address I  delivered at the conclusion of the conference of the Nasirite  Popular Unionist Organization. I said no solutions will come  from abroad. We are the ones who should tackle the problem. It  is futile to wager on the outside world. This problem can only  be solved by Yemen's sons, by the responsible among them, and by  the coalition in particular. There is no justification to waste  time any longer. The most difficult thing facing us is rejection  of reality and the refusal to deal with it soundly.    [AL-KHALIJ] What is the role you envision for the political  forces that are outside the coalition?    ['Attas] They can play an assisting role. But the  decisionmaking is in the coalition's hands, particularly hands  of the YSP and the GPC. They are the two parties that can make  the decision. They are confronted with a historic  responsibility. They are the two parties that made the unity,  and they are the ones that can preserve it.  <H5>  Honesty and Confidence </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] With the unity declaration, people ignored all  the negatives that had preceded the declaration, and the two  parties were crowned as champions of unity. Do not the two  parties consider this fact now, and do they not realize the  dimensions of the danger and the defacement that will afflict  them if any setback is suffered?    ['Attas] Certainly. But what we lack now are the honesty and  the confidence to overcome difficulties. The Gulf War was the  first tremor to hit Yemen's unity. Many questions remain  unanswered. After the war, people sensed danger, and they  united. But then the problem resurfaced. Since the middle of  1991, we have been confronted with successive crises. We formed  the first joint YSP-GPC committee to solve this problem in  November 1991. But we continue to suffer, and this is amazing.    Note: at this moment, an employee arrived with a big  envelope. The prime minister asked Mrs. Amat-al-'Alim  al-Sawsawah, the Information Ministry undersecretary, to read  passages from the program, and then said: "She will read so you  can hear the text from her." But Amat-al-'Alim said, "I have  memorized it. I do not need to read it." Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas responded, "No, they have not distributed this to  you." After pointing out that the passage is from an official  proposal which he, al-'Attas, submitted on 10 October to deal  with the crisis, she read:    "Proceeding on basis of the accord signed by the party  [YSP] and the grouping [YGR], which states that introducing the  constitutional amendments is one of the tasks that must be  accomplished; considering that the time available has not helped  the parties to the coalition to accomplish this task in the  period since the Presidential Council's term was extended; and  in order to provide the proper period of time to complete and  pass the amendments; to underline the coalition's eagerness to  reassert the democratic march which was launched on 27 April  1993; to cement national unity and the trust between the  coalition parties; and out of concern for this pioneer  experiment, the allied parties have agreed on the following:    "First, the parties to the coalition will carry on with  the dialogue to develop an agreed formula for the constitutional  amendments during a maximum period of three months. The formula  agreed on for the constitutional amendments will be submitted as  a plan for general discussion. A national committee will be  formed of the ruling coalition parties, the opposition parties,  university professors in Sanaa and Aden, ulema, and social  figures and submit draft amendments to be approved and passed by  the House of Representatives within a maximum period of two  years.    "Second, the Presidential Council will be elected in  accordance with the current Constitution, on the basis of the  coalition, and through agreement among the parties to the  coalition: the GPC, the YSP, and the YGR.    "Third, in view of shortness of the time available to  debate the issues raised by the YSP, as well as the issues  raised by the coalition parties, on developing the state and on  the citizens' problems, and in view of the approval attached to  this accord and its supplements (1, 2, and 3), the parties to  the coalition have agreed on the following:    "1. Continue the dialogue to unify the coalition's  vision of the issues that have been raised and that are attached  to this accord so as to help the government implement this  accord.    "2. The coalition will undertake to complete this task  within two weeks.    "3. The coalition will require its members in the  government to implement the contents of the cabinet statement.    "In view of the importance of some issues and of their  impact on security and on the stability of the citizens' living  conditions, the parties to the coalition have agreed on the  following:    "1. The coalition declares its adoption of a general  truce among the tribes. In accordance with this truce, the  practice of revenge shall be prohibited. Whoever engages in  taking revenge shall be considered an outlaw, and the state  agencies concerned shall take strict legal measures against him.  A national committee shall be formed to survey and deal with  cases of revenge occurring prior to the declaration. The  government shall incur any expenses required by this step. The  truce shall be declared within two weeks.    "2. The coalition shall assign the government to take  the steps necessary to arrest suspects whose names have been  mentioned during investigations of the assassinations and  assassination attempts, highway robberies, and of other security  violations within a maximum period of six weeks. Whoever harbors  a suspect shall be considered in violation of the law, and legal  steps shall be taken against him.    "Army forces shall be evacuated from major cities in  accordance with the unity accords. The Presidential Council  shall ratify Council of Ministers decree No. (....) on the  temporary administrative division of the republic.    "4. Monthly reports shall be submitted to the coalition  leadership by the authorities concerned on the implementation of  the contents of this accord and on adoption of the necessary  measures."  <H5>  Credibility Crisis </H5>   Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas went on to add, "This is a copy of  the letter that was not approved on 10 October. Now all 18  points are accepted. How come?"    [AL-KHALIJ] The GPC feels that the YSP is pushing in the  direction of escalating the conflict and is calling for  involving the opposition forces in the dialogue so as to broaden  its political base. What is your opinion?    ['Attas] Numerous documents developed by the GPC and the YSP  met their end before they were signed. We have had discussions  with each other, we have met repeatedly since last September,  and we have had discussions within the coalition. When we  submitted this proposal to the dialogue committee in the YSP's  name, it was a realistic and responsible proposal to overcome  the crisis and then to deal with issues calmly.    Now top-level GPC circles say that they will accept whatever  the YSP accepts.    There is an issue that has escaped many, namely the issue of  confidence. Because of the crisis, confidence exists no longer,  and herein lies the problem. The president has told me: I state  explicitly and say that I have accepted all 18 points. I  responded: It is no use now. We discussed all the details in  your presence, so why did you not say this?    The problem is that I doubt that the statements by the GPC  circles are sincere. In truth, the more important problem is:  How do we restore confidence?    Yesterday I received a report from the party in Ta'izz  indicating that the plan to assassinate (Anisi?), a parliament  member representing the YSP, and the party organization  secretary goes on. I sent the report today, Sunday, to the  interior minister and to the security agency chief to be  investigated. There are forces determined to engage in sabotage.  Even in the latest operation in which a U.S. information  official was kidnapped, the kidnapper used a car that carried a  forged license plate attributed to Aden.  <H5>  Security Secrets </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] What are the secrets behind the kidnapping?    ['Attas] This person is an army colonel named Mubarak Salih  Mashan al-Zayidi. He had previously carried out an act that  caused an oil pipeline to rupture and production to be stopped  for 48 hours. We decided to send a force to arrest al-Zayidi.  But tribal chiefs intervened to solve the issue. However, here  he is, persisting in his acts. By the way, he is not the only  one to engage in such acts. Before him, another man kidnaped  French tourists in the same province of Ma'rib. We said: Let us  punish this man. They responded: We will settle the issue  tribally. The man demanded a salary and some other things. An  offense against Yemen is something easy to these people.    [AL-KHALIJ] It seems that for the YSP, the security problem  is the most urgent problem.    ['Attas] Not just for the YSP, but for all of Yemen.    [AL-KHALIJ] The interior minister has held the Jihad  Organization responsible and has asserted that there are 15  Jihad members in jail and that efforts are being made to arrest  the others, totaling nearly 60 in number.    ['Attas] Jihad is one of the forces involved. These forces  were determined some time ago, and we embarked on a conflict  over arresting them and bringing them to trial. Even the  interrogation reports have been altered. This is amazing. The  security agencies and this alien organizations cross paths, and  perhaps the organization is used.    What offends the YSP even more is that after each incident  of  the sort, some GPC leaders say that it is the result of conflict  within the YSP. This has offended the YSP greatly. If the GPC  has such information, then it should seize those who are  responsible for the incidents, even if they are from the YSP.    When I received the first threat about a mine planted near  my  home, I was meeting with the deputy prime ministers. Suddenly,  the mine exploded and soldiers rushed to the explosion site.  There they were able to apprehend two people. The traces of TNT  were still showing strongly on the hand of one of the two men,  because he had planted the explosive and connected it to a fuse,  hence the traces on his hand. We apprehended the man and the  report, photographs, and all interrogation requirements were  prepared. The next day, security forces took the evidence and  altered the report at their laboratory. They said that the  traces the man had on his hand were those of qat, as if qat  contains TNT. They also said that the mine was not an antitank  mine but an anti-personnel mine, even though we know that the  mine was an antitank mine, and this is supported by photographs  and data.    The interior minister presented this modified report to the  Council of Ministers. We also discovered that the young officer  who had prepared the original report had been dismissed from his  work.    At the Council of Ministers, I said, "O interior minister,  there is a crossing of paths in your agencies." They then said  that the suspect, a 28-year-old man, is insane.    This is how an incident aimed against the prime minister has  been handled, and the prime minister cannot learn the truth!    This incident occurred in 1992. Afterward, assassinations  were perpetrated with the purpose of pressuring people. All this  happened after the security plan was drafted. This is why we  want to establish security first, and then the development and  reform program will follow.    The threats continued by phone. One day, I was sitting here  and I had the interior minister, his deputy, and some Interior  Ministry brothers with me. The telephone rang and the caller  said that Dr. al-Maqalih wanted to talk to me. So I took the  receiver to speak to al-Maqalih, but what I heard was a  different voice. So, I said to the caller, "You aren't  al-Muqalih." He said that he was and that his voice was  different because of qat. I gestured to the interior minister to  do something, if he could. Suddenly, the man started threatening  me on the phone. This happened in May, and they exploded the  mine afterward. What is surprising is that the voice was  familiar to me and that it rings in my ears. But I could not  identify it.  <H5>  Premeditated Violence </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] An observer notices that acts of violence were  perpetrated prior to the elections, were stopped during the  elections, and resurfaced prior to the latest crisis. How do you  understand this condition? Are the acts premeditated? Who is  behind them?    ['Attas] They are premeditated. It is as if they proceed "on  command." As to who the planners are, only God knows.    [AL-KHALIJ] The interior minister has told us that he will  announce all the facts very soon.    ['Attas] God willing. I had an appointment with them  regarding this issue for today, Sunday. But they have not  finished. There is a lot of information on violence, especially  by the Jihad Organization and by some other elements. Agreement  was reached on this issue, and we decided to arrest a group of  people, some of them residing in the southern governorates and  some here. Orders were issued to police stations. The brothers  in the southern governorates arrested the individuals wanted  immediately and brought them here. But here, the wanted, who  include officers, enter and leave Sanaa, and nobody dares arrest  them.    When I said that the wanted included officers, they asked:  Who? One of them is Najib al-Salahi, an officer in the first  armored division. When we raised his name, they said: We can  bring this one at any time. When I sent a message to the  interior minister to arrest them, no answer was given. A lot can  be said about this issue. The important thing is that security  concerns all people and that nobody can live without security.    In wake of the accord, acts of violence were premeditated,  and they "erupted and stopped" with some sort of intelligence.  While main elements of the YSP have been targeted directly, some  explosions have been staged near the homes of some GPC leaders.  Explosions have been staged near the homes of 'Abd-al-Karim  al-'Arshi and of al-Lawzi. But one feels that they are for  coverup so people will not say that the blows are aimed against  the YSP alone. There is a difference between shooting to kill  and shooting for some other purpose.    On 5 September, I went to discuss the security issue and to  debate Yemen's conditions with brother 'Ali al-Bid. I arrived in  Aden and during my meeting with brother 'Ali, the telephone rang  and I was told that it was the interior minister. He told me not  to worry about the bomb that had exploded near my home and said  that he was investigating the issue. Okay, who exploded this  bomb, and why? It is as if whoever did it wanted to say to me:  Why are you going to Aden? Leave the issue alone. Why do you  tackle it?  <H5>  Foreign Forces, But.... </H5>   [AL-KHALIJ] What are your reports and your information on  this issue?    ['Attas] There are parties hostile to the Yemeni people's  true aspirations. Jihad is just a part of the process. Even  Jihad is used by others. Our party has expressed its opinion,  and I have personally sent a message to the Presidential Council  on the issue. We want to deal with the problem. We know that  there are foreign forces working against unity. But the  executors are Yemeni citizens. We want to tell Yemeni citizens:  Break the ties with the foreign forces. We talk to these people  clearly, but we do nothing else to them. What more can we do?    I offered several proposals to end this issue: We can arrest  those responsible for what has been done, but we do not harm  them. We just tell them: Here are the facts, and here is where  you stop. Or else we can relieve the Interior Ministry leaders,  because they are unable to end this phenomenon. Or the Council  of Ministers can resign and a new government can be formed.    They responded: We will end the issue. We reviewed all the  names, and all they did was to arrest the famous poor young man  (al-Fadli) in Shabwah. He revealed all the names, but they have  done nothing important to end the crisis.    [AL-KHALIJ] In an interview with AL-KHALIJ two months ago,  brother Anis Yahya raised the issue of the escape of prisoners  from jail. When I raised this issue here in Sanaa, people  pointed out to me that the jail is under the control of officers  and officials from the YSP. What do you say?    ['Attas] I addressed a committee of the House of  Representatives and said that the mistake that the brothers here  made and whose negative consequences we are reaping now is that  the brothers here believed that everything in the south,  including people, land, and institutions, belonged to the YSP,  even though this is not true. (Here, Mrs. Amat-al-'Alim  interposed to say, "Thank God.")    (Al-'Attas went on to add:) We have been saying this for a  long time. But this mistake and others have caused the people in  the south to react, making them all insist that the YSP is their  representative in the unity. In the latest election, all people  in the south voted for the YSP, which was even the reason behind  the two GPC candidates who won in the south. (Again, Mrs.  al-'Alim interposed to say, "Regrettably, this is not good for  the country." The prime minister said Amen to her words).    (Al-'Attas further added:) Even we in the YSP did not expect  more than 50 percent of the southern vote. But because of this  position, people reacted, and they all considered the YSP their  true representative. We did not want this thing to happen.  Regrettably, there are many who have begun pondering unity in  its current form. Numerous mass organizations have begun to rise  and to move in this direction. [passage omitted]</p>

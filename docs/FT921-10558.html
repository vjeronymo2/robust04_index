			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Perrier The lull in the battle for Perrier, as all sides seek advantage in the courts, is another striking reminder of that great cross-frontier struggle in 1988 between Mr Carlo De Benedetti and Societe Generale de Belgique. Then, as now, an Italian was cast in the role of unwelcome guest at a Francophone feast. Then, as now, the local establishment enlisted outside support to repel the threat, and Parisian banks were at each other's throats. Even the contentious issuing of Perrier Treasury stock to Agnelli's allies at St Louis - the subject of the most important legal argument at present - has a parallel in the hasty issue of shares by SGB to its trusted friends. The interesting question is whether the hectic Brussels denouement, involving a frantic race for the last free shares, will be repeated. The odds must be against it. One of the differences this time is that Mr Gianni Agnelli, unlike Mr De Benedetti, is not an outsider. Pride would obviously not allow him to accept outright defeat, but, though some of his alliances appear to have broken down, they are probably strong enough to leave room for compromise.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (1): Free-spending days are over - All over the world, business travellers are under pressure to cut costs, fly economy and stay in cheaper hotels. At the same time, airlines and hotels are trying to make their guests feel their money is going further AS YOU lie sleepless in an unfamiliar hotel bed, wondering whether switching on CNN will provoke another round of irate wall-knocking from next door, comfort yourself by pondering the contribution you are making to a great industry. Not the chemical, pharmaceuticals or financial services industry, but the business of business travel. The money that companies spend ferrying employees from city to city, from sales presentation to conference to contract signing, now accounts for an average 2.5 per cent of European gross domestic product. German companies spend Dollars 38.8bn on business travel and expenditure annually. British organisations spend Dollars 30.3bn; French companies Dollars 25.3bn. Not that the average business traveller is seeing much of this lavish outlay. While the amounts spent on business travel might seem high, they are not growing. A recent 10-country survey by American Express found that European business travel expenditure is expected to fall by 0.3 per cent this year. In Sweden, it is expected to drop by 11 per cent, in Germany by 6 per cent, in Switzerland by 4.5 per cent. Expenditure will rise in some countries. The UK, after two depressed years, will see business travel spending grow by 9 per cent. Spain will enjoy growth of 4.4 per cent and Hungary, beginning from a low base, will see a rise of 14.3 per cent. Even in countries where expenditure is growing, however, the opportunities to enjoy business travel are becoming increasingly restricted. Business travellers are expected to spend fewer days, rushing to more appointments, flying ever further back in the aeroplane and staying in cheaper hotels. Mr Juergen Bartels, chief executive of the Carlson Hospitality group, which owns Radisson Hotels, offers this cheery thought: it is never going to get better. There are some signs that business travel expenditure increases as national economies improve, but Mr Bartels insists the free-spending days of the 1980s will not return. European and US businesses' painful restructuring in the face of Asian competition will keep costs under pressure until long after today's business travellers have retired, he says. There is, he adds, no point in building any new four- or five-star hotels in the US or western Europe. The demand will not be there. The American Express survey, which covers 3,500 companies, appears to bear out this pessimism. Although 64 per cent of European companies have taken recent initiatives to control travel expenditure, many feel they have further to go. Only 54 per cent of European companies say they are entirely satisfied with their cost-cutting efforts so far. The travellers likely to endure the least additional pain in the future are the Spanish and the British. Almost 90 per cent of Spanish companies say they are satisfied with their cost-cutting. Nearly two-thirds of UK companies say their travel expenditure is now under control. The travellers who are in for the toughest time are the French; only 26 per cent of companies in France believe they have successfully controlled travel expenses. Nearly three-quarters of European companies tell their employees which travel agent to use. About a fifth of those have changed their travel agent in the past two years, either because they were dissatisfied with the service they were receiving or because they thought the new agent could obtain larger discounts. But if employers are giving business travellers less money to spend, airlines and hotels are constantly looking for ways of making their guests feel their money is going further. Hotels and airlines are linking up to reward their most loyal customers. There are free flights for those who stick to one airline. Hotels are offering gifts for travellers to take home to their children. As in all industries, it is cheaper to keep old customers than attract new ones. As money becomes tighter, the business travel industry is poring over surveys of its customers, trying to determine who they are and what they want. According to the American Express survey, the European business traveller is still likely to be male. Only 13 per cent of European business travellers are women. This contrasts strongly with the US, where Mr Bartels puts the figure at close to 40 per cent. There are signs that European businesswomen are travelling more. In the UK, the proportion of women business travellers is now 23 per cent, double the number in 1989. In the financial services sector, 44 per cent of UK business travellers are women. In Spain, women make up 17 per cent of business travellers. The number of female business travellers in the other large European economies is still relatively low: in France it is 10 per cent, in Germany 11 per cent and in Italy 7 per cent. The industry expects the number of women to rise throughout Europe, particularly as economies continue the shift from manufacturing to service industries. However, many hoteliers are still ill-equipped to meet women travellers' needs, according to Mr Mark Harris, marketing manager of Expotel, a large hotel reservations agency. His company's market research shows that most women travellers are generally satisfied with hotel service standards. Hotel reception desks are usually given high marks for their endeavours to make women guests feel welcome. But hotels, particularly in the UK, still fail to provide the level of physical security that women travellers are looking for, Mr Harris says. Many British hotels do not have peepholes or chains on doors and car parking areas are poorly lit. He says Expotel's women customers also want a more discreet check-in process, so that only the guest knows the room allocated to her. Other complaints focus on the lack of facilities in rooms. While hotels provide trouser presses and suit hangers, many do not have skirt hangers, hair dryers, irons or ironing boards. Hotel restaurants are criticised for not providing tables for single guests. Twenty-four hour room service is regarded as essential by many women business travellers, Mr Harris says. While business travellers are encouraged to spend fewer days away from the office, they still resent the time spent away from their families, says Mr Michael Stajdel, head of European, African and Middle East marketing at Inter-Continental Hotels. When Inter-Continental asked its customers what they wanted from the chain, the most popular answer was to be able to being their spouses and partners along. As frequent flyer programmes can be used to win a free ticket for partners, many travellers have been asking for double occupancy of their hotel rooms at no extra charge. Another popular request was for transport from the airport to the hotel. Many said it provided a more comfortable start, particularly in cities where they did not speak the language. Given the pressures on them to show that their journeys have been worthwhile, today's business travellers also want hotels to make it easier to work while they are on the road. 'If we look at the research of 10 years ago, people said they wanted their hotels to be homes away from home,' Mr Stajdel says. 'Today they want them to be offices away from the office.' Some of the ways to ensure office-like efficiency in hotels are already standard, such as swift delivery of facsimile messages or fax machines in rooms. At the Inter-Continental in London, guests can leave a voice mail message in the language of their choice. Today's business travellers feel the need to be healthier and more alert. Hotels have built more health clubs as well as business centres. 'Whereas 10 years ago travellers would want a bottle of whisky, today it's fresh fruit and mineral water,' says Mr Stajdel.</p>

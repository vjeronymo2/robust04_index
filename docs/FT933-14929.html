			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / BP mothballs Baglan Bay ethylene production line BP CHEMICALS intends to shut down nearly half its ethylene capacity at Baglan Bay, near Port Talbot in South Wales. It plans to close the smaller of its two production lines at the site indefinitely. The decision will remove about 150,000 tonnes a year of ethylene from a European market which, according to BP Chemicals, is suffering from significant over-capacity and poor demand and prices. Ethylene is the raw material for most plastics. The line will not be restarted in October, after the two - with a combined capacity of 330,000 tonnes a year - are shut down for maintenance in September. BP says there will be no implications for its 900 staff at the complex, which is one of the largest employers in the region. The closed line will be kept operable in case demand and prices improve. Mr Stephen Pettit, chief executive for petrochemicals at BP Chemicals, has admitted the site is the division's most marginal. But it is reluctant to close the complex completely. The remaining production line, with a capacity of about 180,000 tonnes, will continue to provide ethylene for downstream activities including ethanol, vinyl acetate, styrene and isopropanol. Most European ethylene manufacturers are not covering their cash costs because of poor prices. Two new complexes - BP's 350,000 tonnes a year expansion at Grangemouth and EniChem's 360,000 tonnes a year plant at Brindisi - have taken European capacity to 18.5m tonnes a year, aggravating the supply position further.</p>

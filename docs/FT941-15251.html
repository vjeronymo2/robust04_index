			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Motoring: Take the rough with the tough - How to take snow and floods in your stride The first spell of severe winter weather concentrates the mind about four-wheel drives. People who already have one congratulate themselves on their foresight. And others who find themselves stuck on a snowy hill or stalled in a foot of floodwater think that perhaps they really ought to have one next time. I like to have an on-off road 4x4 on test at the turn of the year because if my part of Kent is going to have a hard winter, this is usually when it starts. The market in these vehicles is still expanding and the variety on offer is bewildering. This time, I chose a Jeep Cherokee Sport to be sure of staying mobile during the Christmas and new year break. Funnily enough, I still have not seen any snow this winter, apart from a sprinkling in November, so the Jeep's four-wheel drive traction was not needed. But its high clearance came in useful when the never-ending rain flooded many minor roads. Knowing the Jeep could wade through water much deeper than a normal car could cope with was a great confidence builder. Outwardly, the Cherokee Sport looks the same as the Cherokee Limited but instead of a four-litre in-line six-cylinder engine and automatic transmission, it has a 2.6-litre four-cylinder and five-speed manual gearbox. Both Cherokee Limited and Sport are four-door estates in which four adults sit comfortably on soft upholstery. A pair of labradors can travel in style behind, although the large, internally-stowed spare wheel does cut into the luggage space. Like the Cherokee Limited (from Pounds 18,995), the Pounds 15,995 Sport is exceptionally good value. Power steering, electric windows and outside mirrors, plus remotely-controlled central locking are standard. It is one of the most car-like on-off road 4x4s to drive, with a light - if long throw - clutch pedal and a gearbox as easy to use as a family hatchback's. The transmission is selectable; only the rear wheels are driven unless extra traction is needed when four-wheel drive can be had in high or low ranges. By on-off road vehicle standards it rides and handles well, is effortless to park and runs quietly. Although the Sport is geared much lower than the 4-litre Cherokee Limited, one has to shift fairly frequently because exhaust system vibration discourages low speed in fourth or fifth. Fuel consumption averages about 22mpg (12.85 l/100km). The Cherokee's styling is so restrained it is unlikely to frighten even thoroughbred horses and I felt it would sit happily among the Range Rovers and Fortnum's hampers at smart outdoor events. One could not say the same of Toyota's showy on-off roader, the 4Runner, which would look more at home pulling a flash looking powerboat than a couple of hunters. The 4Runner, which has been sold on mainland Europe for some years, is based on a pick-up truck. So is the Vauxhall (Opel) Frontera but whereas the Frontera is cheap (from Pounds 13,445 for a 2-litre petrol- engined 2-door Sport) the 4Runner is anything but. At Pounds 22,292 for the three-litre petrol V6 (Pounds 23,211 for a three-litre, four-cylinder turbo-diesel) it is priced closer to the Mitsubishi Shogun and well above the class-leading Land Rover Discovery. Toyota says by way of explanation that the 4Runner is aimed up-market of Frontera. On and off road, it goes well - the diesel in particular because its low-speed pulling power allows it to be driven almost as a one-gear car. But the interior trim is unexciting and maximising load space has made the rear seats quite cramped. Volkswagen's Caravelle Syncro looks like a van because that it what it is; a converted van with windows and up to eight seats. But forget the looks. It drives like a car, rides beautifully, is massively roomy and has permanently engaged all-wheel drive. Though not a proper on-off road vehicle, it can tackle muddy paddocks and rutted farm roads and would be ideal family ski-holiday transport. The Pounds 22,936, 2.5-litre, 5-cylinder version I drove was a quiet and comfortable motorway cruiser. Being box shaped, it was more parkable than it looked and the high driving position was appreciated in town traffic. I rate the Land Rover Discovery automatic diesel I am using now the best of its kind. The 2.5-litre direct injection engine has class-leading economy and fires up instantly on a sub-zero morning without the help of pre-heater glow plugs. It is growly when accelerating, quiet when it gets into top and the automatic transmission's shift quality is as good as you get in a luxury car. The up to seven-seat Discovery is just made for a country family needing a roomy school bus-cum-shopping car during the week and something to carry a shooting party's guns and gundogs at the weekend. It could not be easier to drive and, if used sensibly, has an unusually modest thirst for a burly on-off road 4x4 with two pedal control of around 27mpg (10.46 l/100km). Automatic transmission, which adds Pounds 1,150 to the price, would be worth every penny to many a Discovery owner who uses it as a daily on-road, mainly urban or suburban runabout. But, being a Land Rover, it still has more off-road capability than almost anyone could ask for, let alone really need.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: London Gilts have rallied over the past couple of weeks, helped by a general upturn in the international bond market, and there is little on the horizon this week to suggest a setback is in the offing. The central event of the week will be the convertible auction on Wednesday (see article below). According to Mr Ian Shepherdson of HSBC Greenwell, the issue is likely to have some appeal to domestic investors. There are few important economic statistics due, although the Confederation of British Industry's survey, published on Friday, may give further indications of the impact of April's tax increases on the recovery. Last week's figures provided some contradictory evidence on inflation, with the rise in average earnings outweighing the good news of a fall in the annual rate of underlying inflation. The market sees the earnings figures as an indicator of future inflationary problems, while the retail prices index merely reflects the past. With little on the domestic agenda to affect the market, the main danger may come from the US first-quarter gross domestic product figures on Friday. Too strong a GDP number would inevitably upset the Treasury bond market, with the normal knock-on effect on gilts.</p>

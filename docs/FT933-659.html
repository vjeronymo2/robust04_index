			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Hammerson The question unanswered by yesterday's interim statement is what terms Hammerson will offer for enfranchising its restricted voting shares. The broad hint from the company is that the 10 per cent price differential between its two classes of shares before May's rights issue will be taken as evidence of what full voting rights are worth. Ordinary shareholders might thus expect something like a 1-for-10 bonus issue by way of compensation. But there is doubtless room for haggling. Since the differential had shrunk to 8 per cent by yesterday's close, the market may now be anticipating something less.</p>

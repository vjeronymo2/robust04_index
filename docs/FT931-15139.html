			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: 'Massive interest' in Lilley businesses RECEIVERS to Lilley said there had been 'massive interest' in the businesses of the Glasgow-based contracting and construction group, which collapsed last week with debts of more than Pounds 80m. Price Waterhouse, the receivers, have put a deadline of noon tomorrow for inquiries about the businesses, which have work worth about Pounds 100m in hand. A further announcement, possibly relating to finalised trade sales or management buy-outs, will be made tomorrow afternoon. Meanwhile at Westminster, 18 MPs put their names to an early day motion expressing deep concern at Clydesdale Bank's 'cynical' decision to call in the receivers and the 'subsequent actions of the receivers in ending the trading of financially healthy subsidiaries of the Lilley Group.' The motion went on to note that the receivers were 'now stating' to companies owed money for work carried out for MDW, a Glasgow-based construction subsidiary, that 'debts outstanding of almost Pounds 16m have been transferred to Lilley Group plc, who will be unlikely to make these payments.' It called on the department of trade and industry to introduce regulations to safeguard the rights of viable companies in such circumstances. Mr Iain Bennet, the partner in charge of the receivership, said every effort had been made to continue the activities of the subsidiaries, although 343 people have so far been made redundant out of a total of 1,900 employed by the subsidiaries which are in receivership. Mr Bennet said it was true that trade creditors to subsidiaries were unlikely to receive any payment, but said this was inevitable when a group went into receivership and its assets and the likely proceeds of its disposals were greatly exceeded by its debts.</p>

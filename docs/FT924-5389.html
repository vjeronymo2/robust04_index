			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Council tax relief for 3.75m households SOME 3.75m households will benefit from transitional relief designed to ensure that no household is more than Pounds 182 worse off after the introduction of the council tax, which replaces the flat-rate poll tax. The scheme, announced yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, is slightly less generous than had been expected. Nonetheless, it appeared last night to have defused a potential rebellion by Tory MPs for London and south-east constituencies. They were concerned about the impact of the property-based tax in the region which has relatively higher property values. The system, which will cost Pounds 340m in the first of its two years, is tilted towards giving most help to people in the lower property bands. Those in the least expensive houses will have to bear an increase of only Pounds 91 a year before qualifying, while people in the most expensive homes must be paying an extra Pounds 182 before becoming eligible. Government estimates now of the number of those who will gain from the tax - just over half of England's 19m households - are notably lower than when the council tax was originally put forward. In April 1991, Mr John Major said that seven out of 10 households would be better off. The move was announced as Mr Howard released detailed figures for local spending, which suggest that council tax bills will range broadly from about Pounds 300 to more than Pounds 1,000 a household in England next year. Mr Howard said that, for the first year of the property-based council tax, the Environment Department had made its calculations on the basis of a Pounds 439 bill for a property worth Pounds 52,000 to Pounds 68,000 (band C), if the council spent in line with government assumptions. Two thirds of homes are in this band or lower. But other factors, such as poll tax arrears, and the slight scope for overshooting budgets even within the tough regime for limiting local spending, are likely to push the figures higher. Ministers are still smarting from the difficulties caused by providing illustrative figures for the poll tax. Mr Howard emphasised that the calculations were not his forecast or prediction of council tax bills, since levels would have to be set by individ-ual councils. That stance also reflects the highly charged political battle over whether central or local government should take responsibility for the level of bills and what happens to local services as a result of the local spending settlement. Mr Howard said there was no need for job losses provided councils 'behaved sensibly' but critics warned that the settlement would mean swingeing cuts.  --------------------------------------------------------------               PROJECTED AVERAGE COUNCIL TAX BILLS  -------------------------------------------------------------- Band                   Property value           Bill  -------------------------------------------------------------- A                 up to Pounds 40,000     Pounds 329 B        Pounds 40,000- Pounds 52,000     Pounds 384 C        Pounds 52,000- Pounds 68,000     Pounds 439 D        Pounds 68,000- Pounds 88,000     Pounds 494 E       Pounds 88,000- Pounds 120,000     Pounds 604 F      Pounds 120,000- Pounds 160,000     Pounds 713 G      Pounds 160,000- Pounds 320,000     Pounds 823 H                 over Pounds 320,000     Pounds 988  -------------------------------------------------------------- Calculations based on government estimate of Pounds 439 for band C if councils spend in line with its assumptions.

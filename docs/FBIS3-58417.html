			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, Jan. 12, IRNA -- Vice-Chairman of the Iranian  Majles Foreign Commission Mohammad Javad Larijani held talks  with President of the German Parliament (Bundestag) Ms. Rita  Suessmuth and other ranking officials on issues of mutual  interest, regional and international issues here Tuesday [11  January].    Among other things, the two discussed establishment of peace  in the Middle East, the situation in the Central Asian states  and former Soviet republics.    Underlining the importance of Iran-German parliamentary  friendship group, Ms. Suessmuth formally demanded that German  national, Helmut Szimkus, sentenced to death for espionage, be  pardoned by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah 'Ali  Khamene'i.    Referring to Iran's policy in Central Asian republics,  Larijani who arrived here last Monday, said Tehran was to  provide security to its borders with those countries.    He noted that the U.S. prevented Iran from having  cooperation  with the Persian Gulf littoral states and from setting up  regional cooperation to bring peace and stability into the  region.    Larijani also said Iran was for annihilation of arms of mass  destruction, atomic, chemical and biological weapons in the  region.    On Tehran's opposition to the PLO-Israeli accord, the  Iranian  official said Iran only expressed its political opinion in this  connection and it was not an obstacle to peace but was rather  for realization of a just and real peace.    The only way for real and lasting peace in the region was  consideration of equal rights for Muslims, Christians and Jews,  he noted.    "The Islamic Republic of Iran is always ready to use its  influence, if asked by Europe, in the region to establish real  peace," Larijani said.    In another development, Larijani had a separate meeting with  Deputy Economic Minister of Germany Dieter von Wuerzen who  stressed the importance of continuation and improvement of  Iran-Germany political and economic relations.    He also welcomed the proposal of cooperation among Iran,  Europe and the Central Asian republics and expressed Bonn's  readiness to play an active role in Iran's second five-year  development plan (1994-98).    Head of the German Parliamentary friendship group, Christoth  Matschie [name as received], also present in the meeting lauded  Iran's efforts for establishment of peace in the region, to  mediate between warring Azerbaijan and Armenia in particular,  and for hosting millions of Afghan, Azeri and Iraqi refugees.    He referred to the Rushdie issue, allegations on Iran's  involvement in assassination of kurdish leaders in Berlin and  Iran's disagreement with the PLO-Israeli accord as differences  existing between the two countries.    Larijani, in response mentioned the granting of asylum to  terrorist organizations by Germany, Bonn's failure to carry out  its obligation towards Tehran including completion of Bushehr  power- plant, negligence of German judiciary system regarding  hundreds of Iranian prisoners in Germany, the West's support for  Salman Rushdie and the biased stance and unrealistic attitude of  the German press against Iran.    He said Iran considered the West's support for Rushdie as  open hostility with Islam and Islamic sanctities.</p>

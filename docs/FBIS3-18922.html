Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Verona  agricultural fair, Agriculture Minister Alfredo Diana said he  did not rule out that Rome may wield the threat of a budget veto  if EU farm ministers agree with a Commission proposal not to  grant Italy an increase in its milk production quotas, as agreed  to last year.    "Each one uses the weapons at his disposal," Diana said.    Italy will have to pay about one trillion lire (595 million  dollars) in fines for having exceeded its production quotas from  1989 to 1991 and cannot take on additional financial burdens,  Diana said, referring to threats of a budget veto issued  yesterday by Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta.    "This is not blackmail but an evaluation of the domestic  budget made by Minister Andreatta," Diana said, adding that a  compromise solution to the Union's budget requirements and  Italy's agricultural problems will have to be found.    Andreatta yesterday cited "general policy reservations" in  barring implementation of the European Union budget reform that  had been agreed on at the Edinburgh summit of 1992.    EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday failed to  approve the budget reform, which would base contributions on  gross domestic product and in inverse proportion to value added  tax rates.    Andreatta said the way Italy now calculates its GDP puts it  at a disadvantage compared to other member states that have not  yet carried out the budget reforms, changing the way production  levels are estimated. Italy claims the discrepancy would force  it to pay as much as one trillion lire in additional budget  contributions.    Rome also argues that failing to increase Italy's milk  production quotas may cost it as much as five trillion lire  (2.97 billion dollars). Italy believes the EU has not moved  quickly enough on agricultural reform where Mediterranean  products are concerned and that further negotiations are needed  on agro-monetary realignment.</p>

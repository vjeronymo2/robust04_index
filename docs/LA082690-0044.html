			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VACATION HOME SALES TO SURGE, STUDY SAYS;  </P> <P> SECOND HOMES: ECOLOGISTS CONCERNED ABOUT INCREASED DEMAND FOR RESORT PROPERTIES  IN 1990S AS BABY BOOMERS MOVE INTO THE AGE GROUP THAT TYPICALLY BUYS THEM.  </P> <P> In the next 10 years, droves of baby boomers may be heading for the hills. And  for the mountains. And for the beaches.  </P> <P> According to a new survey financed by the real estate and resort-development  industry, demand for second homes may surge in the 1990s as baby boomers move  into the age group that typically buys vacation properties.  </P> <P> Demand for vacation properties may soar from its current level of about 135,000  purchases a year to as many as 450,000 a year, according to the study's  authors.  </P> <P> "Baby boomers generally are reaching that point in their lives where people  historically have purchased vacation homes," said Steven S. Miner, research  director of Eugene, Ore.-based Ragatz Associates Inc., which conducted the  survey.  </P> <P> But the shift of development to the nation's hinterlands already is a matter of  grave concern to environmentalists, who worry that more people and more traffic  in once-pristine areas will damage wilderness areas.  </P> <P> Now, in a new twist, some are advocating that the federal government take a new  look at the ways in which it is helping to accelerate the process.  </P> <P> A U.S. Forest Service report, based on public hearings and backed by  environmental groups, has suggested that the federal government should  reconsider the tax breaks it gives to people who buy vacation homes in such  ecologically important areas as New England's Northern Forest.  </P> <P> "The federal tax provision to deduct the interest on second-home mortgages may  encourage the demand for recreational development and could be partially  responsible for the increased rate of land conversion threatening the Northern  Forest," the report said. "While the purpose of the deduction is to stimulate  growth and construction, it may be having other effects in the Northern  Forest."  </P> <P> For many within the real estate industry, the mortgage-interest deduction is a  key issue.  </P> <P> Under current law, people who own second homes can deduct from their taxable  incomes the mortgage interest they pay on the properties. In other words,  depending on a household's tax bracket, the federal government will subsidize  up to one-third of the cost of owning a vacation home.  </P> <P> The Northern Forest environmentalists are focusing on tax policy as a way to  block development because the federal budget deficit means that little money is  available to purchase land to protect it, said Mason Morfit, executive director  of the Maine chapter of the Nature Conservancy, a group that buys  environmentally endangered land to preserve it.  </P> <P> "In this day and age, money is so tight that we thought the federal government  would be more willing to look at (changing) tax policy than at grants," Morfit  said.  </P> <P> The idea of environmentalists tinkering with real estate-related tax policy is  frightening to many in the real estate industry, who say that elimination of  the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes could prove catastrophic to  resort developers and rural areas that rely on tourism dollars to survive. They  say that without the mortgage-interest deduction, many vacationers would rent  rather than buy.  </P> <P> "This is a rather ludicrous proposal; it's so far-fetched it boggles my mind,"  said Chuck Houseman, sales manager for Litchfield Co., a resort-development  firm based in Pawleys Island, S.C. Houseman said land-use issues should be  decided locally, and not by tax policy.  </P> <P> To others, however, the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes is a  fairness issue, particularly in light of the perennial federal budget deficit.  </P> <P> Barry Zigas of the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, for one, said he  believes the current mortgage-interest-deduction system is inequitable. He said  money being spent by the federal government on tax breaks for vacation homes  for the affluent could be better spent helping house those who do not have  first homes.  </P> <P> The questions surrounding the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes  could gain further currency if the number of people buying vacation homes leaps  in the next few years, as predicted by the resort-development industry's  survey.  </P> <P> According to that survey, more than one-fifth of people under 39 years of age  expressed interest and said they had at least a 50-50 chance of purchasing  recreational property, with people under 30 particularly keen on the idea. In  contrast, 12.5% of those over 50-years-old expressed the same sentiments, the  survey found.  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Realtors, the International Foundation for Timesharing  and the American Resort and Residential Development Assn. Political Education  Fund paid for the study, which consisted of telephone interviews last spring  with 5,636 people nationwide.  </P> <P> Its other findings included:  </P> <P>  -- The highest rates of vacation home ownership are among households that are  headed by people aged 45 to 54.  </P> <P>  -- About 1 in 13 U.S. households owns recreational property.  </P> <P>  -- Time-share ownership of resort housing is increasing in popularity. Almost  half of all new second-home owners since 1973 have been time-share buyers.  </P> <P>  -- Florida is clearly the nation's second-home hot spot, with more people  identifying it as the place where they own a vacation home, or would if they  could.  </P> <P>  -- While married couples make up only about 56% of all households, they make  up more than 78% of all recreational property owners.  </P> <P>  -- People who already own homes are far more likely to also own a vacation  home. They are four times more likely to own recreational property than are  apartment renters.  </P> <P>  -- The median income nationwide of recreational property owners is $46,500,  but among families earning $100,000 or more, nearly one-third own vacation  homes.  </P> <P>  -- On average, recreational properties are little used: Total average usage  came to only about 58 nights per year, or about eight weeks of annual use.  About half that occupancy was by renters, with the owners, their relatives or  friends using it for the equivalent of the other month.  </P> <P>  -- More than half of the potential second-home purchasers said loss of the  mortgage-interest deduction would cause them to reconsider a vacation home  purchase.  </P></p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Britain frustrated at HK talks BRITAIN appears to be exhibiting greater frustration at lack of progress in talks with China on Hong Kong as an important British cabinet committee meeting on the colony approaches in London on November 10. Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's chief negotiator with China over Hong Kong, said yesterday there 'remains a substantial gap' between the two sides. Sir Robin, who is Britain's ambassador in Beijing, was speaking after the opening session of the 15th round of talks. Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten is to attend the cabinet session, called to discuss whether to proceed with plans to extend the franchise for elections due in the colony in 1994 and 1995.</p>

Every year when he  is in Shanghai, he has a talk with Shanghai municipal party and  government leaders, and expresses his views on the development  of Pudong and the further development of Shanghai; he even puts  forward suggestions for the CPC Central Committee. All this  serves to show his earnest concern for the city of Shanghai.  Deng Xiaoping blamed himself during his trip to southern China  in 1992: "Shanghai has all the conditions for faster  development, for it enjoys superiorities in able personnel,  technology, and management, and it has a greater capability for  spreading its influence. Looking back at what I have done! I  realize that one of my major mistakes is my failure to add  Shanghai to the existing four special economic zones. If I had  done so, the Chang Jiang delta, the entire Chang Jiang Valley,  as well as the nationwide situation of reform, could have  progressed in the same wave." Thus it can be seen that the  reason Deng shows special concern for Shanghai is that to him,  the overall situation of nationwide reform and opening up  depends on the development of Shanghai.  <H5>  There Is No Limit to the Emancipation of the Mind </H5>   This year, driven by his high hopes for Shanghai, Deng  Xiaoping set his foot in Shanghai earlier than previous years.  Accompanied by his daughter, Mao Mao, and others, he arrived in  Shanghai before New Year's Eve. After his arrival, he inspected  the grand Yangpu Bridge and the busy Shanghai streets around New  Year's Day, and expressed his views to the municipal party and  government leaders on how to speed up the pace of development in  Pudong and in Shanghai as a whole.    According to a source in Beijing, on 3 January, after  hearing  reports by Shanghai municipal party and government leaders on  Shanghai's development in 1993, Deng Xiaoping said: "I have  come to Shanghai every year in the past few years, and I feel  very pleased to see the development and changes that have taken  place in the city. Practice has proved that the line of  regarding economic construction as a central task is correct,  for it tallies with our national conditions and has won the  popular support. Shanghai has very good industrial, as well as  scientific and technological foundations, and enjoys superiority  in able personnel, so Shanghai should make greater  accomplishments in reform and opening up; should persistently  push forward Shanghai's reform, opening up, and economic  construction with high standards and from high starting points;  and should render service to the reform and opening up of the  entire country. To this end, leading cadres are required to  further emancipate their minds. It is true that Shanghai has  attained great achievements and that Shanghai's leaders are  open-minded. However, because society is undergoing development  and because great changes are taking place every minute, there  is no limit to the emancipation of our minds. Some people are  worried that they may make mistakes and go to extremes if they  overdo emancipation. Their worries are totally groundless.  Static and metaphysical concepts go against the basic outlook  of Marxism. In the final analysis, what these people have is  fear; they fear that the nature of China's socialist system will  be changed and that China will take the road of capitalism. Of  course, they have good intentions, yet some people inside our  party cannot bear the sight of many new things, even today, and  they have become critics and commentators. Now they are playing  a negative role and have hindered cadres from giving full play  to their initiative and creativity."    People from Beijing's political circles believe that by  claiming that "there is no limit to the emancipation of the  mind," Deng Xiaoping aimed to call on cadres in Shanghai and the  entire country to have the courage to open up a new situation in  reform and development, and to reach a new realm of thought in  the emancipation of the mind. Without constant emancipation of  the mind, our cause will not undergo constant development. On  13 January, Shanghai's JIEFANG RIBAO carried a commentator's  article entitled "Further Emancipating the Mind." The article's  detailed expositions of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on the issue of  emancipating the mind has drawn the attention of the entire  country.  <H5>  We Need To Employ New Ideas in the Course of Reform </H5>   According to the source, Deng Xiaoping added: "To push  Shanghai's economic construction to an all-time high, the key  issue is to employ new ideas in reform and opening up. This  task requires us to further emancipate our minds. To attain the  goal of further emancipating our minds, we need to overcome our  fear and have greater courage. We can achieve new ideas only  when we are willing to give it a try. To further emancipate our  minds, we should oppose arrogance and shatter complacency. Do  not be complacent over occasional successes. In short, to  attain fairly great development in our economy, we need to make  a change in our concepts. Yet we should not change only some of  our concepts and keep the others; neither should we change our  concepts in name only. "We communists advocate socialism.  What is socialism? To put it frankly, some of our comrades are  not clear about the definition, even today, or we can say that  they have not entirely extricated themselves from the set  patterns of dogmatism. The essence of socialism is to free and  develop productive forces, to eliminate exploitation and  polarization, and to reach the final target of common  prosperity. We should tell people this truth over and over  again until they can gain a thorough understanding," added Deng  Xiaoping.    Deng Xiaoping continued: "I made it clear two years ago  that we can hardly make new accomplishments if we do not have  the courage or the energy to open up new paths. There is  nothing in this world concerning which we can be 100-percent  sure of its success and correctness. We need to rely on  practice."    People in Beijing's political circles believe that by  calling  for "new ideas in reform and opening up," Deng Xiaoping actually  is making known his hope that cadres should give rein not only  to their enthusiasm, but also their initiative. There is no  mistaking the target of his remarks, for many cadres nowadays  are excessively sedate and lack initiative. They are afraid of  taking risks, of being "the first" to make mistakes in  explorations, and of losing their vested interests in reform.  If they are worried by so many things, how can they set up an  operational mechanism for the market economy and for pushing  economic development onto a new level? It has been learned  that, in order to counter this situation, the CPC top leadership  has decided to make a serious change to its customary way of  thinking concerning the selection of leaders, by which stress  generally was placed on cadres' enthusiasm, instead of their  initiative. It is imperative to have the courage to promote  young cadres who have great potential and who dare to open up  new paths. By so doing, we can appoint people on their merits,  and give them jobs suited to their abilities.  <H5>  Corruption Has Become a Malignant Tumor </H5>   The source noted that Deng Xiaoping also touched on the  current campaign against corruption. Deng Xiaoping indicated:  "If party members and party cadres are corrupt and abuse their  authority for personal gain, what right do they have to  represent the people, and how can the people support them? We  should dismiss cadres of this kind from their posts, and  resolutely send to the people's courts those who deserve it. We  must not be vague in this matter. Shanghai has attained results  in this field, and it is correct for Shanghai to focus its  campaign to build clean administration on department-level  cadres. Your former mayor, Zhu Rongji, also has made some  contributions to this achievement, and you should keep up the  good work in the future."    Deng Xiaoping is telling the truth. During his tenure as  mayor of Shanghai, Zhu Rongji always paid close attention to the  building of clean administration and set strict rules for  government cadres. At a people's congress meeting marking the  commencement of his term of office, Zhu Rongji made it clear  that his goal was to build a "clean, highly efficient, and  highly authoritative" municipal government. He often cited an  ancient saying: "The public will obey only a government that is  clean, not one that is strict. Clean administration is the  mother of authority." Shortly after he took office, Zhu Rongji  instructed the municipal supervisory bureau: Your primary task  is to keep a close watch on Shanghai's 506 department-level  cadres. He believed that clean practices can be spread among  all cadres of the municipality only when the senior-ranking  cadres of the municipal government succeed in maintaining their  cleanliness in administration. Under his leadership, the  municipal government drew up and put into strict implementation  rules for cadres on the building of clean administration, and  all violators have been handled sternly. Under the influence of  Zhu Rongji, Shanghai indeed attained remarkable results in the  building of clean administration.    However, the problem of corruption is becoming increasingly  serious on a national scale, and corrupt practices have become  common social phenomena, a malignant tumor, and the biggest  social contamination in mainland China today. Hu Anga1ng [5170  7254 6921] and Kang Xiaoguang [1660 2556 0342], two experts from  the National Conditions Analysis Group under the Chinese Academy  of Sciences, have submitted to the CPC top leadership a "Report  on National Conditions" entitled "Fighting Against Corruption  Through Innovations in the System," yet so far, people can see  no sign of new policy decisions by the CPC top leadership on a  radical cure of the problem. People now believe that it was not  alarmist talk when Deng Xiaoping pointed out 10 years ago that  "the trend of corruption has broken out with tremendous force.  If our party fails to pay serious attention on the problem and  to resolutely check the trend, our party and country will have  to face the possibility of changing color."</p>

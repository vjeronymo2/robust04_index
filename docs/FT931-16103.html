			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Muted reaction to cut THERE WAS a muted reaction in European interest rate markets yesterday to the Bundesbank's decision to lower its money market dealing rate, writes James Blitz. Yesterday morning, few dealers were under the impression that the Bundesbank would ease policy, in spite of continuing pressure inside the European exchange rate mechanism and signs that Germany is entering a deeper recession than had been anticipated. After a council meeting that went on longer than expected, the Bundesbank left its official interest rates unchanged. But it lowered the fixed rate at which it offers repurchase agreements in the German money market by 15 basis points to 8.60 per cent. The move on money market rates failed to have much impact in futures and cash markets. Some dealers suggested that if the Bundesbank lowers the repo rate again to 8.50 per cent, this would ensure that the official discount rate, which sets the floor for all German rates, would need to be reduced. However, Euromark futures were already pricing in a near-term cut in German rates before yesterday's move by the Bundesbank and the 15 basis-point reduction could therefore have made little difference to expectations. The March contract opened yesterday morning at 92.17, a level which prices three-month money at 7.85 per cent in the spring, 80 basis points below the current level. There was little more excitement in French franc futures. The March French franc contract closed 2 basis points lower at 90.44. In the French cash euro-cash market three-month money was a touch easier at 12 1/2 per cent from the 12 7/8 per cent rate of the day before. The main event in the sterling market was the difficulty in removing the shortage in the discount market, The sterling overnight rate peaked yesterday at 11 per cent after the Bank of England forecast a deficit of Pounds 1.45bn. According to one dealer, the market had been waiting for the Bank to repeat its offer of a repurchase agreement to March 1, at a rate of 6 29/32 per cent, because this was slightly cheaper than dealing in the longer-dated bills. However, the repo was not forthcoming, and late assistance, at Pounds 595m, was considerable. Three-month money finished slightly firmer at around 7 3/16 per cent.</p>

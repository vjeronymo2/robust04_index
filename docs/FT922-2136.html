			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Maastricht: If Ireland coughs, the rest of the EC is in for a prolonged cold - A look at the options for the Community IRELAND, as its prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, rightly said this week, has the eyes of Europe, and many other countries, on it today. If its referendum produces a majority, however slim, in favour of the Maastricht treaty, the treaty lives on - at least for a while. But, if Irish voters follow the Danes in rejecting Maastricht, even by a few thousand votes, the pact for European political and monetary union will die  -at least in its present form. Then, a second set of options would open up for European Community: settle for the current Treaty of Rome, try to renegotiate Maastricht, or let some EC states move ahead of the rest to form an inner core of tighter integration. But there is no agreed contingency plan to deal with a second No, any more than there was to deal with the first No. Denmark's 11 partners did move speedily, after the vote on June 2, to affirm their intention to pursue ratification of Maastricht, regardless. In the event of a second No, there will be no such speed or unity. On a very technical level, the Brussels lawyers still argue, Irish rejection would not kill Maastricht. EC constitutional revisions must be ratified in all member states, under the Rome treaty's terms. But there is no set time limit. EC leaders expressed the hope that Maastricht would be ratified this year. Yet, the treaty itself only stipulates that it would enter into force on the first day of the first month after the last member state ratified it. This, theoretically, gives parliaments and peoples an open-ended period in which to reverse any rejection. But real life in the Community is not like that, of course. An Irish No today would almost certainly lead to rejection in neighbouring Britain, where Mr John Major, the prime minister, already has an anti-Maastricht revolt on his back-benches, and prevent the Danes from changing their minds. Devising a special half-in, half-out status for Denmark is, or would be, bad enough; creating such arrangement for two other countries as well would be a nightmare. The French and German governments might try to plug on with ratifying an unchanged Maastricht treaty, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl indicated yesterday. But both he and President Francois Mitterrand (for whom an Irish No would vastly increase his risk in holding an autumn plebiscite on Maastricht) would first have to sell to their publics the idea of a two-speed Europe. Returning to an inner integrationist core of, perhaps, the original six members of the Community - Germany, France, Italy and Benelux - might in fact strike a popular chord among French, maybe even among Germans. Yet, for Paris and Bonn simply to decide to forge ahead with a smaller club of 'Maastricht-ers' would raise the question of how the Community is to relate to the wider Europe. For, also riding on today's vote in Ireland is the issue of enlargement, whose institutional implications the Commission was wrangling with again yesterday. One thing is now sure. The EC executive will be now be far more modest than it had planned in its report to next week's Lisbon summit about the institutional consequences of enlargement. Reports and misreports that Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, was planning an all-powerful executive in Brussels to run a more numerous Community boomeranged in the Danish referendum. But before entry negotiations can start with any of the seven countries which have now applied for EC membership, the applicants clearly need to know, or be told, what they are joining. The Maastricht commitment to a European union is the only current basis on which Brussels can start preparing to open negotiations with at least Austria, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland early next year. If Irish voters give Maastricht a fresh lease of life today, but ratification by other EC states drags on into 1993, it may still be impossible to start enlargement negotiations on time. 'We couldn't start this with Maastricht unratified and our negotiating flank exposed,' a senior Commission official said this week. 'We would find applicant countries picking and choosing what they liked, and didn't like, out of Maastricht.' Laying the ground for enlargement talks early next year is a high, perhaps the highest, priority of Britain's EC presidency in the second half of this year. If Irish voters were to vote Maastricht down today, finding any other basis on which to negotiate enlargement would be very tricky and time-consuming. That helps explain why Britain, which might otherwise hope to renegotiate a less federalist version of Maastricht, sees merit in sticking to the original.</p>

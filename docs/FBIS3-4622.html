They felt that the current robust economy would enable  Malaysia to continue to enjoy growth in investments from other  countries.    They were also confident that the country's economy would  remain strong even if Britain decides that Malaysia no longer  qualifies for overseas aid schemes like the Pergau dam project.    Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Britain could do as  it  pleased, saying that the decision will not affect our economy.    Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim  announced Friday the cabinet's decision not to award new  contracts to British companies following British newspapers'  allegation that certain Malaysian leaders were corrupt.    Energy, Telecommunications, and Post Minister S. Samy Vellu  said the British companies stood to lose projects worth 1.5  billion ringgit (about U.S.$555 million) from his ministry.    On Saturday, all the state governments expressed their  support for the cabinet decision at a meeting of the national  financial council chaired by Anwar.    At the meeting, all the state governments agreed to  implement  the decision.    British companies are expected to lose billions of ringgit  in  projects, including the 9-billion-ringgit (about U.S. $3.33  billion) international airport construction project in Sepang,  following the cabinet directive.</p>

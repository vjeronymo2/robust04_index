			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Argentine President Carlos Menem at the closing </F> session of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of state  and government, at the Convention Center in Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia, on 15 June -- recorded]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters of  Ibero-America:    In a few minutes we will be distributing to the media the  conclusions of this Fourth Ibero-American Summit. Following the  guidelines established at the Guadalajara Summit, it is my turn,  as president of the country that will host the Fifth  Ibero-American Summit, to speak of these two days of intense  work that we have conducted. These have been two days mainly  marked by a clear sense and concept of what democracy and  freedom are. Absolutely nothing was left to be discussed. All  the topics suggested for discussion were discussed in depth in  well-presented statements, and this has left us convinced that  there is no better way of making progress in development and  growth than this type of meeting that allows us to present our  proposals based on the experiences we have lived and are living  in our countries. Important issues that have been a matter of  discussion for a long time on other continents have become  crucial issues of these meetings, especially this fourth summit  that is about to end.    We are conducting a process in the image and likeness of  what  is happening in the old Europe. Europe has been discussing this  issue since the days of the so-called Steel and Coal Community,  for the past 40 or 50 years. We began this process of  integration and the establishment of free trade zone only 10  years ago, only a decade ago. The results to date have been  highly positive. We have centered our discussions, talks, and  proposals on the issue of trade. Don Manuel Belgrano, an  Argentine, one of our forefathers, a lawyer and great statesman  who later became, because of the circumstances in general of the  nation, once said that trade was the soul of the peoples. That  phrase continues to be true today. This is why we have also  centered our attention on trade as a proposal for development  and growth of our respective nations. This can be either  bilateral or multilateral trade. But this is mainly based on  the proposal for integration, on the proposal for free trade  zones that little by little are becoming a reality.    We have talked about the processes of transformation. We  have also said that there is no incompatibility between state  and market, especially the social or popular market economy. We  have also said that there is no incompatibility between  democracy and this new proposal in the fields of commerce and  industry; this is true at least for many Latin American  countries. However, we have also centered our attention on the  fact that these processes of in-depth change have, in some  countries, increased the poverty index. This is one of the main  concerns we, the men who are leading the destiny of our  countries, have.    But we have also reached the conclusion that there is no  better system of government than this one, the one we have in  practically all the Latin American countries; be it democracy  based on the presidential system, democracy based on a monarchic  system, or parliamentarian democracy. In the end, these are all  democracies. A sole and indisputable democracy without any sort  of gadgetry in which the people can fulfill their aspirations in  total freedom without obstacles or problems. The people can  also speak freely and without pressure. This freedom is the  main guideline on the path toward that future of greatness that  lies ahead for man if he learns that democracy is essential to  attain peace and in that world of peace, justice. Peace,  justice, and freedom are issues that evidently concern mankind.  It is our duty, the duty of the men chosen by the people, to  make this a reality.    Of course, we also talked about human rights. We have talked  about the right to life. We have talked about the mother and  the child. We will continue to talk about this until the next  summit.    If you were to ask me at this moment which of the four  summits has been the most positive, I would have to say -- and I  am not trying to say that the others were not -- that this one  has been the most important because of the issues discussed,  because of the freedom with which we expressed ourselves, and  because of the organization. This was an important and  effective summit.    As if this were not enough, during this closing session we  listened to the words of the Colombian president who closed,  with a golden broach, this meeting that next year we will repeat  in Argentina. The actual site for the next summit will be  chosen in the next few months. Perhaps we can hold the next  summit in one of the most European cities on this earth, Buenos  Aires [laughter], or in one of the most beautiful places of this  continent, in southern Argentina, in Bariloche. Perhaps even on  the beautiful beaches of Mar del Plata. But we will hold the  summit in a place where our guests will feel good and  comfortable and where they can enjoy the freedom and democracy  we, the Argentines enjoy and try to strengthen.    In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, freedom and democracy  are strengthened with greater freedom and greater democracy.  Thank you and I will see you in Argentina. [applause]</p>

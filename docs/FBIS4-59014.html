			<p>BFN     [Text] In deliberations conducted by the Prime Minister's  Office and the Foreign Ministry, it was decided not to abrogate  the Golan Law because it relates to the residents of the area  and not to the territory itself and because internal political  problems will make its abrogation difficult.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher is due to return to the  region next week to resume the negotiations between Israel and  Syria.</p>

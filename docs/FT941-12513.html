			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): US economic data help boost senior bourses Senior bourses galloped ahead yesterday, some of them giving due credit to better US economic data, but others advancing reasons of their own, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was gently better on the session and the Dax index closed at 2,133.47, up 8.33 on the day and 2.8 per cent better on the week. Turnover fell from DM9.5bn to DM8.6bn. However, the post-bourse was enlivened by comments from the Bundesbank's chief economist, Mr Otmar Issing - who forecast that M3 growth would normalise early in 1994, and that inflation would fall below 3 per cent in the second half of this year - and boosted further by better than expected US inflation and GDP data. The Ibis-indicated Dax closed another 23.14 higher at 2,156.61. The German and US economic news helped interest rate-sensitive, and exporters' stocks respectively, said Mr Harry Jaarsma at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt. Allianz rose DM52 from the previous Ibis-indicated close to DM2,802, and Deutsche Bank by DM18.50 to DM825. Among exporters, Volkswagen gained DM6.40 at DM439.40 and Linde DM11 at DM896. Daimler was one exporter which gained little, up just DM1.50 at DM810 after the James Capel downgrade in London on Thursday, and on pressure in the US market yesterday after Deutsche Bank launched another ADR offer in the stock overnight. ZURICH posted its fourth consecutive record close, the SMI index adding 45.5 or 1.5 per cent to 3,140.7, for a 3.3 per cent rise on the week. Early demand came from domestic investors on a forecast that Swiss inflation will fall below 1 per cent this summer. US investors were also active buyers late in the day. Roche certificates rose another SFr140 to SFr7,100, 6.7 per cent better on the week amid share split speculation, and market rumours that UBS was short in the stock. MILAN produced a second consecutive record performance, as foreign buyers turned their attention to the laggard telecommunications and insurance sectors. The Comit index rose 5.63 to 641.83, up 4.6 per cent on the week, in record turnover of L1,138bn. Montedison continued to climb, rising L70 or 6.4 per cent to L1,159, for a cumulative 16.7 per cent rise on the week. Volume of 154.7m shares again prompted speculation about stake building, although Consob, the market watchdog, said that it had received no notification of such a move. Sip closed L153 or 4 per cent higher at L3,991 after an apparent trading error saw it jump almost 10 per cent at one stage, forcing a temporary trading suspension. Stet rose L85 to L4,524. MADRID saw feverish buying late in the day and the general index hit a new high of 352.34, up 3.72, and by 3.1 per cent on the week. Turnover eased to Pta38.4bn from the previous day's Pta57.5bn. Interest rate-sensitives moved on the strong domestic bond market, the utilities, Iberdrola and Fecsa, rising by Pta55 to Pta1,175, and Pta45 to Pta1,060 respectively. PARIS was encouraged by a number of factors, including the US data which came late in the session, as well as technical trading. The CAC-40 index finished 32.22 ahead at 2,313.17, a week's gain of 3 per cent. Heavy US buying lay behind the rise among automotive stocks. James Capel in London recommended Peugeot on Thursday, noting that given the flat performance of the shares during 1993 'there is more than average scope for them to rise on recovery prospects.' The carmaker put on FFr28 to FFr855, while Michelin advanced FFr10 to FFr254.90. Euro Disney went against the trend, losing FFr1.45 to FFr35.05, following reports that the company was relying on survival from funds made available by its US parent, Walt Disney. AMSTERDAM's AEX index finished with a solid gain of 4.07 to 429.78, a week's rise of 0.3 per cent. Among the day's best rises was the 4.6 per cent recorded by Hoogovens, the steel and aluminium group, on a potential breakthrough in curbing global overproduction of aluminium. The shares closed up Fl 2.50 to Fl 57.00. Akzo was one of the few losers, closing off 70 cents at Fl 209, on worries about the interruption of electricity supplies to its plant in the north of the country on Thursday. The group said that there would be no impact on earnings. STOCKHOLM was heartened by the good US economic data and the Affarsvarlden General index rose 14.4 to an all-time high of 1,574.6. Volvo B rose SKr29 to a record SKr682. ISTANBUL pulled back from an early fall of nearly 7 per cent as domestic investors, who have been behind the market's 30 per cent decline in local currency terms this week, returned as buyers. The composite index closed down 4.9 per cent at 18,562. Following the devaluation of the Turkish lira on Wednesday, overnight interest rates were raised to 400 per cent as the central bank tried to protect the currency. Local investors were also encouraged by a statement from the prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, that she was considering new tax incentives to encourage equity investment.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> N. Judicial Review of an Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There were a number of comments concerning judicial review of assessments performed in accordance with the rule. Some commenters supported the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice that the rebuttable presumption attaches only to those assessments that are performed in accordance with the entire rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters disagreed, stating that the different components of the rule are not inextricably intertwined and that trustee officials need the flexibility to decide which aspects of the rule are appropriate for a particular assessment. These commenters stated that the language of section 107(f) of CERCLA, which grants a rebuttable presumption to assessments performed ``in accordance'' with the rule, allows trustee officials to obtain a rebuttable presumption for any portion of an assessment that is in accordance with the rule. These commenters thought that if trustee officials assessed one component of damages following the rule and another component without following the rule they should still be able to obtain a rebuttable presumption for the component that was assessed in accordance with the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department's statement that the rebuttable presumption attaches only to those assessments performed in accordance with the entire rule was not intended to suggest that trustee officials would lose the rebuttable presumption if they supplemented the damage claim assessed under the rule with additional claims assessed without following the rule. The rule provides both an overall administrative process for development and review of documentation as well as a range of alternative methodologies for the actual determination and quantification of injury and damages. In order to obtain a rebuttable presumption, a trustee official must follow the entire administrative process set forth in the rule. If the trustee official has followed the administrative process, the rebuttable presumption attaches to those components of the damage claim that were calculated through the use of the methodologies described in the rule. However, trustee officials are not required to use all of the listed methodologies in order to obtain a rebuttable presumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, if trustee officials decide not to use the rule to assess damages for injury to a particular resource, they need not follow those portions of the rule that describe the methodologies for determining injury to such a resource. In that case, the trustee officials could still obtain a rebuttable presumption for damages for injury to other resources that were calculated using methodologies described in the rule. Similarly, if trustee officials decide not to use the rule to assess damages for a particular element of lost use of an injured resource, they need not follow those portions of the rule that describe methodologies for calculating compensable value for such an element. In that case, the trustee officials could still obtain a rebuttable presumption for damages for other elements of lost use that were calculated using methodologies described in the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter disagreed with the Department's statement that CERCLA does not grant a rebuttable presumption to assessments performed by tribal trustee officials. This commenter stated that when SARA was passed, Congress intended to grant tribes the same authority as States in the area of natural resource trustee activities. The commenter further stated that under established case law concerning the Federal government's fiduciary responsibility to tribes, any ambiguity in the statute concerning tribes' right to the rebuttable presumption must be construed in favor of the tribes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, a few commenters agreed with the Department's statement that CERCLA does not grant a rebuttable presumption to tribal assessments. However, these commenters expressed concern that the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice that assessments performed jointly by Federal and tribal trustee officials or by State and tribal trustee officials would qualify for a rebuttable presumption. These commenters thought that such an interpretation would circumvent the language of the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 11.91(c) of the rule was revised in 1988 to reflect the SARA amendment to CERCLA granting a rebuttable presumption to natural resource damage assessments performed by State trustee officials. In the preamble to that rule, the Department stated that SARA did not extend the rebuttable presumption to assessments performed by tribal trustee officials. 53 FR 5167. The Department went on to state that ``Federal trustees and Indian tribes can work closely together in assessments, and such assessments would qualify for a rebuttable presumption.'' Id. at 5168. Further clarification of this issue is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

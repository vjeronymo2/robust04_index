			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Simex settles in to niche market - The Singapore exchange has renewed links with the CME The advent of global electronic futures trading, the growth of Japanese derivatives exchanges, and the ballooning over-the-counter market in Asian securities has done little to dent the success of the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (Simex). Last week Simex, conceived 10 years ago as a vehicle for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to deliver financial futures contracts to the Asian time zone, renewed its partnership with the CME and won the rights to trade futures on a prized Japanese stock index. At the same time, Simex officials are negotiating a co-operative trading arrangement for crude oil futures and options with London's International Petroleum Exchange, and are in talks with other derivatives exchanges in Europe and North America to share Simex's trading window into Asia. Simex was the first financial futures exchange in Asia, the first Asian exchange to trade energy derivatives, the first exchange in the world to trade Japanese stock index futures, and the only exchange to agree that trades made on its floor could be offset on another exchange in a different time zone. This last arrangement, called mutual offset, was renewed last week between the Simex and the CME for another five years. The fact that the arrangement survived despite the CME's aggressive backing of Globex, the international electronic futures trading system, provided proof that the open outcry method of trading is still preferred by many traders. As part of the renewal agreement, Simex officials will support the entry of Globex terminals into Singapore. In Florida last week for the Futures Industry Association conference, Mrs Elizabeth Sam, Simex president, seemed little worried by the prospect of electronic competition. 'We have learned from our own experience that the open outcry system is a better system,' she said. Although neither exchange releases statistics, industry sources estimate that 2.5m Eurodollar futures traded under the mutual offset pact between Simex and the CME last year. In 1993, Simex traded 15.7m contracts. Eurodollar futures, with a turnover of 5.5m, was its largest contract. The Simex mutual offset arrangement generates far more volume for the CME than Globex. Recently, the CME decided to pump up its volume figures by counting Simex mutual offsets. This made Simex an important factor in the CME's struggle to hold its place as the world's second busiest futures exchange, behind the Liffe. Simex's second-largest contract is the Japanese Nikkei 225 stock index future, with volume in Singapore growing at the expense of the Osaka Securities Exchange. Last year's poor stock market performance in Japan was blamed in part on suspected manipulation of the Nikkei 225 futures traded in Osaka. That forced higher margin and commission rates, making Singapore a cheaper place to trade.</p>

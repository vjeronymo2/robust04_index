			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Multimedia moguldom Viacom's Sumner Redstone marked his victory in the Dollars 10bn battle for Paramount Communications by declaring that the combined group would become a 'global media powerhouse of unparalleled proportions'. Are these the extravagant remarks of an empire builder who has overpaid? The visions of a far-sighted entrepreneur? Or the unhealthy ambitions of a would-be monopolist? The answer is probably a bit of all three. It is not hard to make the case that Viacom has overpaid. The Dollars 10bn price tag was only achieved after a fierce auction which pitted Mr Redstone against QVC's equally determined Barry Diller. Paramount's financial performance has been lacklustre. There is also Wall Street's verdict: Viacom's shares have tumbled since the battle began in September. The glamour of owning a Hollywood studio is certainly part of the story. But this is not a classic case of managerial capitalism run wild. Mr Redstone is Viacom's majority shareholder, so it is largely his own fortune at risk. That also gives him the incentive to apply his undoubted drive to make the takeover pay. Enthusiasts say the potential synergies are huge. Paramount's principal expertise is in film production. Viacom's is the ability to package and market entertainment globally. Add to these Blockbuster, the video retailer which is subject to a related Dollars 8.4bn merger with Viacom, and you have a killer combination. Joining forces The key is to maximise the value of each 'software property' by distributing it in as many different formats, channels and markets as possible. Brands such as Paramount's Star Trek or Viacom's Beavis and Butthead can be exploited in cinemas, videos, TV programmes, video games, theme parks and upcoming multi-media formats. When packaged with other brands as cable TV channels, they can be sold from Budapest to Bombay. Paramount and Viacom are already doing some of these things. But, say enthusiasts, they will be able to get a much bigger bang for their buck by joining forces. Booz Allen, a management consultancy group hired by Paramount, estimates earnings could rise by Dollars 280m a year. The tale is seductive. It clearly makes sense to sell the same product in as many different ways as possible. But why is vertical integration necessary to achieve this? Wouldn't Viacom do better to pick the best software from a range of producers? Wouldn't Paramount benefit from choosing the best distributor for each market? Integrated group There are two answers. One is that the full benefits of marketing through multiple channels cannot be achieved by arm's-length relationships. To maximise their returns from a particular property, companies must be able to control the timing of its release in each format and co-ordinate the marketing through different channels. This is only possible with an integrated group. Set against this is the fact that large integrated organisations have their own bureaucratic problems. Putting two businesses together within the same organisation does not guarantee successful co-operation. One only has to look at another mega-media merger, Time Warner, to see that much talked-of synergies often come to little. It remains to be seen whether Viacom-Paramount-Blockbuster will be more dynamic. The second explanation for integration is that entertainment companies do not have the luxury to buy products or distribution channels on the open market. Hollywood has long been an oligopoly. This is because the large studios control access to cinemas. As a result, the many independent producers have little option but to deal with the big players. Now, the theory goes, this oligopolistic structure is migrating to other media. In addition to Viacom and Time Warner, there are Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Japan's Sony and Matsushita, which all own Hollywood studios. Commercial power comes from being within such integrated structures. While such an oligopoly would be cause for concern, it may never emerge. New technologies are altering the economics of entertainment all along the value chain from production to distribution. Mr Redstone's empire may not last as long as he would like.</p>

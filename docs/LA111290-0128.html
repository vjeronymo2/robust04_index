			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GM PLANNING 10 SATURN MODELS  </P> <P> General Motors Corp.'s Saturn subsidiary is planning to produce 10 models by  1994 and possibly expand its current one-plant operation, a trade journal said  today.  </P> <P> Saturn Corp. sent three car models -- single- and twin-cam sedans and a sporty  coupe model -- to showrooms Oct. 12.  </P> <P> The Automotive News reported in today's editions that the company will add a  luxury sedan and coupe, a coupe convertible, two station wagons and two  two-door hatchbacks. At least two of those vehicles will be added in each of  the next three model years, the publication said.  </P> <P> Saturn's $2-billion Spring Hill, Tenn., plant can produce up to 240,000  vehicles annually. Automotive News said production there is scheduled to reach  303,000 by the 1993 model year and 360,000 the following model year.  </P> <P> That will probably force Saturn to build a second plant or expand the existing  facility, it said.  </P></p>

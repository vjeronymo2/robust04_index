			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW JAGUAR WILL GO 200 M.P.H. AND COST $587,000  </P> <P> British luxury car maker Jaguar said today that it will produce a new  200-m.p.h. sports model to compete with Ferrari and Porsche.  </P> <P> The Jaguar XJ220 will have a price tag of about $587,000 and production will be  limited to an initial 220 cars, or at most 350 if there is enough interest.  </P> <P> Jaguar's chairman, Sir John Egan, announced the new car just two days after the  $2.6-billion takeover of the company by Ford Motor Co. was finalized.  </P> <P> Jaguar unveiled a prototype of the XJ220 last year, but executives at the firm  feared that it would never go on sale because flagging profits would prevent  production.  </P> <P> Customers are asked to put down an $80,000 deposit, and they will have to wait  until 1992 before the models roll off the production line.  </P> <P> The wait could be worth it. The Times of London estimated that collectors will  be prepared to pay $1.6 million because of the tiny production run.  </P></p>

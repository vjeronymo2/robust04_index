			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> ROYSTER, LOCKWOOD JOIN FAST COMPANY  </P> <P> When was the last time USC had a 200-yard rusher and a 100-yard rusher in the  same game, as it did Saturday night against Washington State, when tailback  Mazio Royster ran for 203 yards in 34 carries and fullback Scott Lockwood ran  for 102 yards in 20 carries?  </P> <P> It hasn't happened since 1929, when Russ Saunders ran for 234 yards, Jess Hill  ran for 166 and USC piled up 753 yards on the ground in the first USC-UCLA  game.  </P> <P> USC won, 76-0. Its rushing yardage is still a conference record.  </P> <P> Quarterback Todd Marinovich hasn't thrown a touchdown pass since Sept. 15, when  he passed five yards to tight end Frank Griffin with 3:05 left in the first  quarter of a 19-14 victory over Penn State. That's 15 quarters without a  touchdown pass for Marinovich, who threw three in USC's opener against Syracuse  but has only one since. JERRY CROWE  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBERT HILBURN: A ROCKY START FOR DEACON BLUE  </P> <P> Rule No. 1 for a highly touted British band making its local debut: However  ecstatic the crowds were back home, don't come on stage here expecting -- or,  even worse, trying to force -- immediate frenzy. It's better to underplay than  overplay.  </P> <P> Rule No. 2: Don't chide folks seated at the rear tables for not getting up and  dancing midway through the show. You're just pointing out that the music itself  hasn't been sufficiently stirring to make those people want to leave their  chairs.  </P> <P> Deacon Blue lead singer Ricky Ross ought to paste the rules on his next U.S.  tour itinerary. By breaking both of them Thursday night at the Roxy, he got his  highly touted Scottish rock band's first local appearance off to a decidedly  clumsy start.  </P> <P> Ross rushed on stage shortly after 10 with the anxious energy of a man about to  yell "Fire!"  </P> <P> As the rest of the six-piece group got settled, he paced back and forth,  striking a few Springsteen-ish rock-hero poses before lunging at the microphone  and singing Buddy Holly's old hit "Not Fade Away" with the urgency of someone  who thought he had just seen the new "future of rock 'n' roll" -- in the  mirror.  </P> <P> The idea was to create an immediate explosion -- a connection with the greats  in rock history -- and it may have worked some nights back on the campaign  trail in Britain. But it just seemed awkward and even a touch embarrassing this  night.  </P> <P> This wasn't a room filled with devoted followers, but mostly curious onlookers  who must have felt they were part of some video shoot. There was such a sense  of exaggerated emotion in Ross' manner that he seemed to be acting out some  triumphant concert moment for, say, the upcoming "Eddie and the Cruisers II."  Ross -- with his boyish, clean-cut appearance -- even resembled "Eddie's"  Michael Pare. You kept waiting for someone to yell "Cut."  </P> <P> If all this helped keep it from being a night to remember, there were moments  in the final half of the 90-minute show -- after Ross loosened up -- that  suggested Deacon Blue is a band worth watching. Ross, who put the band together  in 1985, shares the rock-as-inspiration sensibilities of such figures as  Springsteen and U2's Bono Hewson, and he writes appealing, compact songs. He  also showed late in the show that he could relate to an audience on a more  convincing and intimate level.  </P> <P> Ross' tunes on Deacon Blue's first album, "Raintown," carry an especially  strong sense of detail and emotion. While the lyrics on the new "When the World  Knows Your Name" sometimes lack definition, the music itself is brighter -- a  touch of post-Motown snap and the Celtic soul of Van Morrison. There are some  imaginative touches in the arrangements, including the way Lorraine McIntosh's  vocals interlock with Ross'.  </P> <P> The Roxy show was part of a brief, introductory U.S. tour. If Ross can learn to  be more personal and less of a role player next time around, the band could  well be quite special.  </P> <P> Thursday's show was opened by Toad the Wet Sprocket, a promising young Santa  Barbara band (lead singer Glen Phillips is just 18) with a strong R.E.M.  instrumental shading. While the quartet's arrangements tend to be somewhat  colorless and a little flat, there is an interesting blend of youthful idealism  and wary pessimism in Phillips' frequently imaginative lyrics.  </P> <P> THE STONES' SHOWS: According to Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stones -- who will be  at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Oct. 21 with Guns N' Roses and Living  Colour -- have rehearsed 45 to 50 songs for their upcoming tour, but are now  concentrating on about 30 for the show, which he estimates will run about two  hours.  </P> <P> "My attitude is you can't play a high-energy show for more than two hours," he  said by phone this week from Washington, Conn., where the band has been  rehearsing for the group's first U.S. tour in eight years. "You can go three  hours if you play a lower-energy show and take some rests and throw in a few  long ballads. We're aiming for more energy this time and two hours is about the  max for that."  </P> <P> Jagger said that he never doubted the Stones would eventually tour again,  despite his break from the band to record two solo albums and play brief solo  tours in Japan and Australia. Those moves were bitterly criticized by Stones  guitarist Keith Richards, who followed with his own solo album and U.S. solo  tour.  </P> <P> "I enjoyed very much the solo tour, especially Australia because there were  more shows than in Japan and I got my teeth into it," Jagger said. "But I  always thought we would do this tour this year. The only question I had was  whether we could get the record done in time.  </P> <P> "I think the new record is a great improvement over 'Dirty Work,' " Jagger  added, comparing "Steel Wheels" (due in stores Aug. 29) to its 1986  predecessor. "That album had a couple of nice things in it but, on reflection,  not a lot of depth. This one has a lot more variation musically and lyrically."  </P> <P> LIVE ACTION: Tickets for the Rolling Stones' Coliseum concert go on sale at 9  this morning at Ticketmaster outlets in Music Plus stores throughout Southern  California. . . . Fine Young Cannibals will be joined by Neneh Cherry on Oct. 7  and 8 at the Universal Amphitheatre. Tickets on on sale Friday. . . . Ringo  Starr and Santana have both added second Greek Theatre appearances, Sept. 4 and  14, respectively.  </P></p>

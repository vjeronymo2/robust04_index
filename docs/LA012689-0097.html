			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATTEMPT TO INTERVENE IN EPA SUIT REJECTED  </P> <P> A U.S. District Court judge has rejected an attempt by two business groups to  intervene in a lawsuit by local environmentalists to require the Environmental  Protection Agency to enforce federal clean-air standards in Ventura County.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Economic Development Assn. and the Building Industry Council  of Southern California asked the court last month to add their voices to the  lawsuit as a way of considering the "concerns of all of the citizens of Ventura  County, and not simply those of one special interest group."  </P> <P> Attorneys for Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, which filed its suit against the  EPA on Feb. 24, 1988, said the request was inappropriate and would interfere  with an impending settlement between the group and the federal agency.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp, who agreed that the request for intervention  was not timely, said the two business groups could review and comment to the  court on any proposed settlement.  </P></p>

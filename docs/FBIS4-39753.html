			<p>BFN     [Text] First Vice Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets believes  that the word "crisis" should be prevalent while describing the  current situation in Russian industry. He made this statement  at a government meeting in Moscow Thursday.    Soskovets harshly criticized the leaders of some federal  ministries and agencies, including the Machine-Building  Committee and the Atomic Energy Ministry, for poor discipline  and feeble control over the situation in specific branches.  Commenting on the performance of a number of federal executive  bodies, he said "We are doing our job very badly."    Soskovets said the government meeting had summed up the  results of its performance in the first half of the year. "There  are no outstanding success in the sphere of industrial  production, an unbiased assessment is needed," he said, adding  "the movement of reforms will depend on how we use the executive  power we are entrusted with."    Soskovets said Russia had lost its positions on the world  arms market. Soviet arms exports totalled 30 percent of the  world market compared to the USA's 35 percent.    Now the situation has thoroughly changed, he said. Russia's  exports amount for a mere five percent, while the U.S.A.  controls 65 percent of the world arms market. "We have suffered  great losses in this area, it is necessary to restore our  positions gradually, step by step," Soskovets said.</p>

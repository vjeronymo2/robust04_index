			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Economic theory comes under fire: British Association for the Advancement of Science ECONOMIC THEORY has failed to answer important questions about how some countries' economies expand while others contract, Professor Paul Ormerod of Manchester University told the association. Prof Ormerod, the chief economist of the Henley forecasting group, said economic thinking was out of touch with the real world and in a 'true crisis'. Little in the standard economics textbooks was known to be true, while forecasters made serious errors. In particular, economics had failed to explain the main factors behind long-term economic growth, and why unemployment has risen in many western nations since the 1970s. He also criticised the way western economists pressed east European nations to move to free-market economies as soon as possible. The association welcomed this week's GCSE results, the main examination for 16-year-olds in England and Wales. The association said it was particularly pleased about the rapid increase in entries to the broadly based science exams, which had risen from 145,000 in 1991 to 240,000 this year. Professor Jeff Thompson, association chairman, said the switch from individual science subjects - biology, chemistry and physics - to 'broad and balanced' science was good news because 'it will provide a better understanding of science as part of a general education for the majority of students'.

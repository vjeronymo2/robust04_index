			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Yong-won] </F>   [Text] It has been learned on 8 May that the headquarters  of the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] is positively examining  putting its cooperative duties with the U.S. forces in written  form. This is in regards with U.S. reinforcements that are to be  deployed to areas of the ROK Second Army in the event of an  emergency and to protect related equipment.    The step was taken upon the request made by the U.S. forces  in the ROK in early April to put into written form the ROK-U.S.  consultations on the ROK Second Army's wartime operations. The  Second Army, which controls most of the rear with over 100,000  force-in-beings and one million reserves, covers the broadest  area among the three ROK Armies.</p>

Once items of usable special tooling required by the Government are identified, the Contracting Officer may_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Direct the Contractor, in writing, to transfer specified items of special tooling to follow-on contracts requiring their use. The notification shall specify whether the Government is taking title to the special tooling or reserving the right to take title. Those items specified by the Contracting Officer shall be subject to the provisions of the gaining contract(s); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Request the Contractor to enter into an appropriate storage contract for special tooling specified to be retained by the Contractor for the Government. Tooling to be stored shall be stored pursuant to a storage contract between the Government and the Contractor; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Direct the Contractor to transfer title to the Government (to the extent not previously transferred) and deliver to the Government those items of special tooling which are specified for removal from the Contractor's plant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Contracting Officer may direct the Contractor to sell, or dispose of as scrap, for the account of the Government, any special tooling not specified by the Government pursuant to subparagraph (i)(1) of this clause. To the extent that the Contractor incurs any costs occasioned by compliance with such direction, for which it is not otherwise compensated, the contract price shall be equitably adjusted in accordance with the procedures of the changes clause of this contract. The net proceeds of all sales shall either be credited to the cost of contract performance or otherwise paid to the Government as directed by the Contracting Officer. Sale of the special tooling to the prime contractor or any of its subcontractors is subject to the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Contracting Officer may furnish the Contractor with a statement disclaiming further Government interest or right in specified tooling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If the Contracting Officer fails to give disposition instructions as required by subparagraphs (i)(1), (2), or (3) of this clause, the Contractor may, at Government risk and expense_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Retain the special tooling in place; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Remove and store the special tooling at the Contractor's plant or in a public warehouse consistent with sound industrial practice and the item's security classification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer by certified mail, at least 30 days in advance, before taking any action under this subparagraph. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except as provided in this subparagraph, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for failure to give written notice required by subparagraphs (i) (1), (2) or (3) of this clause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Restoration of the Contractor's premises.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the Government has no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the Contractor's premises under any circumstances (e.g., abandonment, disposition upon completion of need, or upon contract completion). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Access to special tooling.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Contractor shall provide access to special tooling subject to this clause at all reasonable times to all individuals designated by the Contracting Officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Storage or shipment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Contractor shall promptly arrange for either the shipment or the storage of special tooling specified in accordance with the final disposition instructions of this clause. Tooling to be shipped shall be properly packaged, packed and marked in accordance with the directions of the Contracting Officer. All operation sheets or other appropriate data necessary to show the manufacturing operations or processes for which the items were used or designed shall accompany special tooling to be shipped or stored or shall otherwise be provided to the Government as directed by the Contracting Officer. To the extent that the Contractor incurs costs for storage, shipment, packing, crating, or handling under this paragraph and is not otherwise compensated for, the contract price shall be equitably adjusted in accordance with the procedures of the changes clause of this contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Subcontract provisions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To perform this contract, the Contractor may place subcontracts (including purchase orders) involving the use of special tooling. If the full cost of the tooling is charged to those subcontracts, the Contractor agrees to include in the subcontract appropriate provisions to obtain Government rights and data comparable to the rights of the Government under this clause (unless the Contractor and Contracting Officer agree, in writing, that such rights are not of interest to the Government). The Contractor agrees to exercise such rights for the benefit of the Government as directed by the Contracting Officer. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (End of Clause) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6895 Filed 3&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;34&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / City faces rise in terror premiums THE GOVERNMENT is to press Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurer, to increase terrorism insurance rates in spite of opposition from the insurance industry and businesses. The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that new rates would be introduced on Pool Re policies sold after July 1. As a result some businesses in London could face premium increases of between 200 per cent and 300 per cent. Some smaller businesses outside London could benefit from rate reductions. The new rates will be based on recommendations of consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow's review, presented to Pool Re earlier this week. The Association of British Insurers said this week that further increases in rates would lead many businesses to cancel terrorism cover. It confirmed that Mr Ian Rushton, the ABI chairman, had told the DTI late yesterday that the board members of Pool Re would 'find themselves in a difficult if not impossible position' accepting the increase without having seen or discussed it in advance. Yesterday Mr John Pollard, policy adviser to the Confederation of British Industry's company affairs directorate, said rates were already too high and called for an urgent meeting with the DTI. Mr Pollard said rises of up to 300 per cent 'would place an intolerable burden on hundreds of firms, particularly those in the City of London'. 'Rates are not normally increased in the middle of the insurance year, based on one incident,' he added, referring to last month's bomb in Bishopsgate in the City. The British Insurance and Investment Brokers Association also issued a strong warning against any mid-term increase in rates. Ms Ruth Rooley, its director, said increases would further damage the City as an international finance centre by frightening companies away. To change the insurance rating for a new scheme in mid-term would be virtually unprecedented during the past 20 years, she said. The take-up of the new terrorism policies has been less than hoped, and Pool Re's funds will be exhausted by claims after last month's Bishopsgate bomb, which are expected to total more than Pounds 400m. Pool Re meets all claims until its funds are exhausted.</p>

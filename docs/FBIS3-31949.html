			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Guatemalan Education Minister Celestino Tay </F> Coyoy by Lucia Dubon, at the Parque La Industria voting station  in Guatemala City--live]    [Excerpts] [Dubon] Good morning, Mr. Minister.    [Tay] Good morning. I am here to say, regarding the civic  event taking place this morning, this has been a somewhat chilly  morning and that I think this has had some impact on the people.  I was in the west side, in the Santa Teresita area, where I  voted, and I was told not many people had gone to vote. There  were lines of approximately 40 voters per voting booth. When I  was leaving I noticed that more people were going to vote.  [passage omitted]    This is a very important moment for all the people of  Guatemala, because our democracy is beginning to consolidate. A  very important point has been made: In spite of the conflicts  and crises we have endured, we have overcome them rationally,  via dialogues. I believe this civic event, this voting, is very  important. We must take advantage of this opportunity to speak  out about in which direction we think the government should go.  This is why I am inviting Guatemalans to fulfill their civic  duties.    [Dubon] What do you think about the Congress president  saying  that regardless of the referendum result there should be a  rapprochement between the executive and legislative branches,  which have had confrontations that have produced the political  crisis the country is enduring?    [Tay] Regarding the yes or no vote, I think it is important  that Guatemalans speak out on this, because they have the right  to do this to develop democracy. I think we all want to  overcome the errors of the past, and this must be the framework  of our civic behavior at this moment. Regarding the Congress  president's statement that there has been a growing apart  between the two branches, what happens is that the origin of the  executive branch is different from that of the legislative  branch. [passage omitted]    [Dubon] Mr. Minister, what do you think about the attacks?  What influence will they have on the referendum? What about the  leaflets that have circulated after the deadline for written  propaganda?    [Tay] I have no information about the leaflets. I was in the  interior yesterday, dedicating a school, in San Antonio,  speaking with the teachers and the community. They were highly  motivated. You know, the towns of San Antonio and Santa Catalina  are places [words indistinct] enjoying the beauty of [words  indistinct]. The people there are growingly in favor of  pacification. I heard that [words indistinct].    There is an environment of fear in the capital, however. I  think the media have also contributed to the creation of this  atmosphere in the capital.    This morning, when I left home, certain people recommended  that I not go too far away from the capital. I think this is a  contradiction, because it is here where there is this atmosphere  due to the attacks, due to those who think the people would not  participate in the referendum.    I think this is, definitely, very negative, and the  Guatemalan people should realize this and not approve of that  kind of behavior; otherwise, how are we going to develop?    I think we Guatemalans must improve ourselves. Those who  have carried out the attacks have committed a crime against the  fatherland, because they harm the country. What they are doing  is very grave.    We have to draw energy from our inner strength, because we  are Guatemalans who are uprighteous, who are working for the  people who want honesty and calm. I think honesty and calm must  permeate through all Guatemalans so that we all, together, in an  environment of reason, justice, and equity can march forward,  because the country must progress.    This country must get out of the crisis and reach the  development levels we all want. This is what everybody says;  for this reason, I think it is very important that this morning  we Guatemalans speak out, aware of the fact that we are part of  this democracy.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Activity in Reuters News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings which announced yesterday that it is to move its main operational site saw a two-way tussle develop in the shares. Agency broker James Capel has been telling clients about the group's marketing ploy to boost sales of its Dealing 2000-2 automated foreign exchange trading system. It says that take-up of the system has been 'so disappointing' that the company has been forced to offer discount incentives to users. However, Henderson Crosthwaite, traditionally an enthusiastic supporter of the company, said yesterday that Reuters recent poor share price performance had pushed the historic p/e relative to its lowest level since the shares were listed in 1984. Analyst Mr Brian Newman believes that prospects for Reuters three new transaction systems are impressive and has the stock as a strong buy. Yesterday the shares rose 18 at best before being sold back down again to close a net 14 better at 1258p.</p>

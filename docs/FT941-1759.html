			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / South Korea threatens to invade North if attacked South Korea yesterday issued a veiled warning that if North Korea staged an attack, Seoul would respond by invading the North to overthrow the government of President Kim Il-sung. 'Our strategy is that, depending on the type of North Korean armed provocation, we would make it an opportunity to realise unification,' Defence Minister Rhee Byoung-tae said. 'There are no signs that North Korea will launch a provocation soon,' although the North Korean army and air force have intensified their training recently, he explained. 'But we cannot rule out the possibility if the UN Security Council starts deliberating sanctions.' The US and South Korea are now considering holding their joint Team Spirit military exercise sometime this spring or summer, with late April being the earliest date, he added. The scheduling of the exercise is being determined by the arrival of 48 US Patriot missile launchers, which are not expected in South Korea until mid-April. They will take part in the Team Spirit. He said North Korea had only limited time to drop opposition to international nuclear inspections if it wanted to stop Team Spirit. 'Once the government officially announces the resumption of Team Spirit, it will be difficult to suspend the exercise again.' Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean foreign minister, said the key to resolving the nuclear dispute lay in either UN sanctions against North Korea or securing China's co-operation in persuading Pyongyang to accept inspections. Neither South Korea nor the US intends to compromise on the basic issue of full inspections with North Korea, including the resumption of inter-Korean talks on mutual inspections as well as unrestricted access to the International Atomic Energy Agency, he added. South Korean President Kim Young-sam left early today on a six-day trip to Japan and China to seek support in resolving the nuclear issue. His visit to Beijing, beginning on Monday, is considered the most crucial stage of the trip since he will ask Chinese President Jiang Zemin to intervene with North Korea in the dispute. China has expressed opposition to sanctions, explaining that the issue can be solved only through continued negotiations between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington. In a mixed message, North Korea said yesterday it was prepared for new negotiations as well as for armed conflict. 'As we have declared time and again, we are fully prepared to answer dialogue with dialogue and war with war.' It denounced deployment of Patriot missiles, accusing the US of bringing the Korean peninsula 'to the brink of war'. It also called on the South Korean people to overthrow their government. The statement comes amid signs that students in Seoul are preparing to hold demonstrations against the US, which they criticise for aggravating tensions in Korea.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Of the 3,032 thrifts in the country, 72% were profitable in the first nine  months of 1988, but the staggering losses of the unhealthy institutions left  the industry with a net loss of $4.5 billion in that period, thrift rating  service Sheshunoff &amp; Co. reported. "The remaining 28% or 838 institutions  were unprofitable," said Alex Sheshunoff, founder of the rating service. "Of  the unprofitable S&amp;Ls, 315 were insolvent. Of the insolvent, 91 have been  merged or closed by the regulators." He said the $4.1-billion profit generated  by the healthy thrifts was offset by the unprofitable ones, which lost $8.6  billion, creating a net loss of $4.5 billion for the industry.  </P></p>

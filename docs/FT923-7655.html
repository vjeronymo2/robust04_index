			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Looters seize part of relief shipment to Somalia RELIEF operations in famine-stricken southern Somalia were sabotaged yesterday when armed looters seized part of the first United Nations shipment of food and fuel into the port of Kismayo. The need for UN military protection of relief operations was underlined when local militia hired to protect the shipment stole 600 tonnes of food and fuel. The supplies were meant for an estimated 200,000 starving people in and around the port, including 10,000 children believed by the UN to be in the final throes of malnutrition. About 1.5m people are facing starvation in the country. The looting in Kismayo took place as rival gunmen shot dead three people in the port of Mogadishu, disrupting efforts to unload food from two ships. In spite of security problems, international relief efforts were boosted yesterday by the news that the US would begin an airlift of 145,000 tonnes of food to Somalia. But the news surprised aid officials in Mogadishu, raising questions about the level of co-ordination between donors. An Irish relief official aboard the ship in the port of Kismayo described the scene in a radio call to UN headquarters in Mogadishu: 'The security situation is critical. I can see them looting as I speak to you.' In a tense but controlled radio conversation the official said the rest of the shipment was effectively being held to ransom by Somali port officials and gunmen, who were demanding Dollars 140,000 (Pounds 73,298) for customs clearance, security and other claimed fees. This was Dollars 100,000 more than the official had expected to pay. Some Somali officials in Kismayo were said to be calculating their charges at an exchange rate of Somali Shillings 5,800 to the dollar, instead of the normal market rate of 7,400. Mr Husein Yusuf of the Red Cross said at least 10,000 UN guards were needed urgently to safeguard relief operations.</p>

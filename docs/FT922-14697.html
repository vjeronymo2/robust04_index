			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Riddle of Libyan retaliation CONFUSION yesterday surrounded an apparent threat by Libya to the commercial interests of countries which voted to impose sanctions over its refusal to hand over two men accused of the Lockerbie bombing. The threat was originally made by student protesters on Libyan television. A Libyan spokesman was quoted as saying: 'The statement of the crowds has not so far become official.' But a Libyan diplomat told European ambassadors in Tripoli that countries which had supported the sanctions would have their interests 'negatively affected'. Libyan officials were also vague over the protesters' call that countries which backed the UN sanctions should evacuate their nationals from Libya.</p>

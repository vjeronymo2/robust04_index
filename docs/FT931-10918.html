			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Short-term relief THE BUNDESBANK'S decision to cut German interest rates yesterday was, in the words of Mr Jacques Delors, a good political signal. But it was a singularly confusing economic one, coming after hawkish rhetoric from Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger. Earlier this week he declared that talk of persistently high interest rate policy in Germany 'was the idle chatter of ignoramuses'. It was a tenable view on Monday, and would have looked no less tenable today without the unexpected cuts. While the German economy is stagnating, it is far from clear that inflation has peaked. Mr Helmut Kohl's solidarity deal with employers, unions and the state governments is not yet in the bag. The long end of the D-Mark bond market was not unnerved by this loosening of policy, but the Federation of German Chambers of Commerce attacked the move, worrying that price stability might become the victim of political expediency. This is not an extreme view in Germany. The Bundesbank's action bears all the hallmarks of a hard-fought compromise. And this is, indeed, a battle in which the stakes are exceptionally high. After the speculative attack on the Danish krone and against a background of growing pressure on the French banking system, a cut of half a point in the Lombard rate and quarter of a point in the discount rate offers an immediate reprieve for the exchange rate mechanism and for its harder-pressed members. It also keeps alive, for the moment, the hope that monetary union has a future. But the relief, however welcome for the rest of Europe, is likely to be short term. The Bundesbank has been prepared to accommodate pressure in the ERM before. But it still seems implausible that a body that has always made domestic economic conditions the primary focus of monetary policy will now emerge as a D-Mark lender of last resort to this semi-fixed exchange rate system. Even after the Bundesbank's modest gesture in the direction of interest rate disarmament, the French economy continues to suffer from phenomenally high real rates of interest and rising unemployment. And the franc still has to cope with considerable political uncertainty before and after the French elections in March. As the strains within the ERM fail to go away, the search for scapegoats is becoming more noisy. Yet there is little point attacking the speculators when they are doing no more than highlighting inconsistencies of policy. The Germans mishandled unification; and the French commitment to the franc fort has meant that adjustment to the resulting shock has had to be taken in the real economy. To blame the currency markets is to shoot the messenger. Since there are unquestionably more messages in the pipeline, it would be helpful if the policy lesson were firmly grasped now.</p>

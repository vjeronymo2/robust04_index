			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Chairman of Goodman Fielder to stand down Australia's largest food processor, Goodman Fielder, said its chairman, Mr John Studdy, would stand down once an external successor is found and that two additional non-executive directors would be appointed, Reuter reports from Sydney. The company's future has been under a cloud recently after a revolt by shareholders, led by Melbourne businessman Mr Doug Shears, whose company Agrifood Australia owns 3.5 per cent of the stock. 'While Mr Studdy has the full support of the board, he recognises the need for a succession plan and the appointment in due course of an external successor,' Goodman said. 'The chairman has indicated a desire and a willingness to stand down when a successor has been found. This transition will ensure the stability of the board and will allow the board to continue its process of change.' Mr Shears had rallied three groups of institutional investors with a combined shareholding of just under 16 per cent to his side. Goodman has recorded flat profits for the past five years, resulting in its share price remaining little changed over the same period.</p>

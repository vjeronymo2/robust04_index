			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Training needs benefit of charitable status Sir, Recent comment by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Home Office about the charitable status of many organisations in the UK may have created the impression that the only objective of any charity is the relief of poverty. The argument appears to be that, if poverty does not exist, charities may not need to exist either. This is clearly a nonsense. As chairman of the National Training Federation - which has many members that are registered charities and fulfil a vital role in the education and training of individuals for employment - my concern is that, in any proposed clear-out, the baby should not be thrown out with the bath water. Given acceptance that education can have acceptable charitable status, it is one thing to criticise a small private school for calling itself a charity to gain tax and other financial advantages. It is another thing entirely to knock an organisation which exists to provide training or education for otherwise disadvantaged people - and help them back into work. Many people will, I feel sure, see this as an altogether proper use of, and destination for, such relief as is available for those given charitable status. The time may well have come to take a close look at the number of bodies sheltering beneath the charity umbrella. But, rather than make a blanket declaration or decision on eligibility, let us have a careful reassessment of qualifying criteria so that end-users with real needs (which are currently being met by registered charities) will continue to be well served under any new regime.

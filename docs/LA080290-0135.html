			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY OFFICIALS SUPPORT POLICE MUSEUM PLAN;  </P> <P> HIGHLAND PARK: BACKERS CAN BEGIN RAISING $6 MILLION TO MODIFY A HISTORIC  STATION.  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials have endorsed a plan to transform the city's historic  Northeast Police Station in Highland Park into a museum that will house Los  Angeles Police Department mementos and law enforcement exhibits.  </P> <P> The endorsement allows museum backers to begin raising the more than $6 million  they need to open the facility.  </P> <P> Capping more than a year of debate on the future of the 65-year-old building,  the Los Angeles City Council last week unanimously directed the city attorney  to prepare an agreement leasing the station to the Los Angeles Police  Historical Society for 30 years at $1 per year. The station, at 6045 York  Blvd., has not been used by the Los Angeles Police Department since 1983.  </P> <P> Boasting a distinctive Renaissance Revival architecture, the station is a city  and federal landmark that has often been used as a backdrop by Hollywood  filmmakers. Last year, a group of police officers proposed turning it into a  police museum.  </P> <P> In recent months, city officials have considered incorporating the police  museum project into one of two rival proposals calling for construction of  housing, offices and a restaurant in and around the historic station. City  Councilman Richard Alatorre had said merging the museum with a commercial  project would have provided private funding to renovate the building.  </P> <P> But last week's decision will allow the museum to proceed without ties to a  commercial project.  </P> <P> "It was the only right thing you could use that building for," said Officer  Richard Ledesma, a member of the historical society's board of directors who  works at the Police Department's Northeast station on San Fernando Road.  </P> <P> Museum boosters, who earlier said the project would cost about $4.5 million,  now have raised their cost estimates to $6 million for renovation, construction  of exhibits and staffing.  </P> <P> A fund-raising consultant for the society has also recommended that an  additional $1.5 million be raised as an endowment to offset some of the  museum's operating costs.  </P> <P> Ledesma said the historical society board is also considering construction of a  youth recreation center on the grounds, which could cost another $1.5 million  to $2 million.  </P> <P> In his motion endorsing the museum lease, Alatorre stipulated that the  organizers must provide a progress report in two years regarding their  finances.  </P> <P> Sgt. Richard Kalk, president of the society and the museum's most vocal  supporter, said the group has raised little money thus far because it has not  had possession of the station. Now that the society has been given permission  to use the building, he said, it will be easier to solicit donations.  </P> <P> "Everything has fallen into place," Kalk said. "The tentative response we're  getting regarding donations is so positive. We're not going to have any trouble  showing the city we can build the museum."  </P> <P> He said the society would seek funding from major corporate foundations and  then launch a public donation drive.  </P> <P> The historical society has hired a professional fund-raising consultant, Culver  City-based Netzel/Steinhaus and Associates. Jeff Conway, the firm's vice  president, said the group will spend months preparing a more detailed budget  and fund-raising strategy before launching a donation drive in 1991.  </P> <P> Organizers believe the museum could open in about five years.  </P> <P> "We are convinced it is a very popular project," Conway said. "We're confident  of its success."  </P> <P> He said a key first step will be to expand the society's board from nine to 19  to include members who have more expertise in construction and fund-raising and  to make it representative of the community's ethnic and cultural diversity.  Current board members are all active or retired police officers.  </P> <P> The museum received a boost in April when Los Angeles voters approved a bond  measure, sponsored by Alatorre, to pay for earthquake-safety repairs in  city-owned structures. It included $1.2 million for the station.  </P> <P> Before the measure was approved, friction developed between Kalk and Alatorre  because of the councilman's concern that the museum's backers had insufficient  funds to build the project without working with a commercial developer.  </P> <P> But Robin Cramer, Alatorre's chief of staff, said a spirit of cooperation now  prevails. She said the councilman's staff plans to shepherd the museum through  the complex city planning approval process.  </P> <P> "What we're trying to do is work as a team from the get-go," she said.  </P> <P> Tentatively, the museum will display police guns and vehicles, a tribute to  slain and injured officers, exhibits on famous arrests and unsolved cases and a  comparison of actual law enforcement versus its depiction on television.  </P> <P> Al Fiori, whose Venice firm is the museum's design consultant, said the  exhibits will have a strong educational component, showing youngsters the  consequences of drug dealing and drunk driving. They will also focus on such  crime-solving techniques as fingerprints, autopsies and fiber analysis.  </P> <P> Fiori said the museum will have many high-tech interactive exhibits such as a  police car simulator that would allow visitors to experience participating in a  street patrol and a device for creating a composite sketch of a crime suspect.  </P> <P> "It's not just going to be a static collection of police chiefs' pictures and  badges," he said. "It's going to be a hands-on museum. This is a showcase for  the state-of-the-art in police science."  </P></p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Bombardment kills 10 in Sarajevo BOSNIAN Serbs, Croats and Moslems battled for territory across the republic yesterday and accused each other of planning large offensives, Reuter reports from Belgrade. In Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, a crisis centre which monitors casualties reported that 13 people had been killed and 78 wounded during the weekend. Ten were killed in the city itself, which endured its worst shelling in weeks on Saturday. A Bosnian army commander said the artillery barrage could be a sign that Bosnian Serbs were preparing an assault on the city. UN officials have reported Serb troop movements around the city but are unsure whether the Serbs plan an offensive. The Serbs said it was the Moslems who were trying to push forward on fronts in central Bosnia. There were also clashes around Gracanica in the north-east, Maglaj in central Bosnia and Jablanica in the west. In the north-western Bosnian enclave of Bihac, Bosnian Moslem government troops clashed with rebel Moslems loyal to the enclave's leader, Mr Fikret Abdic, during fighting in two villages.</p>

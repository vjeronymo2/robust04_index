			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Nikkei fall puts investors on tenterhooks INVESTORS in the Japanese stock market were on tenterhooks as prices fluctuated in hesitant trading early today after yesterday's resounding fall to their lowest level for five years. In an effort to steady the market, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said temporary and technical factors were largely to blame for yesterday's sharp drop in share prices - which took the Nikkei index through the psychologically important 20,000 level. He predicted the market could recover in the not-so-distant future. In a similar soothing vein, Mr Takeshi Noda, the Economic Planning Agency minister, said the Tokyo price fall did not reflect Japan's economic fundamentals. Share prices made a modest rebound when trading began this morning, then dipped down again before attempting a further slight recovery, with the Nikkei index of leading stocks soon at 19,766. Yesterday the Nikkei index lost 618.90 points or 3 per cent to close at 19,837.16. The fall below 20,000 - for the first time since February 1987 - had been widely expected because of the market's recent weakness. It brought the Tokyo market down 49 per cent from its 1989 peak - in contrast to New York and London, where shares have been trading relatively close to all-time highs. The broader Topix index yesterday shed 19.14 points to close at 1,444.86, its lowest since November 1986. The Tokyo decline has meant that equities have now lost all the spectacular gains made in the late 1980s, when a supply of cheap credit prompted a wide-ranging financial boom. Stocks have slumped in response to higher interest rates, declining economic growth and political turmoil in Japan and overseas. Yesterday's losses were triggered by a modest spate of selling by Japanese corporate and institutional investors preparing their books for the end of the financial year this month. Yesterday was the last day for some groups of investors to complete transactions in time for the year-end. Many Japanese investors early today were bracing themselves for further falls, fearing that the poor financial health of some securities companies and banks would undermine the market. Mr Shiomichi Kawamoto, of the investment management affiliate of Sumitomo Life, a life company, said yesterday: 'The Nikkei may rebound above 20,000 but the overall downward trend is unchanged. Who will buy stocks from securities companies which are about to collapse?' However, a significant minority believed prices were bottoming out. Mr Tsuneo Nakamura, managing director of Yamaichi Securities, one of the big four brokers, said yesterday: 'Market statistics indicate that we have already entered the final stages of the correction period.' The Japanese authorities at first maintained a studious calm in the wake of yesterday's sharp drop in share prices. Their stance was in contrast to October 1990 when the Nikkei last dropped through 20,000 in intra-day trading and the finance ministry unveiled an emergency package of market-boosting measures. Ministry officials now believe that changes to trading and other rules do little to help stock prices in the long run and distort free markets. In recent weeks they have encouraged a tightening of rules governing stock futures trading. This was in response to complaints from brokers who blamed the market's weakness on over-aggressive futures trading by foreign securities companies. But latest revisions have had little effect on sentiment. However, politicians yesterday repeated calls for further cuts in interest rates, urging the Bank of Japan to reduce the Official Discount Rate from its current level of 4.5 per cent. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, told a parliamentary committee he was still studying the effect of previous reductions. Japanese bond prices remained virtually unchanged yesterday, evidence of the fact that investors were well prepared for the fall in equities. But on the foreign exchanges, the yen lost ground against the US dollar. Bankruptcies in Japan rose by 56.2 per cent in February to 1,056 cases, reflecting the cooling of the Japanese economy, Teikoku Data Bank said, Steven Butler adds. The pace of corporate insolvency has risen steadily on an annual basis for the past 17 months. It said liabilities of bankrupt companies in the fiscal year ending this month were likely to reach Y7,600bn (Pounds 33bn). Uneasy calm amid gathering storm, Page 21; Stock markets, Page 39</p>

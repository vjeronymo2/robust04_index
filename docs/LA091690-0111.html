			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TEXAS A&amp;M SETS RECORD WITH 774 TOTAL YARDS  </P> <P> Lance Pavlas completed all nine of his passes, three for touchdowns, and Texas  A&amp;M set a school record for total offense with 774 yards in defeating  Southwestern Louisiana, 63-14, Saturday night at College Station, Tex.  </P> <P> It was the second-highest total in Southwest Conference history behind  Houston's 1,021 yards against Southern Methodist last year. Robert Wilson,  Darren Lewis and Randy Simmons each had 100-yard rushing performances for the  Aggies (2-0).  </P> <P> Pavlas threw touchdown passes of nine and 20 yards to Gary Oliver and 68 to  Shane Garrett -- all in the first quarter.  </P> <P> On the long touchdown, Pavlas executed a perfect fake to Lewis, who drew in the  Ragin' Cajuns' defense while Pavlas retreated with the ball hidden on his hip.  Garrett slipped unnoticed into the secondary, caught Pavlas' pass at the 22 and  ran untouched for the score.  </P> <P> The Aggies scored on six consecutive first-half possessions after a fumble  stopped their first drive at the Cajun six.  </P> <P> No. 15 Arkansas 28, Tulsa 3 -- Quinn Grovey completed his first two passes for  touchdown plays covering 48 and 57 yards as the 15th-ranked Razorbacks opened  Jack Crowe's first season as coach with a victory at Fayetteville, Ark.  </P> <P> The Razorbacks beat Tulsa for the 14th consecutive time. Crowe replaced Ken  Hatfield in January after Hatfield took the Clemson job.  </P> <P> Grovey's first pass came on the third play of the game and was caught by  freshman Tracy Caldwell cutting across the field. Grovey's second touchdown  pass came on the Razorbacks' next possession and was the 10th play of a 99-yard  drive. Grovey rolled left and found Derek Russell in stride alone down the  middle.  </P> <P> Tulane 43, SMU 7 -- Deron Smith threw three touchdown passes, and Tulane's  defense stuffed Southern Methodist's run-and-shoot offense at New Orleans.  </P> <P> Two of Smith's touchdown passes went to Melvin Ferdinand in a 23-point second  quarter in which the Green Wave took control of the game. The third went to  Steve Ballard midway through the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Tulane is 2-1, SMU 1-1.  </P> <P> Smith completed 18 of 29 passes for 223 yards.  </P> <P> Tulane's defense held SMU quarterback Mike Romo to 175 passing yards and also  contained running backs Rongea Hill and Kevin Love.  </P></p>

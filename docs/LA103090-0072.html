			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC TICKETS ON VERGE OF ENTERING COMPUTER AGE;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE HIGHWAY PATROL WILL TEST A HAND-HELD DEVICE THAT PRINTS  OUT VIOLATIONS. MOTORISTS MAY EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO PAY FINES WITHOUT LEAVING  THEIR CARS.  </P> <P> A hand-held computer that will allow police to print out instant traffic  tickets and eventually let motorists pay fines on the spot with credit cards  was unveiled by the California Highway Patrol on Monday.  </P> <P> The program -- the first of its kind in the country -- will be tested in a  $60,000 pilot project in Ventura County. The CHP has equipped officers with 12  computers and portable printers to cut down on the time and paperwork required  to process handwritten tickets.  </P> <P> If the program proves successful, the Highway Patrol plans to implement  automated ticketing throughout California within three years, said Maury  Hannigan, commissioner of the Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> The computers, about seven inches long, can provide information on a driver's  hair and eye color and vehicle type with the punching of a few keys, said  officials demonstrating the equipment at the Conejo Commercial Vehicle  Inspection Facility on the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> And when the Department of Motor Vehicles begins issuing licenses with magnetic  strips in selected counties in December, law enforcement officials hope to use  the computer to tap into the National Crime Information Center and obtain  records of previous arrests and outstanding warrants.  </P> <P> Within five years, the computer could be used to accept credit cards from  motorists who opt to post bail without leaving their cars, Lt. Claude LeMond  said.  </P> <P> "The 21st Century is less than 10 years away and law enforcement needs to take  advantage of technological advances if it is to keep pace with today's world,"  Hannigan said.  </P> <P> It now takes as much as a month for motorists to receive information about  their fines or court appearances, said Sheila Gonzalez, executive officer of  the Ventura County Superior and Municipal Courts. Ventura County alone  processes 6,500 tickets, many of them difficult to read or containing errors,  she said.  </P> <P> With the computers, violators will be able to receive information about their  fine within 24 hours, she said.  </P></p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A house in trust I AM the trustee for the estate of my wife's father who died in 1971. The family home, which is the sole asset, is left to be divided between the two sisters upon the death of the stepmother who has lifetime use of the property. If the stepmother wishes to move from the house the proceeds must be shared three ways. What will the position be regarding capital gains tax if and when the house is sold. As you will see from the free pamphlet CGT4 (Owner-occupied houses), obtainable from tax inspectors' offices, the trust should escape CGT by virtue of section 103 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979: 'Sections 101 to 103 above shall apply in relation to a gain accruing to a trustee on a disposal of settled property being an asset within section 101(. 1) above where during the period of ownership of the trustee the dwellinghouse or part of the dwellinghouse mentioned in that subsection has been the only or main residence of a person entitled to occupy it under the terms of the settlement, and in those sections as so applied (a) references to the individual shall be taken as references to the trustee except in relation to the occupation of the dwellinghouse or part of the dwellinghouse, and - (b) the notice which may be given to the inspector under section 101(5)(a) above shall be a joint notice by the trustee and the person entitled to occupy the dwellinghouse or part of the dwellinghouse' It is a surprising that this was not explained to you by the solicitors: the law on this point has not significantly altered since the introduction of CGT in 1965. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 1 May (MENA) -- The Fatah Central Committee  tonight ended its consultations on the formation of the National  Authority Council that will run self-rule affairs in the Gaza  strip and Jericho.    Al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahman, Fatah Central Committee member and  Palestinian ambassador to Jordan, said the National Authority  Council will comprise 25 members, half of them from the occupied  Palestinian lands and the other half from Palestinians of the  diaspora, in addition to Yasir 'Arafat.    Among key members from diaspora Palestinians are Economic  Department Chief Ahmad Quray', also known as Abu-'Ala'; Dr.  Nabil Sha'th; and Intisar al-Wazir, also known as Umm-Jihad.  Key representatives from residents of the occupied Palestinian  territories are Faysal al-Husayni from the West Bank and  Zakariya al-Agha from Gaza. The council will also include Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh, Samir Ghawshah, Yasir 'Amr, and Muhammad Zuhdi  al-Nashashibi.    Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, will  not  be a council member because the Political Department will remain  outside Gaza and Jericho, most probably in Tunis.    Mahmud 'Abbas, also known as Abu-Mazin, expressed the desire  not to enter Gaza and Jericho, preferring to remain abroad to  carry out other political tasks. He also expressed the desire  not to become a council member.</p>

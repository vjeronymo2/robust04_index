[passage omitted]. O brothers, O my kinfolk, O  masses of our struggling people, O revolutionaries, strugglers,  and mujahidin of our struggling people. I am addressing you to  express my pride, and that of your brothers in the Palestinian  leadership, at this splendid steadfastness and this courageous  attitude that shows the great nature of our people, especially  at times of trial and difficulties. After the hideous slaughter  perpetrated by the killer settlers and the occupying army, our  entire people rose to defend its existence, sanctities, dignity,  and its hope while waiting for the moment to end the hateful  Israeli occupation, the imposing of the national authority  stage, and then the forming of an independent Palestinian state  with Jerusalem as its capital.    I am addressing you in the sincere and clear words of those  who have borne the trust and, at the same, have stood ready to  sacrifice their lives for our people to secure its future,  dignity, freedom, and independence. I tell you with all  brotherhood and frankness -- given the importance of persistence  and steadfastness in these difficult days in which we must  always ignore the attempts by some to spread programmed rumors  and a climate of frustration and despair -- I tell you with all  frankness that we are facing one of the fiercest battles at a  time when our people, under the PLO leadership, is forcefully  knocking at the doors of independence and freedom, and at a time  when the international community is looking forward to seeing  the Palestinian rights realized with the rhythm of successive  events. This is one of a series of our battles that we have  been continuously fighting since the first bullet was fired on 1  January 1965, a fact that was crowned with the outbreak of the  great national Intifadah that is continuing and escalating, and  which will continue and will further escalate until the  objectives of our people are realized, i.e. to end the  occupation and realize the independence and freedom for our  people, land, and sanctities.    The settlements were, and still are, one of the obstacles  that faced us and still faces us in our talks with the Israelis.    The international community and decisions stand beside us in  connection with these settlements that are an obstacle on the  road to peace, therefore, our faith was never shaken for a  moment that it would be the fate of these settlement to  disappear, and the fate of the settlers would be to depart from  our land because what was based on a myth was void in origin.    Events have proven the truth of our stance and international  public opinion realized the enormity of this matter, and the  issue of disarming the settlers became the prelude for the  dismantlement of the settlement and its removal from our land.    This cooperation between units from the Israeli Army and  armed settlers that we are now facing is the same as the one  that our Algerian brothers faced during the first and second  Evian talks.    We confronted this ordeal in the same way as we have  previously faced numerous ordeals. It had only strengthened our  faith and belief in the strength of our right and the justice of  our aims.    In the past, we have suffered a great deal. This suffering  consolidated our belief and conviction in the strength of our  right and the legitimacy of our goals. Consequently, we  stressed this stance, as dictated by national responsibility,  regarding the need to provide international protection for our  people; and to bring the international community face to face  with its responsibilities and confront this terrible plan.    While we were engaged in a diplomatic battle inside the UNSC  [UN Security Council] to arm ourselves with an international  resolution; and while we were discussing it within the  Palestinian leadership, and debating the ways to deal with this  battle; some people, who are professional in sowing chaos, were  pronouncing unjust verdicts and writing false statements. We  did not pay attention to their fabricated lies because we have  been, and still are, refusing to be dragged into marginal  battles. We have, and still consider that the battle against  the occupying enemy forms the basis for the confrontation  against the occupiers; rather than the deliberate sowing of  confusion by all the enemies of the Palestinian dream, the  Palestinian homeland, and the Palestinian existence [Koranic  verse].    Brothers, I would like to say that we have remained loyal to  the trust, promise and pledge; the pledge and promise of the  pure innocent martyrs. The honor of responsibility warrants us  to stand steadfast against all trials and incidents whose  impacts can only strengthen our faith, might, and resolve. At  times of suffering and challenges, we should all stand united,  with a united heart, we should think in a responsible way and  search for all methods of confrontation, including resorting to  help from international public opinion and the international  legitimate institutions, foremost of which is the United  Nations, international and Arab institutions such as the Arab  League, the Nonaligned Movement, the ICO [Islamic Conference  Organization], the OAU [Organization of African Unity], and all  our friends around the world.    This is a savage battle brought about by the Hebron  massacre,  the Jerusalem massacre, the 'Ayn Garah massacre, the massacre of  Sabra and Shatila, Dir Yasin, and also the difficult  confrontations in Jinin Rafah, the Triangle [as heard],  al-Nasiraha, and al-Naqab.    We have suspended negotiations with the Israelis, and we  have  clearly stated that these negotiations will not resume until our  people receive all guarantees for international protection, the  dismantling of settlements that threaten to sabotage the peace  negotiations, and to punish the perpetrators of the crime.    The battle will not stop at that level because we have a  lot of details that lie ahead of us, and on our agenda are  fateful issues that require fair solutions in order to  consolidate the just peace. At the fore of these issues is the  issue of Jerusalem that America refuses to mention in the  Security Council's resolution, the issue of the refugees, the  dismantling of the settlements, the borders, the gaining of  total national independence, and the creation of our independent  state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. [passage omitted]    Among the urgent issues is the issue of our brothers who are  detained in the occupation prisons. We will not rest easy nor  will we close our eyes to sleep before we ensure the freedom of  all of them so they can contribute to the battle of building our  national authority and our independent state. We had strongly  rejected all enemy attempts to divide them or to classify them.  We had also rejected the freeing of Fatah detainees alone,  although they were the majority of the detainees and insisted on  the same treatment for all of them as they are all sons of  Palestine and the beloved of Palestine.    I address you at these difficult moments and ask you to  stand  in one [solid] rank to face up to this new situation resulting  from the attack of the herds of settlers, with the collusion and  planning of some enemy army units, on the unarmed civilians  while performing their holy prayers at the holy al-Ibrahimi  mosque during the blessed month of Ramadan. I appeal to the  sons of our people everywhere to close ranks and to realize the  national unity and to be as the heart of one man at time of  difficulty and trial, for we are the people of martyrs, the  people of the revolutionaries, the people of Mujahidin, and to  cast out of their ranks all those who incite sedition and  division. For despite this dark night the light of dawn is sure  to come. Dawn and victory is certainly coming. [passage  omitted]    The Israeli soldiers are still escalating their oppression,  aggression, and crimes that include opening fire on women,  children, and old people. Israel continues to violate the  Declaration of Principles, and it is our right to resort to all  legitimate methods, to retaliate, and to seek favorable  prospects. (It is our right) to quell the plots by circles  against peace in the Israeli military establishment, by the  armed settlers whose hands have been let loose more than at any  previous time, to cause destruction, and to spread chaos in an  attempt to stop the wheel of history.    We truly want peace but we refuse to surrender. We want just  peace and we reject surrender and subjugation, just as we refuse  to transform the peace agreement into an submission agreement.  I tell you that Palestinian blood will not be cheap. It is the  blood that lights the flame of our struggle [Jihad] and our  fight that has not died down and, with God's help, will not die  down.    Because of our loyalty to that blood, we will take all  measures and stances made necessary by the higher national  interests for our people. Greetings to all our steadfast sons  in Hebron and in every corner of our beloved homeland. [passage  omitted]    In these days, during which humanity celebrated  International  Woman's Day, on 8 March, the heroic Palestinian woman was  standing with steadfastness under the ceiling of fire [as  heard], bidding farewell to the martyrs with ululations and  confronting the occupiers, their bullets, and their oppression  with rage and sacrifice. Salutations to the great Palestinian  woman, and we pledge that she will, in the coming years,  celebrate her festival in the comfort of a free, independent,  and democratic homeland for a free and revolutionary people.  Brothers and sisters, I renew to you the pledge, and I renew to  you the promise, and I tell you that tragedies will only  increase our strength, faith, and firmness; the hammer breaks  the glass, but forms iron [into something useful]. We have made  quick strides and offered thousands of martyrs, and we will not  stop the struggle in all its forms before our people receive all  their rights. Let the victorious march continue; the road to an  independent state still requires sacrifice, struggle, and  suffering from us, but it is our will, which cannot be defeated,  and our determination, which cannot be dented, to do so.  Blessed be you, O our people; blessed be you, O our people, O  people of generosity and sacrifice; blessed be you, O people of  martyrs. [passage omitted] It is revolution until victory.</p>

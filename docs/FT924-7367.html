			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Troubled transmission for the big picture show: British doubts and budget pressures threaten Europe's strategy for HDTV Just under a year ago, 12 European Community telecommunications ministers spent 15 hours laboriously mapping out a course towards high-definition, cinema-quality television. In a joint press conference, the principal advocates of an EC high-definition television (HDTV) strategy hailed the directive they had agreed as a breakthrough: the European Commission, Dutch, French and German ministers said it was a vital weapon in the continuing fight against US and Japanese competitors in the consumer electronics industry. On Thursday, those same 12 ministers meet to discuss their strategy for high-definition television (HDTV) amid fears that British intransigence and general EC budget pressures may simply undo what they achieved last year. Under discussion will be the European Commission's proposed five-year 'action plan' for HDTV, which supports last year's technical directive. The plan consists of an Ecu850m (Pounds 697m) package of incentives to encourage the introduction of wide-screen television services. The eventual aim is a move to full high-definition television on the basis of the so-called 'Mac' family of transmission standards. These were the norms chosen as the best route to high-quality television pictures when the EC first legislated on the subject in 1986. That first directive, which expired at the end of last year, was widely discredited as an unsuccessful attempt to impose an industrial strategy on an unwilling market. Satellite broadcasters skirted the requirements of the legislation and began transmitting in non-HDTV standards. This time, Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the EC telecommunications commissioner, has tried to persuade politicians to co-operate with the industry. To get funding under the action plan, consortia of satellite broadcasters and programme-makers would have to demonstrate to the EC that they could deliver a wide-screen service. It could be the EC's last chance to relaunch an HDTV strategy. The main obstacle to agreement is money. Britain, which will chair Thursday's meeting, believes the Commission has not made a sound business case for spending Ecu850m. 'We still haven't seen much justification for this,' said one British official last week. The British stance reflects continuing scepticism among broadcasters that the Commission and interested member states want to cosset European television manufacturers - such as Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France - which have invested heavily in Mac technology. The vote has to be unanimous, so Britain could veto the idea. Advocates of the plan, however, point out that it does not include provision for direct funding of manufacturers. Instead, they say the proposals will assist a wide range of economic interests from independent television producers to retailers. A report prepared by KPMG Management Consulting for the Commission suggests that without the funding the wide-screen market will develop slowly. Under those circumstances, equipment manufacturers, broadcasters and programme-makers are unanimous that there will be little or no incentive to continue with joint development of specifically European HDTV technology. Philips, for example, has stated that if there is no subsidy, 'it could well be the case that you will never see HD-Mac (the final HDTV standard) in Europe - at least not supported by Philips'. With funding, however, KPMG estimates that the value of the market for wide-screen sets and video recorders will reach Ecu27.2bn in current prices by 2002, against Ecu2.5bn if there is no subsidy. Apart from the central issue of cash - which will have to be thrashed out at ministerial level - discussions between national officials in Brussels over the past few weeks have focused on several persistent concerns. For example, the involvement of Thomson and Philips in developing rival digital technology has fed fears that the analogue Mac transmission standards may be superseded. Digital signals are electrical (analogue) signals which have been converted into binary codes. The use of digital signals makes it possible to process and distribute a greater volume of information more rapidly than using an analogue system. Digital television is not excluded from the EC strategy, although the Commission insists it is still a long way from commercial production. Along with Mac standards, it would improve the picture quality, but it would also enable more channels to be broadcast than now possible. The debate about standards has been raging since an HDTV strategy was first proposed in the early 1980s. But are EC consumers and the consumer electronics industry really interested in a new standard, or do they simply need a new product - in this case wide-screen television - to kick-start an ailing market? The latest draft of the action plan reflects this question. It gives the plan's objective as the development of 'advanced satellite and cable television services in Europe in the (wide-screen) format'. The Mac standards which have been at the centre of the debate over the past decade are hardly mentioned directly. Even in the telecommunications directorate, stronghold of the Mac strategy, officials now admit that wide-screen television sets and services will initially be more important than the standard in which programmes are broadcast or received. 'Nobody buys a standard,' says one senior Commission telecoms official. 'What people are going to buy in the first phase is wide-screen.' Recent discussions between national officials in Brussels have also shifted the emphasis of the action plan in the direction of the broadcasters. The original proposal was to devote some 25 per cent of funding to so-called 'software' - in other words, programmes. In the current draft, between 30 and 40 per cent of funds will be devoted to programme production and conversion. Two questions remain. Commercially, can the industry deliver what is required? Politically, will member states unite to support the strategy? HDTV still faces a number of significant hurdles. First, television sets will have to incorporate high-quality picture tubes which cost several tens of thousands of dollars. Second, the improvement in HDTV picture quality over conventional sets is apparent only in bulky and heavy sets that are at least 33in wide. For practical purposes, HDTV needs an entirely new display system - such as flat panel displays that could be hung on the wall. Such displays are under development but are probably at least 10 years away from the market. The political problem is more pressing. Telecommunications ministers who aim to support the wide-screen strategy on Thursday know that the final decision on funding is not theirs to take. Even if Britain can be persuaded to agree, the money must come from existing and future EC budgets. Those budgets are increasingly under pressure as governments feel the economic pinch at home. Judging from the tone of debate among finance ministers, cuts may be made in exactly those areas - research and technology - where an HDTV strategy might find a home.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: FILLED FILO DOUGH FITS INTO ALMOST ALL MEAL PLANS FOR FANCIFUL  FEASTS  </P> <P> Filo dough triangles, stuffed and then baked until golden brown, are a  traditional appetizer at many Greek feasts. Those filled with cheese are called  tiropitas; when a spinach and cheese mixture is used, they are known as  spanokopeta.  </P> <P> Although filo dough is not difficult to work with, it's important that the  paper-thin sheets don't dry out or they'll crumble into flakes, becoming  useless. To prevent this from happening, cover the filo dough completely with  plastic wrap and a kitchen towel as soon as the dough is removed from the  package.  </P> <P> Mold may appear on filo that is old or has been improperly packaged or stored.  Don't hesitate to return a just-purchased package of filo if it appears moldy,  and discard any that has been stored for too long. When well wrapped, the  sheets should stay fresh in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.  </P> <P> If the edges of the filo are slightly dry, revive by spritzing with water from  a clean spray bottle. Tears in the dough may be patched by moistening a  separate piece of dough and placing it over the defect. Wrinkles may be patted  down or smoothed out.  </P> <P> To form the triangles, place one sheet of filo at a time on a clean work  surface and brush with melted butter (Step 1) or a mixture of melted butter and  olive oil. Fold the sheet in thirds (Step 2), brushing each surface with  butter.  </P> <P> Place about one tablespoon of frozen spinach, thawed and well drained, on a  corner of the strip (Step 3). Sprinkle with feta cheese (Step 4).  </P> <P> Fold the corner over the filling, forming a triangle (Step 5). Continue to  fold, flag fashion, up the strip, retaining the triangle shape. The last fold  may require trimming or tucking in of any excess dough.  </P> <P> Before placing on a baking sheet, brush each triangle with butter (Step 6).  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown.  </P> <P>  Suggestions for column topics may be sent to Back to Basics, Food Section, The  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

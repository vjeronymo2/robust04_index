			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Ratifying the round An electorally battered President Bill Clinton is about to fly to Jakarta for the second annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. Foreign policy success matters to the president, but in this case what he achieves abroad will be determined by events at home. The US will create nothing concrete within Apec if the Uruguay Round outcome is not ratified. That task falls to the lame-duck Congress. Some argue that a duck as lame as this one has become has no right to pass legislation of such significance. It would indeed have been better to have ratified the legislation sooner. But there is no alternative. If the bill were to die in the present Congress, it could not be reintroduced into the next one under the 'fast track' authority. Amendments would then be possible and, being possible, would be probable. If the round were passed in a different form from what was negotiated, it would have to be reopened. The chances that others would agree to that idea, after seven years of wearisome negotiations, can be defined simply as zero. This notion of a later consideration is frivolous. The US has a simple choice: to ratify or not - and the time to decide is now. The US is, it appears, also the only country in the world to have important substantive doubts about the deal. So a heavy weight now falls on the shoulders of this particular lame duck. The benefits of the round are not the smallest part of what is at stake. A report from the Gatt secretariat, out today, presents the results in greater detail than hitherto. In addition, it uses a sophisticated economic model to evaluate the benefits to total world income, which it assesses at an increase of Dollars 510bn in 2005, including a gain of Dollars 122bn for the US. Huge as it is, this excludes the effects of the round on services, intellectual property and, more generally, on security of market access. Over-optimistic Such calculations also rest on the over-optimistic assumption that the alternative to ratification would be the status quo ante. Yet the decision to initiate the Uruguay Round was a response not just to protectionist pressures, but also to the belief that the international trading system had become too incomplete to remain relevant. The final deal is the product of the seven years of the round, themselves following around four years of preparation. If, after 11 years of effort, the outcome fails to be ratified by the country that drove the process throughout, the system will stand condemned as irrelevant to the problems of today. Everything achieved before the round would then start to unravel. The credibility of the US is as much at stake as that of the multilateral trading system. It is unlikely, for example, that countries would be prepared to enter into complex negotiations on an Apec-wide free trade agreement if the US was unable to ratify the Uruguay Round. Such a negotiation would be condemned as a waste of time: full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Leap forward The puzzling thing about the doubts surfacing in the US is that the Uruguay Round is, in every important respect, its baby. It was the US that wanted inclusion of agriculture, services, intellectual property and trade-related investment measures. It was also the US that wanted a more effective dispute settlement procedure. While the outcome has inevitably fallen short of initial US demands, it is also a huge leap forward. The World Trade Organisation is, in fact, a remarkable achievement of global co-operation. Yet at this very moment of triumph, people in the US have rediscovered the old concerns about sovereignty that buried the International Trade Organisation back in the late 1940s. The truth, however, is that unbridled national sovereignty is impossible in the case of trade, because two governments are always involved. There is no alternative to some kind of international agreement if conditions for global trade are to be both predictable and liberal. This is what the US learnt in the 1930s. It is now 60 years since the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act started the country on the journey that culminated in the Uruguay Round agreement. The process underpinned the postwar success of the market economies, which is why countries like China and Russia want to join. Now, in the post-cold war era, economics have also taken a central place in international political relations. Failure by the US to ratify the round would, therefore, amount in one moment to a repetition of the two great mistakes of the inter-war period - the vote against the League of Nations in 1919 and the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930. To make those mistakes once was calamity enough. To repeat them would be unforgiveable. It is often difficult to know in advance whether an event is historic. But this is certainly one. The Uruguay Round decision is a defining moment in the history of US relations with the rest of the world. The achievement of the deal was bipartisan. The challenge now is to both parties. All concerned must remember what is at stake.</p>

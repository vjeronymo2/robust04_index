			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Lobbying on home loans is renewed Mortgage lenders are to renew their lobbying of ministers and MPs after signs that the government is considering further cuts in the income support available for mortgage interest, Alison Smith writes. The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents building societies, banks and centralised lenders, is to brief backbench Tory MPs about the likely adverse impact of further restrictions on the fragile recovery in the housing market. The arguments against a further limitation will also form a significant element of the council's submission to the Treasury before November's Budget. At least one building society chief executive believes lenders should have concentrated more on preventing the reduction of mortgage support than on opposing the cuts in tax relief on mortgage interest payments. While the Pounds 1.2bn spending on mortgage support last year is not a large slice of the Pounds 85bn social security budget, ministers believe it is among the fastest-growing elements. They are keen to encourage people to take out private insurance against job loss rather than relying on the state to help with mortgage payments if they become unemployed. Last August, a ceiling of Pounds 150,000 was im-posed on the mortgage amount for which income support would be available. This was lowered to Pounds 125,000 for new claimants from early this month. A further restriction will come into effect later this month when people on income support will no longer be able to claim interest payments on mortgages which they have taken out or increased while receiving benefit. But the council believes that imposing tougher limits on mortgage support payments will directly cut across the government's intention of extending home ownership through initiatives such as the rents-into-mortgages scheme. The original crackdown on support came after embarrassment over a case in which amounts of almost Pounds 2,000 a week were paid to a former insurance sales executive. Mortgage surge, Page 10</p>

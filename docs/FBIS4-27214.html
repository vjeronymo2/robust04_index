			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 28 KYODO -- Domestically grown grain  will account for 40 percent of the 500,000 tons of rice the  government plans to sell in July, ministry sources said Saturday  [28 May].    The sources said the government will release 200,000 tons of  domestic rice from its stockpiles in July, 50,000 tons more than  was originally planned.    According to the Food Agency's new rice-supply plan, the  proportion of domestic grain in the government's total supply  will increase to 60 percent in August, 80 percent in September  and more than that in October.    Currently, the ratio stands at just 30 percent.    The new plan will be officially adopted in early June after  the agency briefs each prefecture.    Under the original plan, the ratio of domestic rice was put  at 30 percent by the end of July. It was only in September that  supplies of domestic grain exceed those of imports.    But following last year's devastating harvest, which forced  Japan to buy foreign rice, farmers planted more early-harvested  rice this year, prompting the government to add more domestic  rice to its supplies in the coming months.    Some analysts are even concerned that supplies of domestic  rice will become excessive from August to October, leaving large  amounts of imported rice on the shelves.    A rice market official said, "if nothing is done, only  domestic rice will be distributed around October and it will  load wholesalers with large stocks of imported rice."    Already, some imported rice, mainly Thai rice, has been left  unsold after the panic hoarding of domestically grown rice in  March.</p>

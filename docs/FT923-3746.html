			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: BBL directors in strategy talks DIRECTORS of Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) yesterday met for an unscheduled discussion of the Belgian bank's future strategy, amid continuing speculation about the company's unstable shareholder structure. BBL refused to comment on the substance or outcome of the meeting, but said it would release a statement today. Belgian newspaper reports yesterday suggested that the meeting would focus on the intention of Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch banking and insurance group, to increase its 10 per cent stake. ING also declined to comment yesterday.</p>

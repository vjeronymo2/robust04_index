			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / European sales of new cars surprise makers NEW CAR sales in west Europe jumped sharply in December thanks to an unexpected surge in demand in some of the biggest markets, Germany, the UK, France, Spain and the Netherlands. According to industry estimates west European new car sales in December rose year-on-year by 18.7 per cent to 975,000. Sales for the whole of 1992 were virtually unchanged at 13.5m. Figures for several of the 17 markets across west Europe are still based on preliminary estimates, but the strength of demand in recent months has confounded carmakers' more pessimistic forecasts. According to industry estimates new car sales last year were less than 0.1 per cent lower than in 1991. The decline in sales in several European markets in the past three years has been compensated for by the addition of eastern Germany, since mid-1990, to the overall market. Germany, the single biggest car market in Europe, again played a pivotal role in December with an estimated sales increase year-on-year of 33 per cent to 308,000. The surge in December could depress sales this month, as purchases were pulled forward to avoid the increase in valued added tax in Germany at the beginning of January. The same happened in France, where new car sales were an estimated 221,000, up year-on-year by 33.5 per cent. In the UK, sales last month jumped by 37.1 per cent year-on-year to 79,900, although special factors also distorted the picture. Only Italy suffered a decline among the main volume markets in December with a fall year-on-year of 6.4 per cent. Across west Europe sales both in December and in the whole of 1992 were higher than a year earlier in nine markets and lower in eight. New car sales in the whole of 1992 were higher than a year ago in four of the five leading volume markets, Italy, France, Spain and the UK - though only marginally in the case of the UK - while the estimated decline in German new car sales of around 5.1 per cent was much less than feared. Most industry forecasts for 1993, however, suggest a decline of around 4 per cent. Japanese new car sales in west Europe fell last year by an estimated 4.8 per cent to around 1.59m, reducing Japanese share to around 11.8 per cent from 12.3 per cent. The Volkswagen group was the best-selling carmaker in west Europe for the eighth year in succession, boosting market share to a record 17.5 per cent from 16.4 per cent a year earlier.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                           January-December 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Volume    Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                           (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Dec 92  Jan-Dec 91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET            13,506,000    -0.1       100.0       100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen*(incl.        2,365,000    +6.8        17.5        16.4 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) General Motors           1,685,000    +3.1        12.5        12.1 (Opel/Vauxhall, US**** &amp; Saab)  -Opel/Vauxhall          1,614,000    +3.1        12.0        11.5  -Saab**                    51,000    -5.1         0.4         0.4 Peugeot (incl.           1,646,000    +1.0        12.2        12.1 Citroen) Fiat (incl.

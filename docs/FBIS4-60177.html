			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant </F> General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih with domestic and international  correspondents and an unidentified moderator in Sanaa on 21  May--recorded]    [Text] [Salih] First of all I would like to welcome the  national, Arab, and international press. On behalf of the  Yemeni people, we congratulate you on the occasion of the  blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of the Yemeni  Republic. These days, our country is living through a  regrettable war launched by certain separatist elements, led by  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] headed by traitor 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, who returned to the black history before 22 May 1990  when he announced late last night the official secession from  the Yemeni body. He announced secession for his personal  objectives and for the objectives of certain influential  elements in the party. We would like to reassure our people,  the good people and unionists in the world, and the masses of  our Arab nation that unity continues and exists, and is backed  by wide popular support all over united Yemen. Separation [word  indistinct] only concerns individuals and a clique that includes  certain elements in the YSP leadership. I welcome the press and  the news agencies again, and I am ready to answer all questions.    [Sulayman Nimr, AL-HAYAH and BBC] Your Excellency the  President, now after 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the YSP have  announced their separation from the united Yemen, does this mean  that the cease-fire will end? Will this mean that you will  continue the battle to end the current situation in Aden?    [Salih] Yesterday we announced a decision by the  presidential  council, the speakership of the House of Representatives, and  the council of ministers--in response to the demand of the  unionist elements within the YSP and Arab and international  efforts to end the war--to provide a chance for the rebels, led  by the party, to surrender themselves to justice and to give a  chance for those who were deceived in the Armed Forces and who  were left under the authority of the YSP to return to legitimacy  and to the army of unity, the army of unity and democracy, the  army of the constitutional legitimacy. We issued this decree to  cease fire for 72 hours, three days, in order to give them a  chance. This decision was met with support from our brothers in  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Arab Republic of Egypt, and the  United States. However, YSP-led separatist elements did not  respond to this decision and they continued the war on various  fronts. This decision or decree stated that if those who hold  sway over the YSP do not stop, the response will be firm. They  did not stop. Regrettably, the battles continue.    [Unidentified correspondent] Your Excellency the  President: The entire Arab world is one body and Yemen is a  part of it. President Husni Mubarak held numerous unpublicized  contacts to close Arab ranks. [Words indistinct] Egypt's role  and what is expected from it?    [Salih] Egypt is exerting itself and Brother President  Mubarak urged the parties to cease fighting. We responded to  the cease-fire call. The leadership held [word indistinct] and  made a decision. We cannot do without Egypt's role; We have a  soft spot for Egypt. Egypt has exerted itself to bring an end to  the hostilities.    [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Yemeni  masses  for civilian life to continue, and democracy, and political  pluralism? [words indistinct] Yemeni expatriates around the  world about what is actually happening in Yemen, and what is the  future of Yemen [words indistinct]?    [Salih] First of all, the bulk of the Republic's territory  is under the control of the army of constitutional legality,  even the areas where the military has no presence are absolutely  committed to Yemeni unity. We reassure our people, our Arab  masses, and expatriates that, God willing, the secessionists  will be defeated or arrested and brought to justice. They may  seek to flee the country.    Yemen will see an extensive development program following  the  frustrations experienced by the Yemeni people in the southern  and eastern governorates while under the control of the YSP when  they and ourselves shared power after the proclamation of the  Republic of Yemen. Then, instability, insecurity and lax  bureaucracy and financial and administrative corruption were the  order of the day. That was a deliberate policy on the part of  the secessionist YSP leadership. The future of Yemen, God  willing, promises to be one of security, stability, democracy,  political party pluralism, and modern institutions. God  willing, local government will be improved and there will be a  greater degree of decentralization -- financial and  administrative. Local governments will enjoy greater and wider  powers throughout Yemen.    [Unidentified correspondent] Many happy returns of the 'Id.  I would like to begin by saying that, despite the political  leadership's high credibility and the fact that news  correspondents have been given the liberty to move directly to  the field of action, reports carried by some agencies and radio  stations do not reflect what is taking place in the Yemeni  arena. [Words indistinct] credibility. What would Your  Excellency the President like to tell these correspondents so  that they will measure up to the trust placed in them by the  political leadership that has allowed them freedom of movement?  The second part of my question: We are not surprised by the  secession. The secession was declared on the very day the  merger was proclaimed. Evidence is found in the stockpiles of  [word indistinct] divisionist weapons. This is not strange,  coming from the gang that plotted secession from day one. But  what is the link between the timing of the official declaration  of secession and the remarkable successes scored by our Armed  Forces, the forces of constitutional legality? Thank you, Your  Excellency the President.    [Salih] Thank you. I mean [word indistinct] the beginning  of the question. First, with regard to the world news agencies,  press, and television stations, as well as the Arab and foreign  television stations, we in fact regret the biased role played by  some papers, news agencies, and television stations.    Perhaps, some foreign television stations take reports from  some Arab television stations and newspapers, so the former  stations did not follow up on the facts themselves in order to  find out the actual situation. We, however, do not pay  attention to certain distortions of positions and to the lack of  credibility by some media. We pay attention to what takes place  on the ground. We do not pay attention to what is said by  certain radio stations, journalists, or television stations. We  pay attention to our presence on the ground, to tightly  controlling the Republic's territory, and to repulsing and  expelling the secessionist elements.    [Correspondent] Your Excellency the President: The second  part of the question is: What is the link between timing the  official declaration of secession [word indistinct] moments, and  [word indistinct] the great victories achieved by our Armed  Forces, which are defending unity and legitimacy?    [Salih] The link is that victories were achieved on the  ground. Thus, there was no room for al-Bid and the  secessionists' clique but to officially declare secession  because al-Bid is unable to confront the army of the people,  unity, and legitimacy. He has officially declared secession at  a time when he has actually seceded, but in an undeclared  manner, since he returned from Washington to Aden. We, however,  were not surprised by this issue because he had seceded in the  first place. Moreover, he unwillingly joined unity, and he did  not like unity. Representative of the YSP, al-Bid's political  rhetoric said that it is the party of unionists. He, however,  lost credibility regarding his party, himself, his homeland, and  the Arab and foreign world.    They say that the YSP was established on unionist bases. How  could this be true now that secession has been declared? Thus,  where is this credibility?    [Unidentified moderator] May we give an opportunity to  non-Arabs, please?    [Salih] Go ahead.    [Moderator in English] Come, non-Arabic speaking  correspondents.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English] We already have  indications that some Arab countries, and perhaps others as  well, are prepared to give support to the declaration of  independence by Mr. al-Bid. How worried are you about this, and  what effect will it have on your objection so far to any form of  negotiations [words indistinct] with Mr. (?al-Bid)?    [Salih] First of all, any Arab country or any friendly state  that attempts to sympathize with this secessionist decision will  be counted in the camp of the enemies of the people of Yemen.  This is also considered flagrant interference in Yemeni affairs.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English] [words indistinct]  So, after this truce, which will last for three days or so, do  you intend to go only to Aden, to take over Aden or [words  indistinct]    [Salih] We are now tightening the ring around Aden, the  economic and commercial capital. After tightening the ring  around Aden, our intention was not to enter the capital with the  Army. But with 'Ali Salim al-Bid's announcement of secession  and declaration that Aden is the capital of his party, we will  have to enter Aden by any means necessary. Afterward, the Army  will chase the remainder of the party's leadership in  al-Mukalla. Thus, al-Bid will have to flee either to Oman or to  (?al-Sharawrah) toward Saudi Arabia to join his secessionist  colleagues living abroad. In fact, he and his colleagues have  sent their children and families abroad as well as the fortunes  they have accumulated from here and abroad. He will be forced  to go after the funds he has deposited in banks abroad, funds he  received as price for the crisis, and with which he ignited the  war. He will run after the funds he managed to amass during  this period. He has no cause, and if he did have a cause, he  would have stood fast in Aden and would not have left Aden. As  he left Aden for al-Mukalla, so will he leave al-Mukalla for  outside Yemen.    [Unidentified correspondent] President Mubarak [word  indistinct] the cease-fire during the 'Id. You responded to  this. Al-Bid announced that he accepts the cease-fire but after  that he announced secession?    [Salih] [Words indistinct] cease-fire announcement [words  indistinct] but immediately after the cease-fire announcement,  he proclaimed the secession.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, [words  indistinct] 'Ali Salim al-Bid [words indistinct]    [Salih] For the second time, any recognition of this means  that this country will be the direct enemy of the Yemeni people.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English] In light of the  declaration of the separatist state, do you intend to continue  the war in the next three days [words indistinct]?    [Salih] We said [words indistinct] cease-fire but the [words  indistinct] did not stop fighting. This [words indistinct]  forces us to pursue military operations. [words indistinct] for  the information of the press, several of the units loyal to the  YSP announced [word indistinct] yesterday after the secession  decision [words indistinct] announced their loyalty to  legitimacy. This was the ('Affan) Brigade, one of the most  important brigades, the [word indistinct] Brigade, the Hunayshan  Brigade, and the [word indistinct] Brigade announced their  allegiance to legitimacy.    [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] regarding  other political reactions [words indistinct] the YSP members  [words indistinct]. What is their stand on the [words  indistinct]?    [Salih] [Words indistinct] in the Yemeni arena, they  condemned this decision. We demand condemnation [words  indistinct]. They have conveyed to us their condemnation over  the phone. Other parties [words indistinct] should condemn this  secessionist decision through the press and electronic media.  Most YSP leaders in Yemen, not only in the north, but in Yemen  as a whole, support unity. Most of them have made their stands  known. Perhaps statements will be issued by the YSP  organizations in some governorates of the Republic. Some YSP  leaders have submitted their resignations en masse. I have  received their party cards and resignation letters from various  governorates of the Republic. [words indistinct] this excellent  unionist stand. Only 'Ali Salim al-Bid and those who stand to  benefit from this situation among the leaders of the YSP have  remained. Eventually, he will be left alone.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English] [Words indistinct]  much longer [words indistinct]?    [Salih] This is up to the commanders in the field to decide.  Our hope is that the battle will be decided within hours or  days. However, we are facing the YSP war machine that once  belonged to a member of the socialist bloc. After the  declaration of the republic, particularly after the beginning of  the crisis nine months ago, the YSP received double the quantity  of the weapons that it inherited from the socialist bloc. We  are facing difficulty, but we have taken approximately 80  percent of their equipment. This includes what has been hit,  surrendered, or seized. During the past 12 hours, we have  received information that a number of strategic Tupolev planes  are transporting a cargo at the al-Riyan airport in Hadhramaut,  (?each carrying two tanks). There is also a vessel carrying a  number of vehicles, ammunition, artillery, and tanks to the  al-Mukalla port. From this premise, we warn all countries  involved in this affair and that seek to prolong this battle.  We warn against weapons sales, and the arrival of vessels to  ports that fall under the control of the party, and aircraft  that pass through Yemeni airspace, we warn against their  arrival, and this will be viewed as blatant interference. This  will prolong the battle. We warn all the friendly and fraternal  countries against becoming involved in this matter to support  this secessionist party as this will be viewed as blatant  interference in Yemeni affairs.    [Unidentified correspondent] What role are regional  countries  playing in the Yemeni crisis?    [Salih] [Words indistinct] weapons from arms dealers. Arms  sales are funded by the YSP, which has large amounts of money.  Thanks again to the press and newsmen. Many happy returns.</p>

They freely  expressed their views at a forum held by the State Council's  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office [SCHKMAO] and the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY's Hong Kong Branch [XNAHKB] in the past couple of days,  thereby demonstrating a great sense of responsibility befitting  those who are the masters of their own affairs.    The forum for Hong Kong affairs advisers was held in  Shenzhen  from 2 to 3 March. SCHKMAO Director Lu Ping and XNAHKB Director  Zhou Nan presided over the forum and listened to advisers'  views. During the forum, the advisers pointed out: Britain's  "White Paper" announced recently and its various unilateral  sabotages of the talks revealed the deceptive nature of  "cooperation with China" -- a phrase that it has kept on  repeating. The negative example set by Britain which may serve  as a lesson has made more and more Hong Kong people realize the  truth and become disillusioned. We must specially watch out for  various "actions" on the part of the Hong Kong British  authorities, such as making trouble in the economic and banking  sectors, before they pull out. Analyzing the series of moves  taken by the Hong Kong British authorities in recent years, some  advisers believed that Britain's sabotage of Sino-British talks  and Hong Kong's smooth transition was planned beforehand for the  purpose of leaving a "hot potato" for the special  administrative regional government in the future. In this  connection, China should make proper preparations to meet  various emergencies.    The issues of government functionaries' and people's  livelihood in Hong Kong also caught the attention of advisers.  During the forum, they discussed how to solve the housing,  transportation, and public security problems facing ordinary  citizens and how to guarantee the support for the aged after  they have retired; they made many constructive suggestions.    The advisers said: There are only a little more than three  years left before China regains its sovereignty over Hong Kong  in 1997. As China and Britain fail to reach an agreement,  preparatory work for the special administrative regional  government should be accelerated. In this regard, the tasks of  the Preliminary Working Committee are particularly important.  The arduous tasks should be jointly undertaken by all patriotic  Hong Kong people who love Hong Kong with the attitude of those  who are the masters of their own affairs. The Hong Kong affairs  advisers will also make efforts, communicate with the broad  masses of citizens, and make contributions to Hong Kong's smooth  transition and to its long-term prosperity and stability.    In their speeches, relevant persons in charge of the SCHKMAO  and XNAHKB who attended the meeting said: The rule of Hong Kong  by Hong Kong people after "97" is possible only with the  participation of the Hong Kong people before "97." The  advisers' views and suggestions are a concrete embodiment of the  active participation by the Hong Kong people; they play a role  in promoting the post-transition work and, meanwhile, reflect  the prospect of "the rule of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people" as  well as the confidence that Hong Kong and Macao compatriots have  in marching toward 1997.    SCHKMAO Deputy Director Chen Ziying and XNAHKB Deputy  Director Qin Wenjun attended the forum.</p>

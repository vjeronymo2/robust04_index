			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 4--Israel would like to see India  play an "intensive part" in the multi-lateral peace efforts in  West Asia, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel, Mr Yossi  Beilin, told reporters here today while replying to questions at  a press conference.    He hinted at the "limitless" scope of cooperation between  the  two countries. Though Israel had no specific plans, he said it  could sell arms to India and share its experiences in tackling  problems relating to agriculture and water scarcity. India and  Israel could also join in helping developing countries such as  those of the CIS in the former Soviet Union.    He also said that Israel hoped to establish diplomatic  relations "very soon" with several Muslim countries that  included the Gulf nations, Morocco and Tunisia. These countries  were awaiting the implementation of the peace process in West  Asia.    Mr Beilin, who had signed an agreement on civil aviation  ties  between the two countries with Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, the Union  Minister for Civil Aviation, before attending the press  conference, spoke warmly of his talks with several Indian  leaders of the ruling party as well as the Opposition, including  the Foreign Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh, and Mr L.K. Advani, the  BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] president.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Caricom cuts import tariff THE Caribbean Community (Caricom) has lowered the rates of a controversial tariff being applied to imports from third countries. However, the reduction has angered regional businesses which want continued protection, and is not expected to satisfy the community's critics, including the US, which want more substantial and immediate cuts. At an extraordinary summit in Trinidad, the leaders of the 13 Caricom states agreed to reduce the top level of the common external tariff from 45 per cent to between 30 per cent and 35 per cent, with all states committed to this reduction between January 1 and June 30 next year. This will be followed by a further reduction of the top rate to between 25 per cent and 30 per cent by 1995, with the rate falling to between 20 per cent and 25 per cent by 1997. The Community, which has a market of 5.5m people, is made up of 13 English-speaking countries of the region, and is trying to create a customs union which the members have agreed is a prerequisite for a planned common market. The Bahamas is not a party to the community's trading arrangements, and Belize has been granted permission to delay the implementation of the new tariff arrangements.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government has decided to retain the right to  levy tariffs on 250 import items, including textiles, footwear  and glass, either in proportion to their value or volume, the  Ministry of Finance said yesterday.    The option to impose ad valorem rates or special rates in  proportion to volume on the 250 imports will be contained in the  country schedule of tariffs the government is scheduled to  submit to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade today, the  ministry said.    Special rates applied in proportion to volume can be applied  to control imports of low-priced textiles, footwear and other  products from developing countries in particular.    Currently, the government applies special rates on 21 types  of film for movie production in proportion to import volume.    In the tariff schedule on the trade of agricultural  products,  industrial products and services, the government will commit  itself to the reduction of agricultural subsidies from 1,718.6  billion won in what is called the total aggregate measurement of  support to 1,490 billion won in 2004, said the Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.    During the 1989-91 base years, the total aggregate  measurement of support amounted to 1,568.4 billion won for rice  production, 52.3 billion won for barley production, 72.9 billion  won for soybean production, 22.6 billion won for corn production  and 2.4 million for rape seed production.    In the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations, which  were concluded Dec. 15 last year, the government committed  itself to the opening of the domestic agricultural market to  imports and tariff cuts. Under the Uruguay Round, Korea will  have to increase its rice imports from 1 percent of its needs in  1995 to 4 percent in 2004. The government is required to open  the domestic market wider for other agricultural products, beef,  pork and chicken through tariffication, quota increases and  liberalization.    During the 10 years from next year, the government will have  to cut the average concessionary tariff rates on industrial and  fishery products from 17.9 percent in the 1986 base year to 8.1  percent in 2004.    With applied rates standing 7.9 percent now, the Ministry of  Finance said, the scheduled concessionary tariff cut will have  little impact on Korea's imports.    Applied rates on only 10 nonferrous metals are now higher  than concessionary rates, or rates the government will commit  itself to in its country schedule of tariffs to be submitted to  the GATT, the ministry said.    The government will also commit itself to reducing tariffs  on  128 items in 10 sectors, including steel, construction equipment  and agricultural machinery, to zero rate during the next 15  years.    As a result of tariff cuts and removal, the ministry said,  revenues from import duties will begin to decline in 1998.</p>

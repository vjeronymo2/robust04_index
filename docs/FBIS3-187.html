These political negotiations were only "stage-managed by the  Zairian political class" comprising "90 percent of Mobutu  supporters," Matanda added at a news conference. He described  Monsignor Monsengwo, under whose auspices the negotiations took  place, as a "traitor". According to Matanda, the bishop  "betrayed the civilian, military, and religious population's  confidence," adding that the negotiations also served to get rid  of Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi.    The Zairian opposition is capable of "overthrowing President  Mobutu," and they do not need troops to do so. "They only have  to paralyze the sensitive areas by blowing up fuel pipelines,  the rail lines or the high tension pylons." Matanda said  "Mobutu has an army which has been reduced to its simplest form,  in a miserable state." He said "Mobutu can be overthrown, the  most important thing is to start it." Jacques Matanda, however,  admitted the existence "of divergent views within the  opposition."    Matanda also spoke about the support given by the Angolan  authorities to Zairian "nationalists" who had launched an armed  attack on the province of Shaba (extreme south of Zaire) in  March 1977. Nathaniel Mbumba's National Front for the  Liberation of Shaba had the "blessing of the ruling Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola and particularly that of  the defunct President Agostinho Neto," Matanda pointed out.  Luanda had several times denied Kinshasa's accusations of the  presence of Katangese maquisards in Angola.    Furthermore, Matanda said that soldiers from the Zairian  president's special division unit fought on the side of the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] for  the capture of the oil town of Soyo (northern Angola). "Most of  the soldiers fighting in northern Angola" with UNITA come from  Zaire, Matanda added.</p>

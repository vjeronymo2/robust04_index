			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / July money supply rise eases fears A RISE in the money supply last month has reduced fears that the economy may be sliding into further decline, though it provides little sign of an upturn. M0, which mostly comprises notes and coins in circulation, increased by 2.4 per cent in the 12 months to the end of July, after a year-on-year rise of 1.3 per cent in June and 2.5 per cent in May. M4, a broader measure which also takes in bank and building society deposits, rose 5.7 per cent in the year to the end of last month, following a year-on-year rise of 5.3 per cent in June and of 5.2 per cent in the previous month. The changes in the seasonally adjusted figures fit in with the picture of a flat economy. M0 rose by 1.2 per cent between June and July, while M4 increased by 0.8 per cent. Last month total M4 lending rose by Pounds 2.8bn, in line with expectations. The increase may have been partly due to extra mortgage borrowing, triggered by the stamp duty holiday which ended this week. Figures from the British Bankers' Association on behalf of the nine biggest UK commercial banks fit this interpretation. These groups lent a seasonally adjusted Pounds 900m in July, with much of the total accounted for by mortgage borrowing. Not allowing for seasonal fluctuations, lending for house purchases by the banks rose by Pounds 805m, out of a total increase in net lending to people and companies of Pounds 565m. In the industrial sector many companies made repayments, adding up to Pounds 379m for property companies, Pounds 341m for securities dealers, Pounds 118m for construction groups and Pounds 115m for the hotels and catering sector. However, lending to manufacturers rose by Pounds 541m. Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, a London finance group, said: 'The figures show the economy is failing to pick up, but at least it is not falling back.' The British Bankers' Association said much of the upward trend in lending was due to extra borrowing on mortgages. It said it 'remained to be seen' whether the extra activity would continue after the end of the stamp duty holiday last Wednesday. Among the banks, deposits from the UK private sector fell by Pounds 1.07bn. After adjustment for seasonal factors, the underlying movement showed a rise of Pounds 2.6bn, with most of this rise accounted for by companies.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: KFW issues Germany's first 'stripped' bonds THE Kreditinstitut fur Wiederaufbau (KFW), the state-owned bank, has launched Germany's first issue of 'stripped' bonds. The DM200m issue was arranged by Metallbank, a Frankfurt merchant bank. The deal comprised of 8 per cent 20-year bonds which were issued at a price of 101.25 yesterday for a yield of 7.87 per cent. However, the interest payments on the bonds have been 'stripped' and repackaged into an issue of 20-year zero coupon bonds. The financing technique originated in the US Treasury market. Investors can choose whether to buy either the 20-year bonds in the normal way, buy the zero coupon paper, or buy the underlying bond without any entitlement to interest. The structure is designed in part to appeal to private investors, who often prefer to buy long-dated zero coupon bonds on tax grounds. There is no tax to pay until these bonds are redeemed in 20 years time. The deal was launched with the permission of the Bundesbank and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Market sources suggested that the Bundesbank itself, and larger German banks, would adopt this funding technique later this year.</p>

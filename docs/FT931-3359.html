			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (15): How the Japanese exported a dream BEYOND MASS PRODUCTION: THE JAPANESE SYSTEM AND ITS TRANSFER TO THE US by Martin Kenney and Richard Florida Oxford Dollars 29.95, 410 pages ARGUABLY THE single most important industrial phenomenon of the past 20 years has been the rise of Japan to dominate many sectors of global manufacturing, initially by exporting but increasingly through the establishment of factories in foreign countries. Much has been written about this achievement, but largely by examining manufacturing processes in Japan itself, rather than looking at the nation's success in diffusing these techniques abroad. Now comes Beyond Mass Production, a study by two US academics, Martin Kenney, of the University of California, and Richard Florida, of Carnegie Mellon University, which describes how Japanese companies have established hundreds of so-called 'transplant' factories in the US and adapted American workers to their ways. It is a curiously uneven book, blending some useful description of transplant operations with flights of impenetrable and pretentious academic prose. The authors argue that Japanese companies have pioneered a new manufacturing method (which they call 'innovation mediated production') involving close teamwork, the breakdown of white and blue collar distinctions, and the harnessing of workers' intelligence to create constant innovation. This, they say, marks a distinct and crucial break with traditional US manufacturing techniques (labelled 'Fordism') where workers are unthinking cogs in a machine. All this represents fancy new packaging for some fairly familiar ideas. For example, the Total Quality Management movement, which is becoming increasingly popular across US industry, has similar values to 'innovation mediated production' at its core, learnt from Japan. Nor do the authors serve their cause well by the quality of their forecasting. They suggest, for example, that the Japanese economy is set to enjoy a prolonged boom (whereas the country is now in its worst recession for 20 years), predict that US car company Chrysler is destined to lose its independence (when it is in fact staging a dramatic recovery), and make some highly questionable predictions about Japan's strength in high technology. Yet amid the irritating, jargon-ridden wrapping there is a useful compendium trying to get out. The core chapters describe in straightforward prose how the Japanese have fared in setting up transplant operations in the fields of automobile assembly and parts, as well as electronics, and invested heavy in the US steel and tyre industries. The experiences have been very different in each sector. There is, for example, a much greater gulf between blue and white collar workers in Japanese electronics transplants than in Japanese electronics firms in Japan or in the automotive industry transplants in the US. Even among the car transplants, there is a big divide between Toyota's smooth-running Kentucky plant and Mazda's plant outside Detroit, which has a history of poor labour relations. Nor, as the authors point out, are the Japanese factories paradise: 'Transplants in various industries impose strict rules on their workers; some even use methods of intimidation and surveillance to enforce company loyalty. A few transplants that have tried to get to fill production very quickly have experienced high rates of injury among their workers.' The authors note that in nearly every plant they visited Japanese executives said that one of their greatest problems was teaching American managers to adapt to their ways, both in terms of commitment to the company and the new, collegiate style of management. 'The strength of the Japanese system,' they add, 'is the organic link between managers and workers; this is very difficult to reproduce in the US with traditional American managers.' Yet this problem is not confined to the transplants. Several leading American companies, at the forefront of the quality movement, are also struggling to find the best way to train a new type of flexible, non-autocratic middle manager. Getting the right answer may prove one of the most important factors for success in the new industrial era.</p>

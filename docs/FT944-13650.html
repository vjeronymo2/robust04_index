			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Accor net loss reaches FFr264m for first six months Accor, the French hotels and travel service group, yesterday announced that it had incurred a net deficit of FFr264m (Dollars 49.9m) for the first half of the year, compared with a net profit of FFr109m for the same period in 1993. The company had warned last week that it would fall into the red, partly because of a lack this year of exceptional gains, which boosted earnings in the first half of 1993. In addition to the losses, the company announced that it was planning a series of asset disposals worth an estimated FFr2.5bn by the end of next year. The disposals are aimed at reducing the group's debt burden, which stood at FFr13.3bn at the end of last year, excluding the borrowings and financial commitments relating to Motel 6, the US chain controlled by Accor. Accor, which previously held 39.5 per cent of Motel 6 through IBL, a holding company, said it had decided to consolidate the chain to the level of 73.6 per cent in its accounts. It said that the decision, prompted by the anticipation of the exercise of put options by other investors in the chain, resulted in a negative charge of FFr57m. In spite of the loss, the first in its history, Accor said that its operating results had recovered from a net deficit of FFr74m last year, on a pro-forma basis, to FFr107m. Industry analysts said that the recovery reflected the improved state of the European hotels market following the recession of 1992 and 1993. Accor said that the improved performance of its businesses, and the expected exceptional gains on the disposal of assets, should allow a result for the full year at least equal to the FFr615m achieved in 1993.</p>

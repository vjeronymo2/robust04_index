			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> THE TAX CUT DEBATE;  </P> <P> SOME LAW MAKERS FAVOR LIBERALIZING IRAS. OTHERS WOULD TRIM CAPITAL GAINS  LEVIES. WHICH IS BETTER?  </P> <P> Congress is considering two approaches to cutting taxes. One plan, pushed by  the Bush Administration and passed late last month by the House, would cut  taxes on capital gains for two years to encourage long-term investment. A  counterproposal offered by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) would broaden tax  benefits for people putting money into individual retirement accounts. Which  approach would do the most good for the most people and for the overall  economy? Times researcher Melanie Pickett interviewed experts on the topic.  Excerpts of their comments follow:  </P> <P>  Robert B. Reich, professor of political economy at Harvard University's John  F. Kennedy School of Government:  </P> <P> There's absolutely no evidence that (the capital gains tax cut proposal) will  stimulate productivity or net new investment, simply because it applies to  investments already made. The primary beneficiaries unquestionably are people  with incomes over $200,000.  </P> <P> Another important aspect of this new reality, should the Republican plan be  enacted, is that lower- and middle-income taxpayers would be shouldering a much  greater burden. Not only because they'd be paying more in order to make up for  what high-income taxpayers are not paying, but also because their Social  Security payments, even now, are being applied to budget deficit reduction. And  the Social Security payments, of course, are very regressive. They apply to the  first $43,000 from dollar No. 1 of earnings. Mike Milken last year fulfilled  his Social Security obligations at 18 minutes past midnight on Jan. 1, to give  you some example on how regressive this entire system is. If you put the  Republican tax reduction on capital gains together with what's happening in  Social Security, you come up with a tax system that is the most regressive we  have had in the last 75 years and the most regressive tax system of any  industrialized nation.  </P> <P> As to the Democrats' plan, it's not that much better. IRA deductions are  already available to families (with incomes) lower than $50,000, so all this  does is extend IRA deductions to families with incomes greater than $50,000.  And although in Los Angeles that may feel like middle class, that's actually  upper-middle class in the nation.  </P> <P> In terms of stimulating savings, the jury is out on the Democrats' plan. The  evidence we have as to whether IRAs actually stimulate new savings is  ambiguous. And different studies tend to show different things.  </P> <P> The average middle-class taxpayer loses by the Republican plan and doesn't gain  anything by the Democrat plan. The upper-middle-income taxpayer gains a bit  from the Democratic plan because IRAs can be deducted. He gains very little  from the Republican plan. The 600,000 wealthiest individuals in the country  stand to gain a great deal from the Republican plan because this enables them  to shelter more of their income and to sell their assets at windfall rates.  </P> <P> David Keating, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union:  </P> <P> Either proposal can help the economy, again as long as they're not paid for by  raising marginal tax rates or by making some other harmful change. But it's  equally important that Congress control the spending so the deficit doesn't  balloon. It's not commonly known, but the government is still getting a huge  amount of new revenue each year from economic growth and some tax increases  that have already been built into the system. So even with changes such as the  capital gains tax rate reduction or even an extended IRA deduction, in the  grand scheme of things, the government is still going to be getting a big  increase in revenue from year to year. Even with these so-called tax cuts. But  whatever changes are made by either plan, the changes in the economy will be  fairly minor. Simply because the cuts themselves are fairly small when you  compare them to the size of the economy.  </P> <P> If you just look at the tax due at the bottom of the 1040 form, it's possible  more people might claim an expanded IRA deduction than would benefit from a  capital gains deduction. But I haven't seen the numbers on that and I don't  know how they would compare. I wouldn't be surprised if they were pretty close  to each other.  </P> <P> Alice M. Rivlin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office and currently a  senior fellow at the Brookings Institution:  </P> <P> I think both are pretty dubious propositions. The tax reform of 1986, which  gave us a much more equitable income tax, was a good thing. And eroding it by  making additional special provisions, whether for capital gains or for IRAs or  whatever, is unfortunate.  </P> <P> The deficit is a long-run problem. We need to be worrying about how to bring  the federal deficit down. It doesn't make sense to take short-run revenue  increases (as more investors sell assets to take advantage of lower capital  gains taxes) at the expense of long-run losses.  </P> <P> Lawrence A. Krause, San Francisco financial planner and author:  </P> <P> The reality is that people are tax motivated. When they took away the tax  incentives from IRAs, the sales went down substantially. The change in 1982,  (expanding tax deductions for IRAs), showed that people who swore that they  could never put money aside indeed could, given the right incentives. And it  made investors out of people who previously were just savers.  </P> <P> Is that good for the economy? In the long run, of course. In the short run,  maybe it was negative as far as taxes go, maybe it didn't bring in the revenue.  But you can't tell me that by teaching people to save and invest, that's bad in  the long run.  </P> <P> The same thing holds true with regard to capital gains. By taking away capital  gains incentives, you're taking away motivation.  </P> <P> The little guy, if he's motivated to save money in the first place, for example  through the IRA, then maybe he can take advantage of capital gains, too, down  the road. But he has to have the incentives to do that.  </P> <P> What boggles my imagination is that you'll talk about something that will add  to the deficit or bring in less revenue by -- pick a number -- $3-, $4- or  $5-billion on one side of the coin, and on the other side of the coin you talk  about a savings and loan debacle of $160 or $200 billion -- and that's waved  over like a wand.  </P> <P> Mike Schuyler, an economist with the Institute for Research on the Economics of  Taxation:  </P> <P> It's desirable for the economy to lower the capital gains tax rate. It's also  desirable to return to the broader IRAs we had before the 1986 tax act. So in  contrast to what some people are saying on Capitol Hill, I do not regard the  IRA proposal as in any way a substitute for a lower capital gains rate nor do I  think that expanded IRAs on their own merits are a bad idea.  </P> <P> What I really would like to see would be a reduction in the real capital gains  tax rate and, to prevent inflation from covertly taking back some of the  reduction, I would also like to see capital gains indexed for inflation. If I  had my druthers, I think I would prefer that the capital gains tax be  abolished. But short of that, a lower rate and inflation indexing so inflation  does not produce fat gains which people have to pay real taxes on.  </P> <P> The Bentsen IRA proposal is not as good as the old law because the  deductibility would be only 50% for people who are single and have incomes over  $35,000 or (for joint filers who earn) over $50,000. They would have to fill  out informational forms every year they paid this partially  deductible/partially non-deductible IRA. Based on the information forms that  presently have to be filled out for the non-deductible IRAs, which many people  are saying are complicated, it would be a burdensome thing for taxpayers. Also,  taxpayers have the problem that when they have a mixture of deductible and  non-deductible contributions, they have to keep records until they begin to  make withdrawals, which could be a generation from now.  </P> <P> Bentsen's proposal to allow people greater ability to make withdrawals is  desirable in the sense you want to encourage people to save for their own  retirements -- to exercise more responsibility. And actually I think people  left to themselves tend to do that very well. One of the problems we've had is  the tax system creates a strong bias for people to consume immediately and  short-change the future.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppets staged a joint air war exercise to  examine the capacity of a surprise strike on the North in the  skies above Pyongchang, Hoengsong and Asan bay, South Korea, on  May 26, military sources said.    It involved many overseas-based U.S. warplanes and  fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes,  reconnaissance planes and early warning planes belonging to the  U.S. Airforce in South Korea and the puppet Airforce.    Meanwhile, 105-mm artillery groups and bandits of the puppet  army took combat positions in Paju and Yonchon Counties, Kyonggi  Province, and Chorwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province, and  fired more than 300 shells and bullets of large-caliber  machineguns at spots adjacent to the Demilitarized Zone along  the Military Demarcation Line.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER SUPREME COURT'S ABORTION DECISION  </P> <P> Regarding the abortion controversy ("Dislike Abortion Ruling? We Voted for It,"  by Martin Schram, Op-Ed Page, July 10), are there others, like me, who have had  their pro-choice leanings strengthened because of the actions of the pro-life  demonstrators? They seem to show so much hostility to the women who have made  this choice. I get the feeling many of them want the women punished for  perceived sexual transgressions.  </P> <P> I do not think a baby should ever be a punishment.  </P> <P> LaVONE DRUMMOND  </P> <P> Buena Park  </P></p>

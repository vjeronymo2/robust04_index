			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Presidents join to sell Nafta THE White House yesterday produced an extraordinary display of bipartisanship, pageantry and salesmanship which laid to rest any doubts about President Bill Clinton's commitment to congressional passage of a North American Free Trade Agreement. 'We will make our case as hard and as well as we can,' he told supporters of the pact between the US, Canada and Mexico. 'Nafta will create jobs - good paying jobs. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't support this agreement.' The ceremony - for the signing of labour, environmental and import surge side agreements - began with a spine-tingling entrance of Presidents Clinton, Bush, Carter and Ford walking abreast to the strains of Hail to the Chief. Vice President Al Gore, the first up to the podium, praised the 'long series of commitments by presidents of both parties' which paved the way for Nafta. He lauded the bipartisan US foreign policy, in place since the second world war, as 'how we won the cold war. . . how we promoted peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.' Mr Clinton ad libbed at length - too much length, so that the three ex-presidents eventually sat down - but he rescued his performance with several moments of real eloquence. Most important, he framed the Nafta debate in a way that has been wholly lacking before as about whether Americans would 'embrace' the changes in the global economy or 'try to resist them and try to preserve the economic structures of yesterday'. Workers have become 'vulnerable to fear tactics - that is behind most of the opposition to Nafta'. However, he said, 'when you live in a time of change, the only way to recover your security is to broaden your horizons and to adapt to the change. . . 'If we learned anything from the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the governments of eastern Europe, even a totally controlled society cannot resist the winds of change,' he said. Each former president urged support for Nafta. It fell to Jimmy Carter to take on Mr Ross Perot, the billionaire leading opposition to Nafta, as 'a demagogue. . . who has unlimited financial resources' and 'is extremely careless with the truth'.</p>

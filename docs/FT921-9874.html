			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Output rise by small companies 'delayed' AN IMPROVEMENT in orders and output expected by smaller businesses four months ago has yet to materialise, according to the latest Smaller Firms' Economic Report from the Confederation of British Industry. The report for last month confirms that businesses have consistently underestimated the extent of the recession in manufacturing. It shows that the rate of decline in output and orders for small businesses slowed in the four months to last month, and that a further slowdown is expected over the coming four months. Mr Richard Brucciani, the new chairman of the CBI's Smaller Firms' Council, said that the slowdown in the rate of decline was a positive sign, but the growth in orders and output for which small businesses hoped still appeared to be some way off. More small businesses are cutting investments in plant and machinery although spending on training is set to rise, the report says. Spending on product and process innovation is not expected to change. It adds that cost pressures have remained weak and that unit costs will continue to rise only very slowly in the coming months. However, the expected increase in export orders has not occurred, and there has been a rise in the number of businesses reporting a decline in overseas orders. One in three companies cited the political and economic situation abroad as constraining export orders, apparently reflecting difficulties in the US and German economies.

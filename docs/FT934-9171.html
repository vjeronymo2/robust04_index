			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (8): Raising global profiles - Korean companies are limited when it comes to securing cash overseas MANY of Korea's largest companies are competing for business on a global basis, but their ability to raise funds in overseas markets is restricted. Since domestic interest rates can be as much as 10 percentage points higher than rates in international markets, this puts them at a competitive disadvantage. It is no surprise, therefore, to find that Korean companies have taken full advantage of the gradual liberalisation of these restrictions and have worked hard to raise their profiles with foreign investors. 'In our case, our capital expenses are so big that we have to secure funding from overseas,' said Jang Yeul Koo, general manager, international finance department at Samsung Electronics. 'The domestic market is not sufficient to meet our requirements.' However, the Korean government continues to exercise strict control over bond issuance and occasionally delays or reduces the size of issues. 'Many companies are interested in raising money overseas,' said Chan-Yull Lim, assistant minister at the Korean ministry of finance. Because of the large interest rate difference, if permitted 'everyone will go abroad', says Mr Lim. 'Usually we allow companies to raise money overseas when they will use that money to import from overseas,' he says. The authorities are concerned that excessive overseas borrowing will affect the growth of money supply and cause the level of inflation to rise. For this reason, Korean companies are not permitted, for example, to refinance domestic debt in the international market. However, the government has raised the limit on overseas borrowing from Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn for this year and the level is likely to be the same next year. Firms have to gain approval for each offering and approval is based on the purpose of the financing. Reasons other than capital expenditure, preferably on equipment from abroad, are frowned upon. 'Korean companies would like to be able to be more opportunistic in the market,' said one banker. In spite of restrictions, companies are sometimes able to take advantage of opportunities in the swap market to reduce funding costs. Last year, Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), needed to borrow yen in order to repay some yen syndicated loans. It proved cheaper to issue debt in dollars and swap into yen. Yon Woon Kim, senior managing director of Posco, estimates that the swap saved the company Dollars 14m. Korean companies have approached the international market gradually. 'Korean companies used to be financed by syndicated loans in the 1970s and 1980s,' said Edward Kim, general manager, international finance at Korea Development Securities, a wholly owned subsidiary fo the Korean Development Bank. 'In the mid-1980s, they started issuing convertible bonds then as credit perception improved, they were able to issue straight debt,' Mr Kim said. As well as offering lower interest rates, the international markets offer more scope for companies to issue longer term debt. Korean borrowers are reaching an increasingly broad range of investors. Having started by issuing in the Eurobond market, some have now tapped both the US Yankee bond market and the Japanese Samurai bond market. Some companies have moved into more esoteric markets. Samsung Electronics, for example, is one of the first borrowers ever to set up a programme in the Hungarian Forints Commercial paper market which it will use to finance its plant there. In order to reach a broader audience of international investors, an increasing number of Korean borrowers are seeking ratings from the leading international credit rating agencies, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Ratings are considered more necessary for companies that want to issue straight bonds than for those issuing equity-linked bonds. Since the Republic of Korea was rated A+ by Standard &amp; Poor's in 1988, a number of wholly or partly government-owned entities have achieved the same rating, including the Korean Development Bank (KDB), Korea Electric Power (Kepco) and Korea Telecom. Moody's does not rate the Republic, but the government-guaranteed KDB and Export-Import Bank of Korea are rated A1 by Moody's. David Levey, head of sovereign ratings at Moody's said that the much lower level of debt that Korea has achieved and its continued strong economic performance, in spite of some slowdown, had to be balanced against the uncertainty over potential reunification with North Korea. So far, few industrial companies have gained ratings. Posco is rated A2 by Moody's and A+ by Standard &amp; Poor's, while Samsung Electronics is rated Baa2 by Moody's and A- by Standard &amp; Poor's. However, more companies are likely to seek ratings in the future, although there is a tendency for companies to want ratings only if they will be in the single-A category. Companies have also made efforts to explain their credits directly to investors. Samsung Electronics, for example, has hosted regular roadshows to coincide with new issues. Posco, the world's third largest steel producer, was 'well known in Asia but not in the west', according to Posco's Mr Kim. In its efforts to develop its investor base, the company holds one-to-one meetings with investors rather than road shows. Traders in London say that demand for Korean companies' issues is strong, providing issues are correctly priced. Investors generally require a slight premium over similar European or US credits. Samsung has been active in a wide range of markets and has issued commercial paper as well as long-term debt. So far this year, the company has tapped the US and D-mark CP markets. It is also considering setting up a sterling CP programme, if its sterling requirement proves sufficiently large. The company has a colour television factory in Billingham. 'In the future we will need to diversify our exposure. Our overseas activities are increasing and we need to meet those needs,' said Mr Koo, adding that dollars, D-marks and sterling were of particular interest. Posco, too, has made a 'strategic decision to diversify funding sources and investor groups' so that it can continue to finance new projects worldwide, says Mr Kim. Korean companies have also been active in issuing depository receipts or global depositary receipts. 'If we offer equity in the Korean market, it has be at a discounted price. In the foreign markets we can issue at a premium,' said Mr Koo of Samsung.</p>

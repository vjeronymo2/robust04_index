			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Associated Dairies backs QUF offer ASSOCIATED Dairies, the Victoria-based dairy products company which is the focus of an ADollars 82m (USDollars 55m) bid battle, is recommending that shareholders accept a ADollars 3.35 a share offer from QUF Industries in the absence of a higher bid. 'Your directors regard the offer as fair and reasonable and recommend that you join them in accepting this offer in the absence of a higher offer,' Associated Dairies said in its formal bid response document filed yesterday. Australian Co-Operative Foods (ACF) has launched a rival bid for Associated Dairies, but this is currently worth only ADollars 3.25 a share. ACF holds just under 20 per cent of its target's equity, shares which were bought at prices significantly below the QUF offer terms. This would allow ACF to walk away from the battle with a profit of almost ADollars 6m, if it chooses not to raise its terms again. Associated Dairies directors, however, advised shareholders to wait until the last minute before accepting the offer from QUF. 'As your company has a unique position within the Victorian dairy industry, it is possible that either or both of these offers could be revised upwards in the days ahead,' they said.</p>

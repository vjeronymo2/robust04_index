President Chon Tu-hwan sent director of the Agency for  National Security Planning [NSP] Chang Se-tong to Pyongyang  after Ho Tam, secretary of the North Korean Workers' (Communist)  Party, visited Seoul as the special envoy of President Kim  Il-song, the daily claimed in its story. Ho arrived in Seoul on  Sept. 4 through the truce village of Panmunjom and stayed until  Sept. 6, while Chang visited Pyongyang through Panmunjom from  Oct. 16 until Oct. 18, it said.    The presidents discussed through their envoys how to arrange  the first Seoul-Pyongyang summit.    Pak Chol-on, as special assistant to the NSP director, went  with Chang to Pyongyang while Ho was accompanied by Han Si-hae,  An Pyong-su and Choe Pong-chun. Ho was chairman of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Fatherland, which is  in charge of North Korean policy toward the South, from 1984  until his death in 1991.    Chang met with Kim Il-song on Oct. 17 in Pyongyang and gave  him a letter from Chon asking him to visit Seoul after Chon  visited Pyongyang, the CHUNGANG said.    The two sides discussed ways to hold a summit in Pyongyang  at  "an early date" and a second summit in Seoul, but the meeting  has still to be realized nearly 10 years later.    North Korea was more active than the South in seeking a  summit until the end of 1985, but become reluctant in 1986 as  the South Korean political situation became unstable due to  controversy over constitutional revision.</p>

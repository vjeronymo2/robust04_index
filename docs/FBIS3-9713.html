			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An agreement between the Romanian Ministry of  National Defense and the Ministry of Defense of the Russian  Federation was signed in Bucharest this afternoon. The document  was signed by Gheorghe Dinca, Romanian minister of national  defense, and Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian minister of  defense, who arrived today in Bucharest.    The two ministers believe today's agreement marks a new  stage  in Romanian-Russian relations. In this respect, General Pavel  Grachev told our radio station that this accord also marks the  end of the period of stagnation that emerged in relations  between the two countries after the dismemberment of the former  Soviet Union and the revolution in Romania. The document signed  in Bucharest today, the Russian guest said, is a framework  agreement that pertains to all aspects of military cooperation,  including technical-military cooperation, thus presupposing  normal relations between two neighboring countries.    Gheorghe Tinca said that this accord creates a normal  framework for ties between the two neighboring countries and is  not directed against anybody else. This is the 15th document of  military cooperation concluded by Romania with neighboring and  other European countries.    This evening the Russian guest also met with Romanian  Foreign  Minister Teodor Melescanu. After the meeting the Romanian  minister of foreign affairs told journalists that he considers  General Grachev's visit to be a signal for the relaunching of  relations between Russia and Romania.</p>

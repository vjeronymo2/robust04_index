			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK rejects Dublin idea on Ulster sovereignty BRITISH and Irish ministers clashed over the future of Northern Ireland last night after the Irish government incensed unionist leaders by floating the idea of joint UK-Irish sovereignty of the province. In a scarcely disguised rebuke, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he had been 'surprised' by comments by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. Speaking after a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, Sir Patrick said Mr Spring had apparently gone beyond the 'cardinal principle' that the constitutional future of Northern Ireland would have to be agreed by the province's population and political leaders. But Mr Spring said that it would be wrong for any option for Northern Ireland to be ruled out: 'If we are not allowed to put forward provocative ideas then we may as well all give up.' Irish officials said privately that the two governments had to be prepared for the possible failure of 'round-table' talks on the province. Mr Spring said that 'ultimately, responsibility lies with governments and I think that the governments have to make that quite clear'. The row reflected growing frustration in London and Dublin at the failure of the two governments to restart the talks involving Northern Ireland's main political leaders, which collapsed last November. Unionists say they will not re-enter until the Irish Republic modifies its constitutional claim on the north. Although his row with Mr Spring lowered still further the chances of talks resuming, Sir Patrick again refused to give up yesterday, saying: 'I don't visualise this process failing.' However, Mr Spring, while still commited to 'round-table' talks, has raised the possibility of the two governments going over the heads of local politicians and agreeing a political framework for the province, which might be put to referendums in Northern Ireland and the south. He said options could include shared authority or sovereignty of the province - both under consideration by the UK Labour party. But Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Sir Patrick have rejected such proposals.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Gardening: Prepare to do some serious weeding and feeding - Spring is in the air and Arthur Hellyer is not ready to let the grass grow under his feet. He is busy getting his lawn into shape IN MY part of West Sussex, which has not been notably short of water, grass scarcely has stopped growing all winter. Indeed, I have been mowing it every month since November. Admittedly, I have no really close-mown lawns: much of my grass is under fruit trees or around ornamental trees and shrubs. And I have rye grass and creeping bent grass, naturally-vigorous species that tend to grow even when conditions are adverse. So, I cannot complain. I imagine, though, that things are very different in some other parts of Britain, particularly in the north, and that some lawns are going to need nursing back into condition. In any case, those who want first-class lawns must be prepared to do some feeding, and probably also some weeding. What grass needs now is food containing a high percentage of nitrogen, and all special lawn fertilisers have this. People with large gardens may decide to save money by buying a high-nitrogen agricultural fertiliser. I use a 20:10:10 mixture - containing nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash in those percentages - at about two ounces per square yard. If growing conditions are good, I can see the effect in a deeper green colour and increased rate of growth within a week or so during April and May. But proprietary lawn fertilisers can differ a lot in strength and must be used according to label instructions. Many gardeners use a wheeled distributor for even spreading. But if the distributor is adjustable, it might be advisable to fill it and wheel it over a large sheet of paper - ruled out in square yards or square metres - to get the rate of distribution just right. It is easy to overlap when wheeling a machine over a lawn. This is why I prefer a fertiliser that shows up clearly on the grass. Double dosing through overlapping can cause damage. Many manufacturers offer a mixture of fertiliser and selective lawn herbicide, which gets two jobs done at once. Personally, I prefer a separate liquid herbicide because I think this gives better cover, but I do not feel strongly about it. There is, however, a more compelling reason for applying the herbicide, wet or dry, as a separate operation - namely, that you need treat only those parts of a lawn that are weedy. Apart from it obviously being a waste of time and money to use weedkillers where they are not needed, it also seems reasonable to avoid unnecessary use of anything that is designed to kill things, however selectively. Do not cut lawns too hard early in the year. They need time to build-up strength after the winter, and they should have enough herbage to make good use of the natural food in the soil plus any added fertiliser. Leaves are the factory of the plant, enabling it to produce all the complex organic compounds on which it depends for growth, and mowing reduces a lawn's ability to do this. Even in high summer, usually there is no point in cutting lawns below one inch unless they are required for games that need a true playing surface. But, for the next few weeks, lawns deserve extra-generous treatment and should be given every opportunity to build up strength. For much the same reason, rollers should not be used except where they are needed to produce a true playing surface. They tend to compact the soil on top; this prevents air from getting to the roots and can cause all sorts of trouble, including killing grass and letting moss thrive. There are plenty of good, swift-acting moss killers about; but if moss has infested a lawn seriously, you might find that, when you have got rid of it, there is little left except weeds. Moles have been very active in my lawns this winter, and I suppose this means there have been plenty of earthworms and leather jackets about. This is one of the penalties of living in the country, where it is almost a waste of time to try to get rid of the moles. Even if they are trapped or poisoned, the lawns are re-populated almost instantly from surrounding fields. In town gardens, moles rarely are a serious problem; if the odd one arrives, usually it can be driven out easily by lighting special mole fusees in the main runs. You can find expert professional mole trappers in most country areas, although my experience is that their time is occupied pretty fully.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Court identifies Lloyd's Names issues ASHMORE AND OTHERS v CORPORATION OF LLOYD'S House of Lords (Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Roskill, Lord Bridge of Harwich, Lord Templeman and Lord Goff of Chieveley): April 1 1992 A LITIGANT has no legitimate expectation that trial will proceed to a conclusion on the evidence to be adduced, and the judge's decision to hear preliminary issues of law before ascertaining whether it is necessary to go on to hear evidence should be respected by the parties and upheld by an appellate court, unless he was plainly wrong. The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the defendant, the Corporation of Lloyd's, from a Court of Appeal decision setting aside Mr Justice Gatehouse's order that preliminary issues of law should be tried in an action by the plaintiffs, Patricia Ashmore and 30 other Lloyd's Names. LORD TEMPLEMAN said Lloyd's was a society of underwriters incorporated by statute and authorised to exercise supervisory, regulatory and disciplinary powers over its members. The plaintiff Names were underwriting members of Lloyd's, organised in syndicates. The relationship between Lloyd's and a member was governed by its constitution, membership documents and written agreement. If a Name was a member of a syndicate, business must be carried on by a managing agent approved by Lloyd's, and the Name must not interfere. The plaintiffs became Names at various times between January 20 1971 and December 30 1981, and were members of syndicates managed by Oakeley Vaughan (Underwriting) Ltd. They claimed damages from Lloyd's for losses on insurance contracts entered into by OVU as managing agent in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983. They issued their writ on August 28 1987 and served points of claim. The trial was fixed for October 8 1990. In August 1990, they obtained leave to make extensive amendments to the points of claim. The trial began before Mr Justice Gatehouse on April 22 1991. Plaintiffs' counsel had reached day seven in his opening when he applied to make further substantial amendments to the points of claim. The application was resisted and took five days to argue. The judge allowed the amendments. He was reluctant to do so at so late a stage. Lloyd's submitted that, since substantial further amendments had been allowed and the trial interrupted and prolonged, preliminary points of law should be ordered to decide whether Lloyd's owed each plaintiff any of the duties alleged in the points of claim and to decide the extent and application of its statutory immunity from suit. The judge ordered preliminary points of law to be argued. The plaintiffs appealed. The Court of Appeal set aside the order. On the present appeal Lloyd's asked that it be restored. It would be necessary for the judge eventually to decide whether Lloyd's owed any duty in law to the plaintiffs. It seemed sensible that that decision should be made at the outset of the trial. If the decision was in the plaintiffs' favour, the judge, having defined the relevant duty, might logically proceed to hear evidence to decide whether Lloyd's acted in breach of duty. If it owed no duty, the action would end without further delay, expense or harassment of witnesses. Mr Justice Gatehouse ordered that questions as to duty of care and statutory immunity from suit be tried as preliminary issues. It was agreed that the immunity issue was suitable for preliminary decision. Before deciding to make the order, the judge considered the dangers involved and the House of Lords guidance in Tilling v Whiteman (1980) AC 1. When a judge alive to the possible consequences decided a particular course should be followed in the conduct of the trial in the interests of justice, his decision should be respected by the parties and upheld by an appellate court unless there were very good grounds for thinking he was plainly wrong. The plaintiffs' first objection to the preliminary issues was that the points of law to be determined did not cover their case that there was a duty in tort. If Lloyd's owed a duty by statute or contract, the preliminary issue would be decided in the plaintiffs' favour. But if no duty was imposed by statute or contract it did not appear that a duty could have arisen in tort. It was said that if no duty in tort existed when a Name became a member of Lloyd's, such a duty arose later towards plaintiffs who were Names on March 6 1981. That alleged duty was never clearly pleaded, but arose, so it was now said, when a Lloyd's committee member suggested amendments to and approved a letter dated March 6 1981, sent out by OVU to its Names. The letter commented on a Lloyd's press release and press reports of a Lloyd's investigation into aspects of OVU's business conduct. It was said that in September 1981 Lloyd's discovered facts from which it should have realised that the letter ought to be corrected. But Lloyd's never assumed responsibility for the letter. The plaintiffs had no right to rely on Lloyd's for the accuracy of its contents. The letter could not have created a duty in tort if no such duty existed beforehand. The second objection was that the points of law could not be decided in advance of oral evidence concerning 'admissions' alleged to have been made by Lloyd's committee members. The court's task in deciding whether statute had imposed a duty on Lloyd's towards each member could not be affected by subsequent remarks of a committee member. In the points of claim allegations against OVU were confused and difficult to follow. It was pleaded that by late September 1981 Lloyd's was or ought to have been well aware that OVU was thoroughly unfit to act as managing agent; that the facts required Lloyd's to act to protect the plaintiffs; and that Lloyd's, in breach of duty, wrongfully permitted OVU to continue underwriting and failed to inform the plaintiffs of the facts. It was not said that Lloyd's came under a duty to suspend OVU until late September 1981. It was unclear from the pleadings whether or when a duty to give information arose and was broken, but the loss and damage claimed to have been suffered included losses on contracts underwritten in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983. The parties and legal advisers in any litigation were under a duty to co-operate with the court by chronological, brief and consistent pleadings which defined the issues and left the judge to draw his own conclusions about the merits. It was counsel's duty to assist the judge by simplification and concentration. There had been a tendency in some cases for legal advisers, pressed by clients, to make every point conceivable and inconceivable without judgment or discrimination. Where a judge for reasons which were not plainly wrong made an interlocutory decision or made a decision in the course of a trial, it should be respected by the parties. If it was not respected it should be upheld by an appellate court unless the judge was plainly wrong. Mr Justice Gatehouse thought he would be assisted by early deliberation of issues of law. He deserved support. Control of the proceedings rested with the judge, not the plaintiffs. An expectation that the trial would proceed to a conclusion on the evidence to be adduced was not a legitimate expectation. The only legitimate expectation of any plaintiff was to receive justice. The appeal was allowed. LORD ROSKILL agreeing, said it was part of the trial judge's duty to identify crucial issues and see they were tried as expeditiously and inexpensively as possible. Litigants were not entitled to uncontrolled use of his time. Others awaited their turn. Litigants were only entitled to so much time as was necessary for proper determination of the relevant issue. Their Lordships agreed with both judgments. For Lloyd's: Peregrine Simon QC, Paul Walker and Matthew Reeve (NP Demery). For the Names: Michael Lyndon-Stanford QC, Paul Griffin and Nicholas Peacock (Michael Freeman &amp; Co).</p>

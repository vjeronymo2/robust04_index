			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Technology: Promise of calls to come Life would seem much easier sometimes if we had a way of proving previously made promises. Prices quoted on the telephone could be verified and hotel reservations double-checked. US and British telecoms companies are negotiating to purchase a new technology which provides such a service. A New York social worker, JoAnn Zucker, has obtained a patent for 'certified' telephone calls, faxes and electronic mail and will grant licences to telephone groups in August. The new technology is also being considered by the US federal court system for approval as a legal document. The certified messages would have a number of applications, says Alan Zucker, a former economics publisher who is promoting the product. US hospitals are interested in certified telephone calls to help them document communications. If a patient is not able to make a medical decision, for instance, the next of kin must be contacted. Currently, this means a witness listening to the conversation between the physician and the relative. Certified telephone calls would make the witness unnecessary. They could also be used to verify over-the-telephone orders and requests. Courts could serve a summons via fax. The sender calls, faxes, or E-mails a telephone company providing the service. If the sender does not want to talk to the recipient, the telephone company records the message, then sends it on, taking note of when the message was sent and received. The message can be programmed to be sent at two-hour intervals, until it has been heard. In the case of E-mail or fax, a photo of the message is preserved. If the sender wishes to talk to the recipient, the message is recorded simultaneously with its delivery. In 1993, 238m certified letters were handled by the US Postal Service, and the Zuckers believe the new product could replace much of this business.</p>

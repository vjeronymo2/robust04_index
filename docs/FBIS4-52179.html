			<p>BFN     [Text] Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas is reasonably  satisfied with the outcome of the talks he held in Geneva with  Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso on the future of East  Timor. In an exclusive interview with Rui Araujo, Ali Alatas  talks about progress but does not stop at criticizing Portugal  and particularly the adoption of the so-called confidence  building measures.    [Begin recording] [Rui Araujo] Are you happy with the  results  of the meeting?    [Alatas, in English with superimposed Portuguese  translation]  Reasonably happy because, we, again, made some progress in  identifying and agreeing on some confidence building measures.    [Rui Araujo] Some will argue that the talks, until now, have  achieved little if anything substantive.    [Alatas] No, it is true that we have not reached the  substantive part of the talks yet, as was earlier agreed upon  among the three sides [Portugal, UN and Indonesia]. We first  tried to create a better atmosphere, a propitious atmosphere,  before we go into the substance because we know that the two  positions, the two basic positions are very far apart. So we  have made progress with these confidence building measures. It  was slow, not as fast as I would have liked, but we are making  progress. You should see it from that point of view, rather  that from the point of view of substance that we have not  reached yet.    [Rui Araujo] Are you optimistic about that issue?    [Alatas] I would say I am reasonably satisfied with the pace  of the talks.    [Rui Araujo] You have accused Portugal of failing to act  quickly to establish confidence building measures. What kind of  measures were you expecting from Portugal?    [Alatas] Just as a few illustrations, perhaps: when we  started talking about confidence building measures at the  beginning, we could not agree at all on any one of them and, if  my recollection is correct, we agreed immediately at the first  meeting already on something like exclusion of journalists,  exclusion of personalities, etc. It took two meetings before  Portugal came around to accept it. There were other things that  were already proposed by the secretary- general from the very  beginning, such as interest sections. You have heard about this  proposal that we would not open diplomatic relations because  that may be too early perhaps for Portugal, but interest  sections, two officers, two diplomatic officers of Portugal in  the Netherlands and two Indonesian officers in the Thai embassy  or the Malaysian embassy in Portugal. They would quietly work  there, they would be a channel of communications.    In the case of the Portuguese diplomats, they can  occasionally go to East Timor, report on what they themselves  see rather than rely solely on the press. These are some of the  good confidence building measures.    [Araujo] Do you feel Portugal is changing now?    [Alatas] I see no indication yet on that. [end recording]</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (34): Catching up with information - Review of changes in control of the media ALL Poland's newspapers were once owned by RSW Prasa, one of Europe's largest publishing concerns. Their profits went to RSW's owner - the Communist Party. Newspapers, as well as radio and TV, were run by the Communist Party's press department and the system was as simple as one-party rule itself. Dismantling it has been a more complex business. Disposing of RSW's assets has been the responsibility of a seven-man liquidating committee set up by an Act of parliament last year. In its heyday the concern employed 85,000 people, owned 22,500 newspaper kiosks and 25 printing works and brought out 160 newspapers and journals. Breaking up this empire has been a controversial process with political, financial and even foreign policy considerations all being brought into play as editors and journalists, as well as hopeful owners and politicians, have fought for control of the papers. Mr Maciej Ilowiecki, the head of the SDP, a journalists' association, is highly critical of the way the sales have been conducted. He argues that the reasons for decisions have not been explained to the public. He is also concerned that Poles often knew too little about potential foreign buyers and their real intentions. New political parties such as the Christian Democrat Centre Agreement have schemed to win control of organs like the Express Wieczorny, the Warsaw working man's favoured evening reading. The politicians primarily wanted influence. But last year also showed that with the growth of revenues from advertising newspapers have become profitable. Mr Robert Hersant, the right-wing French publisher of Le Figaro, has emerged as the most significant foreign buyer. He has taken substantial shares in six newspapers, including Rzeczpospolita, once the government's own newspaper. He has also bought titles in key local centres such as Gdansk and Lodz and intends to bid for dailies in Katowice, the country's largest industrial area. expensive. The Dziennik Baltycki in Gdansk, which showed a profit last year of 4bn zlotys (USDollars 430,000), cost Mr Hersant 12bn zlotys. In this case the group has a 51 per cent share. The balance is owned by Solidarity's Gdansk region, a politically powerful if impecunious partner. Mr Hersant's right-wing views have stood him in good stead on his shopping spree in Poland's present political climate, and a measure of French influence has been seen as a good thing in the light of residual fears of Germany. Mr Robert Maxwell, the British publisher, has had less luck. He has suffered from his previous connections with high-ranking East European communists, whose biographies he published in his World Leaders series. He failed to buy a share in Zycie Warszawy, a leading Warsaw daily, which was sold recently for 40bn zlotys after an epic political battle. The successful bidder was Mr Kazimierz Woycicki, the present editor, who amassed an impressive array of letters of support from President Walesa downwards. Much of the finance came from STEI, a small media group from Sardinia. The RSW sale is now almost over and when it ends some 102 journals will have been sold and another 61 handed over to co-operatives formed by the journalists themselves. But as the dust settles another even more intense competition is about to start as franchises are awarded for private radio and TV broadcasts. Literally hundeds of applications have been sent to the ministry of communications, and more are expected before the June 10 closing date. The flow started ahead of draft legislation de-monopolising the broadcast media which is on its way through parliament. It will vest decisions on the granting of broadcast rights in a special committee - part appointed by parliament and part by the president. Foreign participation in any company wishing to broadcast in Poland is limited to 33 per cent. But private channels wanting to compete with state TV will need foreign financing. RTL of Luxembourg, as well as Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group of Italy, have demonstrated interest. 'Foreign visitors tend now to be showing an interest in tall buildings,' says Mr Andrzej Jonas, editor of the English language Warsaw Voice weekly. They are looking for places to put their broadcasting equipment. One domestic group bidding for a licence is Independent Polish TV (NTP), which groups Polish companies ranging from publishers to film studios and it estimates it will need Dollars 60m in its first year. While newspaper readership has held up surprisingly well, given rising costs and the collapse of the distribution network in the smaller towns and the countryside, it is TV and radio which is literally providing access to every household. A recent survey done by OBOP, state radio and TV's research centre, shows that 100 per cent of the population have access to a TV set, with 63 per cent watching in colour. Around 97 per cent have access to a radio. Meanwhile, 10 per cent of the population have access to satellite TV programmes (often thanks to small local cable networks) a figure which has grown from 1 per cent a year ago. Futhermore, 28 per cent of all households have access to video recorders, more than double last year's figure. Mr David Chase, a rich financier from the US, has embarked on an ambitious venture to install cable TV throughout the country. He plans to invest up to Dollars 1bn and once the project is under way is counting on an annual revenue of around Dollars 340m. In the information sphere at least Poland is catching up fast.</p>

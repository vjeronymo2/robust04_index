			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Two issues rekindle interest in asset-backed area which has experienced a dearth of deals in recent months - saw the launch of two new issues yesterday. Goldman Sachs launched a Pounds 116m deal for European Bank Investment Trust, which holds 20 per cent risk-weighted assets with Credit Suisse Financial Products providing the cash-flow from swaps. According to Goldman Sachs, investors have two lines of security - a guarantee from Financial Guaranty Insurance (FGIC), and a pool of assets which are senior fixed-rate sterling obligations from European banks with a credit rating of AA-/AA3 or better. The bank obligations will consist of bonds, letters of credit or loans and are procured in the market by a specialist boutique. The structure is expected to be bought by banks, according to the lead manager. One market participant commented that the payment - of three-month Libor plus 0.2 per cent 'seems a bit tight'. The day's other asset-backed deal came from Daiwa Europe which is launching Dollars 100m of secured extendable notes for Grace 1 International, a special purpose vehicle. These are secured by US commercial mortgages. The maturity can be lengthened from 2001 to 2002 at the bondholders' option. Elsewhere, Petrobras, the Brazilian oil group, launched its long-awaited floating rate deal yesterday, offering Dollars 300m of five-year notes. The notes are priced at 99.5 and have a coupon of six-month Libor plus 440 basis points. At the current level, that would mean a coupon of 7.775 per cent and a yield of 7.82 per cent, according to lead-manager Chase Investment Bank, although the coupon will not be set until June 4. Mr Jorge Jasson, managing director with Chase's international capital markets group, said Petrobras was keen to create a liquid benchmark in the five-year area. 'The deal has had a warm reception as the market welcomes floating-rate notes at a time when interest rate vulnerability is increasing,' he said, adding that only a handful of emerging market names have launched floating-rate deals. Petrobras already has one floating-rate note deal under its belt, having launched Dollars 140m of two-year notes maturing in August 1994. However, the borrower was keen to test investor appetite for a bigger, longer-dated issue. Chase said the deal was priced with an eye on both the existing FRN and other fixed rate issues in the market from similar borrowers. The existing notes are trading at around 100.75, giving a yield of 365 basis points over Libor, according to Chase, while other fixed rate bonds from Petrobras are trading at 450 to 475 basis points over US Treasury bonds.</p>

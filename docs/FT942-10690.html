			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Gonzalez turns to party outcasts: Troubled times bring deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra in from the cold The left wing of Spain's ruling Socialist party, headed by the astute deputy party leader Mr Alfonso Guerra, has come to the aid of the scandal-hit government after enduring months of ostracism in the wake of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's narrow electoral win for a fourth term a year ago. Mr Guerra personally signalled his support for the prime minister just as the credibility of Mr Gonzalez was dealt another blow yesterday when Judge Baltasar Garzon, the best known magistrate in the country, announced he was resigning his Socialist seat in parliament because Mr Gonzalez was not doing enough to curb corruption. Mixing both sorrow and anger in his resignation statement, Judge Garzon said he had been promised support and responsibilities to combat corruption but that neither had materialised. An independent who was personally co-opted by the prime minister to stand on the Socialist ticket in last June's election, Judge Garzon bitterly said he had been used 'as an electoral ploy'. The prime minister was, meanwhile, seeking a candidate for the key job of Socialist parliamentary leader to replace Mr Carlos Solchaga, a former finance minister and the most prominent of the party's free marketeers, who resigned from the job at the end of last week. Mr Solchaga had cleared left wingers from many positions of influence in the parliament last year but his successor now is likely to have to be a figure acceptable to Mr Guerra. The drive towards consensus, following the departure of Judge Garzon and of Mr Solchaga, both of whom were equally controversial in the eyes of the deputy prime minister's supporters in the party apparatus, effectively means the return to the political centre stage of the guerrista faction. The comeback of Mr Guerra's supporters emerged at the weekend in regional Socialist party congresses that were held in Madrid and in the Aragon. In contrast to similar congresses in recent months that marked a guerrista retreat, the left wing was able to negotiate a strong position at both conventions. The chief victim of the spate of scandals that have rocked Mr Gonzalez's government appears to be the renewal wing which backed the prime minister in the last general elections and which now has most to lose as the party faithful close ranks. In a tell-tale sign that the pendulum has swung back, Mr Jose Mara Benegas, a leading guerrista, has been entrusted with running the party's campaign in the European elections next month. Mr Benegas is at the centre of an illicit party funding scandal that is being investigated by a high court judge.</p>

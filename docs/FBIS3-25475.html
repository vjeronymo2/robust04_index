			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reports from the main Mogadishu port say a  disturbance took place at the port following an attempt by  UNOSOM and its surrogates to impose taxes on cargo goods. The  confrontation occurred yesterday between Mogadishu Somali  citizens and UNOSOM mercenaries based at the port.    A reporter from Radio Mogadishu Voice of the Great Somali  People, who witnessed the event, said the people were enraged by  this foreign provocation. He said the people barricaded all the  roads leading to the port with burning tires and carried  placards with slogans expressing their indignation and  opposition to the so-called taxes imposed on cargo goods at the  port. Asked by our reporter about the taxation, one of the  transport owners at the port said UNOSOM was not the country's  central government and therefore had no right to levy taxes at  Mogadishu Port, adding that they would prefer to die rather than  pay taxes to UNOSOM.    Our reporter also said he had met some Mogadishu Port  Corporation Officials, (MPOC), an agency appointed by UNOSOM to  supervise the port's operations and which is composed of whites  and pseudo- Somalis. The officials told our reporter that what  UNOSOM had imposed on the Mogadishu Port was not taxes but a  GATT tariff. They preferred the GATT tariff to tax, believing  that Somalis would not interpret this as tax.    Whatever you call it -- tax, taxation, tariff, GATT, duty,  levy and others -- basically they are all the same. The Somali  people will not allow the invading foreigners to impose any  types of taxes on them.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Other Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule contains a number of other amendments to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission's existing regulations in 46 CFR part 572. For the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part, these amendments are not substantive and are designed to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existing regulations consistent with the proposed rule, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate certain outdated regulations, or to reorganize certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subparts of the existing regulations. They include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In &sect;572.104, new definitions are added for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms as ``capacity management or capacity regulation agreements,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``monitoring report,'' ``rate'' and ``vessel-operating costs.'' In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the present definition of a joint service is revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate the reference to ``consortium,'' which is a term not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined by the 1984 Act and could include a number of commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationships besides joint services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In subpart C, the exemptions of certain kinds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements are revised to eliminate unnecessary references to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Information Form'' requirements. These changes have no effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exemptions themselves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Subpart D is revised to include existing subpart E, so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all regulations governing the content and organization of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filed agreements will be contained within one subpart. Also,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;572.401(a)(2) states that five copies of the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information Form must be filed along with a new agreement; this is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the minimum number of copies that will be needed by the Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to review and process an agreement. Subparagraph (h) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present &sect;572.402 is deleted as no longer necessary. Also,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule eliminates the requirements in current &sect;572.403(a)(2)&hyph;(3) that Information Forms must accompany  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant modifications'' to effective agreements; they will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer be necessary since the agreements addressed by those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations will in all likelihood be subject to ongoing reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Also, the standards presently set forth in &sect;572.404 for granting a waiver are revised to remove the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the applicant show that ``beneficial results'' will occur if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver is granted, and instead to require that the applicant show  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that granting the waiver will not impair effective regulation by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Commission, consistent with the language of section 16 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1715. Similar language is used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule's other waiver provisions in revised subparts E and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 572.608(b)(2), which sets forth an exception to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the confidentiality of submitted material, is revised to more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closely reflect the language of section 6(j) of the 1984 Act, 46  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. app. 1705(j). Similar language is used in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule's provision on confidentiality in revised subpart G.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Carrier Costs and Profits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's obligation under section 6(g) of the 1984 Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to police against agreements that may cause, or have caused,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unreasonable increases in transportation rates, and the 1984 Act's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of providing an efficient and economic transportation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system in the ocean commerce of the United States, 46 U.S.C. app.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1701(2), raise the question whether these policies can or should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursued by monitoring the costs and/or profitability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carriers to a particular agreement. The proposed rule does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include provisions on carrier costs or profitability, but the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission wishes to solicit comments on the lawfulness and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility of such provisions. Commenters should address whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such provisions would be inconsistent with Congress's directive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ``[t]he determination whether an agreement is likely to produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an `unreasonable increase in the price of transportation' does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize the FMC to engage in the type of ratemaking analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertaken by regulators of public utilities or as applied in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> domestic offshore trades.'' H.R. Rep. No. 600, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35 (1984). That aside, commenters should also address how such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions might be structured, particularly given the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule's focus on individual country sub-trades; whether costs and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> profitability under a particular agreement can be measured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurately, particularly if the carriers to the agreement have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other operations elsewhere; and whether arguments that an agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is necessary to control costs or to improve profits are better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explored in the context of an investigation of a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement, rather than made the subject of regulations applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to broad classes of agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

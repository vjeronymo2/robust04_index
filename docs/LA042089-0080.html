These include exposing the hair in a vulgar way, using lipstick and eyeshadow  in a provocative manner, wearing clothes that accentuate body curves and  wearing see-through stockings not covered by trousers.  </P> <P> Men were also warned that they should not wear "gaudy clothes which are at odds  with public decency."  </P></p>

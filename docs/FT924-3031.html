			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Prince Charles and Diana to separate but not divorce THE PRINCE and Princess of Wales are to separate, Buckingham Palace announced yesterday, but the government said the princess could still become Queen. Mr John Major told MPs the decision had no constitutional implications and there were 'no plans' for the couple to divorce. Prince Charles's succession as head of the Church of England, which frowns on divorce, was also unaffected. The prime minister said: 'There is no reason why the Princess of Wales should not be crowned Queen in due course.' The couple's 11-year marriage had been subject to intense speculation by newspapers, fuelled by the publication in June of a biography of the princess by Mr Andrew Morton. Buckingham Palace said the Queen was 'saddened' by the announcement and wanted an end to the press intrusions into the couple's lives. The Queen believes 'a degree of privacy and understanding is essential if their Royal Highnesses are to provide a happy and secure upbringing for their children, while continuing to give a wholehearted commitment to their public duties'. The prince and princess will continue to carry out public engagements - sometimes together, as at tomorrow night's state banquet in Edinburgh for European Community leaders. The princess will live in Kensington Palace. The prince will stay in Highgrove House, Gloucestershire, and, when in London, with his grandmother, the Queen Mother, at Clarence House. The announcement follows, in the Queen's words, an annus horribilis for the royal family - dominated by newspaper reports of marital rifts and the behaviour of its junior members - that has stimulated debate about the future of the House of Windsor. After a political row over the cost of the Windsor Castle fire, the Queen said she would pay income tax and reduce the number of publicly funded royals. The separation of Charles and Diana could have wider implications. If either wanted to divorce, the question of the succession would trigger constitutional uncertainty not seen since the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936. Downing Street last night refused to comment on 'hypothetical' scenarios. Mr Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, believes that the prince will renounce the throne in favour of his eldest son, William. The idea of a single-parent Queen separated from her husband was greeted with gasps by MPs. 'There is no possibility of this working,' said Mr Brooks-Baker.

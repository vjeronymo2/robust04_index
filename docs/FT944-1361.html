			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Vietnam attacks book pirates: Still loopholes in Hanoi's new copyright law, critics say Vietnam's recent copyright law brings protection up to international standards, but in 'photocopy city', where books can be reproduced for a few dollars, loopholes still exist, Reuter reports from Hanoi. National Assembly president Nong Duc Manh signed the ordinance protecting the copyright of the works of Vietnamese authors last week, according to newspaper reports. 'It's a good law in most ways,' said Ms Tanya Pullin, a specialist on intellectual property rights with White and Case, a New York law firm. 'It's an international-standard law that covers the things copyright should cover, such as books, music and computer software.' The ordinance would help Vietnam join the Berne Convention on copyright. But until it is admitted to the convention, a serious flaw in foreign eyes is the ordinance's stipulation that foreign authors must publish their works in Vietnam to qualify for copyright protection there. If they are published abroad, they must be published in Vietnam within 30 days to qualify. In practice, few foreign authors of books, or composers, will do so. But computer software companies may well want to protect their works in this growing market. 'It means we would have to release simultaneously in Vietnam and the US, in English,' said Ms Maureen Flanagan, country manager of the US company Unisys. Computer software piracy was 'standard procedure' in Vietnam and had been encouraged by the US trade embargo, which Washington rescinded in February. Because legal imports of US software had been banned before then, the Vietnamese 'got in the habit of importing and copying', she added. 'It's worse here than China or Thailand.' When Vietnam joins the Berne Convention, it will have to extend copyright laws applicable to its own nationals to foreign authors, too. 'But until they join the convention, the 30-day rule is a big loophole,' Ms Pullin said. Mr Cameron McCullough, of Sly and Weigall/Deacons, an Australia-based law firm, said the protection offered to computer software was the key element of the law. Vietnam is keen to develop an information technology (IT) industry as well as a publishing one. 'A copyright law is an essential element for protection of international property to develop sectors of the publishing industry. It is important for IT and absolutely critical for development of a software industry.' The law covers works including plays, broadcasts, videos, photographs, architecture, maps and books. How effective it will be against local piracy remains to be seen. There are lucrative businesses based on photocopying popular books and documents, and pirated popular compact discs imported from other Asian countries have appeared on street stalls in large numbers recently, selling for about Dollars 1 each.</p>

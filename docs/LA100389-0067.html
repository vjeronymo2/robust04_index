			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICES TO RULE ON MASS DRIVER SOBRIETY CHECKS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, acting Monday on nearly 1,000 appeals that had piled up over  the summer, announced that it will rule on whether motorists may be stopped by  the police at highway checkpoints to see if they are drunk.  </P> <P> Despite the growing use of sobriety checkpoints in many states, including  California, the high court never has ruled directly on the constitutionality of  routine police stops of presumably innocent motorists.  </P> <P> The Michigan courts in February called a halt to that state's sobriety  checkpoint program on grounds that the effort, although "laudable," violated  the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures. The state  attorney general appealed, arguing that such stops represent a reasonable  response to the carnage caused by drunk drivers.  </P> <P> The Michigan appeal was among 22 that the justices agreed to hear Monday. The  high court dismissed hundreds of appeals, leaving the lower court rulings  intact.  </P> <P> One of the day's most significant developments came in an off-hand announcement  that Justice John Paul Stevens, who has voted in the past to protect the right  to abortion from state regulation, would not participate in the pending  Illinois abortion case.  </P> <P> He did not explain his reasons, although in the past he has recused himself  from cases involving law firms with which he has a personal or family  connection. Stevens once practiced law in Chicago.  </P> <P> The move by Stevens was a sharp setback for pro-choice advocates. They had  hoped that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the swing vote on abortion, might be  persuaded to join Stevens and three other justices to produce a 5-4 ruling that  Illinois and the other states may not impose regulations on abortion clinics  that are costly and medically unnecessary.  </P> <P> The Illinois case is viewed by legal experts as the most significant of the  three pending abortion appeals.  </P> <P> The court ruled last July that states may ban abortion in public facilities,  and critics of the Illinois law say that it is designed to drive private  abortion clinics out of business. However, lawyers for Illinois say that the  law is merely intended to ensure quality medical care in abortion clinics.  </P> <P> Without Stevens, about the best the abortion-rights advocates probably can hope  for is a 4-4 split. That would uphold the Illinois appeals court ruling, which  threw out the Illinois law as unconstitutional. But it would have no impact  beyond the immediate Illinois law and would not establish a national precedent.  </P> <P> If O'Connor votes with the four other justices who voted last July to let  states ban abortion in public facilities, the ruling would reinstate the  Illinois law and leave other legislatures free to follow suit.  </P> <P> The case (Turnock vs. Ragsdale, 88-790) will be argued before the court on Dec.  5.  </P> <P> The Michigan case on sobriety checkpoints (Michigan vs. Sitz, 88-1897) will be  heard early next year. Just before the Christmas holidays last year, the  justices let stand a California Supreme Court ruling permitting sobriety  checkpoints. But, in that case, the court merely denied an appeal and did not  rule on the merits of the issue.  </P> <P> In the last decade, the high court has developed what many experts view as a  confusing two-track analysis of search and seizures cases. When a search is  criminal in nature, police must show some "reasonable suspicion" before  stopping and questioning an individual. However, if the search is labeled  "administrative," officials may search anyone.  </P> <P> The concept of "administrative" searches began with the inspections of  businesses for fire code violations and other non-criminal activities. Searches  at the U.S. border are considered "administrative," and cars and passengers may  be routinely inspected even though agents have no reason to suspect wrongdoing.  Likewise, airport searches of passengers and baggage are permitted.  </P> <P> However, as defense lawyers have pointed out, sobriety checkpoints on the  highway are closer to criminal searches.  </P> <P> Unlike most state courts, the Michigan Supreme Court analyzed the sobriety  checkpoints as a type of criminal search and seizure.  </P> <P> "While the goals of the sobriety checkpoint program are laudable," the state  court said, "the program fails to qualify as a reasonable seizure under the  Fourth Amendment."  </P> <P> In other actions, the court:  </P> <P>  -- Made clear that the U.S. Interior secretary, not state governors, has the  final word on selecting sites for offshore oil exploration. The court let stand  a ruling (Cowper vs. U.S., 88-2000) from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals  upholding the authority of federal officials to lease sites off the Alaska  coast. The law allows governors to make "recommendations" but leaves the  decision to the federal government, the court said.  </P> <P> California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, joined by seven others, said that the  ruling leaves the states "virtually powerless" to block offshore drilling near  their coastlines. The court rejected the appeal without dissent.  </P> <P>  -- Let stand a $278,600 libel verdict against a Pawtucket, R. I., newspaper  for a news story that contained no false statements (New England Newspapers vs.  Healey, 88-1939). Rather, the Rhode Island Supreme Court said that the libel  award was justified for "what was left unprinted."  </P> <P> In reporting the sudden heart attack death of a local political activist  outside a public meeting, the newspaper noted that the chairman of the meeting  had been Dr. Paul Healey, a physician. This left the "defamatory implication"  that the doctor should have come to the aid of the stricken man, the court  said.  </P> <P>  -- Agreed to decide whether a government agency may take into account an  employee's political affiliation in making promotions and transfers.  </P> <P> In 1980, the court dealt a blow to political patronage by ruling that public  employees may not be fired solely for political reasons.  </P> <P> UNSAFE WORK SITES -- The Supreme Court clears the way for states to criminally  charge employers for exposing workers to dangerous chemicals.

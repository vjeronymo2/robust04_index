			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN GETS 11 YEARS FOR ROLE IN MURDER  </P> <P> An 18-year-old Van Nuys woman was sentenced Friday to state prison for at least  11 years for her role in the murder of a Pacoima man who was gunned down as he  sat in a car with his fiancee.  </P> <P> Karen Argott, who police say is a gang member, was convicted by a Superior  Court jury of second-degree murder and attempted murder.  </P> <P> Police said she drove the car Jan. 17 while her boyfriend, Walter Oswaldo  Barillas, 22, fired at least 11 shots into the victim's car.  </P> <P> Barillas remains at large, Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels said.  </P> <P> Killed in the gunfire was Odilon Gonzalez, 33. But police said the bullets  missed Gonzalez's fiancee, Irma Ortega, 21, who apparently was saved because  Gonzalez pushed her to the floor just before he was killed.  </P> <P> Samuels said Argott will remain in prison at least 11 years under the sentence  of 16 years to life imposed by Judge Darlene E. Schempp.  </P></p>

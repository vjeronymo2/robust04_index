			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Lighter mood THERE WAS a lighter mood in both the sterling futures and cash markets yesterday morning as the pound managed to stay above DM2.8200 on the foreign exchanges. In the afternoon, however, the atmosphere darkened as the currency slid back, and traders grew anxious about German and British indicators due out later in the week. In the morning, the markets were still being lifted by Friday's bullish news out of Germany, especially the wholesale prices figure for July, down 1.3 per cent from the previous month. Short dates in the sterling cash market also softened after traders removed most of the Pounds 1.2bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England in early operations. The softer tone to period rates in cash lasted throughout the day. One-month money closed  1/8 easier on the offered side at 9 15/16 per cent, and the three-month ended at 10 7/32 per cent offered, down from 10 1/4 per cent. But the underlying pessimism about a rate cut maintained the yield curve: both six-month money and the one-year finished at 10 3/8 per cent on the offered side. Futures dipped in the afternoon as the pound lost its early gains on the currency market. After opening at 89.72, the September short sterling contract fell to a low of 89.67 and closed 3 basis points down on the day. The December contract ended 4 basis points off at 89.75. Several factors subdued futures dealers. Mr Lothar Mueller, a Bundesbank board member, said at the weekend that the central bank would quickly raise the Lombard rate if last month's discount rate increase was seen to have no effect. Dealers are also concerned about the figure for M3 money supply in Germany, the guide to Bundesbank monetary policy, which is due out this week. Whatever their long-term views on rates, few expect a rate change in Britain or Germany between now and the French referendum on Maastricht, and dealers were therefore selling bills to the Bank of England rather than running portfolios. In the early round, the Bank purchased Pounds 210m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 800m in a repurchase agreement (repo) at 9 15/16 per cent. The shortage was later revised to Pounds 1.1bn and the Bank did not operate in the afternoon.</p>

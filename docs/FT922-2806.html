			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Companies House wins funding privilege THE TREASURY is to allow Companies House, part of the Department of Trade and Industry, to fund its penalties division from the money it raises in fines, in an unusual move beyond the normal rules of government budgeting. Officials last week concluded a temporary arrangement which will allow Companies House, based in Cardiff, to retain about Pounds 750,000 collected during the current financial year from penalties of Pounds 20m that it expects to receive from 150,000 companies. This will be used to cover the costs of its new late-filing penalties programme. The new programme begins on July 1 and will levy automatic fines of up to Pounds 5,000 on any company filing accounts late. About 20 staff will work on the operation and a Pounds 300,000 advertising campaign will be launched to urge prompt filing. Companies House is an executive agency under the government's Next Steps programme, and also has 'trading fund' status which allows it to retain some of the revenues it generates. Several other agencies - including Her Majesty's Stationery Office, the Royal Mint and the Central Office of Information - have similar arrangements which allow them to retain a proportion of their income. But the Companies House agreement is believed to be the first large-scale example of an agency which will be able to self-finance some of its operations with fines - a source of income which is designed to reduce over time. Normally government agencies must return any income they earn to the Treasury, a process which has been criticised by the National Audit Office because it fails to provide any incentive to improve productivity. Mr David Durham, chief executive of Companies House, said he hoped that within three years most companies would be filing on time and the sums collected in fines would fall almost to zero. The Central Statistical Office is to market economic data in pamphlets for businesses as part of a project to increase eightfold its earnings from the private sector over the next five years, Peter Marsh writes. The scheme was devised by Mr Bill McLennan, the CSO director. He wants to make more of the CSO's output relevant to business as well as its main customers in the Treasury. He said the target of increasing the CSO's private-sector earnings from about Pounds 500,000 last year to Pounds 4m in 1997 was 'achievable'. That would take the proportion of the budget gained from data sales to non-government users from less than 2 per cent to about 10 per cent.</p>

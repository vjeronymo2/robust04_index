			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All names and titles as received] </F>   [Text] Buenos Aires, 25 Apr (NA) -- Senators from the  Justicialist [PJ] and Radical Civic Union Parties [UCR] were of  one mind in pointing out to U.S. Government officials today that  Argentina might only join NAFTA through Mercosur [Common Market  of the South] or with the consent of its member countries.    The senators, moreover, asserted that the upper chamber will  pass a new law on patents for pharmaceutical products, although  they anticipated that it will not totally match up to U.S.  demands.    These remarks by PJ and UCR senators were made during a  meeting with John Heuneman, deputy assistant secretary for the  Western Hemisphere at the U.S. Commerce Department; Sean Murphy,  director of Southern Cone affairs at the U.S. State Department;  and Peter Whitney, commercial attache at the U.S. Embassy in  Buenos Aires, in the Senate's Gray Hall this afternoon.    PJ Senators Augusto Alasino, Mario Fadel, and Ricardo  Branda;  UCR Senators Jose Genoud, Ricardo Lafferriere, Jorge Cendoya,  and Conrado Storani; and Corrientes Autonomist Party Senator  Antonio Romero Feris also were at the meeting.    Among the U.S. delegation members, Heuneman did most of the  talking; he stressed that it would be most advisable for  Argentina to pass a new patents bill, even though he neither  mentioned deadlines nor made it a condition for Argentina to be  able to join NAFTA.    Heuneman stated the acknowledgement of inventors' rights  will  foster research development in our country. He added that  international experience shows that patented medicines are not  more expensive, as Argentine laboratories contend.    Sen. Genoud, chairman of the Industry Committee, said his  party will not approve a new patents law until Congress ratifies  the recent GATT agreement establishing the World Trade  Organization.    Genoud pointed out to the Americans that the chapter on  patents in the GATT agreement "establishes more flexible  guidelines" than U.S. requirements in this area. He added that  it would be a contradiction for Washington to have signed the  Marrakech pact and yet claim conditions that go beyond what was  established under that international agreement.    Genoud explained that the Patents Bill is currently under  discussion in Congress and that public hearings are being  conducted to learn the parties' stance on this matter. He noted  that this round of hearings will end on 19 or 26 May with a  deposition by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo.    Alasino told the U.S. Government officials the Senate will  pass a new patents law, although he made it clear that the upper  chamber is analyzing the way of maintaining a balanced market  and is trying to establish a deadline for the implementation of  the patents law that will enable domestic laboratories to  accommodate the new regulations.    With regard to this, he conceded that the Senate is talking  about a 10-year deadline to acknowledge intellectual property  rights either by the payment of royalties [preceding word in  English] or by the granting of a monopoly to the medicines'  inventors.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government 'firm' on EC hours limit THE UK government might accept a compromise on the European Community working time directive but is not prepared to agree to the controversial 48-hour limit on the working week, even if it is delayed for 10 years. A meeting of senior cabinet ministers yesterday finalised Britain's 'bottom line' on the directive, which will almost certainly be voted on at the meeting of EC ministers responsible for employment legislation in Luxembourg tomorrow. Britain is insisting that there should be full flexibility on designating Sunday as an official day of rest; that negotiations on directives between employers and employees can take place at local and not just national level; and that employees should be free to work more than 48 hours a week if it does not put their health at risk. The first two points are unlikely to cause difficulty, but several countries would prefer to keep the 48-hour limit, even if it is delayed for 10 years as proposed by the Portuguese. If Britain cannot win an indefinite postponement of the 48-hour limit it will probably launch a legal challenge against the directive. Although Britain alone cannot vote down the directive, ministers believe that other EC countries are less likely to impose the directive on the UK after the Danish referendum result. One senior minister said after yesterday's talks that the government had agreed a position that combined 'firmness with reason'. It was anxious to avoid an open breach with its EC partners on the eve of the Lisbon summit, but there were limits beyond which its supporters in the Commons would not accept compromise. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, today meets her opposite number in Paris, Mrs Martine Aubry, for what might be a crucial last-minute negotiation on the directive. The French have been among the most enthusiastic supporters of the directive, including the 48-hour limit, but Mrs Aubry has a reputation for pragmatism.</p>

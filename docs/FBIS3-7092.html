The 1993/94 budget  indicated a huge deficit of 1.8 trillion rupiah. The huge  budget deficit will raise questions from numerous sectors, such  as, will such a deficit reoccur during the 1994/95 fiscal year?    In a statement during a plenary session of the House of  Representatives (DPR) on Monday, 7 March, Finance Minister  Mar'ie Muhammad stated that more funds will be allocated and  changes will be made to the 1993/94 budget to keep to a balanced  budget of 62.65 trillion rupiah. It is clear that such changes  are needed so income estimates will be at 62.65 trillion rupiah  while estimates for expenditures will stand at 64.64 trillion  rupiah.    According to the finance minister, the government will  utilize a balance of payments and proposed reserves for  development totalling to 1.8 trillion rupiah from previous  fiscal years in the effort to realize several development  programs during the 1993/94 fiscal year and as a measure to  cover the deficit.    Our economic planners need to be more watchful if we take  into account the amount derived from 1993/94 domestic income,  which stands at only 52.279 trillion rupiah or 0.9 percent lower  than estimated. This indicates that lower income derived from  the petroleum sector has not been balanced yet by increased  nongas exports.    Income from the petroleum sector was expected to bring in  only about 12.507 trillion rupiah or a decline of 17.3 percent  from the estimated target. The average price of Indonesian oil  will only stand at U.S.$16.50 per barrel or U.S.$1.50 per barrel  lower than the projected U.S.$18 per barrel for the 1994/95  fiscal budget.    Therefore, the major cause for the 1993/94 fiscal year  deficit is due to the lower income derived from the petroleum  sector. Unquestionably, the lower income derived from the  petroleum sector was solely due to declining oil prices in the  international market.    Global oil prices continue to slide since last year and in  February 1994, the price of oil remained static at U.S.$14 per  barrel. This worrisome condition of our national income from  the petroleum sector should be expeditiously anticipated.    Lately, the price of petroleum in the international market  further intensifies our concern because current oil prices have  descended to slightly more than U.S.$13 per barrel. The price  of Brent Blend [preceding term in English] -- a global demand --  stood merely at U.S.$13.05 per barrel on Monday, 7 March.    The perpetual decline in oil prices will certainly influence  our national income for the 1994/95 fiscal year because we  projected oil prices to stand at U.S.$16 per barrel. National  income will be lowered by a net 600 billion rupiah if the price  of oil were to decline by a mere U.S. dollar per barrel.    In the effort to avoid another budget deficit as a result of  the perpetual decline in oil prices, the government has made a  provision of 3.5 trillion rupiah to be taken out from the  proposed development reserves. Several sectors will surely ask  if it was indisputable that another budget deficit can be  avoided through the utilization of proposed deveopment reserves.    The country's economic planners have frequently stated that  the proposed reserves for development will not be used as long  as it can be avoided. This means that the proposed reserves for  development can only be used when there is a problem with  national income, which in turn, causes a national economic  crisis.    The utilization of proposed development reserves indicates  an  "instability' in the national economic situation. As such, an  alternative source has to be found. Several other alternatives  exist and the one with the most potential is to effortlessly  intensify nongas export activities.    As a result of the increasing stiff and endless competition  to gain access to the international market, we must first  totally eliminate all high-cost economic activities in the  country in our effort further increase and intensify our nongas  exports. Indonesian products will never be competitive if such a  measure is not taken.</p>

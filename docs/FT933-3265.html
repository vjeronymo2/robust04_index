			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Mitsubishi Motors and Mitsubishi Corporation to set up joint venture in Vietnam MITSUBISHI Motors and Mitsubishi Corporation, the trading house which is part of the same industrial group, are setting up a joint venture in Vietnam to manufacture vehicles, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. The Japanese companies have agreed to link up with Vietranscimex, a Vietnamese national shipping and trading company, and Proton, the Malaysian national car company, to assemble and sell vehicles in Vietnam. The four companies, which will each hold a 25 per cent stake in the new company, plan to begin assembling minibuses from mid-1994, on receiving Hanoi's approval. The minibus will be modelled on Mitsubishi Motors' Delica. Mitsubishi will be the second Japanese car company to invest in making cars in Vietnam. Vietnam Motors, which is 70 per cent owned by foreign shareholders including Nissan Diesel and Nichimen, the Japanese trading house, already makes trucks and cars. Car ownership in Vietnam was an estimated 210,000 in 1991, Mitsubishi says. But the companies expectthe market could expand to 300,000 vehicles by 1995 and 430,000 by the year 2000.</p>

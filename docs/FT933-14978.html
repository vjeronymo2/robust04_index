			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Maxwell funds seek Pounds 56m from Goldman Sachs: Pension schemes ask for detailed talks GOLDMAN SACHS, the US-based investment bank, has been asked to pay up to Pounds 56m to two pension schemes formerly controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. This is the first time that Goldman Sachs, which dealt extensively for the Robert Maxwell family and their companies, has been approached for payment in connection with the pension schemes. Goldman is not believed so far to have rebuffed the requests. The requests, made in the past few weeks by two former Maxwell pension schemes, relate to a series of transactions in 1990 in which Goldman Sachs acted as purchaser for shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation from the Mirror Group Pension Scheme and the Maxwell Communication Corporation Staff Scheme. It is not clear on whose behalf Goldman Sachs was acting, but the shares were later repurchased from the firm by two Liechtenstein-based trusts controlled by Maxwell family interests. The requests have been made in letters to Goldman Sachs from the pension schemes, which are now seeking detailed discussions. The Mirror Group Pension Scheme last year filed a writ against five UK and international banks seeking about Pounds 87m for assets which it claims were wrongly taken from the scheme. The first of these cases is set to come to court next January. It is believed that Sir John Cuckney, chairman of the government-appointed charitable trust which raises money for the Maxwell pensioners, is seeking round-table talks with all banks against which the pension schemes are likely to pursue claims. For any party to admit it is in talks would suggest it erred in carrying out the relevant transactions. It is expected that if Goldman Sachs agreed to hand over all or part of the money it would seek a privacy agreement barring disclosure of details of the deal. Sir John is understood to believe the best course of action would be for firms wishing to make payments to be able to make them anonymously to his trust, which could later announce the total sum raised. Sir John believes anonymity is essential if pension fund assets are to be secured without resorting to the courts. According to testimony last autumn before the parliamentary select committee on social security, Goldman bought the shares from the two pension schemes but made payment to a third party, Bishopsgate Investment Trust (BIT), a private entity which acted for the Maxwell family interests. Goldman Sachs has said it paid the funds to BIT on the instructions of Mr Maxwell's son, Mr Kevin Maxwell, who was a trustee of both pension schemes at the time. It is believed that the requests for the return of the assets depend on two questions raised by both schemes: first, whether Goldman Sachs could be branded a 'constructive trustee' with a specific duty to safeguard scheme assets, and second, whether it obtained formal authorisation from the full trustee boards of both schemes to act on instructions of individual trustees for certain kinds of activities. Neither Goldman Sachs nor trustees to the two schemes would comment on whether they had discussed the assets, but it is believed that talks are in preliminary stages. To date the Cuckney trust has raised only Pounds 6m from some City firms which had business dealings with Mr Maxwell. Auditors have found a total of Pounds 440m missing from pension schemes controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell. In June Goldman Sachs was fined Pounds 160,000 by the Securities and Futures Authority for breaches of UK securities rules in connection with the Maxwell affair.</p>

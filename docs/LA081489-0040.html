			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 KIDNAPERS IN BRAZIL ESCAPE IN PLANE AFTER 3-DAY STANDOFF  </P> <P> Four heavily armed fugitives in south-central Brazil on Sunday released their  three hostages, including two television reporters, and made a getaway in a  plane provided by authorities, police said.  </P> <P> According to authorities, the four traded their captives for an aircraft and  pilot to end a three-day standoff with police on a highway near the town of  Presidente Prudente, 635 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro. They were armed  with hand grenades, submachine guns, pistols and shotguns.  </P> <P> Police said the hostages were unharmed.  </P> <P> "I lived for four days with a pistol at my head, but not for one minute did I  believe I would die," said Monica Calassa, one of the hostages. "A person who  trades her life for that of another can't die like that."  </P> <P> It was not clear where the plane was headed. The fugitives -- two married  couples -- earlier said they wanted to be flown to Paraguay.  </P> <P> Brazilian media identified the fugitives' leader as Rui Ribeiro de Campos and  said he owns a farm in Paraguay.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, three local journalists offered to take the place of a 9-year-old  boy the fugitives had kidnaped Aug. 3. The fugitives were also paid a $25,000  ransom and given an armored car and a driver. The kidnapers later released one  of the reporters.  </P> <P> However, Goias state authorities on Wednesday failed to provide a plane for  their escape, and the kidnapers began leading police on a 500-mile chase  through three states.  </P></p>

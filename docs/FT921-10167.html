			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Texaco to resume Kuwait output Texaco is hoping to resume oil output in Kuwait's Wafra field later this month, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The company is aiming to produce around 50,000 barrels a day from Wafra, a level that would be well below the 140,000 bpd before the Iraqi invasion. Oil output from Wafra is shared equally by Texaco and the state-owned Kuwait Oil Company. The onshore field lies in a zone along the border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Before the Gulf war Texaco refined its output from Wafra at the Mina Saudi refinery. The US company will now be exporting crude directly from Wafra and analysts suggest that it may seek to sell the high-sulphur oil to Japan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa  Amendment Bill and the Electoral Amendment Bill have both been  approved by Parliament.    The Constitutional Bill was approved by 115 votes to 33,  while the Electoral Bill was approved by 170 votes to 28.  Dissenting parties to the Constitutional Bill in the House of  Assembly were the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], the Conservative  Party [CP] and Independent MP's aligned to the Afrikaner  Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front -- AVF]. The CP reiterated  its rejection of the amendments saying they had been inspired by  communists. CP leader, Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg, said that the  constitution provided for a unitary state and that none of the  amendments changed this.    The National Party [NP] and the Democratic Party [DP]  supported the bill saying the Freedom Alliance had received  everything it had asked for. The amendments, among other  things, grant further regional powers, introduced the principle  of a volkstaat [homeland], and permit a double ballot. The five  IFP members in the house joined the NP, DP, and ANC [African  National Congress] in voting for the Electoral Bill. It was  opposed by members of the CP caucus and independent MP's aligned  to the AVF.    Parliament also approved a resolution empowering the state  president to extend the operation of the 1990 Indemnity Act for  a further year until 17 May 1995.</p>

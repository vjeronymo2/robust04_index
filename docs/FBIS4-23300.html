			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ble Guirao, deputy secretary general of the </F> Federation of University and High School Students of Cote  d'Ivoire, by correspondent Cendres Glazai; place and date not  given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Glazai] In which conditions  were you detained?    [Guirao] We spent very very harsh moments in detention. Our  comrades who were detained at the police academy turned out to  be "guinea-pigs" for the police trainees who flogged them all  the time. Some of them were even admitted in hospital, thus  prompting the trainees to stop torturing them. I was personally  subjected to special treatment for allegedly writing a letter to  General Ouassenan Kone about the genocide of the Guebies. I was  tortured day and night so that I would no longer feel like being  an activist of the Federation of University and High School  Students of Cote d'Ivoire [FESCI]. We all fell so sick that the  government was forced to buy up to 115,850 CFA francs worth of  drugs to treat us.    [Glazai] Yet, you said in a statement on television that you  were well treated.    [Guirao] Everyone knows that we performed a play in several  acts, in which each of us had a carefully defined role.  Minister Kone was the director and we were the forced actors.  All this was to make us dismiss -- under Minister Kone's  supervision -- the "allegations" made by LA VOIE about our  detention conditions and to give an account that would be  favorable to the government. We were also forced to apologize  to our parents and to ask for the government's forgiveness.  Minister Kone ordered me to read and sign the statement. He  said he would reconsider the decision to release us if I dropped  even one comma while reading the statement, so that is why I had  my eyes riveted on the sheet of paper while reading. It was a  true play in which I denied being a FESCI member whereas I  remain the movement's second in command.    I conclude by saying that we were not well treated, the  proof  being that we were drugged. The government must stop those old  methods which consist in forcing people to make statements.    [Glazai] Now that you are free, how do you feel?    [Guirao] I feel scared and disgusted. I think of the  democrats who are targeted through our movement. It is time for  the forces of change to wake up; our country is in danger. What  we could see and hear at the police academy proves our thinking  right and disturbs us. For example, Minister Kone said he is  ready to repress and crush all those who break law and order  which, according to him, means all those who make demands, stage  marches, and so on... He intends to do this fully in the name of  peace.    I would like to shout and say that my heart aches for Cote  d'Ivoire. This is a country in which so-called legalists have  come to power through the law but who persist in violating this  same law. They violate the citizens' liberties with impunity.  The people should not remain silent in the face of the regime's  acts of aggression because democracy is actually at stake in our  country. Ouassenan Kone has even stated that he is ready to  stage a coup d'etat if the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire  loses power through the ballot box in 1995. [passage omitted]</p>

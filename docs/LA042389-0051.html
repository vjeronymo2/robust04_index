			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICTURES AND WORDS, EUROPEAN STYLE  </P> <P> Re Charles Solomon's "The Comic Book Grows Up," April 16:  </P> <P> Solomon writes that "graphic novels have been popular for decades . . . in  Europe" (which is true), then adds: "In Paris, the rage for these florid  fantasies has led book dealers in the swankiest arrondissements . . . to devote  large sections to them.  </P> <P> This is simply wrong. It evokes the superficial, shallow judgment of the Ugly  American Abroad ("Look, Hon, they have McDonald's on the Champs-Elysees!")  </P> <P> I am a Frenchman, and I did not grow up in a "swanky" arrondissement but in a  series of unremarkable provincial towns. Yet I've always seen "graphic novels"  in all bookstores, college or otherwise. They are not, as Mr. Solomon implies,  the result of a "rage" limited to rich college kids or yuppies.  </P> <P> Indeed, the first graphic novels published were the "Tintin" books in the  1930s, which gained immediate acceptance for the genre. At first, graphic  novels were considered to be primarily for children, but in the '60s people  began to realize that adults were reading them too. (Gen. De Gaulle once  jokingly complained that Tintin was more famous than he!)  </P> <P> Mr. Solomon is also wrong when he describes our graphic novels as "florid  fantasies." If I were to refer to your own "Peanuts" as a "torrid soap opera"  or "Calvin &amp; Hobbes" as "thrilling exotic adventure," you'll have an idea  of how accurate Mr. Solomon's opinion rings to me.  </P> <P> JEAN-MARC LOFFICIER  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

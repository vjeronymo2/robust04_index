			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition  Democratic Party [DP] Friday urged the government to tread  carefully in taking punitive action against North Korea due to  the standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear program, warning that  sanctions could lead to war on the Korean peninsula.    "The recent situation is heading towards a critical phase in  which the (whole) nation could collapse concurrently," concluded  a meeting of DP lawmakers affiliated with the National Assembly  Foreign Affairs and National Unification and National Defense  Committees.    During the meeting presided over by party Chairman Yi  Ki-taek, it was decided to hold an emergency meeting of DP  lawmakers Friday to announce the party's official position on  the North Korean nuclear issue and call on the ruling Democratic  Liberal Party to convene relevant National Assembly committees  to deal with the issue.    The DP lawmakers also decided to demand that the North  immediately stop playing the "foolhardy" nuclear card to head  off any possibility of a crisis developing on the Korean  peninsula.    The opposition lawmakers agreed that if the need arises,  sanctions must be imposed on the North by the United Nations  Security Council through resolutions based on a global consensus  rather than through an initiative by South Korea, the United  States and Japan alone.    They also pointed out that armed conflict could erupt on the  Korean peninsula if economic sanctions were imposed, considering  that a sea blockade would be necessary for effective  implementation.</p>

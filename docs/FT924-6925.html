			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Schlesinger gives warning on rules for moving to single currency THE conditions governing the European Community's planned shift to a common currency are already weak and unclear and there is a danger they could be further diluted, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the German Bundesbank, warned yesterday. Spelling out the central bank's reservations to members of the European parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Schlesinger virtually denounced as inadequate the criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty. While striving to avoid attracting charges of political interference, couching his comments in the context of statements from Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other politicians, he noted: 'The German population and parliament should agree to give up the D-Mark only if there is to be no lazy compromise in the selection of countries for monetary union.' 'The convergence criteria are not very clear and also not especially strict,' he said. Permissible limits for national deficits were 'as a rule too high'. Mr Schlesinger said conditions governing price rises had to be rigorously interpreted and stood as a 'true test' of member states' commitment to stability: if monetary union were to go ahead now, countries with inflation rates of 4.5 per cent could be accepted. The Frankfurt central bank, which regards a 2 per cent annual rate as merely tolerable for Germany, has in the past said it would prefer a fixed inflation rate to the Maastricht formulation. This defines countries with inflation rates up to 1.5 percentage points above the average of the three lowest rates in the Community as acceptable participants in monetary union. The treaty conditions on budgetary discipline appeared to be exacting, but the permitted upper limit for government deficits - 3 per cent of gross domestic product - was 'as a rule too high', Mr Schlesinger claimed. This criterion was also 'particularly open to interpretation'. Even if member states succeeded in consolidating their budgets in the coming years, there were likely to be some which would be unable to meet the deficit criteria. Mr Schlesinger said later he did not consider there was any need for reform of the ERM to allow greater central bank intervention.</p>

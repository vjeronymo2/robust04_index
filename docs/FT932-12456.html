			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Bryant to raise Pounds 18m for land purchases BRYANT GROUP yesterday became the latest housebuilder to raise funds to buy land in what increasingly looks like the beginning of a housing market recovery. It is raising about Pounds 18m from a placing of 13m shares at 137 1/2 p. After the announcement the shares fell 2p to 142p. The placing is through SG Warburg Securities. Mr Colin Hope, chairman, said: 'The revival in new house purchasers' confidence since the beginning of this year is extremely encouraging. Our net reservations since December 1 are more than 30 per cent ahead of the comparable period a year ago.' The group, in addition to purchasing land in its existing areas, has formed a subsidiary in Edinburgh and is in the process of establishing itself in north-east England.</p>

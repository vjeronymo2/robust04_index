			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All Names rendered in Kurdish] </F>   [Text] Garzan/KURDISH NEWS AGENCY--The Workers Party of  Kurdistan [PKK] and the Kurdish People's Liberation Army Command  Headquarters in Garzan and Amed Provinces have revealed the  number of villages burned down and the number of villagers  killed by the state forces in their recent operations in  southeast Turkey. The two command headquarters distributed  leaflets to the newspapers and the people to inform them that 74  villages and 10 farming settlements were razed, nine villages  partly destroyed, and 36 villagers and all the men in 10 farming  settlements have been missing for some time. The leaflets also  expressed condolences over the dead villagers.    Asserting that the Turkish state's move that began 10 years  ago to force the Kurdish people to emigrate and become a  community without a homeland has peaked, the two command  headquarters argued that the security forces, which are involved  in the spring operation against the PKK, have tried to force the  Kurdish people to agree to register as village guards, burned  down several houses in various villages, and compelled the  people to emigrate. The leaflets said: "The wide-ranging  operations launched at the end of April and maintained without  interruption have clearly indicated the objectives of the  security forces. The Kurdish people are faced with the threat  of being forced to emigrate from Turkey, as was the case from  1925 to 1940. The state forces have burned down villages to  force the people to emigrate and to stop them from going back.  They do not fail to shoot and kill people from the villages  after accusing them of being terrorists."    The leaflets stressed that the Turkish State regards the  Kurds as a potential threat and a rebel community, and noted  that it has moved to burn and destroy the entire region step by  step in order to prevent them from organizing resistance against  the security forces. They begin with the areas where the people  rebelled against the government in the past -- that is, areas  such as Palu and Dersim. The leaflets also noted that all rural  areas have been declared out of bounds and the military troops  have been ordered to shoot and kill anyone they suspect. They  said: "The tactic in the recent operations is as follows: The  Turkish state deploys large military units with heavy arms to  evict the people from particular areas. Those areas are then  pounded with bombs. The security forces predetermine the people  who must die in the areas. They shoot and kill them during the  operations, and evict the survivors from their villages. The  evicted people are not allowed to go back to their property,  which is set on fire and destroyed. The Turkish state no longer  bothers to accuse the villagers it evicts from their homes of  `aiding and abetting the guerrillas,' as it did in the past.  Every Kurd who refuses to be an agent for the Turkish state; to  serve as a member of the village guard units, which are merely  armed bands; or to commit treachery against his community is  regarded as a `terrorist,' selected as a target, and shot and  killed -- regardless that they are unarmed and innocent  villagers. Such acts of violence are occurring before the eyes  of the world in Kurdistan in general and in Amed and Garzan  Provinces in particular."    The leaflets said that 74 villages and 10 farming  settlements  were burned down, nine villages partly destroyed, and 36  villagers and all of the men in 10 farming settlements reported  missing in the recent operations. They urged the local and  international media organs to send their representatives in  order to verify the situation on the spot.</p>

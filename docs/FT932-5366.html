			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Access talks are key to Uruguay Round hopes - A four-way open market package is seen as 'within striking distance' NOT for the first time in the past four years, hopes have leapt in recent days that agreement is within reach in the long-stalled Uruguay Round of talks on global trade reform. Negotiators who have been to the brink before, and failed, are inevitably cautious. There is more talk on the obstacles that still have to be overcome than on the headway that has been made in recent months. But as ministers from the industrialised countries were being told in Paris this week how grave the world's economic problems were, a consensus has appeared that reforms under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have 'crucial relevence' if early recovery is to be achieved. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, caught the mood of negotiators in Paris when he noted: 'We are at last within striking distance of the largest market access package in history.' Sir Leon Brittan, his European Community counterpart agreed that it is 'realistic to aim for the outline of an ambitious market access package' by the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo in early July. The aim is to bind the G7 countries into a package of tariff cuts in manufactures and services trade, and use this as the springboard for wider multilateral agreement. The target is for a Uruguay agreement by December 15 this year. Underpinning a quiet, cautious optimism that a deal is within reach is a sequence of negotiations initiated in January this year by Sir Leon. They began on New Year's day in secret talks with Mrs Carla Hills, then the US trade representative. Rather than wrestle with all Uruguay Round issues simultaneously, the two opted to push for a bilateral market access deal that would involve deep tariff cuts in a range of manufactures and services. Sir Leon managed to maintain momentum in spite of the inevitable hiatus following the change in the US administration. In Toronto a month ago, talks were broadened to the 'quad' group of the US, the EC, Japan and Canada. Officials remain secretive about the details of the market access package. It embraces pharmaceuticals, chemicals, steel, construction equipment, medical equipment, spirits, beer, textiles, ceramics, glassware, paper, wood, electronics, non-ferrous metals, farm equipment and scientific equipment. In the services area, it includes financial services, telecommunications, transport, audio-visual services, and labour migration. Officials stress that while this covers the sectors under discussion, it is unlikely that agreements can be reached in all areas. Last week, Japan outlined in talks with US counterparts new concessions to open up its financial services sector. These proposals were put before EC negotiators in Geneva yesterday. They could be of immense importance in rallying support in Europe and the US for the wider Uruguay Round package, since both are expected to gain significantly from liberalisation of financial services. Perhaps most critically, they could be important in swinging the French government behind an agreement. Fierce French opposition to proposals for reform of farm trade could be offset by significant liberalisation in financial services, since France is the world's second-largest services exporter. Sir Leon warned in Paris on Wednesday, at the end of a meeting of 'quad' ministers, that if outline agreement was to be secured before the Tokyo summit 'it must involve every participant being ready to move and do things which will not necessarily be easy'. Notably, the US will need to lower protection for its textiles industry. US negotiators will also need to assure other G7 countries that they have won unconditional 'fast track' authority to present a 'take it or leave it' deal to Congress. The EC must cut tariffs on electronics products, and will need to lower barriers to foreign films and television programmes. Japan is under pressure to open its market to more rice imports. It is understood that no concessions are likely before the G7 summit, though negotiators hope Japan will bend to pressure in the multilateral negotiations that would follow a successful G7 outcome. Between now and the Tokyo summit, negotiators are scheduled to meet virtually non-stop. A critical sequence of meetings in Tokyo culminate in a 'quad' summit on June 23-24. What is significant is that 'quad' ministers invited Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of Gatt, to brief them in Paris this week on how a G7 agreement could be broadened to embrace all 111 Gatt members. Also present in Paris was Mr Peter Sutherland, who is expected to succeed Mr Dunkel at the end of this month, and who would play a critical part in managing multilateral negotiations in the wake of the G7 summit. By this stage, a range of new obstacles will face negotiators. The 14 farm produce exporting countries organised into the Cairns Group have already made it clear that the US-EC agreement on farm trade reform reached at Blair House in Washington in November must provide a 'rock bottom minimum' for the agriculture section of the Uruguay Round agreement to be acceptable. Japan, which has come under increasing unilateral pressure from the US to set targets for bringing its trade with the US into balance, is spearheading efforts to include in the Uruguay Round package clear commitments to use the multilateral Gatt forum to settle trade disputes. This is aimed in particular at Washington's 'Section 301' laws, which are at the heart of an armoury of unilateral trade sanctions that are of increasing concern to US trade partners. Japan in turn will come under pressure to agree to 'tariffication without exception' in the Uruguay Round package - a commitment that would force it to open its domestic rice market to foreign competition, albeit behind high tariff walls.</p>

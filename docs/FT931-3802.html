			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / As They Say In Europe: Britain's overheated news economy - Press Review THE SECOND anniversary of the day this column was launched on an astounded world seems a good time to reflect on the unique nature of the British media. It stems from the intense competition among 11 national dailies and the way that is heightened by the power of a well-funded nationwide broadcasting system. In the rest of Europe the news market is dominated by a couple of weekly magazines, one or two national papers and any number of regionals which operate on a shoestring and poverty-stricken broadcasters. That the British media exercise a uniquely decisive influence on national political life has been notably demonstrated in recent days: in no other country would what has been termed the 'moral panic' over juvenile crime have provided the basis of such a concerted campaign that led to almost instant action on the part of the government. Foreign correspondents in London quickly become attuned to the 'nine-day-wonder' nature of the news. It results from the way national dailies, and not only the tabloids, latch on to a single phenomenon to fight competitive battles. Veterans of the foreign press corps who have been scarred by numerous incomprehensible stories - Westland, salmonella in eggs  -now take a sardonic view of those sudden eruptions that characterise the flow of British public life. But their daily rhythm is rigid. The Today programme on Radio 4 is part of breakfast. They can relax until the World at One appears on the same wavelength. These set the agenda which is pursued in Question Time in Parliament and that in turn assures the headlines for the evening TV news and next day's papers. Thus the British debate runs like this: The Guardian carries an exclusive about a secret report on the decline of the ice cream industry. The Today programme gets hold of the story and runs a feature on the rise of American ice cream in Britain. The original report is published in full later that morning and the World at One interviews the Minister for Ice Cream. In parliament during Prime Minister's questions, John Major rejects demands for action. Next day the Daily Express leads on the headline, 'Ice cream: Major acts.' Look what happened to the last set of unemployment figures. Endless items up to 'U-day' itself predicted that unemployment would rise above 3m. Then came the figures. They showed that it stood at 2,995,100 seasonally adjusted. So the media unanimously, and contrary to normal practice, seized on the unadjusted figures which put unemployment at above 3m. How wise the Germans are never to say when their official statistics are to appear. One may wonder if the institutionalised overheating of the policy debate in Britain damages the policy-making process. City economists, who should be safely locked up feeding incorrect forecasts to their employers, become famous, quoted and interviewed on all aspects of government policy. When the pound was on its way out of the ERM last September, they appeared across the media to sing the praises of devaluation. Now guess whether their employers made or lost money on the sudden collapse of sterling. The situation in France or Germany is quite different. For one thing, both suffer a dreadful shortage of economists. There is some discussion of public policy issues on the broadcast media but the usual fare of morning current affairs programmes is provided by the clients of resourceful public relations agencies. 'And now we take a look at the forthcoming masterpiece of Jean-Luc Cineaste.' It was inevitable that there was an intense debate in Britain on the Maastricht Treaty while public opinion in most of the rest of Europe supinely accepted the word of parti pris Eurocrats. But have the benefits of this public debate outweighed the damage? Is the absurd chain of events at Westminster not the result of an over-excited controversy that is constantly fanned into life by highly-motivated and gifted newsmongers? And they in turn are assisted by an astonishing number of well-organised pressure groups, charities and of course MP's devoted to ensuring the public benefits from their unique insights. All these have abundant access to the nation's news outlets to which decision-makers feel compelled to pay attention. Any time anybody wants an opinion in Britain there is always the Royal Society for the Protection of This and That, Credit Russe Bigbang &amp; Boom, the Sweatshop Association, Help the Rich, Women Against Men, the National Truss and Hernia Foundation and Lord knows who ready to provide it. And everybody who is anybody from Land's End to John O'Groats has to listen. It could all get worse. There may yet be a Freedom of Information Act.

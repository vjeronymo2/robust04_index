			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Cambodia let down by democracy: Coalition government has had a turbulent year Cambodia is one of those countries in which provincial restaurants display polite signs asking customers to leave their grenades and semi-automatic weapons outside. Travellers outside the capital, Phnom Penh, risk not only the possibility of being kidnapped by guerrillas or bandits (two Britons and an Australian seized three months ago are still missing) but also the probability of being shaken down by drunken government soldiers demanding money or cigarettes at gunpoint. Having endured such treatment and worse from a succession of governments run by whimsical monarchs, a military dictator, fanatical Maoists and Vietnamese-backed communists, Cambodians know plenty about violence and political instability. Perhaps it was not surprising that most Cambodians greeted with a shrug of indifference the news of an attempted coup d'etat a week ago and the subsequent sight of more troops on the streets of Phnom Penh. But the present government, a coalition of royalists and communists elected a year ago in a poll organised by the United Nations, was supposed to be democratic. The lack of popular concern about the government's fate, and the widespread suspicion that it may have engineered the failed coup for its own unfathomable political purposes, indicate how badly it has fared since taking power. Particularly disastrous for its reputation were the army offensives against Khmer Rouge guerrilla strongholds in northern and western Cambodia earlier this year. On two occasions the guerrillas retreated before the troops, led them into a trap, and then counter-attacked and routed them. Apart from demoralising the army, the fighting frightened away French and other foreign tourists who were beginning to arrive in greater numbers to visit the famous Khmer temples of Angkor Wat. The government's economic record is better than its military one, but is hardly ideal. Mr Sam Rainsy, the finance minister from the royalist party Funcinpec, has tried to introduce free market policies and has inspired the confidence of the International Monetary Fund and foreign investors. But Mr Rainsy's authority was suddenly undermined last month when responsibility for collecting timber revenues was secretly moved to the Defence Ministry from the Finance Ministry, apparently after pressure on the government from the military. The move, authorised by Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Mr Hun Sen, the coalition's two prime ministers, deprives the Finance Ministry of an important source of budget income, contravenes the budget law, and will probably anger the IMF. Funcinpec, in spite of having won the most seats in the election, has not had much impact in the provinces, where corrupt communists from the former regime are still largely in control and former Funcinpec supporters accuse their own leaders of betrayal. Neither the overmanned civil service nor the incompetent army has been reformed. At the national assembly in Phnom Penh, haggling between Funcinpec and the communist Cambodian People's party has delayed passage of several important laws, including one on foreign investment. Corruption and inefficiency are so widespread that even Asian businessmen who pride themselves on being able to strike deals where no westerner would dare venture are frustrated by the difficulties of doing business. Cambodians say a lucrative job as a customs officer can be bought for about Dollars 6,000 (Pounds 3,900), the equivalent of 30 years' salary. Stolen Toyotas and Nissans are parked outside government ministries by the officials who stole them. Army generals who are supposed to be fighting the Khmer Rouge often trade gems and tropical timber with them. 'They shell each other in the morning and trade and drink whisky in the evening,' says one disgusted Phnom Penh businessman. After decades of repression by various governments, the UN operation in Cambodia and the election campaign encouraged the creation of independent pressure groups dealing with everything from the environment to human rights. More than 40 Cambodian newspapers also appeared on the streets. Now this flowering of popular democracy may be threatened. Yesterday the government said it had arrested a newspaper editor for 'creating disorder' by publishing a story about the generals believed to have been involved in the failed coup attempt a week ago. Two other newspapers critical of the government were closed previously. Perhaps the government's biggest mistake, according to diplomats and aid donors, is its failure to invest in the rural areas where most Cambodians live as rice farmers. Government troops have made themselves unpopular by extorting money from villagers when they bring their rice to market along government-held roads. Foreign aid workers noticed during an outbreak of fighting in the north-west in May that while many homeless Cambodians fled to government-held zones, hundreds of others took refuge in Khmer Rouge areas. 'I can't help thinking that things are sliding back into the situation between 1968 and 1974 (a year before the Khmer Rouge took power), when the army was ineffective and corrupt and politics were unstable,' said one foreign investor.</p>

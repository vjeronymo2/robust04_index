			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Books: Sad Little Prince SAINT-EXUPERY by Stacey Schiff Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 25, 525 pages Who is the most popular French writer outside France? Not Moliere, nor Sartre, nor even Simenon, but the war pilot Antoine de Saint-Exupery. His children's story The Little Prince, about an aviator who crashes in the Sahara Desert and wakes up beside the little prince, visiting from another star, runs into more foreign editions than any French book. Written in lonely wartime exile in New York, The Little Prince was bundled off to the publishers as Saint-Exupery boarded a ship for north Africa in 1943 and persuaded the American forces to take him on as a reconnaissance pilot. The next year, deviating from his flight plan so that he could glimpse his childhood haunts in southern France, he disappeared. His plane was never recovered. As romantic and mysterious as his fiction, Saint-Exupery's life was steeped at once in the pioneering spirit of early aviation and in nostalgia for the chivalry of the 19th century. Born in 1900 into an aristocratic family, he spent an idyllic childhood in a chateau at the foot of the Jura mountains. At 12, he made his first flight - four years after the Wright brothers - and was hooked. He joined the French air force, then flew in north Africa as a member of the Air Mail Service - the subject of his first book, Southern Mail. In 1931 in Argentina he met a glamorous young widow called Consuelo. He invited her for a flight then and there, and demanded from the cockpit that she kiss him. When she refused, he threatened to crash the plane because he was too ugly to win her love. A few months later, with the bride dressed in black, they married. But his obsession with flying took its toll, and the couple rapidly and resentfully came to lead separate lives. They competed to see who could stay out latest, habitually standing each other up on midnight dinner dates. They could not have a baby, Saint-Exupery said, because Consuelo's socialising was so hectic that she would leave it in a taxi. To escape, he made ever more reckless trips. Trying to break the record for a flight from Paris to Saigon, he and his mechanic crashed in the desert and nearly died of thirst; how they were rescued by an Arab is told in Wind, Sand and Stars. Back home in France, he wrote to the family that had saved him: 'Here the world looks less like a desert but in reality it is more so.' Saint-Exupery never accommodated to his own times. His manner was old-fashioned, aristocratic, exquisitely courtly - the style of The Little Prince. He was an idealist whose over-riding concern was man's spiritual needs in the new technological age. Like many children's writers he never grew up - his favourite pastime was to fly paper aeroplanes off the Empire State Building. This is the second major English biography of Saint-Exupery in two years. Stacey Schiff is more comprehensive and detailed than Paul Webster (Antoine Saint-Exupery: The Life and Death of the Little Prince, Macmillan), but far less readable. Her style is fussy, her interpretation of her subject's writing muddled and convoluted. She does however, throw extensive and important new light on the composition of The Little Prince, much of it written at the home of Sylvia Reinhardt, a young American who was besotted with Antoine. He was, according to Schiff, by this time impotent; moreover he spoke no English and Sylvia had no French. But she served him fried eggs and English muffins by candlelight whenever he called, and provided a doll and a poodle as models for the prince and the sheep. Then she listened, rapt though without understanding a word, as Saint-Exupery read from the manuscript. Schiff sees the Little Prince as a 'cosmic urchin.' Webster, more convincingly and sympathetically, reads the book as a love letter to Consuelo, who is characterised as the rose. After he had finished it, Saint-Exupery wrote that he was 'indifferent to life.' The climax to this story, his madcap despairing wartime flights, is breathtaking and heartbreaking.</p>

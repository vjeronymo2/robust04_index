			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Ulcer drug ruling welcomed Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday welcomed an EU committee verdict endorsing the safety of its top-selling anti-ulcer drug, Losec. The committee was responding to German health authority concerns that injected versions of Losec could cause blindness. The committee for proprietary medicinal products concluded there was no causal link between the intravenous use of Losec and the reported side-effects experienced by some critically ill users. There was no case for recommending restrictions on the drug's use, it added. Astra has agreed to revise its information to doctors accordingly. Losec is one of the world's fastest growing medicines, with 1993 total sales worth SKr12.7bn (Pounds 1.06bn). Intravenous versions of the drug account for just 3 per cent of sales as it is usually taken orally. The group's A shares, which have been overshadowed by the German claims in recent months, rose SKr3 to SKr170.</p>

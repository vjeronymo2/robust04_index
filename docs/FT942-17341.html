			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow suffers sharp loss in heavy trade Wall Street US stocks fell sharply as investors scurried to square their positions after a Good Friday sell-off in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 42.61 off at 3,593.35, but well above the session's low. The fresh decline, as investors returned from a three-day Easter break, extended the downturn in the bellwether index to 385 points, or 9.6 per cent, since its closing record peak of 3,978 on January 31. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 weakened 6.84 to 438.92 and declines swamped rises by 2,108 to 371 in heavy trading of 344.4m shares. The American SE composite was 8.98, or 2 per cent, lower at 434.13, and the Nasdaq composite down 16.05, or 2.2 per cent, at 727.41. The tumultuous opening was no surprise. It was widely expected since Friday, when the Labor Department released March employment data showing the biggest monthly gain in non-farm payrolls since October 1987. Bond prices plunged and yields surged as a result. With the stock markets closed in observance of Good Friday, equity investors had the weekend to mull over the implications of the data for the financial markets, which were already unsettled by the threat of higher interest rates. Their conclusion brought a wave of selling at the opening, pushing the Dow industrials down by as much as 84 points. But prices managed to crawl off the session's lows when the morning failed to bring another sharp setback in bonds. The Dow swung back and forth again during the afternoon amid several waves of program trading and a deep plunge in bond prices just before trading ended. Grumman was marked down Dollars 3 to Dollars 61 5/8 after its board accepted a Dollars 62-a-share tender offer from Northrop, which dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 37 5/8 . Martin Marietta, which had offered Dollars 55 a share, slipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 42 5/8 . Woolworth shed Dollars 2 1/4 to yet another 52-week low at Dollars 12 7/8 on news that senior executives had stepped down temporarily amid an internal investigation of accounting irregularities. Canada Toronto shares plummeted in light trade as a worsening currency crisis gripped all Canada's financial markets. The TSE 300 composite index dropped 99.5, or 2.3 per cent, to 4,230.1 and falls led rises by 713 to 138. With many investors still on holiday, volume was a paltry 42.1m shares. South African markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT ADVISERS  </P> <P> Colman Andrews' "Just What Is a Restaurant Consultant?" (May 13) addressed only  the fluff and glamorous aspects of what one consultant (Debbie Slutsky) chooses  to provide her clients.  </P> <P> In reality, the professional restaurant consultant has a duty to provide a firm  opinion as to whether the client can execute a long-term restaurant business.  </P> <P> This includes labor-relations issues, human-resource environment or company  culture issues, sanitation, quality food and service, waste management,  marketing, total financial and inventory control, etc.  </P> <P> Too many egos are catered to by consultants as featured in this article, and  they continue to do an injustice to their clients and the professionalism of  the industry.  </P> <P> Slutsky states, "People should open restaurants because they love food, have a  certain sense of style and taste, and have recognized a niche in the  marketplace they can fill." What about good business sense?  </P> <P> CONSTANCE A. ESPOSITO  </P> <P> RE: Incorporated  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

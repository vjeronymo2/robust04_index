			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram brokers replaced SPRING RAM, the bathrooms and kitchens group, has appointed Barclays de Zoete Wedd as its brokers, replacing Panmure Gordon. Tomorrow, when the interim results are announced, Price Waterhouse is expected to take over the audit from Arthur Andersen. Price Waterhouse will also be presenting the full financial review of Spring Ram arranged by Mr Roger Regan, the new chairman. In addition Mr Regan will give an operational review of the group. Some unofficial market estimates put the first-half loss as high as Pounds 40m. Tomorrow's results are also expected to spark the departure of Mr Bill Rooney, one of the group's founders and its biggest shareholder with a 16 per cent stake. Mr Rooney lost his job as executive chairman to Mr Regan, who was approached by investment institutions after Spring Ram issued three profit warnings in eight months.</p>

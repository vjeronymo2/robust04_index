			<p>BFN     [Text] Senator Santanina Rasul suspects the terrorist Abu  Sayyaf group is being supported by the military. According to  Rasul, several persons have told her they saw the military  helping some active members of the Abu Sayyaf group.    [Begin Rasul recording in English] There are those who feel  that the Abu Sayyaf or some people in the Abu Sayyaf are  supported by the military. And I think the military should look  into this angle -- that one of the leaders was seen being  ferried by a PCF [expansion unknown], being ferried by a  military chief, and escorted by military personnel in Basilan.    So again, this has given rise to suspicion that maybe the  Abu  Sayyaf are not really what they are. Maybe, it is something  more that, [pause] more than meets the eye. But on my part, as  a leader of this region -- as a Muslim leader -- I feel that  this incident should not be used to project the idea of  Muslim-Christian conflict. [end recording]    This statement followed information released by Criminal  Investigation Service Regional Command 9, which stated that the  firearms confiscated from Mujin Aminudin who is allegedly the  supply officer of Abu Sayyaf, came from the Logistics Command of  the Armed Forces of the Philippines at Camp Aguinaldo.    Senator Rasul also said that the root cause of the Abu  Sayyaf  problem is attributed to the slow pace of the government's peace  talks with the Muslim rebels, as well as the military's failure  to grant Abu Sayyaf's earlier requests on their previous  kidnapping operations.    [Begin Rasul recording in English] So, I think we have to  fast track this peace process with the Moro National Liberation  Front [MNLF]. Otherwise, we will find ourselves on the losing  end. The people who should be supporting the government might  be incited by this extremist group to join forces with them  because they feel that nothing much is happening in the peace  talks between the MNLF and the government.

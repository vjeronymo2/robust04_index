			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / US will press G7 nations to aim for faster growth THE United States will next week call for the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to carry out more growth-oriented policies in response to its growing concern about the weak state of the world economy and the slow pace of the US recovery. Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, warned in London that economic growth rates were below the levels needed to deal with the problems of the G7 countries, the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe and the rest of the world. Mr Brady said after a meeting with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that 'an inordinate preoccupation' with inflation would produce a level of growth that was not satisfactory. His comments were echoed yesterday by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who said he was not satisfied with the pace of the US economic recovery. He said: 'I don't find 2 per cent real growth, which is what we're experiencing at this particular stage, adequate.' Testifying before the Senate banking committee in Washington, Mr Greenspan warned that economic data for January and February had overstated the strength of the US recovery which was proceeding at a much slower pace than in past upturns. Mr Greenspan's comments will fuel speculation that the Fed, the US central bank, may be preparing for further cuts in short-term interest rates if the economy fails to show greater vitality. Senator Donald Riegle, Senate banking committee chairman, urged the US to push the G7 to agree a co-ordinated global strategy when it meets in Washington on April 26. He said the US should be much more aggressive in getting an economic growth strategy to ensure that the US economy did not slide back into recession because of weaker growth elsewhere. Mr Brady briefed Mr Lamont on Thursday after a trip to eastern Europe and Moscow to assess progress with economic reform. G7 finance ministers and central bankers will consider the latest world economic forecasts from the International Monetary Fund, which are thought to point to low global growth of about 1.5 per cent this year but a recovery to 3.5 per cent in 1993. The US growth rate is also forecast to quicken to around 3.5 per cent next year from about 1.5 per cent in 1992. Monetary officials from the US and Europe expect that Japan will be asked at the April 26 meeting to stimulate investment, perhaps by bringing forward further public works programmes. It is unclear how much more pressure the US will exert upon its other G7 allies to persuade them to revise their policies. The US has expressed understanding for the economic difficulties arising from German unification and it may not make a frontal attack on the Bundesbank's high interest rates. Russia's economic reform programme remains intact and the planned financial support for it from the International Monetary Fund should be agreed in May, according to Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary. The US had not changed its support for the economic reform efforts or its view that work on western financial support for Russia should continue, he said. Page 2</p>

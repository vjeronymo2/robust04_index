			<p>BFN     [Text] Arab diplomatic sources have told AL-SHA'B that  while taking part in the conference of nonaligned countries'  foreign ministers, Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id  al-Sahhaf met with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and asked Egypt to  play a role in unifying the Arab fold, defining the elements of  pan-Arab security, overlooking the events of the past, and  developing bilateral ties between Egypt and Iraq.    The sources said the Iraqi foreign minister requested the  reinstatement of the joint action committees for cooperation  between Egypt and Iraq in all economic, social, and cultural  fields and stressed Iraq's desire to mend its political  relations with other Arab countries. He also called for an  urgent Arab move led by Egypt to unify the Arab fold and clear  the Arab air.    The Iraqi foreign minister affirmed his country's readiness  for a serious contribution in the future to any measures led by  Egypt or the Arab League to clear the atmosphere and plan for a  successful Arab summit.    The sources added that Egypt told Iraq of the need to settle  bilateral problems with Kuwait, especially the Kuwaiti  prisoners, and to agree on a new method governing inter-Arab  relations in the coming stage.    AL-SHA'B learned that Egypt turned down an Iraqi plan to  develop bilateral ties between the two countries through  ministerial committees and that Egypt postponed discussion of  any issues concerning bilateral cooperation to a later stage.</p>

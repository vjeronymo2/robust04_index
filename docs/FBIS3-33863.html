During this session some proposals of the  deputies and Majles commissions were approved on revenue figures  of the budget bill for the year 1373 [Iranian year beginning 21  March 1994]. On the basis of these proposals various  ministries, state organizations, and companies are permitted to  hire out or sell at least 20 percent of their vehicles so as to  meet their service costs in the year 1373. The said  organizations are obliged to sell at least 12 percent of their  equipment, which are not fully utilized, to the value of 400  billion rials in the year 1373. The income from such sales  should be deposited in the state general revenue account.    On the basis of another ratified note, in the year 1373 all  imported goods should be registered. The registration fee for  the essential commodities is five rials per every dollar, or its  equivalent in other hard currencies, of the commodity's value.  For the non-essential commodities the registration fee is 40  rials per dollar.    Any person importing a vehicle, in addition to the existing  taxes and customs charges, should pay 10 percent of the basic  value of the vehicle to obtain a number plate for the vehicle.    On the basis of another ratified note, any passenger  entering  the country, even from the free ports, can import goods up to  the value of 150,000 rials without having to pay customs charges  and tariffs.    According to our correspondent's report, on the basis of the  notes approved during this session of the Islamic Majles, in  order to improve the quality of higher education and for more  efficient utilization of the country's educational  establishments, higher education institutes are allowed to  charge the students who fail some subjects. That is, if a  student fails in one or several subjects, he must pay cash or  promise to pay later all the charges incurred by the state to  enable him to repeat the subjects. The universities and the  research and higher education institutes are also permitted to  let their premises and facilities at the fair market rate,  provided their own research works and operations are not  undermined.</p>

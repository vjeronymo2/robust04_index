			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BEVERLY SEEKS EXEMPTION TO CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST RULE  </P> <P> A bill carried by Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) cleared its first  legislative hurdle last week despite complaints from critics that it would  undermine state conflict-of-interest regulations for public officials.  </P> <P> Under state Fair Political Practices Commission regulations, local officials  automatically must disqualify themselves from voting on any development within  300 feet of real estate they own, including their homes, because of the  potential for a conflict of interest.  </P> <P> The legislation, sought by the city of Signal Hill, would exempt a public  official's principal residence from conflict-of-interest requirements.  </P> <P> The Senate Governmental Organization Committee approved the measure Tuesday on  an 8-0 vote and sent it to the Appropriations Committee.  </P> <P> Officials of the Fair Political Practices Commission opposed the legislation as  too broadly drawn and said it could lead to other changes in the  conflict-of-interest statutes. Lilly Spitz, a commission lawyer, described the  potential impact of the bill as "like setting a toe into some quicksand."  </P> <P> Beverly introduced the bill on Monday. With only four weeks remaining in the  1989 legislative session, it is unclear whether Beverly will have the time to  maneuver the measure through the legislative process. Because the bill would  amend the state Political Reform Act and Beverly wants it to take effect  immediately, all action will require a two-thirds majority.  </P> <P> Beverly, whose district covers Signal Hill, said he is pushing the proposal  partly to spur the commission to reach a compromise with the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Add 1,300 Units to City  </P> <P> He said that three of Signal Hill's five council members and two of its  planning commissioners live near two proposed developments, which would add  1,300 residential units to the city.  </P> <P> These officials are prohibited from voting on any item affecting these  developments because of regulations issued last year by the political watchdog  agency, Beverly said. "Merely by virtue of your residence . . . you should not  be guilty of a conflict of interest," Beverly told the committee. Because the  two-square-mile hillside city lies in the middle of an oil field, much of its  land is undeveloped. The housing developments would take up the bulk of the  remaining vacant land in the city of 8,400.  </P> <P> Fair Political Practices Commission Chairman John Larson told the committee  that the commission has spelled out procedures for cities to handle such  extreme cases.  </P> <P> He said the Signal Hill City Council may conduct a random drawing among the  trio of council members who were disqualified. Along with the remaining two  members, the person whose name is drawn would make up a quorum of the council  to review the development projects, according to an analysis of the bill by the  Governmental Organization Committee.  </P> <P> According to the committee analysis of the bill, Signal Hill officials say that  other communities are also penalized by the regulations "because it is  difficult for a locally elected official to avoid conflicts no matter where he  resides in the city."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Had to Disqualify Selves  </P> <P> Last year, the FPPC determined that three planning commissioners and two  council members in Monterey Park had to disqualify themselves from major zoning  changes because their homes fell within areas under review or in close  proximity to them.  </P> <P> Larson said he was in sympathy with Signal Hill's dilemma, but he maintained  that the dispute could be resolved through changes in his commission's  regulations or through a narrowly tailored bill to lift conflict-of-interest  restrictions for officials in small cities like Signal Hill.  </P> <P> "The smaller cities do pose a problem," he acknowledged, noting that the Signal  Hill situation was unique because a majority of the council faces a potential  conflict.  </P></p>

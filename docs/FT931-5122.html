			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Local shops 'win a quarter of sales' LOCAL shops attract significant trade in spite of the spread of superstores and out-of-town developments, according to a report published today by Verdict Research, the retail market research consultants. The report says spending in neighbourhood shops was Pounds 36bn in 1992  - a quarter of all retail sales. But the number of local shops has fallen by 11,000 to 102,000 in the last 10 years. Neighbourhood shops averaged yearly sales per square foot of Pounds 440, above the Pounds 260 average for out-of-town and high street stores.</p>

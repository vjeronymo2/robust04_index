			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei  Kono indicated Tuesday that he intends to put himself forward as  a candidate when the Diet chooses the next prime minister. He  told a meeting of Liberal Democratic Party executives that LDP  members should unite in the election, party officials said.    But he said he intends to have a "fair fight" with the  ruling  coalition, which has yet to choose its candidate to succeed  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his intention to  step down last Friday.    Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the LDP, supported Kono,  saying it is natural for a party leader to run for the  premiership, the officials said.    Kono rapped moves within the LDP to put forward former  Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe for the premiership, insisting  that he as party president should be the candidate.    Backers of Watanabe argued that the party president need not  be the automatic candidate, and Taku Yamasaki, deputy general  secretary of the party, voiced opposition to Kono's comments.  Yamasaki belongs to an LDP faction headed by Watanabe.</p>

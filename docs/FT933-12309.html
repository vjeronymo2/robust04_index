			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Computer data quiz for banks HIGH STREET banks are to be asked what information they keep on customers after it was disclosed this week that National Westminster holds computer information about the political affiliation and religious beliefs of some of its 6.5m personal customers. Francis Aldhouse, the deputy data protection registrar, said that holding information about political affiliations was 'potentially sensitive' and indicated that customers were entitled to an explanation. 'We will be taking this issue up with all leading banks because we are not quite sure what the situation is,' he added. The other three big English banks - Midland, Barclays and Lloyds - have said they do not hold information about a customer's political views on file. NatWest said it does not solicit the information but might record it if it were to crop up in conversation. The bank claimed the main purpose of holding the information was to build a relationship with customers. 'If a bank manager is entertaining a customer who is a vegetarian, he won't want to put his foot in it by serving him meat,' said NatWest. 'The same applies to some leisure activities or knowing whether the customer is a member of the local conservative club. This is what relationship banking is about.' There is nothing illegal about NatWest's actions since it is registered to hold this information. Under the Data Protection Act 1984, information stored on a computer for any reason other than accounting purposes must be recorded with the Data Protection Registrar. 'The registry is in essence a declaration by an organisation of the sort of information it holds on computer,' said John Lamidey, assistant data protection registrar. There are more than 160,000 organisations on it and it is open to public inspection. Banks often record information which might be helpful to them for marketing some of their products, which could be insurance-related or investment oriented, such as a unit trust or services offered by the credit card it issues. The worry for consumers is that what is held on computer is available to credit reference agencies. NatWest says it would make available information relevant only to the granting of credit, such as a customer's income. Under the Consumer Credit Act, individuals have a right to see information held on them by a credit reference agency on payment of Pounds 1. Public concern about personal data stored on computer extends beyond the access which credit reference agencies and tracing agents - licensed organisations which specialise in debt collection - have to it. Earlier this month Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, said he was worried about about the growing black market in confidential personal information. The market has arisen either because bank staff supply details knowingly to third parties or because they are tricked into giving away confidential information. Customers who are worried about the information that might be held by their bank have a right under the Data Protection Act to see what is in their files. Banks are not allowed to charge more than Pounds 10 for this access.</p>

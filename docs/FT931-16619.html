			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Republican rift hits Congress THE battle between centrists and right-wingers for control of the Republican party has spread to Congress, with the resignation of a leading moderate from the party leadership. Congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin said he would not serve as chief deputy whip in the new Congress as he expected the right-wingers who dominate the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives to adopt a strategy of 'rigid confrontation and opposition' to President-elect Bill Clinton. 'There is no question the House Republican leadership is becoming increasingly hard-right. I do not believe our present leadership represents mainstream Republicans in this country or even in the Congress,' said Mr Gunderson, an economic conservative who is more centrist on many social issue. In elections for leadership positions last month, the House Republican caucus ousted the moderate Congressman Jerry Lewis of California from the chairmanship of their Republican Conference, the party's third-ranking post, in favour of Congressman Richard Armey of Texas, a more pugnacious right-winger. In addition, Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois, an argumentative conservative who is principally known as an anti-abortion crusader, took over the chairmanship of the Republican policy comm-ittee. But the conflict in the House mirrors a broader struggle for control of the Republican party in the wake of President George Bush's election defeat - a struggle that will come to a preliminary climax later this month when the party elects a new chairman, but which is unlikely to be resolved entirely before the 1996 presidential primaries. Moderates have complained that the party presented a narrow and divisive image of itself at its convention last summer in Houston, giving prominent speaking roles to right-wingers like Mr Pat Buchanan and Christian fundamentalists such as Mr Pat Robertson. Mr Gunderson, like most of the other generally moderate Republican congressmen from his state, stayed away from the Houston convention and criticised the image of intolerance contained in some of the speeches there.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): 'Capital loss buying' curb THE BUDGET includes proposals to restrict the set off of capital losses brought into a group of companies as the result of a company joining the group. Losses set off against gains arising on or after yesterday will be restricted where they came from a company which joined the group after 31 March 1987. The chancellor's intention is to curtail 'capital loss buying' - a practice used by groups to reduce tax liability on capital gains. It involves buying in losses from other companies which have nothing to do with the purchasing group's own efforts or activities, and getting the benefit of tax relief on the losses even though the group has not suffered the loss.</p>

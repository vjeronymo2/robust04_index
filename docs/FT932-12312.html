			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Levitt to be SEC chairman MR Arthur Levitt, a former chairman of the American Stock Exchange, is expected to be named by President Bill Clinton this week as the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the government agency which polices the securities industry. Mr Levitt, who is 62 and owns Roll Call, a newspaper covering Congress, will succeed Mr Richard Breeden, a Republican appointee, who is stepping down several months before the end of his term. One of the most important actions facing Mr Levitt is the release by the SEC of a long-awaited report, called Market 2000, which will present a detailed study of the future of the US capital markets. Mr Levitt has been favourite to get the SEC post for some months, after edging ahead of Ms Consuela Washington, a congressional aide.</p>

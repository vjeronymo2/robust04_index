			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lotte Mejlhede and Mikkel Thrane: "Effort </F> Against Narcotics Yields Gain"]    [Text] Copenhagen: There are still many and large problems  with narcotics and AIDS in Copenhagen, but it looks like the  trend is going in the right direction. The municipality of  Copenhagen still has a widespread and serious narcotics problem,  and new cases of HIV infection are confirmed daily, but the  problems are not any longer growing. Nevertheless, it is  certainly not a rosy picture that the AIDS and Narcotics Council  gives in its report for 1993.    "Our initiatives in the treatment and information side, and  our condom and needle-exchange programs have borne fruit. The  situation in Copenhagen is less negative than many other places,  but it is definitely serious," says Copenhagen Chief Public  Health Service Physician Claus Lundstedt.    In the narcotics area it is particularly falling prices and  rising consumption of smoking-form heroin that is causing  concern. But also the group of young people who are in danger of  becoming addicted have need for concern, according to the  council report.    "We must have more and better treatment services that should  offer individual treatment plans for each abuser. But if they  are not motivated to free themselves from their abuse, we aren't  going to spend money on them," says Lundstedt.    The council is trying to find a particular method for  dealing  with those drug abusers who are HIV-infected and sick. At the  same time, a better information campaign will be directed to  those in socially disadvantaged groups and foreign-language  speaking groups, whom until now have been more difficult to  reach.    Schoolchildren are to have education on HIV and AIDS, and  there is going to continue to be free handing out of condoms and  clean needles. The council is going to try and get better  statistical data regarding both narcotics and HIV.    "There is a huge need for more information, because as it is  now, we don't have a real insight on the extent of the  problems," says Lundstedt.</p>

Speaking at a press conference, Panov said that the  agreements signed by the former Soviet Union and DPRK are still  effective, but Russia will make decisions on the basis of its  own analysis.    Panov also briefed reporters on Russia's new proposal for  solving the crisis in the Korean peninsula.    According to Panov, the situation on the Korean peninsula is  so tense that it is on the verge of war. He suggested that an  international conference be held among China, the United States,  Japan, Russia, DPRK, the Republic of Korea, as well as the  United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    He said that such a conference should first of all discuss  how to guarantee the non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula  including the joint announcement on a nuclear-free Korean  peninsula by both sides of Korea.    Panov suggested the international conference be held first  in  Geneva and then in Pyongyang and Seoul in turn.    He said the United Nations and IAEA have made great efforts  to solve the Korean issue, but the results are not always  satisfactory.    He added that all related parties are considering Russia's  new proposal.</p>

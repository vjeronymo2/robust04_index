			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: James Halstead rises to Pounds 8.7m - Diversity of operations helps overcome difficult conditions JAMES HALSTEAD, the Manchester-based floor-coverings, weatherproof clothing and trailers group, more than doubled pre-tax profits in the year to June 30, though the rise was flattered by the adoption of FRS 3 accounting standards. Profits grew to Pounds 8.7m, against a restated Pounds 3.84m, affected by bringing the Pounds 4.2m costs of closing the Belstaff operations above the line. The group said that the operating profits before interest, which rose by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 8.48m (Pounds 7.89m), gave a truer measure of the trading performance. Turnover looked flat at Pounds 59.4m (Pounds 58.9m), but the latter included some Pounds 5m from Belstaff. Group margins were broadly maintained, said Mr Stephen Knight, finance director. He ascribed the group's ability to overcome difficult trading conditions partly to the breadth of its operations. James Halstead Ltd, the core floor-coverings division which accounts for two thirds of turnover, was 'marking time for the first time for some time,' he said. With brand leadership and dominant market share in commercial sheet vinyl flooring, he added, it was difficult in the current climate to raise sales without cutting prices. Profits at Conway Products, the trailer tents, trailers and security cabins business which received an offer to buy during the year, fell in all its areas, though none will be abandoned. Driza-Bone, the Australian stockman's coat company, did well in spite of a second consecutive rain-free winter there. However, exports now account for 30 per cent of sales. Cash balances grew to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 3.1m) over the year and complementary infill acquisitions were being considered, said Mr Knight. Interest receivable fell to Pounds 45,000 (Pounds 156,000). Earnings advanced to 20.23p (8.94p) and a 4p final dividend makes 6.5p for the year - an increase of 8 per cent. COMMENT There does not seem to be too much wrong with the management, the products or the group - it has a market beating brand name in its core business and has the sense to invest heavily in that when there is no growth in the market. The benefit should accrue when the construction and refurbishment sectors are beginning to come back. Conway is sufficiently highly thought of for an offer to be made. And the smaller parts of the group have sparkled. Yet, a question nags: is the group doing enough to exploit its brands? With almost Pounds 9m pencilled in for the current year, the p/e will be 17, quite high but supported by the dividend yield.</p>

Grachev arrived in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, this morning,  a day before Russian President Boris Yeltsin flies in for a  one-day summit meeting with its leader Eduard Shevardnadze.    During the summit, both sides are expected to sign a package  of accord which will include a treaty of friendship and  cooperation.    Addressing members of the 405th Russian Regiment deployed in  Georgia, Grachev said: "The future of our military and political  cooperation with Georgia depends upon the stability of the  republic's socio-political life and on settling the problem of  the political status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."    Abkhazia, an autonomous republic of Georgia, declared its  independence in July 1992, while South Ossetia, an autonomous  region of the former Soviet republic, proclaimed its  independence in November 1991. The two rebel regions have been  involved in a long-term and bloody conflict with Georgia.    Grachev also revealed that the coming Georgian-Russian  summit  will decide the future establishment of Russian military bases  on Georgian territory in view of the expiry in 1995 of the  interim agreement on Russian troops status in Georgia.    He said that Russia wants to keep its troops in Georgia and  set up military bases but on the condition that it is done with  respect for the treaty on collective security of the  Commonwealth of Independent States.    "If the question of bases is solved during Yeltsin and  Shevardnadze's summit, detailed arrangements will be worked out  by the two countries' military experts," he added.    According to the minister, who will have a confidential  meeting with Shevardnadze tonight, Russia plans to set up five  military bases in the Caucasian region -- three in Georgia, one  in Azerbaijan and the other in Armenia.    The minister also disclosed that Yeltsin and Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had agreed with the Defense  Ministry the principles of expanding the Russian Army.    He suggested that up to 2.1 million men should be enlisted  into the army by 1995 because its current strength of 1.5  million, set by the country's defense legislation, is not enough  to ensure the state's security.    Meanwhile, Georgian parliament deputy speaker Vakhtang  Rcheulishvili said today that his country expects much from  Yeltsin's visit.    However, in the Abkhazian capital of Sochi Government leader  Sokrat Dzhindzholia said on Tuesday [2 February] that his  country was opposed to the signing of a treaty of friendship and  cooperation between Russia and Georgia.    "Only when the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia is  completely settled should such an agreement be signed," he  declared.    Leaders of South Ossetia today also accused Moscow of  inconsistency in its approach to the signing of such a treaty  complaining that Georgia still refuses to hold talks with South  Ossetia on its status.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / The Wall is gone but the burden remains: How are the people of the former East Germany adjusting to unification? Judy Dempsey asks them and finds them unsettled by change and lacking in self-confidence It was the longing for the tide. 'I wanted to see the ebb and the flow,' said Hannelore Bohm. 'We could never see it at the Ostsee (Baltic Sea) in east Germany. It has no tide.' Bohm was born in 1929 in Gorlitz, a beautiful nineteenth century town tucked deep in the south-eastern corner of Germany. Unscathed by bombing during the second world war, Gorlitz had been divided between East Germany and Poland after 1945. Territory east of the river Neisse had been ceded to Warsaw. 'This part of the country never had access to West German television during the DDR days. We could never travel to the west. We could never see the tide,' said Bohm. The chance to travel came soon after the Berlin Wall fell on November 9 1989. 'It was May 1990. We went to visit a cousin in Ravensburg. We were very excited. But then he told us that the time spent under the DDR were 40 wasted years for which we had nothing to show. The arrogance, the ignorance was awful.' Under the Communists, Bohm also never had the chance to study medicine, a profession practised by her father and grandfather. 'After the war, I applied for a university place. But it was forbidden. I was from a bourgeois family. They said it was now the chance of the workers. What could I do? I started a family. It was only in the late 1950s that my brother was allowed to study medicine. I later trained as a teacher. Until 1989 I was deputy head of the school here in Gorlitz. I never joined the Communist party.' 'With hindsight, I realised how much we lived in a cosy world.' Jens Reich, professor of molecular biology at the Max Delbruck Centre for Molecular Medicine in Buch, east Berlin, was sitting in his office. From his window, a spectacular array of red and rust autumnal leaves was falling. Reich, a long serving member of the East German opposition, had been one of the founding members of Neues Forum, the independent civil movement set up in east Berlin during September 1989, the month thousands of East Germans were trying to escape to the west via the West German embassy in Hungary. Earlier this year, he ran for federal president. He is now waiting to to be reconfirmed as professor. 'Before unification, I was stressed at work. But everything was clear. The politics was clear. The resistance of the people was defined. We knew where we stood with the economy. Everybody knew what to do. You did not have to worry about your future. We lived on a modest level. But we were living like children. Now now we are adults'. Are the east Germans finding it difficult to cope with adulthood which has been so quickly thrust upon them? 'I can't explain it very well. But adulthood means taking responsibility which means mastering the strength to make decisions. A lot of people lack the strength to have inner responsibility. We are now responsible for many more things, things that we had earlier only dreamed about. Then, we were like birds in a cage.' He gazed out the window. 'I never want those days back again. It is sufficient for me to read my old diaries to recall the Mauerkrankheit - Wall sickness - and the melancholy we had.' What is it about unification that is so unsettling for the east Germans? 'It's partly a kind of resentment. People have lost their equilibrium. Their self-confidence. Maybe that is why many voted in the last federal election for the PDS (the successor to East Germany's former Communist party). Deep down, it is a sort of inferiority complex. Injecting money is no substitute for overcoming the psychological problems.' What sort of psychological problems? 'Everything was got rid of so quickly. There was no transition period. The whole establishment of the society had been changed, and to a much greater degree than in West Germany after 1945.' Was it the speed with which the West German system was imposed on east Germany which has contributed to this disequilibrium? 'Here in east Germany, everything had to be refurbished in order to conform to the bureaucratic prescription of the west. I think part of this process represented the inferiority of the west Germans. The first thing they did was to implant western conditions here. You felt they were uneasy if things did not look like what they were accustomed to. The furniture. The towels. Everything western had to be transplanted on the east. It was like a Gummi tree being transplanted in a botanical garden.' Jens Reich sat very still. 'It is our fault. You defend your culture or you simply imitate.' He looked at his desk, packed high with papers, documents, books and forms. What do you feel personally about unification? 'Believe me. I do not want the old system back. I am a winner. My wife is a winner. My children are winners. I feel free now. But that is not the panacea for happiness. I am free in my work. To decide the budget. How I will allocate it. To pursue particular lines of research. I have to be responsible for my life and the future.' How has this sense of responsibility changed you? 'In some ways I often deplore the loss of Knappheit (scarcity, or shortages). I now have a lot of books. But I don't have the time to read. Ten years ago a western magazine kept us happy and busy for a whole weekend. I remember what a gift it was when someone came with a new edition of some philosopher. What a feast]' Reich added that the book would be shared with friends and would be discussed for days. 'In those days, there was a scarcity of intellectual supply. With hindsight, that is something which I now value. It made me hungry. It made me read with wide open eyes. Of course the shortages were terrible. But now I read without an appetite. My appointments diary is full. I have an impulse to throw it away and hide myself and not answer any more calls. Simply to re-establish some equilibrium. Do you know what I mean?' He stared out of the window. 'There is so much to be done besides ending this dis-unification. We must oppose the tendency towards resignation.' Is Chancellor Kohl prepared to address these issues of the disunited Germany? 'Look at the recent election campaign. Not a word was said about the future. It was kept out of the campaign. The decisions that have to be made were quite happily forgotten. They were pushed aside. These were the first signs of a reunited Germany: not to take up the burden of responsibility; not to ask about our national interests as a united Germany and our place in the world; not to address the huge potential for instability in the east, our neighbours.' Reich looked at the time. 'I have to go to another meeting,' he said. He put on his dark grey woollen jacket. It seemed to add to his burden of responsibility. 'We had the chance to build socialism. But we gambled it away.' Egon Krenz, East Germany's last ruling Communist party leader was sitting on his terrace in Pankow, east Berlin, once home to East Germany's Communist elite. The terrace faced out on to a large, lush, green garden. Now aged 57, Krenz had spent all his life in the Communist party. For years he had been groomed for the top party post by the late Erich Honecker. His chance came on October 18 1989, two days after 100,000 people demonstrated in Leipzig to demand reforms and a free East Germany. But the immense pressure from the East German people proved too much for Krenz and the Communists. He resigned just seven weeks later on December 3, joined by the entire politburo and central committee. 'We had a dream. To build something different from capitalism.' Do you have regrets about how you treated people? 'Look what unification has done. The settling of accounts of East Germany's past has been so total. The East German intellectuals have been totally decapitated. East Germany was a country. It was our fatherland.' Do you not have any responsibility or guilt for the way in which the Communists ran the country? 'Of course we made mistakes. But that's not the point. I believed in the idealism. Look, I am not nostalgic for the past.' Krenz took out his old identity card of the former German Democratic Republic. On one of the worn pages was an instruction stating that he was entitled to access to a special party hospital in case of illness. 'This ID card is only valid until the end of the year. I still have my DDR driving licence. Look, I know German unification is a reality. I am not a man that struggles with a windmill.' He paused to allow the noise of a low-flying aircraft pass over. 'About this belief that I held. I thank the Russians for my life. I was seven years old when the Russians came to Germany. I had typhus. My mother was alone. She could not work. She was sick as well. We had to flee to Kolberg, near the Ostsee, which is now in Poland. The Russians saved us. I make no excuses for what I did for my homeland'. What do you do now? 'I ended my political life in the beginning of December 1989. Since then I have been forbidden from working in the public sector. I cannot teach. I am under pressure. The federal property office wants to take away my house which I legally bought in 1989. I travel a bit. I am now a private person. In early 1990, I worked for an estate agency, then in a finance office. But not for long. I have found some work in a special commission looking at east German history. I rely on my friends for support'. It had started to rain. He put his DDR papers back into his short, brown leather jacket. The waiting room was full of people. But they were all silent. An assistant came in from time to time to summon a client. It was like waiting to visit the dentist. Lothar de Maiziere's office was large and comfortable. Situated in east Berlin, a short walk from the bustle of the big train station on Friedrichstrasse, de Maiziere had started up his private law practice soon after he was forced to resign as East Germany's last prime minister when it was discovered he had informed for the Stasi, the east German secret police. He had become the first non-communist prime minister of East Germany after the first free elections in April 1990. 'I had one hope during those days,' he said, speaking softly. 'I hoped that we would have a united German team participating in the Barcelona Olympics in 1992.' His hopes, however, have since faded into disappointment, and some confusion about the pace and methods of unification. 'Please don't misunderstand me. Our economy under the Communist system was so unproductive, the materials so awful. I knew what a catastrophic situation we were in by the end of the 1980s. But despite unification, there are enormous differences still existing between east and west Germany.' What sort of differences? He started to smoke. 'Over the past 40 years, two different cultures evolved in East and West Germany. Take language. We speak German differently. The west Germans have practically forgotten their grammar. They hardly use the genitive case, or the adverb any more.' He paused to light another cigarette. 'But it's more than that. The eastern and western parts of Germany were always different. The west was catholic, and more open-minded to the Romantic tradition. The east was Protestant and sober. Look at the red brick Gothic architecture which you find in the east but not in the west.' How has the past 40 years accentuated those differences? 'During those years, we experienced, heard, and read different things. The easterners were exposed to art which was concrete and realistic and Slav influenced. We read Solzhenitsyn and Akmatova (the Russian writers) and listened to Shostakovich and Penderecki. The West Germans looked westwards, hugely influenced by the US. There is such a large gap in our cultural experiences. The west opposed communism and the east opposed capitalism. And now we are trying to get together again.' And are the two Germanys coming together? 'Inner unity does not exist. It's the way they (the west Germans) talk to us. The way they treat our past. My God] You would think we never ate with a knife and fork before the Wende ('change', the name given to the collapse of the Berlin Wall). The big mistake was that the Wessis (westerners) did not have to make any psychological compromises after unification. The establishment made no effort to integrate the intellectuals and old functionaries. One of the other negative things about unification is the bureaucracy. It's worse than the times under the Communists. But the west Germans told us: 'Do things like us and everything will be fine.' What about you, personally? They found out about your Stasi past. What had you done? 'I was a defence lawyer in the DDR. I was involved in many political cases. We had to speak to the authorities. I did not know that everything would be recorded. In 1991, the Bundestag (Germany's lower house) passed a law in which every (east German) lawyer had to be vetted. They spent a year vetting me.' What did you feel when they found out about your past? 'I was helpless.' An assistant came in. She said there was a client waiting. 'I had been a member of the Liberal Democratic Party Germany,' said Hans-Werner Bohm, Hannelore's husband. The LDPG was a 'block party' sanctioned by the ruling Communist party. 'After fighting on the front during the war I finally returned from Russia in 1949 to Gorlitz. I was 25 years old at the time. I trained as an engineer and worked in a private Handwerk, a small workshop belonging to my uncle. But in 1972, the Communists banned the remainder of the private sector.' After German unification, the Free Democrats, the junior partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats, took over the LDPG. 'I remember it well,' said Bohm. 'I got this letter from Otto Graf Lambsdorff (a senior member of the FDP), welcoming me into the party even though I had never been asked if I wanted to join. And then he said I should pay DM15. They just assumed I would join. I refused. It was their attitude. The arrogance. The way they took us easterners for granted.' During last October's federal elections, the Bohms both voted for the PDS. 'The PDS speaks out for us. They represent our voice. They do not say the past 40 years have been wasted or worthless. But don't misunderstand us. We are both retired. We are well-off. We do not want the old days back. There are many good things about unification,' said Bohm. 'And the tide. We eventually saw the ebb and flow,' said Hannelore Bohm. It was in July 1992. At Amrum, an island in the North Sea. The weather was very hot. It was the speed at which the tide turned which was so surprising. It was really beautiful to see.'</p>

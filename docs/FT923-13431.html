			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Letter: Government as an employer showing signs of confusion Sir, In 'Top public pay rises cut to 4 per cent' (July 10), the focus is on the immediate consequences of the rebuff of the Top Salaries Review Body recommendations, but the longer term significance of the government's decision may be of greater importance. The scale of the reductions and the decision to stage over several years is not minor tinkering. So the 'signal' being sent out might this week embrace the 120,000 police officers whose September 1 1992 pay rise under the Edmund-Davies formula is triggered by the figures on the increase in average earnings in May 1992 which are published on July 16 and are expected to show a rise of 6.5 per cent. Also, early in 1993, the review bodies on teachers, nurses, doctors and armed forces will recommend pay rises for 1.5m other public servants for the financial year 1993-94 and because they use backward looking comparisons, average earnings figures of 6 per cent or more in 1992 will be a factor in what they decide. So cutbacks here are likely too. But it was only last year that the government set up the Teachers' Pay Review Body, and, indeed, on the same day as they cut top pay, they announced an independent review of dental remuneration. So while the government has sent out a clear signal on its responsibilities for 'managing the economy', confusion is beginning to develop on how it intends in future to discharge its responsibilities as the single largest employer. If the present arrangements are an anachronism, they need replacing with something more appropriate. Chris Trinder, research director, Public Finance Foundation, 3 Robert Street, London WC2N 6BH</p>

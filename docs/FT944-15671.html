			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (19): Fierce competition in Swedish market - Prices tumble for international and long-distance calls / Pressures in Sweden's liberalised telecoms sector are intensifying as large international players enter the fray Sweden vies with New Zealand for the title of the world's most liberalised telecoms market, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Having for many years had a de facto state-owned monopoly operating in an unregulated environment, it has moved rapidly to establish a light regulatory framework designed to promote open and fair competition. The results have been striking. Despite the relatively small size of the country - Sweden's population is just 8.7m - some of the world's biggest telecommunications groups, including AT&amp;T , British Telecom and France Telecom, have entered the market. Moreover a number of new competitors have sprung up, led by Tele2, jointly owned by Swedish media group Kinnevik and Cable &amp; Wireless. It means that Telia, the dominant operator, is being challenged as never before - 'Telia faces fierce competition on customer premises equipment, data communications services, cellular services, international calls, national long distance calls and infrastructure,' says Stig-Arne Larsson, Telia's deputy chief executive. Indeed, local calls and Sweden's analog NMT mobile network are two of the few domains where Telia still has a 100 per cent market share. The competition has brought a fall in international and long-distance prices in a country where they already low by international standards. But there has not been a full-blown price war and the effect on Telia's profits has so far been limited. What is clear is that pressures in the domestic market are intensifying. In just 18 months, Tele 2 has bagged more than 10 per cent of the international calls market, and from this autumn it will offer domestic long-distance services. Moreover, Telia has lost international calls and data transmission business to overseas rivals. It was more than a little dismayed when StatTel, a state procurement body, passed over it to award a prestigious data transmission contract to France Telecom. The biggest challenge may yet be to come. BT has just announced a partnership agreement with Telia's Scandinavian rivals - Norwegian Telecom, Telecom Finland and Tele Danmark - as part of a specific drive to win business in the Swedish market. Telia purports not to be alarmed by the increasing pressures, saying it expects to lose up to 40 per cent of international calls and 25 per cent of long-distance traffic in the next two years. Losing more than this would test Telia's patience, however, which may force it to be much more aggressive on pricing than it has been so far. 'Being the market leader, we cannot stage a head-on price war. We would destroy the market and ruin our company,' comments Mr Larsson, while acknowledging it would be politically insensitive if the group went out to destroy the competition before it has fully developed. Telia has responded to the onslaught in a number of ways: Firstly, it has implemented a fierce cost-cutting programme, reducing staff numbers from 48,000 to 32,000 in three years. Secondly, it has begun differentiating its products more, offering customers tailor-made packages to meet their needs. Finally, it has gone on the offensive both at home - where it is actively building its position in mobile telephones, for example - and in markets outside Sweden. There are two strands to the overseas expansion strategy. One is to retaliate directly against competitors in their own home markets. A good example is the UK where Telia has been awarded a licence for international calls and has set up a switch in London. The trouble here is that access to most other European markets is restricted. The second plank of attack is Unisource, a venture with Swiss, Dutch and Spanish partners which is specifically designed to provide the international clout which the four companies lack individually. The grouping has forged a joint venture with AT&amp;T for the delivery of voice services to 50 multinationals. Telia says it can share costs through Unisource while defending its home market (because multinationals can be offered one-stop shopping and a broader global reach) and capturing market share in other European countries. Again, the last ambition will have to await a broader deregulation of the European market. Some worry that Telia is still too dominant, claiming the newly-established regulatory body, the National Post &amp; Telecom Agency, is not trying actively enough to promote competition. Underlying this is a broader concern about conflicts of interest when there is state-owned agency regulating a fully state-owned company. Jerker Torngren, the NPTA's Head of International Affairs, does not see it this way. He says: 'What we want to create is competition. We are not saying we need a certain division of market share to create that competition.' He also rebuts the conflict of interest suggestion, saying that in Sweden there is a very strict dividing line between the government ministries which draft legislation and the agencies which implement it - 'it is the government which owns Telia, not us,' he stresses, adding that there are no policy implications in the fact that Telia is state-owned. Another concern is that the agency lacks the teeth to enforce its decisions. For example, in the current row between Telia and Tele2 concerning long-distance interconnection rights, the agency can act as a mediator, but it cannot force the warring parties to abide by its findings. This is a weakness which could always be ironed out in due course. There were always likely to be some teething troubles given the dramatic change being implemented and the fact that much of the legislation governing the sector only took effect on July 1, 1993. In any case, there is a competition authority to fall back on, as its powers are more than adequate to deal with any clear abuse by Telia of its dominant position. The one surprise is that Telia, though behaving in virtually every respect like a private company, is still state-owned. This may change in due course. There is no doubt that management is keen on privatisation: the incoming Social Democratic government is much more ambigious about the process. Even so, the Social Democrats have hinted they may not oppose privatisation if they think it will help the group's international expansion ambitions.</p>

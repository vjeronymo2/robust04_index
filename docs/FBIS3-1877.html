Garten, visiting deputy U.S. Secretary of Commerce,  here this morning at a press conference upon conclusion of his  Beijing visit.    Garten, together with a delegation of officials from the  U.S.  Department of Commerce and State Department, came to Beijing as  a part of his Asian trip aimed at boosting U.S. export-promotion  efforts to the "big emerging markets", including China and  Indonesia.    Garten said he had discussed current trade issues with  officials of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Co-Operation (MOFTEC).    "The talks have been cordial, business-like and productive,"  he said. The United States and China have agreed on the agenda  for the upcoming meeting of the bilateral Joint Committee of  Commerce and Trade (JCCT) in mid-April in Washington.    "We would like to turn it into a major form of co-operation  with China," Garten said.    He noted that during the meeting both sides will talk about  trade and investment; individual industries, including  information, energy, environmental technologies and chemicals;  and economic reforms.    He said that exchanges of opinions on each other's economic  reforms will enhance mutual understandings of differences.    Garten said one of the purposes of his present trip was to  demonstrate the increasing U.S. commitment to Asia. And no  matter what happens, he added, the U.S. and China, two of the  world's major economies, will continue to engage in the global  economy.</p>

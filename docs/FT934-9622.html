			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Venezuelan rights undermined HUMAN rights violations have increased in Venezuela since 1989 to such an extent that they call into question the government's commitment to protect them, the London-based Amnesty Internat-ional says in a report published today, writes Stephen Fidler. Security forces have 'often responded with excessive and arbitrary force' to demonstrations protesting against worsening economic conditions. Two military coup attempts last year led to a suspension of certain rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and peaceful demonstration. Journalists have increasingly been harassed, attacked and even murdered by the security forces. Criminal suspects, particularly in poor areas, are routinely tortured. Trial proceedings are constantly and arbitrarily delayed, often far beyond legal limits. Meanwhile, those who violate human rights escape unpunished, the report says.</p>

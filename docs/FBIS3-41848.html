			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 28  December on the significance of UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's recent visit to Pyongyang on the nuclear issue.    The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean on page 3  carries a 1,000-word editorial entitled ``Butrus-Ghali and  Dissolution of the UN Command.''    Noting the ineffective result of his visit to Pyongyang on  the North Korean nuclear issue, the editorial reported: ``We  hope UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, who has been to the  North and South, will pay special attention to future  North-South relations, including the nuclear issue, and consider  those involved in his approach to the settlement of the issue.  Kim Il-song, a North Korean man of absolute power, is  decisively important in resolving the nuclear issue. Many  figures who have met Kim Il-song said, however, that he was not  likely to be well aware of the seriousness of the nuclear issue.  Therefore, it is important to inform Kim Il- song of the  seriousness of the nuclear issue. This can be effective when he  has a heart-to-heart talk with Kim Il-song.'' Referring to the  importance of the UN secretary general's role in the settlement  of the nuclear issue and the need for his frequent visits to  North Korea to achieve this, the editorial reported: ``We paid  attention to his remarks that the UN Command will be dissolved  if peace is achieved on the Korean peninsula. We expect peace  to be achieved on the Korean peninsula so there will not be a  need for the UN Command. The UN Forces exist as a last resort to  prevent events that run counter to peace from taking place.''    The moderate Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean carries on page 3 a  800-word editorial entitled ``The Result of UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali's Visit to North Korea.'' Referring to North  Korea's refusal of UN mediation in the settlement of the nuclear  issue, the editorial stressed that ``President Kim Il-song  clearly said there is no need for the United Nations to mediate  the nuclear issue because North Korean-U.S. negotiations are now  under way.'' Noting North Korea's intention to directly hold  negotiations with the United States regarding the nuclear issue,  the editorial reported: ``It is the ROK that is directly  threatened by North Korean nuclear development. Nevertheless,  North Korea wants to only hold direct talks with the United  States with the intention of establishing diplomatic  relations.'' Noting UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's  proposal for the replacement of the armistice agreement with a  peace treaty in peacetime on the Korean peninsula, the editorial  reported: ``For a long time, North Korea has been calling on  the United States to replace the armistice agreement with a  peace treaty, but the North and South have differences as  parties to the conclusion of the peace treaty. The North and  South must be parties to the conclusion of the peace treaty.''  The editorial urges North Korea to show a positive attitude  toward the international climate for the settlement of the  nuclear issue.    The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on page 3  carries a 1,000-word editorial entitled ``The North Korean  Nuclear Issue--Can We Get Through This Crisis?'' The editorial  refers to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's visit to North  Korea as an occasion to ``get through'' the nuclear issue  crisis, reporting that ``in his meeting with Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali on 25 December, North Korean President Kim Il-song  assessed that there are positive signs in the ongoing North  Korean-U.S. negotiations.'' The editorial urges South Korea to  persuade North Korea to clearly dissolve the suspicion regarding  its nuclear development.</p>

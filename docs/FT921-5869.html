			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Observer: Over-breeding The proposed Scottish parliament is growing at a grotesque rate. Under proposals discussed by the Scottish Constitutional Convention on Friday, the Edinburgh parliament could have as many as 194 members. Add in the 72 MPs who the Scots intend to keep at Westminster and the Scottish MP could become almost as common as the Scottish CA. Futhermore, under the plan, each MP in Edinburgh will have an office, secretarial facilities, at least one researcher paid for by the parliament, a computer hotline to government offices and access to a library staffed with researchers and replete with 'the latest computer technology.' The MPs will also have office space in their constituencies, and child care and day care facilities in the parliament. One can understand why Scotland's politicians are getting so enthusiastic. But not surprisingly the question of financing a Scottish parliament is causing problems.</p>

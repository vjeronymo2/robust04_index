			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Fatter and ready for market / A look at the flotation plans of Yorkshire Food YORKSHIRE Food Group, which has expanded rapidly by buying ingredients businesses from Berisford International, will be floated on the market this spring. The Bradford-based business was founded by Mr Mike Firth, 46, the chairman and chief executive. In 1991 Yorkshire, backed by institutions, paid Pounds 11m for Scotia Haven Foods, Berisford's loss-making dried fruit business, and last year bought Treehouse Farms, Berisford's Californian almond processor, for Dollars 9.96m (Pounds 6.6m). These acquisitions boosted Yorkshire's turnover from Pounds 15m in 1990 to more than Pounds 60m last year. Operating profits have grown from Pounds 664,000 to more than Pounds 3.5m. The group is expected to have a market value of about Pounds 35m. A forceful Yorkshireman, Mr Firth and his team transformed Scotia Haven's pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.29m in the year before acquisition to a profit of Pounds 900,000 by squeezing working capital. Stock values were reduced from more than Pounds 6m to Pounds 1.5m by the end of 1991, so outside warehousing totalling 70,000 sq ft was no longer required at the plant near Warrington, Cheshire. Stock control was integrated with the production, buying and sales functions, and improved credit controls helped cash management. Permanent staff kept their jobs, but 80 fewer seasonal workers were employed and nine senior managers were replaced by three from Yorkshire Foods. However, Yorkshire is not just in the business of trimming costs. Treehouse incurred a loss of Dollars 743,000 in the year before it was acquired, but the new owners brought it back into profit by substantially increasing the company's purchase of nuts - almost all of which were sold by Christmas. Mr Firth believes that the same management disciplines can be applied to other parts of the food industry, and Yorkshire intends to make further substantial acquisitions. He said: 'It comes down to ambition - I believe we have a management team which is capable of running a much bigger company.' Mr Firth, who studied physics at Bradford University, established his own packaging business in 1974 with a Pounds 3,000 bank loan after he quit as a production manager with Mars. He said: 'Mars offered me promotion, but I'd always wanted to run my own business and did not want to get used to a fat salary.' After packaging toys and games, in 1979 he established Normanton Foods, near Leeds, which packs sugar, mainly for Sainsbury. It later expanded into direct purchasing of raw materials for packing and selling to retail chains. In 1983 Mr Firth bought the stock of Hunni Foods, a commodity packer of nuts and pulses from the receiver for Pounds 25,000 - and then sold it for Pounds 40,000. Hunni brought an additional range of products, a label and a modest customer base, which by 1985 extended to Wm Morrison Supermarkets. Mr Firth relishes the cut and thrust of the commercial fray. He recalls an early attempt to drive him out of business by a major competitor, which offered to supply Morrison at practically cost price. Morrison allowed him to keep the reduced-rate business, but Mr Firth obtained a copy of the competitor's rock-bottom bid, and delighted in faxing it to buyers of all the leading supermarket chains. Mr Firth said: 'The whole affair cost me about Pounds 150,000, but it must have cost them Pounds 1.5m. I've never enjoyed myself so much.' Yorkshire has two beverage subsidiaries near Halifax - Freshroast Coffee, which roasts and packs beans, and Coffee Mac, which offers an extensive range of beverage dispensing machines. Although the businesses account for only about 4 per cent of the enlarged group's sales, they enjoy high margins and the group intends to build Coffee Mac, which currently has 500 machines installed, into a national chain. The group has enjoyed more mixed fortunes with its two baking subsidiaries, Forshaws (Confectioners) and Crossfield, which supply pies to retailers and caterers. Last year the daily delivered confectionery business and bakery business was closed because of the high levels of investment needed in an extremely competitive market. Crossfield has won important contracts, such as supplying part-baked frozen pies, which have a distinctive 'home-made look' to EuroDisney in France. Baking represents only 2.5 per cent of group sales, but Mr Firth is determined to learn more about the bakery business - which he estimates is worth more than Pounds 3bn annually. However, there is no doubt that Yorkshire's main focus will be on relatively large food processing and packaging operations, where the management's tight controls have most scope for finding cost-savings and greater efficiency. Mr Firth said: 'It is easier to make savings with big numbers. You also spend the same time on a Pounds 40m deal as you do on a Pounds 4m one.' The group, which will have gearing of about 30 per cent after the flotation, is likely to make a fairly rapid move in the UK. Longer-term, Mr Firth likes the West Coast of the US, and believes the size of the domestic market there means many American businesses do not fully appreciate export opportunities. Yorkshire will come to the market through a placing sponsored by stockbrokers Panmure Gordon. It is being advised by National Westminster Bank. The group has been backed by Murray Johnstone's venture capital arm and Phildrew Ventures.</p>

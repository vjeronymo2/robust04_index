[passage  omitted]    Last year was one in which we, guided by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, emancipated our  minds, invigorated our spirits, and seized the opportunities to  win victories in in-depth reform, economic construction, and  social undertakings. It was also a year in which a major step  was taken toward the goal of establishing a socialist market  economy set at the 14th National Party Congress. Like the rest  of the country, Anhui witnessed an unprecedentedly good  situation in reform, opening up, and modernization. The  province enjoyed political stability and social progress. Its  economy continued to develop with a strong momentum. Its  overall economic strength improved notably. It was a year of  unprecedented growth in Anhui's history. Its gross output value  reached 94 billion yuan, an increase of 22 percent over the  previous year, giving Anhui the third highest growth rate in the  country. Its total industrial output value was 140.2 billion  yuan, a 44.6 percent increase. Of the total industrial output  value, industries at and above the township level produced 94.9  billion yuan, an increase of 26 percent, seventh in the nation.  Its agricultural output value totaled 41.7 billion yuan, an  increase of 8.5 percent, fifth in the nation. Large increases  were also reported in revenues, export, and peasants' per capita  income, all of which had not seen rapid growth in previous  years. Revenues rose 32.8 percent to 7.32 billion yuan; exports  grew 16 percent to $964 million; and peasants' per capita net  income was up 26.3 percent to 724.5 yuan. In step with economic  growth, the province also made substantive progress in  enterprise, rural, and other reforms and opened itself wider to  the outside world. It also made major progress in party  building, spiritual civilization, and other social undertakings.  [passage omitted]    The year 1994 is critical to China's efforts to accelerate  modernization and build a socialist market economy. It is also  vital to Anhui's development. For the province, the task of  achieving a fairly comfortable standard of living and basically  establishing a socialist market economic structure by the end of  this century is extremely arduous. To accomplish this arduous  task, we must work hard not only to raise the major economic  norms but also to improve our overall strength; to ensure not  only higher quality but also higher efficiency than the previous  year; and to seek not only faster economic growth but also  comprehensive social progress. To achieve this, in the new year  we must use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as a  guide to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 10th  Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial CPC  Committee, further emancipate our minds, and seize opportunities  to actively but prudently press ahead with reform; constantly  seek to open ourselves wider to the outside world; correctly  handle well the relationship between reform, development, and  stability and between material and spiritual civilizations; and  elevate our work in all fields to a higher level. [passage  omitted]    Comrades, friends: Building a modern socialist country with  special Chinese characteristics is our magnificent goal. Our  future is bright, even though our tasks are arduous. Let us  rally more closely around the party Central Committee, with  Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, work with one heart and one  mind in a pioneering and enterprising spirit for China's and  Anhui's revitalization!    In conclusion, I wish you and your family happy New Year and  good health!</p>

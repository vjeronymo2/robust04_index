			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- Brigades of workers from  various Cuban state agencies engaged today in arduous relief  operations in Guantanamo and Santiago de Cuba after heavy rains  caused considerable damage in these eastern provinces.    Both Guantanamo and Santiago de Cuba suffered considerable  damage in such areas as agriculture, housing, roads,  communications, and electric power generation because of the  excess water and mudslides. The latter were the result of  torrential rains that lasted several days.    According to reports by a special ministerial commission  assigned by the government to promote the resumption of services  and to assist the victims, Guantanamo has been the hardest-hit  of the two provinces.    In Guantanamo, the roads suffered considerable damage, with  some 3,000 km of highways and roads affected. As for the  installations that supply potable water to the population,  several aqueducts were destroyed and another 12 are presenting  problems.    Over 100,000 people currently lack a regular water supply  and  this prompted, together with urgent efforts to reestablish it,  the Health Ministry to decree a special epidemic prevention  program and to increase the allowance of medicines and personal  hygiene articles to people.    As for Santiago de Cuba, the work focused mainly on facing  flood-related losses in nearly 1,500 hectares of sugarcane  plantations, and facilitating the resumption of the sugarcane  harvest, already in its last phase.    Efforts have also targeted thousands of hectares of  vegetable  crops, which were totally or partially flooded because of the  heavy rains, hundreds of kilometers of roads destroyed, and  nearly 5,000 houses wrecked.</p>

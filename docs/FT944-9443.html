			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Berlusconi faces huge aid bill for flood damage: Costs may be underestimated The Berlusconi government is searching for ways to find some L7,000bn (Dollars 4.6bn) in additional aid to cover the damage caused by last week's catastrophic flooding in northern Italy. As an immediate response, the right-wing coalition pledged L3,000bn drawn from existing funds. But the final assessment of flood damage in Piedmont is expected this week and initial estimates of more than L10,000bn worth of damage could prove conservative. With very limited personal and corporate insurance cover, especially in the agricultural sector, among the worst affected, individuals, companies and local authorities are looking to the government for financial help. Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister who has taken charge of the relief operation, has done nothing to dispel the impression that the government will foot the bill. Indeed, the government seems more than ready to do this to offset growing criticism over the authorities' handling of the disaster. The cost of previous disasters, such as the 1980 Irpinia earthquake in southern Italy, were financed by increasing taxes on petrol or tobacco. But this could prove inflationary and the government may well opt to issue a special bond or introduce a once-off income tax payment. More than 700 towns and villages were hit by the floods which began on November 5 in the tributaries of the River Po. Many are still without fresh water supplies although minimal road communications have been restored throughout Piedmont. This has enabled about half of the 10,000 people displaced by the floods to return to their homes. As the clearing-up operation continues, attention has shifted to establishing how the authorities were caught seemingly unawares by the floods. Magistrates in Turin, Alessandria and Asti have opened separate investigations; and Mr Mario Palmieri, the prefect of Asti, is being investigated for culpable homicide for his failure to prevent death from the floods. At the same time magistrates are looking into the activities and management of Italy's civil protection agency, which is in charge of preventing natural disasters. The magistrates are trying in particular to establish why a fax sent at 16.30 on Thursday November 3 from the Piedmont service for the prevention of environmental risks was ignored. This fax was marked urgent, warned that exceptionally heavy rainfall was forecast for Saturday November 5 and accurately identified the areas at risk. The warning was sent to the regional authorities, but was either ignored or played down. In one instance it was buried under a pile of letters for five days. It is even more remarkable that in spite of the fact that the floods took more than 24 hours to reach populated centres such as Asti and Alessandria, none of the big towns were properly prepared.</p>

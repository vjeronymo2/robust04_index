			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Victor Smart report: "Europe's Big Yes to the Union But No </F> to a Federal Future"]    [Text] Voters retain a widespread faith in the European  Union [EU] but resolutely oppose the idea that its destiny lies  in becoming a federal United States of Europe, an exclusive  pan-European opinion survey for The European reveals.    Only 18 percent of Europe's 255 million citizens would vote  in a referendum to quit the Union, the poll shows. Yet 49  percent of voters oppose "a United States of Europe with a  federal government." Just 32 percent are in favour, and there  are substantial majorities against federalism in eight of the 12  EU member countries.    The result of the far-reaching poll, conducted by MORI  [Market and Opinion Research International], will come as a  significant boost to the clutch of parties fighting next month's  European Parliament elections on an anti-Maastricht ticket.    Until recently, the vision of a federal Europe has been an  article of faith among main-stream politicians across much of  the continent. Now, eight months after ratification of the  Maastricht Treaty, the findings suggest that the public is in a  more questioning frame of mind.    According to the poll, across the 12 EU states 70 percent of  people would vote to maintain membership of the Union. Even in  Britain, the home of Euro-scepticism, only just over one-third  of voters would back withdrawal.    But, according to MORI, the appeal of full-blooded  federalism  is now confined to Greece, Italy and Belgium -- the latter  itself a federal country, where backing is highest at 58 percent.    In Spain, traditionally viewed as one of the most ardently  European nations, opinion is almost evenly split.    In France and Germany, in spite of their leaders' unswerving  commitment to the Maastricht blueprint for EU integration, the  electorates are also firmly resistant.    In Germany, supporters of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's avowd aim  to build a United States of Europe are outnumbered almost three  to one.    Predictably, some of the most ferocious opposition comes  from  sovereignty-conscious Denmark and Britain. In both countries  around 70 percent of voters are hostile to federalism. But more  significant as a trend may be the high level of opposition in  the Netherlands, one of the founder-members of the then EEC,  which has traditionally looked to Brussels to fight the corner  of small countries. According to the survey, only 21 percent of  the Dutch support a United States of Europe, compared with 73  percent against.    With the Germans about to begin a bold new federal  initiative  when they assume the EU presidency at the beginning of July, the  findings are bound to be used as ammunition in the increasingly  bitter battle over Europe's institutional future. Rows are  already erupting over the agenda for the Inter-governmental  Conference (IGC) in 1996, which is expected to quicken the pace  of federalism.    Although anti-federalist politicians are still in a  minority,  the poll shows that their views have the support of a  surprisingly large proportion of the population. It will be a  further warning to political elites of the dangers of a  high-handed approach to European issues.    Federalists will already be uneasily aware that the  political  landscape of Europe is changing. Antonio Martino, the new  Italian foreign minister in the Berlusconi government, and a  founder-member of the anti-federalist Bruges Group, is expected  to take a cooler approach to European integration than his  predecessors did. In a crucial policy shift, he is set to  assert Italian national interests at the expense of ceding  further powers to Brussels.    The political partnership between Chancellor Kohl and  Spain's  prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, could be abruptly terminated.  Gonzalez is under increasing pressure to resign as a result of  growing corruption scandals in Spain. The right-wing opposition  leader, Jose Maria Aznar, who may well succeed him, is less  fervent and idealistic about Europe.    For this ambitious Europe-wide survey, MORI and associate  pollsters in the 12 EU nations interviewed 7,300 adults over 18  years old, undertaking the fieldwork between 10 and 30 April.    In terms of the future political make-up of the European  Parliament, the poll puts the Socialists and the Centre-Right  European People's Party level-pegging on 34 percent. The  European People's Party is an umbrella grouping of Christian  Democrats, the British Conservatives, the French UDF and  Gauliists, and possibly the new right-wing Italian groupings.    This neck-and-neck voting result would make the Socialists  the biggest single party, owing to the character of European  electoral systems. The Left would emerge with roughly 40 seats  more than the European People's Party, yet would lack an overall  majority. The final political line-up will ultimately hinge on  how right-wing parties align themselves after the June election.</p>

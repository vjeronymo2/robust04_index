			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / German ban on beef dismissed European Union health ministers yesterday dismissed German attempts to impose a ban on UK beef exports. Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, replied by threatening to seek a unilateral ban from his government, but his support has yet to be tested. He had sought a ban on exports of live cattle and beef from the UK, arguing that bovine spongiform encephalopathy - 'mad cow disease' - could enter the food chain. Brussels made clear once more that it would take legal action if Germany attempted to impose a unilateral ban.</p>

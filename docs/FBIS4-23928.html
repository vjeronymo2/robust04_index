The UNITA chairman  met with UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye.  However, the contents of the meeting are not known. At the end  of the meeting, which lasted more than four hours, the UN  official addressed the Huambo residents who welcomed him  joyously. Our correspondent Lourenco Bento reports from Huambo:    His excellency Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, chairman of UNITA  and supreme commander of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of  Angola, has reiterated his party's wish to continue negotiating  for peace. Addressing thousands of Huambo residents on the  afternoon of 18 June at the end of his meeting with the special  representative of the UN secretary general, Dr. Jonas Malheiro  Savimbi said a true peace representing freedom and dignity was  necessary. In an allusion to what is delaying the advent of  peace and reconciliation of Angolans, the leader of the largest  democratic opposition party in Angola stated that whenever UNITA  attempted to achieve peace, the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola [MPLA] responded with war.    After noting the need for unity and trust among the people,  Dr. Savimbi addressed a message of faith and hope to Angolans,  quote, the difficult days can never be eternal, there will be a  way out, the day when we shall be happy will come, the time will  come when the MPLA will accept that it cannot govern this  country without UNITA, unquote.    Meanwhile, the senior UNITA leader stressed the need for  cooperation between his party and the MPLA for peace to prevail  in Angola. Dr. Savimbi stressed that the MPLA must understand  that for peace to prevail in the country, for us all to leave as  free citizens, it is necessary that MPLA cooperate with UNITA,  and no one can ignore this.    In turn, the UN secretary general's envoy, who held a  meeting  with the UNITA leadership for more than four hours, addressed  the Huambo residents after the meeting.</p>

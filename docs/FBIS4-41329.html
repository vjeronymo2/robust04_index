			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovski] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- The Russian foreign ministry  knows nothing about possible Israeli proposals to Syria with the  aim of finding a possible way out of the now suspended  Israeli-Syrian peace talks, that is how Aleksandr Shein, a  responsible official of the Near East and Africa department,  commented upon the latest statements made by Israeli leaders on  this issue, during a telephone talk with ITAR-TASS.    On Wednesday Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said  that  certain quite interesting proposals have been made to the  Syrians, in case they are accepted by Damascus, a breakthrough  can be made in the Arab-Israeli negotiations within the peace  process framework. The minister, however, did neither clarify  the essence of those proposals nor named the channels through  which they would be conveyed to the Syrian capital.    Nikolay Tikhomirov, deputy director of the Near East and  Africa department, in this context noted Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin's statement, who had said at a meeting with  activists of international zionist movement in Jerusalem on  Wednesday that Israel is not prepared to pay such a high  "territorial price" for peace, which it paid during talks with  Egypt, returning Cairo the whole occupied Sinai peninsula.  Syria's position at the talks with Israel is well-known,  Tikhomirov emphasised. Damascus is for an unconditional  exchange of territory for peace. In other words, for  compeletely returning the occupied Golan Heights and  establishing peace between the two countries within the  framework of a comprehensive settlement. It follows from the  Syrian leadership's statements that they won't go in for  anything less than this.</p>

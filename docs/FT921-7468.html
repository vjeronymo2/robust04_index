			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / W Midlands engineers doubt recovery prospects THERE are no signs of an impending recovery from recession, West Midlands engineering employers warned yesterday. Mr John Owen, retiring president of the region's Engineers Employers' Federation, said that the local engineering industry 'has experienced perhaps its worst recession ever'. The federation's annual report for 1991 said: 'For many companies manufacturing output has stabilised at a very low and unacceptable level.' With more than 1,000 members, the EEF West Midlands represents the largest concentration of engineering companies in the UK and its collective performance is a barometer of national trends. 'Four out of 10 (companies) continue to report a deterioration in their business trends; and only one out of 10 reports an improving trend or more buoyant circumstances,' reported Mr Owen. This experience mirrors the national economy: government figures have shown that the decline in output during 1991 was the steepest since 1931. It is also a renewed pressure on the government, as it prepares a pre-election Budget, for some stimulus to the domestic economy. 'Expectations for recovery extend into the second half of 1992; confidence is low and employment prospects are not good,' Mr Owen said. The West Midlands Enterprise Board said yesterday that, in the region as a whole, 35 people are chasing every available job against a national average of 27. In the urban areas of Birmingham, the Black Country, Solihull and Coventry more than 40 people are chasing each job. It reported 11,655 redundancies over the past six months. Limited employment prospects have also led to a fall in the level of wage settlements. The EEF West Midlands reported that the average increase in 1991 was 6.4 per cent, compared with 7.6 per cent in 1990. Although the EEF West Midlands remains worried about levels of productivity  -'the UK still lags behind world competition' - independent analysts are sanguine about the medium-term future. The enterprise board, although ruling out any immediate prospect of a strong economic recovery, believes that 'prospects for engineering may be better than those for much of the rest of the economy'. It cited the export potential of new Japanese car plants which, it said, would create a demand for components. West Midlands industry is strongly dependent on the fluctuating fortunes of the motor industry.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Yeltsin twists and turns risk support: Manoeuvring by Russian president damages himself RUSSIA'S President Boris Yeltsin is expected to pronounce today on what he plans to do now that parliament has challenged his planned appeal to the people and his intention to rule by decree. He has come out of his bitter conflict with the Congress of People's Deputies in at best an ambiguous position. Indeed, he has wounded himself as much as he has been hurt by his opponents. In seeking both to confront the parliament and to make a deal with it, Mr Yeltsin and his advisers have risked losing the support of the country's radicals - support which may be critical when it comes to campaigning for a pro-Yeltsin vote in a referendum or in future elections. Much of the damage occurred on Saturday night and Sunday morning. It was late in the Saturday session of the parliament when Mr Yeltsin took the microphone and, in a speech which prompted his opponents to accuse him of drunkenness and his supporters to explain that he was tired and grief-stricken after the death of his mother, he appeared to beg for reconciliation, offering a week of talks between himself, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister. The next morning, Mr Yeltsin confirmed from his position perched above Mr Khasbulatov that he would immediately drop his idea for a referendum if the parliament voted for a compromise resolution to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in November. This was opposed: but the damage to his veracity was considerable. Mr Yeltsin had fulfilled the publicly-stated fears of some of the radical democrats, led by Mr Yuri Afanasiev, the historian, before the parliament met. In a statement, Mr Afanasiev and his colleagues said that while they continued to support the president, they feared he would use his principled position on a referendum as a 'bargaining chip' in yet another bad compromise with the parliament. These fears, after the president's proffered compromise, were picked up and amplified (to the large rally in his support which gathered beside St Basil's Cathedral outside the Kremlin walls) by Mrs Elena Bonner, widow of the late Andrei Sakharov, who was the first to speak. 'The president's speech (the previous evening) made me bitterly disappointed,' she said. 'I have, do and will support the president, but he must be our president. I wanted him to say: we must continue the economic reforms; I wanted him to say: we will go by the voice of the people, we will have a referendum, and we won't allow any compromises.' It was for these reasons that Mr Khasbulatov, who himself survived a challenge to his post, was at least partly right when yesterday he claimed triumph after four days of an ebb and flow of political fortunes.</p>

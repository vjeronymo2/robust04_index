			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOLERANCE OF UCLA DEVELOPMENT URGED  </P> <P> As a longtime resident of Westwood and a UCLA graduate, I have followed with  interest the articles concerning planned development of the UCLA campus and  reactions from the community, which at times have been hostile. I would like to  urge a fairer, more balanced view.  </P> <P> UCLA by any standard has made tremendous strides and has developed into one of  the finest academic institutions in the world. Its contributions to Los Angeles  are incalculable. I applaud UCLA for its achievements and continued  contributions to the intellectual and cultural life of Los Angeles. I  congratulate their athletic teams for their accomplishments and for the  enjoyment provided to their fans. Recognition must also be given to the  important role provided by the UCLA Medical Center.  </P> <P> Any vital organization must be permitted to grow with the growth of our  community and must be permitted to adjust with the changes in our society.  Accordingly, I urge tolerance for reasonable construction growth and  development at UCLA in recognition of the tremendous value and benefit Los  Angeles receives through UCLA's existence.  </P> <P> FRANKLIN R. JOHNSON  </P> <P> Westwood  </P></p>

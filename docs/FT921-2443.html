			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (19): The backbone for a worldwide software solution - Consolidating Accounts THORN EMI, the UK industrial and TV rental conglomerate with subsidiaries all over the world, is faced with a complex task in consolidating accounting information to produce half yearly and year-end figures. The group used to send out spreadsheet-based forms to each company, and received back figures electronically or on disk. The data was then validated, currencies converted and adjusted as necessary. The process was largely automated; however, if any changes were necessary, for example, this could only be achieved by extra programming. The result was potentially error-prone and protracted. The group looked for a packaged solution but failed to find anything sufficiently flexible and powerful - 'we were trying to get our reporting-times down,' says Roy Cater, information systems manager at Thorn EMI. 'We decided that we needed as much flexibility as possible.' A database (DBMS) solution was chosen, so that users could set up their own fields if necessary. Ingres' Knowledge Manager enabled this to be done without losing data integrity. 'We needed a relational DBMS for flexibility, with controls on integrity so that we could let users free on the system and be satisfied that they could not accidently 'harm' themselves.' The user enters via a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Beneath that is the SQL link product which, to quote Roy Cater, 'magically threads data into the spreadsheet.' Data from the Ingres database is brought in, a page at a time, for the user to manipulate. A key criterion of the design was to give the consolidation accountant access to all necessary data, whilst preserving control throughout. 'The system operates like a mill, bringing in data and consolidating it as far as possible as it goes along. The engine is pre-emptive, checking data for validity and progressing as far as it can with what it has.' This ensures rapid results, and an increasingly accurate overall picture until the whole consolidation is completed. The system was successfully used to produce last September's half-yearly figures, and the company is doing the year-end figures with it now. So successful is it that Thorn EMI are now considering marketing the system as a package.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: The Greek Passion - Opera Du Rhin Mulhouse, a quiet town in southern Alsace where the Opera du Rhin has just been presenting Martinu's The Greek Passion, is far from the madding cry of international opera. The theatre, a perfectly-scaled building tucked down a little street off the town centre, was built in 1887 and lovingly restored for its centenary. The town has its own part-time orchestra, and performances tend to be as unpretentious as the audiences. But over the years in this same small theatre, I've heard Alain Vainzo as a stylish Werther, a noble Fidelio with Klaus Konig as Florestan, and the only modern production of Massenet's Griselidis. The fact that Martinu can be successfully played in this French provincial backwater says something not just about local taste and the way it has been educated by the Strasbourg-based Opera du Rhin, but also about the impact of last year's Martinu centenary: surely no composer in the past 15 or 20 years has benefited so much from anniversary exposure. The Greek Passion does not exactly play itself onto the stage, but it has the simple advantage of sincerity and conviction, qualities amply reflected in this staging. It also has just about the most bizarre stylistic mix of any modern opera - bitonality and polyphony, warm lyrical colours juxtaposed with harsh-toned declamation, and a rambling, tumultuous palette of instrumental and choral voices, unpredictably interspersed with solo accordion, piano and church bells. Judging by reactions to last year's concert performance at the Edinburgh Festival, the work needs the stage to make dramatic sense of these incongruities. Rene Terrasson's touring production, conducted with a sure, confident touch by Robert Satanowski, was built on a versatile platform of sun-blenched steps and rocks, designed by Isabel Echarri and Diego Etcheverry. The costumes evoked a contemporary Greek atmosphere, while the ragged appearance of the refugee intruders could not help but bring to mind the current plight of the Kurds and the moral dilemmas they have provoked. And that is surely one of Martinu's prime purposes in this village drama-cum-Easter oratorio: to ask timeless, universal questions about public and personal morality, probing the gap between our earthly and spiritual selves. Tibere Raffalli, as the shepherd Manolios who pays for his goodness with his life, sang with dignity and a warm Mediterranean timbre. Jean-Marie Fremeau, a commanding figure with an equally commanding bass-baritone voice, made a convincing Grigoris, the hypocritical village priest. Chantal Dubarry was a wholly sympathetic Katerina, and Remy Corazza acted the part of the pedlar Yannakos with appealing simplicity. The chorus sounded unexpectedly well-schooled, and Michel Ancey's French translation sang easily. The only quirk of the evening was a brief spoken introduction and epilogue on tape, which - far from detracting from Martinu's original - further illuminated its meaning.</p>

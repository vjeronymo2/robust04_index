			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Observer: Tiger's tail? Has the City, in succumbing to the lure of Oriental expertise in the boardroom, been stealing a march on British industry? Or is it unduly beguiled by eastern promise? London's oldest merchant bank, Barings, has been endeavouring to brush up its global street cred and, in addition to Credit Lyonnais boss Jean Peyrelevade, has now opened its hallowed portals to Yoshihiko Miyauchi, president of Japan's largest leasing company Orix, in a non-executive capacity. Last year Foreign &amp; Colonial put a former ambassador to Britain on the board of one of its Pacific trusts and Barclays has a Japanese banker. Outside the Square Mile there has been little such activity. Deputy chairman Andrew Tuckey says he ran into Miyauchi on his first visit to Japan 25 years ago when he was personal assistant to the chairman of what was then Orient Leasing. As part of the Sanwa Bank group, with which Barings set up a joint venture, the company was a natural port of call for the Brits. Tuckey, who describes a visit to the Orix Blue Wave baseball team as 'a pleasure probably still to come', sees in Miyauchi a man with 'long exposure to western business'. There is no telling yet whether these sorts of relationship can really be put to work. As well as being impressed by his connections in Tokyo, Barings, with its emerging markets ambitions, thinks the new addition can provide 'the Oriental perspective on China and throughout south-east Asia', as Tuckey phrases it. Big area, tall order.</p>

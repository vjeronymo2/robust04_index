			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (7): The debate continues - Privatisation IT is doubtful if Professor Jeffrey Sachs, one of the most ardent proponents of the shock therapy programme which seeks to privatise the economies of the former communist countries in the shortest possible period of time, will be returning to Slovenia in the near future. Prof Sachs, from Harvard University, is one of three professors advising the Russian government on a 'shock transition' to a market economy. His plan for Slovenia, first unveiled to the Slovene parliament in April 1991, involved a massive and speedy privatisation to be centralised and administered by the government. But his programme for Slovenia's privatisation programme deepened the divisions in the government and precipitated the resignation of two of the government's most talented ministers - Mr Joze Mencinger, the deputy prime minister and economics professor at the University of Ljubljana, and Mr Marko Krajnac, the finance minister. Both are now at Slovenia's central bank keeping a tight hold on monetary policy. The two ministers resigned for one main reason. 'We wanted a decentralised system of privatisation which was suited to the Slovene economy,' says Mr Mencinger. 'The idea was that an enterprise could choose from many methods of transformation (towards privatisation) laid down by the law and could even combine them,' he said. 'The government would determine the rules for the privatisation and would monitor it, but would not administer it. Privatisation would be gradual; there would be no free distribution of shares at the beginning of the process and enterprises would be transformed into joint stock, or limited companies, in two years,' he added. In broad terms, the Sachs model, supported by Mr Lozje Peterle, prime minister, Mr Andrej Ocvirk, deputy prime minister, and Mr Igor Umek, minister responsible for privatisation, was in two stages. The first phase involved a distribution of a percentage of the enterprise shares to employees, and to a development fund. Later, shares from the development fund would be transferred to five newly-created investment funds which would be distributed among the citizens of Slovenia. The main thrust behind this plan was to create a model for ownership and a definition of property rights as soon as possible. In common with the rest of the republics of the former Yugoslavia - but not with the countries of eastern Europe - property is socially owned. It is owned neither by the state nor by private individuals, but by the workers. Until recently, however, they had not been free to raise equity by selling this socially-owned property. Thus, both privatisation plans had to determine how best to transfer socially-owned property into private ownership. Should it first be transformed into state-owned property, or should enterprises be given a range of options about how to privatise. The Sachs programme was criticised on the grounds that real ownership would rest in the hands of the state and the politicians. One year later, the Slovene coalition government is still debating a privatisation bill. 'We now have a bill which the government is discussing,' says Mr Igor Umek. 'It is a compromise, taking into account aspects of the two former proposals on privatisation,' said Mr Umek. The current bill envisages that: Up to 20 per cent of the values of the assets will be distributed at a discount to the employees; 20 per cent of the shares will be distributed to the population through mutual funds; 10 per cent of the shares will be earmarked for a retirement fund; 10 per cent of the shares will be placed in a restitution fund (set up to compensate those whose property was confiscated or nationalised by the communists after the Second World War);and The remaining 40 per cent will be sold to foreign or domestic buyers. Despite the political wrangling over new legislation, Slovene enterprises, of whom many are anxious to raise equity, have been able to use the federal government's enterprise law and foreign investment law, both of which were passed in late 1989. The two laws divided ownership into social, co-operative, mixed and private ownership. A federal law on social capital, which was passed in 1989, gave workers' councils the right to sell companies to private owners. The proceeds were paid into a special development fund. Agencies were set up in each republic to assist enterprises in this work. Later, in August 1990, employee buy-outs were allowed through the purchase of 'internal shares' at a discount, but sales of these shares were prohibited on the securities markets. The federal law, although radical, contained several weaknesses. The Slovene government, elected in April 1990, took advantage of the federal legislation and attempted to close the loopholes. An Agency for the Promotion of Economic Restructuring and Transformation of Companies - otherwise known as the Privatisation Agency - and a development fund, were established in December 1990 to supervise the process of privatisation throughout Slovenia. Mr Marko Simoneti, director of the agency, says privatisation is moving apace. 'There are a lot of loopholes with the federal law, but we are closing them. The question now is to decide what should be sold and when the government will embark on a national strategy for the development of the Slovene economy,' he said. Unlike other former communist countries, the agency has not had the opportunity to have wide access to western experts - because their fees are high. And it has not yet had access to the UK's Know-How Fund which was set up in 1990 to provide technical expertise and financial assistance to former communist countries. Despite these drawbacks, Mr Simoneti says the agency is implementing three methods for the privatisation of socially-owned enterprises. These include partial or full acquisition of an enterprise by a foreign company; additional investment of equity capital; and debt-to-equity conversion by the creditor. The agency also advises on establishment of new companies, or equity joint ventures with socially-owned enterprises. 'When we were set up, one of our main tasks was to set up a licensing system for business appraisers in order to provide a solid base for approving privatisation of enterprises on a case-by-case basis,' explained Mr Simoneti. 'This is working well. We are confident that the privatisation process will speed up over the next few months.'</p>

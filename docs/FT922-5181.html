			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Arts: Biko - Opera When the Royal Opera House's 'Garden Venture' went public for the first time in 1989 with six specially commissioned music-theatre pieces, one of the most successful of a strikingly undistinguished bunch was Priti Paintal's Survival Song, to a text by Richard Fawkes. Its portrayal of the events leading up to a necklace killing in a South African township was described then as a study for a full-length opera on the life of Steven Biko, and the Garden Venture has gone on to commission that piece; Biko was unveiled in Birmingham on Friday, directed by Wilfred Judd, artistic director of the Venture, and conducted by Timothy Lole. Paintal evidently learnt about Biko through Richard Attenborough's Cry Freedom, and Fawkes's scenario follows the approximate outline of the first half of that film. It presents Biko among his family, a man of non-violence working for the black community despite constant police surveillance, threats and banning orders; his growing friendship with the journalist Donald Woods and Woods' attempt to intercede on Biko's behalf with the state security minister Kruger, and chronicles the escalating harassment, Biko's arrest, torture and death. The bare historical facts have a tragic trajectory of their own, but they are treated here with almost cartoon-like simplicity. Even the character of Biko is hardly given any perspective, while Woods emerges as a hapless stooge, unaware of the potential brutality of the state. Too much of the dialogue is suffocated by banality - Biko surely did not always discuss his aspirations in such cliches - while the lack of cadence and rhythm creates insuperable problems for Paintal's word setting, which falls back on the infuriating tic of repeating every second or third phrase to add emphasis. Much of the score is slight. The climactic moments of the work - Biko's unaccompanied monologue in the first act, his torture and murder in the second - are never underpinned with the musical intensity they demand, and Paintal's mixture of minimalist washes and Bernstein-like melodic invention consistently seems underpowered. Only briefly, at the beginning of the second part when Woods confronts Kruger at his home, does the music begin to function dramatically; there the dark-hued woodwind solos generate exactly the kind of ambiguity and unease the situation requires. Judd's frugal production does what it can, but it is hard to sustain tension when so much in the music and text appears to be conspiring against it. The playing from the Endymion Ensemble is vivid and alert, and there are some fine performances. Daniel Washington makes Biko a highly moral, stoic figure, and Damon Evans contributes a hyperactive performance as Thomas, the militant who rejects Biko's strategy of non-violence; Hyacinth Nicholls is Biko's wife Ntsiki, Angela Caesar the family friend Miriam. Stephen Richardson's portrayal of Woods seems intentionally shallow and naive, while Gerard Quinn and Stephen Austin are the security police; as Kruger too, Quinn gets a second chance to polish his Afrikaner accent. In the end Biko neither rises to the importance of its subject matter nor leaves the impression of a rounded piece of music theatre even on its own limited dramatic terms. As the first fully ripened fruit from the Garden Venture it is a disappointment; Judd's claim in the programme that the project is now well established as 'the prime mover in developing new opera in the UK' still needs to be taken with a pretty large pinch of salt. Birmingham Repertory Theatre until June 6; Riverside Studios, London, June 10-15</p>

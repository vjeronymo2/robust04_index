			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Canada's air rivals slug it out on ground  -A ruling is imminent on a crucial issue in the battle for supremacy A VICTOR is about to emerge from what could prove to be the decisive battle in a three-year struggle between Canada's two main airlines, Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International. But the battlefield is far removed from normal measures of success or failure, such as operating costs or airport slots. The fight centres on the computer networks used by travel agents to book seats and hotel rooms, and by the airlines themselves to manage their inventory of seats. The quasi-judicial Competition Tribunal in Ottawa concluded hearings last week on an application by Canadian to break its management contract with the Gemini Group, a computerised reservation system owned by Canadian, Air Canada and Covia, a United Airlines subsidiary. Canadian's survival depends on moving its business from Gemini to the rival Sabre system, which is owned by AMR of Dallas, parent company of American Airlines. AMR wants to use Canadian as a guinea pig and a showpiece for building up its business of providing management services to airlines, other transport carriers and hotels. The fight over Gemini in Canada could thus be a taste of things to come in other parts of the world as AMR and other large airline management companies seek out new business. The Dallas-based company has agreed to inject CDollars 246m (Pounds 137m) of new equity into Canadian as part of a financial restructuring. But a condition of the entire deal is that Canadian transfers management of its internal reservations system (known as a 'hosting' contract) to Sabre. AMR would provide not only a computerised reservations system but also a wide range of accounting, catering, planning, flight analysis, and airport office functions. It considers the sale of these services potentially more lucrative than the 33 per cent equity stake it will acquire in Canadian. Canadian, whose parent company, PWA Corp, has recorded losses of CDollars 720m in the past three years, says that it is doomed to bankruptcy without the AMR investment. The Americans have given the airline until the end of the year to withdraw from Gemini and to fulfil two other conditions - the financial restructuring and the necessary regulatory approvals. In the meantime, Canadian will be kept alive by federal and provincial government loan guarantees and equity contributions from its employees. The application to withdraw from Gemini is supported by the Bureau for Competition Policy, Ottawa's anti-trust watchdog, wanting to avoid one airline ending up with a 90 per cent share of domestic scheduled traffic. But Canadian's move is vigorously opposed by Gemini and the other two shareholders, which have accused the airline of trying to push it into bankruptcy. The thrust of Air Canada and Covia's argument is that while an alliance between Canadian Airlines and Sabre might keep competition alive in the skies, it would create a near-monopoly on the ground. They contend that Sabre would have a stranglehold on the computerised reservations market in Canada. While it has a market share of only 30 per cent, compared with Gemini's 65 per cent, loss of the Canadian Airlines hosting contract would cut Gemini's revenues by a fifth. According to a Gemini briefing document, the move would also result in a 'drastic reduction' in its share of the computerised reservations market, especially in Canadian Airlines' stronghold in western Canada. However, these arguments are contested, not only by Canadian but by some of Gemini's biggest customers. Mr Bill McGuire, president of the Alliance of Canadian Travel Agents, said that improvements made to Gemini in 1991 had given it much the same capability as Sabre. Most travel agents would be reluctant to spend time and money learning a new system. Gemini's future has also been cemented by its connections with Galileo International, the reservations system in which both United Airlines and Air Canada are shareholders, and which is Sabre's main rival in other parts of the world. The Competition Tribunal is widely expected to give the green light to Canadian, perhaps with some conditions, thus prolonging the struggle between Air Canada and Canadian for supremacy in the skies. Mr Jack Lawless, a Canadian spokesman, says the carrier most likely to survive in the longer term is the one 'who can bleed the longest'. Air Canada is in a stronger financial position than Canadian, but the latter's costs are 15 per cent lower and Mr Lawless says the services to be provided by AMR will bring them down 'significantly'. In the long run, Air Canada's opposition to Canadian's withdrawal from Gemini may have less to do with survival of a computerised reservations system than with the future shape of the Canadian airline industry.</p>

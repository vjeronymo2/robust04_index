			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Trickery with capital gains The tax reforms of the 1980s did nothing to reduce the muddle that prevails over the taxation of savings in Britain. Yet they did at least bring some sense to the limited area of capital gains. The alignment of capital gains tax with income tax rates removed distortions that arose from the natural desire of taxpayers to transform income into lower-taxed capital; and the introduction of indexation of gains and losses protected investors from a hidden and arbitrary inflation tax. The decision in the Budget to scrap the indexation of capital losses is thus a retrograde step. The manner in which the change is being made has also given rise to justifiable irritation on the part of investors. In a move that has been presented in the budget as a tax avoidance measure, the Treasury is proposing to abolish the indexation of capital losses, while retaining the indexation of capital gains. The change is expected to raise an additional Pounds 300m by 1996-97, which may prove optimistic given that the entire yield from capital gains tax last year was put at a mere Pounds 1bn. The one thing that is clear about this measure is that by removing the indexation of losses, and by doing it for transactions undertaken on or after budget day, the government will in some cases impose real capital gains tax rates of well over 40 per cent. The victims will not just be sophisticated tax avoiders. Ordinary investors, who have been running losses on individual shares in their portfolio on the reasonable assumption that they could be indexed and then off-set against past and future gains on other shares, will be hit. This is little different, in practice, from retrospective legislation. Capital erosion At a stroke, a fully transparent top capital gains tax rate of 40 per cent is being replaced by an opaque and arbitrary rate which will depend on the composition of the taxpayer's portfolio. It will be theoretically possible for investors to suffer losses of real wealth as a result of partial de-indexation; and the risk of such capital erosion will become greater if higher rates of inflation come back. Many taxpayers will also have to re-work calculations of the base cost of their investments, going back to 1985 when the indexation of losses was first introduced. These changes are technical and they affect only a small number of voters. Yet they are symptomatic of the way successive chancellors have abandoned all aspiration to continuity or principle in their approach to taxation. Mr Norman Lamont's introduction of a new 20 per cent income tax rate was a sad retreat from the earlier attempt by Nigel (now Lord) Lawson to simplify the income tax and capital gains tax system. And his misleadingly presented raid on the pension funds was a notably unattractive retreat into fiscal opportunism. It undermined an entirely logical approach to the taxation of pensions. As with an expenditure tax, the tax bill on deferred income is not paid until savings are run down in retirement. Retrospective penalty Mr Kenneth Clarke can claim, not unreasonably, that his priority in his first Budget was to deal with the huge hole in the public finances. Yet it cannot be right to spring technical tax measures on the ordinary taxpayer under the guise of an anti-avoidance measure and in a way that make a nonsense of individuals' assumptions about how they should plan their lives. While it may be difficult to retreat from the principle of partial de-indexation announced in the Budget, Mr Clarke should think again about the retrospective penalty implicit in making the new rules apply from November 30th. Meantime the review of the taxation of savings now being conducted by Mr Stephen Dorrell provides the Treasury with scope to redeem itself on the shape of the tax system. The financial secretary should seize the opportunity to put the case for an expenditure tax on to the policy agenda. Among the many advantages of an expenditure tax is that it works on the basis of cash flow. It thus does not have to confront the impossible task of distinguishing between capital and income. The need to index capital gains disappears. A neat way, in fact, for Mr Clarke to confound the critics who claim that economic sophistication is beyond our Ken.</p>

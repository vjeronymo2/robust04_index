			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Lloyd's controls were inadequate, court told AN American Name yesterday claimed that the Lloyd's authorities should have taken action to avert mismanagement at Oakeley Vaughan Underwriting, and that its regulation of the insurance market had been inadequate. Mr James Stone, a Name, or member, at Lloyd's since 1978, was presenting evidence on the eighth day of the case in which 33 Names are claiming that the failure of the Lloyd's authorities to regulate the market adequately was responsible for their losses of more than Pounds 5m. He said: 'I thought that if something was done that was wrong somebody would ring a bell. They didn't' Mr Stone was particularly heavily committed to the Oakeley Vaughan agency, eventually staking more than Pounds 100,000 of the Pounds 450,000 he wrote at Lloyd's to OV syndicates. Oakeley Vaughan also managed his investments in other Lloyd's syndicates, and Mr Stone developed a close friendship with Mr Charles St George, the chairman of Oakeley Vaughan. Under cross-examination by Mr David Johnson QC, representing Lloyd's, Mr Stone accepted that he had been naive in the way he had organised his affairs at Lloyd's. 'When I joined I didn't go into it in the detail with which I should have. I guess I was unknowledgeable about what I was doing.' Mr Stone was 'under the influence of Mr St George', Mr Johnson said. 'The fact is that you had no knowledge of what powers Lloyd's have over underwriting agents.' Mr Stone had repeatedly ignored warnings from Mr John Hayter, the agent who initially managed his affairs at Lloyd's, about the wisdom of committing money to the Oakeley Vaughan agencies, Mr Johnson said. Mr Stone accepted that when he joined Lloyd's he was putting his affairs in the hands of an underwriting agent, but said he thought 'if there had been something wrong I would have expected to have been told about it. In our country we rely on the integrity of the system, not the broker calling in the stock. I've said this so many times it sounds like a broken record.'</p>

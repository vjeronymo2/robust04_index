			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Bonds: NatWest in Pounds 300m mortgage-backed notes debut THE sterling mortgage-backed market received a significant boost yesterday as National Westminster Bank launched its first issue of mortgage-backed notes. An official at NatWest Capital Markets said that the Pounds 300m issue, which was divided into three tranches, sold out quickly to investors in east Asia, Europe and the UK. The official added that the issue, the largest sterling mortgage-backed deal to date, helped to build up badly-needed liquidity in this market. Of the three tranches, the Pounds 150m worth of Class A2 notes proved the most popular with investors. They were attracted by the notes' relatively long average life of 5.08 years and the 40 basis-point spread over the three-month sterling London interbank offered rate (Libor). When these notes were freed to trade, they traded at a small premium to their re-offer price of par. By contrast, the spread on the Pounds 144m worth of Class A1 notes of 20 basis points over Libor was thought to be too tight. These notes, which have an average life of 1.83 years, traded around their par issue price in the afternoon. Commenting on the issue, Mr Richard Goeltz, NatWest's group chief financial officer, said: 'Securitisation is increasingly being used by banks to manage balance sheets and enhance profitability.' Other UK clearing banks are expected to follow NatWest's lead. Barclays Bank, the first UK clearing bank to tap this sector with a Pounds 175m issue in 1989, is likely to launch a mortgage-backed issue of between Pounds 250m and Pounds 300m before the end of the year. Barclays is also expected to launch an asset-backed issue of a similar size next week. The issue will be backed by consumer loans and the notes will have an average life of one to two years. In the D-Mark sector, Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten (BNG), the Dutch bank which funds local authorities, raised DM1bn through an issue of 15-year Eurobonds. BNG is only the second issuer to launch a D-Mark offering with a 15-year maturity. LKB Baden Wurttemberg Finance opened up this area of the D-Mark yield curve in late August with a DM1bn offering, which was increased by DM500m in September. The pricing of 15-year D-Mark Eurobonds is hindered by the lack of a German government bond benchmark with this maturity, and issuers are expected to monitor closely the performance of these two issues before deciding whether to follow suit. At launch, LKB's bonds were priced to yield 36 basis points over the 6 1/2 per cent German government bond due 2003, but the spread has widened to around 42 basis points. BNG's bonds were priced to yield 47 basis points over the corresponding German government bond, but this was widely thought to be too tight. Traders said the spread widened to around 50 basis points by the late afternoon. An official at the lead manager Trinkhaus und Burkhardt said that the bonds were bought by retail investors in the Benelux countries. Elsewhere, the Republic of Argentina, encouraged by the success of its recent D-Mark Eurobond issue, is planning to launch a dollar global bond issue by December. Merrill Lynch is believed to have won the mandate.</p>

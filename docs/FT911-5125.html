			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Cail values shares at ADollars 12 in bid rejection COAL AND Allied Industries, the Australian coal group, has predicted earnings of ADollars 55.2m (USDollars 43m) for the year ending June 1990 and values its shares at ADollars 12 a share in its formal rejection of the ADollars 7.85 a share takeover offer from CRA, the resources group. In their formal response to the CRA offer, which values Cail at ADollars 437m, the directors claimed that shareholders speaking for 52 per cent of the company's capital had indicated they would not accept the bid. These shareholders include three major customers of Cail's export coal: Ube Industries, Nissho Iwai Corporation and Joban Kosan Company, all of Japan. The rejection by the Cail board puts pressure on CRA to increase its offer if it is to be seen as a serious bidder. This is CRA's second attempt to take control of Cail, Australia's third largest coal mining group. It made an unsuccessful bid in 1979. CRA may also be forced to lift its offer because most of the institutions which picked up the 37 per cent of Cail sold into the market last year by shipping and resources group Howard Smith paid more than ADollars 9 a share. Cail shares closed 4 cents lower yesterday at ADollars 8.26 after briefly hitting ADollars 8.36 on the release of the board's recommendation. Although CRA is known mostly for its iron ore and base metals interests, it is also a significant coal mining business.</p>

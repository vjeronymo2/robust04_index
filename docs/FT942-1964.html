			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Hosokawa denies he lied to parliament Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's former prime minister, yesterday denied that he had lied to parliament over a loan repayment and share purchase. Mr Hosokawa dismissed as 'insulting' his summons before a parliament committee yesterday by the two main opposition groups, the Liberal Democratic party and Social Democratic party. They summoned Mr Hosokawa in an attempt to embarrass the present minority government, a preliminary to a possible vote of no-confidence. Leaders of both opposition groups want to vote the coalition out of office after the budget clears parliament, possibly on Thursday, and before the parliamentary session ends on June 29. However, they have yet to get the support of a significant section of their own ranks, who want to continue negotiating to join the coalition rather than rush into a parliamentary showdown. LDP-inspired allegations that a Y100m (Pounds 636,000) personal loan to Mr Hosokawa in 1982 from Sagawa Kyubin, a gangster-linked trucking group, was an illicit political donation, prompted his resignation in April, after just eight months in power. Mr Hosokawa was also questioned yesterday on claims that he had tried to cover up the purchase of shares in NTT, the privatised telecommunications company. He again denied wrong-doing. The ruling coalition initially resisted the summons on the grounds that there was no consensus to interrogate Mr Hosokawa before parliament. But its changed its mind for fear of being accused of seeking a cover-up, a possible pretext for a no confidence vote.</p>

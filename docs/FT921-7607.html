			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Sweden poised to overhaul share ownership FOREIGNERS should be entitled to acquire as many shares as they like in Swedish companies from January 1 next year, it was proposed yesterday by the state's company law committee. The Swedish government is expected to endorse the recommendation and abolish the current legal restrictions created by the dual system of free and restricted shares, which prevents foreigners from being able to purchase all or part of the shares in companies. The proposed change is likely to pass through parliament during the autumn. It will come into force at the start of 1993 with the creation of the free internal market between the European Community and the European Free Trade Association. At present, an estimated 70 per cent of the shares traded in Stockholm are restricted. Clauses which restrict certain shares to Swedes are contained in the by-laws of more than an estimated 220,000 joint stock companies in Sweden. The company law committee said in its report to the government that 'many people question whether it is consistent with the national interest to shield Sweden from other countries. Instead, there is a widespread belief that greater mobility of goods, services, people and capital create the prerequisite for economic growth and greater prosperity'. As a result, it added: 'It seems important to stimulate an interest among foreigners to make investments in Sweden.' The report emphasises that the change must be made because the existing restricted share system is incompatible with the rules laid down by the European Community's Treaty of Rome and the new 19-nation European Economic Area between the EC and European Free Trade Association, which is supposed to come into force next January. The committee suggested there should be no exceptions to its proposal to abolish restricted shares, and free shares should also apply to companies in the Swedish defence industry. The proposed change, when it is implemented, will mean a profound break with past practice. Legal restrictions on foreigners wishing to acquire ownership of Swedish companies and property date back into the 18th century, though the laws only really became codified in their present form in 1916. They were updated 10 years ago. However, Sweden is not moving to a system of one share, one vote. The present system, which differentiates between voting shares and non-voting equity, will continue until the EC itself has agreed on comprehensive company legislation. Many large companies will continue to be owned by Swedish institutions and families like the Wallenbergs through their dominant control of the voting shares. In a further sweeping measure of liberalisation, the Swedish government is expected to announce today proposals to de-monopolise the Stockholm bourse and allow competition in Sweden share trading. This suggestion has already aroused public criticism from Mr Bengt Ryden, the head of the stock market, who has said it could have an adverse effect on the Swedish stock market.</p>

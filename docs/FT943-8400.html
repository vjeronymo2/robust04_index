			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Newsprint buyers set to resist price rise Champion International, the Connecticut-based forestry group, has caught North American publishers off-guard by announcing its third newsprint price increase this year. Buyers indicated that they would vigorously resist the latest increase. Low newsprint prices played a significant part in cushioning publishers from the full impact of the 1991-93 recession, and few have budgeted for another increase this year. Champion's move, which takes the form of a 5 per cent cut in discounts on the Dollars 685 per tonne list price effective from December 1, is expected to be followed shortly by other US and Canadian producers. One industry expert said that some Canadian companies were considering even bigger increases. The latest discount cut would bring newsprint prices to Dollars 534.3 a tonne, compared with less than Dollars 420 at the beginning of this year. Champion started implementing its previous 6 per cent discount cut earlier this week. 'Our sense is that demand worldwide is increasing,' Champion said yesterday. According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, US newsprint consumption rose by 2.4 per cent in the first half of 1994, and consumer inventories were 24 per cent lower at the end of June than a year earlier. Demand outside North America has been even stronger. Canadian exports to overseas markets, mainly the UK and east Asia, soared by 44 per cent in June. Pulp and paper prices have turned round much faster than most market-watchers expected. The latest newsprint increase will coincide with the peak pre-Christmas consumption period. Furthermore, there could be a scramble for supplies if labour-contract talks under way at British Columbia's pulp and paper mills break down, leading to a strike.</p>

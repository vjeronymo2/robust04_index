			<p>BFN     [Text] The commander of defense forces, General Robert  Mboma, has cautioned the Tanzania people's defense forces not to  allow tribalism to infiltrate the Army. He sounded the warning  in Mwanza town today while addressing commanders and servicemen  of the defense forces in Mwanza region. Gen. Mboma said that if  tribalism was allowed to infiltrate the Army it would create  much havoc, as was currently the case in neighboring Rwanda  where brother was fighting brother, each with the aim of  eliminating the tribe of the other.    He said the Tanzanian nation was built on a foundation of  unity and our Army embraced all the tribes of Tanzania, so  anyone attempting to incite tribalism in the Army must be  condemned.    Elaborating on the issue of tribalism, Gen. Mboma said that  a  good example was Ngara District which had a population of  170,000 people but had now been invaded by over 350,000 Rwandan  refugees who had fled the ethnic fighting in their country. He  said he had never witnessed people killing each other so  mercilessly as was now happening in Rwanda.</p>

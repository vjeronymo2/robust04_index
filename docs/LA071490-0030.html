			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPH SEIZURE  </P> <P> I read with shock and anger the July 5 account of the grand jury investigation  of San Francisco photographer Jock Sturges ("Photo Lab Sets Off FBI Probe").  That the police can forcibly enter the home of a citizen, search and seize his  possessions including his means of livelihood and then hold them for months  without so much as filing charges is a chilling thought.  </P> <P> That this power has now been used against an artist over an opinion of what  constitutes pornography is outrageous.  </P> <P> KENNETH FOWLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

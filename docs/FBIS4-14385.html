			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>   [Text] There were strong verbal exchanges among senior PLO  officials during last week's Fatah Movement meeting in Tunis.  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat chaired the meeting.    AL-BILAD learned that Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', head of  the PLO Economic Department and head of the Palestinian  delegation to the Paris economic talks with Israel, lost his  temper after a flare up over differences with Fatah Central  Committee member Hani al- Hasan, who protested against  Abu-'Ala's hasty verbal presentation of a report during the  meeting. After al-Hasan's protest, Quray' openly threatened to  not go back to Paris. He tore up the file of the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, an indication that he is  abandoning his pursuit of this issue.    An argument immediately erupted between Fatah Central  Committee members Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, and Hakam  Bal'awi. According to AL-BILAD's information, during the heated  discussion, Hani al-Hasan said the head of the Israeli  delegation briefed the Israelis in a televised seminar about the  proceedings of the Paris negotiations, explaining the economic  and political gains the Israeli side has achieved, especially on  the subject of Palestinian currency, part of which will be kept  in the Israeli Central Bank's reserves.    Al-Hasan said: This is a very serious issue that cannot be  discussed in this way. All the provisions of the economic  agreement should be laid down on the table and distributed so  the members of Fatah Central Committee can closely examine them.    The sources said another strong verbal exchange occurred  during the meeting when al-Hasan said the pro-Labor Party group  within the Palestinian revolution leadership had implicated  President 'Arafat in affairs in which the Fatah Movement should  not have been involved.    According to AL-BILAD sources, Fatah is expected to hold  another meeting when 'Arafat concludes his current tours.</p>

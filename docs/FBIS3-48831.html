			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Hun Sen reaffirmed that the  Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] will strive to restore  security and political stability in the country and to elevate  Cambodia's image in the international arena. This is aimed at  stimulating foreign investors' confidence. He stated this at an  audience granted to Mr. Gibson Phillip Henry, extraordinary and  plenipotentiary ambassador of New Zealand to Cambodia, at the  Council of Ministers office on the morning of 27 January.    At the meeting, his excellency the second prime minister  made  three requests for assistance from the New Zealand Government.  First, he asked the government to provide general vocational  training for the Khmer Royal Armed Forces' troops; second,  supply necessary materials for the training; and third, develop  Cambodia [words indistinct]. If New Zealand agrees to help  develop Cambodia, it is requested that Cambodian soldiers are  hired as workers. This is to give them jobs and so they may  earn their living.    H.E. Hun Sen also requested that New Zealand provide the RGC  with materials, mosquito nets, blankets, and medicine which will  be given to Khmer Rouge soldiers rallying to the RGC. The royal  government will not ask for armaments or ammunition, he  emphasized.    With regard to the Khmer Rouge problem, H.E. Hun Sen  reaffirmed that the RGC at all times leaves open the possibility  for them to join in national reconstruction and achieve national  unification. This is, however, possible only if they fulfill  the five points of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman.  On the contrary, they have continued to attack the RGC and  people and refuse to recognize the legal royal government.    Before concluding, H.E. Hun Sen profoundly thanked the New  Zealand troops, who had taken part in the elections and mine  clearance in Cambodia. New Zealand continues to assist Cambodia  in the demining operation in its capacity as a state in the same  region.    For his part, Mr. Phillip reaffirmed to H.E. Hun Sen that  New  Zealand is always ready to cooperate in rehabilitating,  rebuilding, and redeveloping Cambodia. New Zealand, he added,  is willing to help restore Cambodia and is prepared to share  weal and woe with the country. Currently, New Zealand is  striving to promote cooperation in the development of the two  countries.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Officials may face public hearings in the autumn Westminster councillors could be required to face public hearings in the autumn following the critical report from the district auditor. After four years of investigation, yesterday's statement was a heavily edited version of the auditor's report of his provisional findings. There will be at least several more months before a final version of the report is released. Mr John Magill, the district auditor from accountants Touche Ross, has invited anyone in the council, those mentioned in his report or the original objectors who triggered his investigation, to submit written responses by July 29. He asked anyone wanting to make oral representations to him on his findings and views to make a request in writing by February 28. He must then decide on grounds of 'justice or the public interest' whether to hold an oral hearing and if so whether to hold it in public or private. He said that an a hearing the onus would be on the objectors who raised the original complaint with him to prove any allegations made. The process would be similar to a court hearing, with opportunities for cross examination and the submission of evidence. Only after any hearing would Mr Magill decide whether to use his powers under the 1982 Local Government Finance Act. If he concluded any action was lawful but implemented with reckless indifference, he could surcharge officers without reference to a court. If he believed the action was unlawful, he could seek a declaration from the court to this effect. The court has the power to impose surcharges and disqualify for a period those responsible from being a member of the local authority. Touche Ross said yesterday that anyone criticised in the report could seek judicial review on its procedures and findings, but that in the past the High Court had ruled that any complaint should wait until the final report. At this point, there is a statutory right of appeal. The Westminster report, which has so far cost an estimated Pounds 1m, is one of a number of special investigations triggered each year by complaints or issues raised during the annual scrutiny conducted by district auditors. Last year there were 31 objections lodged and 14 final 'public interest' reports published. Many others were rejected.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CITY OF WESTMINSTER: THE TORY TARGETS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ward                      Majority*         Designated sales of                      1986         1990       council houses                                                Jul 87-Sep 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Bayswater       Con 360      Con 438            190 2 Cavendish       Con  82      Con 522             47 3 Churchill**     Lab 232      Con 408            116 4 Little Venice   Lab 102      Con 419             44 5 Maida Vale      Lab 563      Con 126             66 6 Millbank        Lab 311      Lab 190            254 7 St James        Con 161      Con 348             50 8 Victoria        Con 267      Con 569              0 9 West End***     Ind  48      Con 464              0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Majority = difference between highest placed candidates of each party All majorities Con over Lab or Lab over Con except **Over SDP/Lib ***Over Con  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Westminster Council  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

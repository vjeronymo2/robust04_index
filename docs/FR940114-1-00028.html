			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 15_Police Traffic Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current Police Traffic Service Guideline No. 15 emphasizes the use of police patrols to enforce traffic laws, improve traffic flow, prevent crashes, aid the injured, document each crash, supervise cleanup, and restore traffic flow. The guideline provides minimum standards by which a police department can measure its quality in traffic services, and suggests uniform training procedures, as well as standardized records and reporting systems. The guideline also addresses selective assignment of personnel and coordination with other agencies and neighboring jurisdictions and recommends in-service training for police personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proliferation of highway safety legislation in recent years, such as tougher DWI laws, child restraint and seat belt use laws, and commercial motor vehicle safety laws, combined with an increased demand for other law enforcement services, has placed a strain on police agencies during a time of reduced budgets, manpower and resources. The proposed Guideline No. 15 assists law enforcement agencies by addressing how to do more with less. Such efforts include developing and participating in comprehensive programs; enlisting support of the media, community leaders, business and volunteer/activist groups; developing resource management plans; and training officers in state-of-the-art enforcement curricula.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Guidelines Remain Unchanged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following 12 guidelines currently contained in &sect;1204 will remain intact and unchanged by this proposal:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Guideline No. 1&blank;Periodic Motor Vehicle Inspection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guideline No. 2&blank;Motor Vehicle Registration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guideline No. 4&blank;Driver Education <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guideline No. 5&blank;Driver Licensing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guideline No. 6&blank;Codes and Laws  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guideline No. 7&blank;Traffic Courts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guideline No. 9&blank;Identification and Surveillance of Accident Locations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guideline No. 12&blank;Highway Design, Construction, and Maintenance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guideline No. 13&blank;Traffic Engineering Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guideline No. 16&blank;Debris Hazard Control and Cleanup <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guideline No. 17&blank;Pupil Transportation Safety (Rev. 4/91) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guideline No. 18&blank;Accident Investigation and Reporting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It should be noted that the guidelines are not binding on the States.

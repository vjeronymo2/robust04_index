			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL UNMOVED BY PLEA FOR FOOT PATROLS  </P> <P> Community activists failed on Monday in a second attempt to revive support for  the $2.5-million police foot patrol program vetoed by Los Angeles Mayor Tom  Bradley 10 days ago.  </P> <P> "I'm 38 years old and I feel highly threatened," Beverly Christianson, a  Koreatown resident, said at a meeting of the City Council's Public Safety  Committee. "I feel like a child myself that I have to sit here and plead with  you. . . . I'm real. I'm not a robot. I don't take bullets."  </P> <P> Christianson and two other residents of the Koreatown area who spoke at the  meeting had hoped to persuade the committee to endorse a measure calling for an  override of the mayor's veto.  </P> <P> No formal vote was taken, but Councilman Richard Alatorre said he would  recommend that the veto be upheld by the full council. No date for that vote  has been set.  </P> <P> In his veto, Bradley urged the council to support a $750,000 pilot program to  be funded by surplus police salary funds.  </P> <P> Assistant Police Chief Robert Vernon, who attended the meeting Monday, said the  surplus salary account money has already been earmarked for other police  expenses.  </P></p>

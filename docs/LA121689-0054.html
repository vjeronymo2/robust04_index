			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCORD NEAR IN U.S. SUIT OVER REDISTRICTING  </P> <P> A federal lawsuit seeking to force Los Angeles County supervisors to redraw  their districts appears close to settlement with a plan that places veteran  Supervisor Pete Schabarum in a new, predominantly Latino district.  </P> <P> The U.S. Justice Department said in a letter to the county Friday that the plan  adopted earlier this week by the supervisors could settle the lawsuit with a  few revisions.  </P> <P> "A settlement is at hand if the board is willing to make these adjustments,"  said the letter. The Justice Department called for adding neighborhoods in  Montebello and Pico Rivera with high Latino voter turnouts to the proposed 1st  District to improve the chances of a Latino to win election to the county  board.  </P> <P> A settlement could come as early as Tuesday when attorneys for both sides are  scheduled to meet again in U.S. District Court. The county plan would place  Schabarum in a mostly Latino district extending east of downtown Los Angeles  through much of the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Supervisor Deane Dana, who cast the deciding vote in favor of the plan, could  not be reached for comment on whether he would accept the proposed revisions,  which would appear to preserve his political base. Supervisor Kenneth Hahn's  chief deputy, Mas Fukai, said Friday that he expects a majority of the board to  reach agreement on a plan with the plaintiffs.  </P> <P> In the letter to the county, Steven H. Rosenbaum, deputy chief of the Justice  Department's voting rights section, said: "Our preliminary review of the  redistricting plan leads us to conclude that although it is flawed in some  respects, it could provide the framework for the development of a plan that  would resolve this litigation.  </P> <P> "The plan's most significant positive feature is that it reduces . . .  fragmentation of the Hispanic population core, from the eastern part of the  city of Los Angeles to the San Gabriel Valley, by placing much of that  population in District 1."  </P> <P> However, the Justice Department objected that the county plan leaves out of the  new district portions of heavily Latino Lincoln Heights and Highland Park while  including communities with small Latino populations, such as Covina, Diamond  Bar, Temple City and Whittier.  </P> <P> Any settlement would have to include an agreement on an effective date for a  new plan, said Rosenbaum, who wrote that the Justice Department is "troubled"  by the county's effort to delay an election in the new district until 1992.  Currently, the 1st District seat is up in June.  </P> <P> The supervisors Tuesday are scheduled to vote behind closed doors on whether to  accept the revisions to their plan. Schabarum has called on his GOP allies to  apply pressure on fellow Republican Dana to withdraw his support for the plan.  </P> <P> Trial on the lawsuit has been delayed until Jan. 2 to allow for settlement  talks.  </P> <P> None of the plaintiffs, including the American Civil Liberties Union and  Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, would comment on the case.  </P> <P> The lawsuit accuses supervisors of breaking up the Latino neighborhoods among  three districts.  </P></p>

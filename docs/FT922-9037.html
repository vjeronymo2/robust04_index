			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Mullova's Schoenberg ALTHOUGH THE future for three of London's orchestras has been settled, the outlook for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra remains uncertain: the impression is that it will find a less than warm welcome on the South Bank so long as its concerts are seen to be unadventurous. So there is an irony that its three programmes this month under its Music Director, Vladimir Ashkenazy, include a major Messiaen score, the continuation of its Shostakovich cycle which is being recorded and, on Wednesday, the Violin Concerto by Schoenberg. This last is a rarity in the concert hall. A difficult work in every sense, it is shunned by audiences and violinists in just about equal measure. Its reputation as a heavyweight goes before it. Heard live, however, the concerto is surprisingly light on its feet, the large orchestra used with delicacy, the solo violin never wrestling to make itself heard. No doubt Ashkenazy is a sympathetic accompanist, but then it would be difficult not to give one's best support in this work to a soloist as immaculate as Viktoria Mullova. Where other players may struggle to get the notes, Mullova has no problems. The part is well within her technical limits and she has time to make music from it. This is not to say that her performance was an overtly emotional one, for Mullova is a dispassionate performer, but she became expressive simply by playing supremely well. There was never an ugly sound, but equally there was no striving after prettiness for its own sake. Just pure and beautiful music-making. After the interval Ashkenazy and the RPO returned to give us their familiar interpretation of Sibelius's Second Symphony. The grand lyricism of Ashkenazy in the big romantic symphonies suits this one perfectly, as it does the orchestra. If a move from the South Bank is in prospect, the RPO might ponder that it would not sound as splendid at the Barbican.</p>

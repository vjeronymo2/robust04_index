			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Labour group attacks Venezuela pay decree VENEZUELA'S most important organised labour group, the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV), has attacked a government decree ordering a 15 per cent wage rise. It warned of 'grave consequences' if the decree was implemented. In a public letter to President Carlos Andres Perez at the weekend, the CTV expressed its 'deep disgust and rejection' of the administration's decree. Earlier this year the group demanded a 45 per cent nationwide wage increase, which was rejected by the government as inflationary. But last week the administration decreed a 15 per cent wage rise for private-sector employees not covered by collective labour contracts, and ordered a 50 per cent rise in the urban minimum wage, to Dollars 109 (Pounds 63) a month. The CTV has strongly opposed most of the government's economic reform programme since it was announced in early 1989. Ironically, its leadership is dominated by members of Democratic Action, Mr Perez's own political party. The group's head, Mr Antonio Rios, and other officials are currently under investigation for alleged corruption. In some sectors, labour's militant demands for wage increases are seen as an attempt to divert attention from the allegations. At the same time the government has warned that if 'price speculation' continued on basic items it would reinstate limited price controls.</p>

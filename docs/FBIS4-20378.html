			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Leading article: "By Closely Integrating Scientific and </F> Technological Development, the [Gansu] Provincial Academy of  Agricultural Sciences Accomplished New Achievements"]    [Excerpts] In 1993, the Provincial Academy of Agricultural  Sciences set up 38 rural centers in ecologically different  regions all over the province. Throughout the year, a scientific  and technological personnel of 132 persons was hard at work here  at the forefront of rural work, conducting various experiments,  as also demonstrating and disseminating superior varieties, and  helping in the training of technical personnel from among the  peasants. The area over which such promotion has taken place  this year has been 3.772 million mu, resulting in 194 million kg  of additional grain, with an additional output value of 107.7  million yuan. In 1993, the dissemination, within the province  and outside of the province, of several excellent varieties  developed by the provincial agricultural academy has been  greatly accelerated. Growing the "Long Ya No 7" type "huma"  [5170 7802] flax was promoted over an area of 2.5 million mu;  growing the new "long mi No 4" type of "mizi" [4745 1311] millet  was promoted over an area of 1.22 million mu; spring wheat of  the "long chun 8139" type was promoted over an area of 1.17  million mu; and winter wheat of the "long jian 196" type was  promoted over an area of 1.34 million mu. Altogether these  promotions exceeded one million mu of varieties and resulted  last year in an additional output value of 168 million yuan and  an additional net income of 141 million yuan.    Similar achievements of increased production and increased  income had been accomplished in contractual S&amp;T projects  undertaken by the provincial agricultural academy in 1993. The  project "Demonstration of Techniques for High Yield Grain  Production on 760,000 Mu of Arid Land in Eastern and Southern  Gansu" has resulted, during its four years, in the additional  grain production of 219 million kg of grain and a net income of  156 million yuan. The "Engineering Project for a Good Harvest of  Grain, Edible Oil, Medicinal Herbs in High-Elevation, Shady, and  Marshy Areas" had contracted for 2.07 million mu for the growing  of grain, edible oil, and medicinal herbs and indeed achieved a  bumper harvest over the whole area. In the area where the  "Experimental Research of Vegetable Growing Techniques in High  Efficiency, Energy Saving, Sunlit Green Houses" had been  promoted, the average per mu yield was almost 5,000 kg, and the  income over 10,000 yuan. The project "Promoting a Comprehensive  Technique for the Improvement of the `Mao Xing' Apricots in  Eastern Gansu" had prepared a demonstration field of 610 mu to  produce a superior variety, and this has led to the setting up  of an orchard of 18,000 mu, which was one way of showing the  people in the old liberated area to escape poverty and attain  prosperity.</p>

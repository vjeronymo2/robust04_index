			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SOVIET VIEW OF USING FORCE AS FOREIGN POLICY;  </P> <P> PANAMA: U.S. INTERVENTION SEEMS ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF AMERICAN PROVINCIALISM  -- BELIEF THAT REGIONAL POLICIES CAN BE SEPARATED FROM GLOBAL POLICIES.  </P> <P> The American intervention in Panama has shown once again that traditional  approaches to foreign-policy problems are still in vogue in the United States.  </P> <P> I am not a fan of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, but neither his background nor  methods of leadership can justify U.S. interventionism. It is especially  regretful that the action in Panama is overwhelmingly supported by the U.S.  public -- just as it was six years ago in the case of Grenada. Nations and  peoples do not change their habits very fast. And that is why I would not like  to sound too optimistic about Soviet-American relations by stating that all the  current changes in these relations are already irreversible.  </P> <P> The U.S. intervention seems to be another manifestation of American  provincialism -- belief that the regional policies of the United States can be  separated from its global policies. But this is not possible in our  interdependent world, and the use of force even at such a low level in Central  America will inevitably echo in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere.  </P> <P> For centuries the most reliable, realistic means of assuring national security  was deemed to be stockpiling more arms and achieving military superiority over  potential enemies. But nowadays betting on such superiority is extremely  dangerous and illusory, politically counterproductive and economically ruinous.  </P> <P> If in the past military force was the main instrument of Realpolitik -- and war  was its continuation by other means -- now it has become impossible to achieve  political aims by resort to force in any conflict larger than Grenada or the  Falklands.  </P> <P> In the Soviet view, a shift to consistent realism has implied, among other  things, an understanding that our own interests will not be served by American  difficulties, especially in the regions that are especially sensitive to the  United States. In recent months Americans have begun to think more seriously  about this, particularly in regard to Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> There are few nations in the world other than the Soviet Union and the United  States whose joint and parallel interests outweigh any real causes for  conflict, tension and confrontation between them.  </P> <P> Economically, the Soviet Union and the United States complement rather than  oppose each other. As for ideological differences, I have never thought of them  as an imperative source of divisions and collisions between the two nations.  Ideology may play such a role only at the primitive levels of societal  development, when fanaticism and prejudice get the upper hand. We should not  forget, however, that ideology was frequently used as casus belli for conflicts  and wars to cover up for other much more fundamental and deep-rooted causes.  </P> <P> The idea of "de-ideologizing" international relations and overcoming dogmatic  stereotypes and prejudices in world politics has already been introduced into  official Soviet foreign-policy doctrine and has become a key element of Mikhail  S. Gorbachev's New Thinking. By the same token, it appears that fascination  with ideology and ideological "crusades" is falling out of fashion in the  United States, while pragmatism begins to play a more important role in foreign  policy.  </P> <P> However, as Panama reminds us, there still exists an area of Soviet-American  relations that during the postwar period was a constant and often highly  dangerous source of conflicts and tensions: our positions in controversies and  conflicts that flared up in various regions of the world.  </P> <P> It is on this ground that the worst crises in Soviet-American relations took  place. It is here that the foundations for mutual trust were undermined. But  looking at world politics of the last four years, we see that the number of  arenas for Soviet-American confrontation have dwindled considerably. Humanity  has tired of conflicts, civil wars, extremism of right and left. Ideas of  national reconciliation are gaining momentum in Central America, Afghanistan,  South Africa and Indochina. To my mind, reduction of world tensions is a  natural process closely linked to overcoming the bipolar system of the Cold  War.  </P> <P> By rejecting blind confrontation and "zero-sum game" approaches to  policy-making, by reassessing the need to respond in kind to any action of the  opposite side, we may take a more realistic look at our own interests in this  world and understand them better. Thus we may come to understand that the era  of empires is over, that the cost of maintaining empires is rising while  benefits are diminishing. We may also realize that acute Soviet-American  confrontation creates a situation where both powers may be dragged into local  conflicts even against their will, or where third countries may use these  circumstances in their egotistic interests, creating instances where the tail  wags the dog.  </P> <P> And finally, we may realize that the Third World would rather be neither Soviet  nor American, that it develops for its own sake and in its own interests,  according to its own laws, and any attempts to interfere in this development  and shape it according to the wishes of a great power are usually  counterproductive.  </P> <P> Whatever your attitude, the Cold War is dying, if only because it takes two to  tango -- and the Soviet Union has adopted a firm decision to opt out of this  dangerous and ruinous game. As I told Americans two years ago, we have deprived  the United States of the "enemy." That brings about tremendous overall changes  -- in traditional political perceptions and institutions that try, for example,  to substantiate the rationale of the arms race and of military alliances. A  great many things lose the very foundations of their existence.  </P> <P> However, no one should forget that the Cold War lasted for more than four  decades. Cumbersome structures were erected, huge mechanisms of confrontation  were set in motion. Dismantling these structures and mechanisms and defusing  the time bombs scattered all over the world can be done more efficiently if the  United States and the Soviet Union act together -- of course with the  participation of allies and friends of both countries.  </P> <P> Joint Soviet-American efforts had slowed in this area during the 12 months  before the Malta summit. The summit, with its decisive shift toward common  sense in Soviet-U.S. relations, should give them a new impetus -- particularly  for treaties on strategic and conventional weapons. If the leaders of both  countries are true to their word and their agreement, we may hope that 1990  will go down in history as the Disarmament Year. This would not only mean  overcoming the numerous technical obstacles that diplomats in Geneva and Vienna  are struggling with, but that both sides would support the negotiations by  exercising restraint in military appropriations and programs. In the long run,  these policies are even more important than the agreements -- which only fix  what has already been accomplished.  </P> <P> At Malta, the United States declared in effect that it is ready to terminate  the economic war against the Soviet Union. I hope this important declaration  will soon be interpreted in practical policy and that the new opportunities for  action in many areas will not be missed this time around. Let us also hope that  neither President Bush nor President Gorbachev will yield to pressure and  attacks from their conservative critics. So much depends on this.  </P></p>

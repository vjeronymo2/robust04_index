			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent recovers after Bush illness scare NEWS THAT the US President, Mr George Bush, had been taken ill gave a scare to continental bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS overcame early profit-taking to end better on a late bout of futures-related buying. The CAC 40 index came off the day's low of 1,758.08 to end 6.91 higher at 1,785.64 in heavy volume of FFr3bn after FFr1.8bn. Alcatel recovered from FFr536 to end FFr6 down at FFr548 with 440,160 shares traded as the company denied rumours that it would buy a stake in ITT. Analysts dismissed the rumour as implausible and attributed the share's weakness to arbitrage related to Alcatel's buyout of SEL, its German subsidiary. Another loser yesterday was the water utility and construction company Lyonnaise des Eaux, which fell FFr11 to FFr444 with 272,850 shares traded on fears that it would have to make heavy provisions in its 1991 results for its property development and construction activities. Euro Disney continued to fall on profit-taking after its recent rise, falling FFr4.20 or 2.8 per cent to FFr143.80. Michelin extended its advance, up FFr5.80 or 4.4 per cent to FFr138.80 in heavy trading of 1m shares after a provincial newspaper reported that it was going to open a plant where tyres would be made entirely by robots. The neglected insurance sector showed signs of life, as UAP added FFr19 to FFr505 with 86,900 shares traded. One analyst said there were reports that the insurers were seeking an increase in tariffs. FRANKFURT looked abroad, seeing a drop in Tokyo and London and fearing a setback on Wall Street. London strategists said that Germany's 1.2 per cent gain in November industrial production cloaked general weakness in the economy, that mechanical engineering orders had fallen by 5 per cent in the same month and that renewed weakness was likely in the car industry. Carmakers led again as share prices fell, the DAX index closing 13.72 lower at 1,578.73 after a fall of 5.62 to 643.26 in the FAZ at midsession. Daimler dropped DM12.20 to DM728.80 after a decline of DM13 on Monday and Tuesday. Yesterday Mercedes-Benz, its automotive unit, talked of cutting its workforce by a few thousand people by the mid-1990s as part of a five-year cost-cutting programme. It also expected west German vehicle registrations to fall from around 3.5m in 1991 to between 3m and 3.2m this year. Volume rose from DM3.5bn to DM4.1bn. The day's most dramatic fall came at AMB as the French insurer, AGF, said that it had acquired a blocking 25 per cent minority stake; Banks came under profit-taking pressure, Deutsche Bank losing DM7 at DM672 ahead of the news that it had fired two employees in connection with 'irregularities' in its securities settlement department. ZURICH also saw weakness in banks though industrials were relatively firm. The Credit Suisse index eased 2.2 to 453.5. Sandoz topped the actives list with its bearers SFr20 higher at SFr2,530 on talk of buy orders from US investors; in banks, UBS bearers dropped SFr50 to SFr2,570. MILAN finished mostly higher in quiet trading. The Comit index was not available; turnover was estimated at not more than L60bn after Tuesday's thin L51.1bn. Fiat pulled the market higher as the ordinary shares rose L120 or 2.6 per cent to L4,820, while Generali rose L120 to L28,400, though both stocks eased a little after their official close. Telecoms were steady with both Sip and Stet virtually unchanged, while Sirti rose L115 to L10,800, reportedly on US interest. MADRID took heart from the mid-morning recovery in New York, and the general index closed up 1.70 at 248.38 in turnover steady at around Pta12bn. Repsol rose Pta85 to Pta2,600 after a buy rating in New York from Smith Barney, which looked for 15 per cent earnings growth. STOCKHOLM overcame a weak opening to close fractionally higher. The Affarsvarlden general index ended 0.1 higher at 928.4 in turnover of SKr439m, down from Tuesday's record SKr1.26bn. The construction company Skanska, saw its B shares fall SK5 to SKr130 after news on Tuesday that it had cut its 1991 profit forecast by SKr700m to around SKr1bn because of losses at the Norwegian construction company Selmer. Astra A rose SKr3 to SKr596 in turnover of SKr160m while Ericsson B eased SKr2 to SKr103. AMSTERDAM recovered from the day's lows on Wall Street's early bounce. The CBS Tendency index ended flat at 113.4. The trading company, Hagemeyer, continued to rise in the wake of the company's positive New Year statement, closing Fl 4.50 higher at Fl 131. HELSINKI rose for the third consecutive day with forest product companies among the climbers as the Hex index closed 5.59 higher at 799.62. OSLO complained of lower prices for North Sea oil, and profit-taking as the all-share index fell 6.49, or 1.5 per cent to 424.46. ISTANBUL surged above 4,500 for the first time since late November after strong buying from banks sparked a late rally. The 75-share index jumped some 100 points in the last 10 minutes to close at 4,580.56, up 160.52 or 3.6 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes  Open      10 am   11 am    12 pm    1 pm      2 pm    3 pm      close 1080.54  1080.51  1080.74  1079.97  1079.53  1078.66  1079.90  1080.21               Day's High  1082.50    Day's Low  1077.52                Jan 7     Jan 6     Jan 3    Jan 2     Dec 31               1086.06   1092.05   1087.01  1078.19   1079.41  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Recession takes toll at Scottish &amp; Newcastle FIRST-HALF pre-tax profits from Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewing and leisure group, declined 6 per cent from Pounds 115.7m to Pounds 108.4m as the recession bit deeply in the north of England and Scotland. 'While the continuing low level of consumer confidence, and the consequent reluctance to spend, were more restricted last year to the south, this year they have been much more widespread,' said Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive. 'In terms of fundamental underlying economic conditions, it must be recognised that there has, to date, been no consistent evidence of any significant upturn,' he added. Fully-diluted earnings per share for the six months to November 1 fell from 18.2p to 18p. The interim dividend is raised 4.5 per cent to 5.76p. Taxable profits were hit by a Pounds 3.3m increase in interest charges and a Pounds 2.2m reduction in the surplus on property disposals. At the trading level, group profits were 2 per cent down to Pounds 118.2m on turnover 4 per cent ahead to Pounds 760.7m. A 31 per cent increase in bad debt provisions to Pounds 6.3m contributed to a reduction in beer profits from Pounds 54.2m to Pounds 51m. Turnover rose from Pounds 430.7m to Pounds 445.6m. Volume sales were 0.5 per cent lower against a market fall of about 2 per cent. The performance of the group's premium brands - McEwan's Export, Theakston's and Beck's - all of which achieved volume increases of more than 10 per cent, had 'given cause for considerable satisfaction', said Mr Stewart. Sales to the take-home market were buoyant. Margins improved after a 30 per cent cut in the second half of last year but were still lower than a year ago. Retail profits dropped from Pounds 29.4m to Pounds 28.4m on marginally higher turnover of Pounds 145.4m. Rigorous cost control helped to offset the impact of more difficult trading conditions, and investment continued in the development of the group's pubs. Leisure operations recorded an increase in profits from Pounds 37.1m to Pounds 38.8m on turnover 7 per cent higher at Pounds 169.7m. Center Parcs, with occupancy levels of more than 90 per cent, continued to achieve 'outstanding profit growth'. Bookings strengthened after some early weakness in the Benelux market; and operations in France, where a new centre will be opened next year, consolidated 1991 improvements. However, Pontin's UK earnings fell because of the recession. Occupancies were 13 per cent down and there was a marked dip in bookings after the October announcement of pit closures. Lex, Page 16</p>

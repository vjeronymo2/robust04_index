			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> BROTHERS ENTER PLEAS IN SHIP GROUNDING  </P> <P> Two brothers aboard a ship that rammed a fragile coral reef pleaded innocent in  Miami to federal charges of operating the vessel recklessly and while  intoxicated. A grand jury Wednesday indicted Michael Anthony Bishop, 43, who  was at the helm, and crew member Jerry Alan Bishop, 40. State and federal  investigators say the empty freighter cut a 200-foot swath through a reef. The  Oct. 25 grounding of the 155-foot Alec Owen Maitland off Key Largo was the  first of three groundings in the Florida Keys during a three-week period.  </P></p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Observer: Albert's heavy petting What a gift to headline writers - Albert Reynolds gives up being Taoiseach. If there hasn't been an 'Irish PM goes (back) to the dogs' it will be a miracle. For Reynolds has earned millions by serving up minced animal remains to Irish and British moggies and doggies. Reynolds, who turned 61 on November 3, established his family company, CD Petfoods, in the early 1970s. Now run by his son, Philip, it churns out Maxi catfood and Max dogfood, the latter supposedly named after the Special Branch minder of Charles Haughey, whom Reynolds toppled from the leadership of the Fianna Fail party three years ago. If he gives up politics - a fair bet according to Dublin observers - Reynolds could always dust off his cv, with experience as building site messenger, cabinet polisher and railway ticket clerk. Ballroom dancing has pretty much died in the rave culture, otherwise he could resurrect his Ballroom of Romance company, started in 1958 to enable youngsters to two-step the night away in teetotal harmony. There again, he could always work for his nephew, who runs one of Dublin's premier nightspots, The Pod. But his own choice might be to take up professional crooning, singing his beloved country and western songs. He once appeared on Irish TV dressed in cowboy gear and stetson hat, and has publicly delivered the immortal Jim Reeves number He'll Have To Go. Maybe he could take up astrology?</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Outdoors: Downhiller without a lift - Financial Times Round-the-World Ski Expeditio / Arnie Wilson becomes a social misfit in Australia's biggest cross country ski area Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker have reached Australia and New Zealand as they attempt to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. Door to door, it took us 28 hours to travel from the Chapa Verde ski area, high above the world's largest underground Copper Mine in Chile, to Whakapapa, the biggest ski resort in Australasia, via Easter Island, Tahiti and Auckland. For 4,996 miles we flew economy with LanChile, crossing the date line, and the next 2,544 miles first class with Air New Zealand. At last, instead of smiling politely while Lucy chatted away in Spanish, I could speak the language. Hearing the Kiwi twang made me homesick for London's Earl's Court. It was the first time I had been called 'sir' for months. Now, as freezing New Zealand rain washed the Chilean mud from our skisuits, Ruapehu volcano, was playing hard to get. Or at least hard to see. We knew it was out there somewhere because Dan Underwood, our ski patrol companion kept telling us what a wonderful view we would have had of its lofty, snow encrusted pinnacles - if only we had not been skiing in a wet and windy white-out. Occasionally, for a second or two, we glimpsed one of Ruapehu's many frozen peaks. What had happened to Whakapapa's claims of 'perfect weather'? Finally, after three days, Ruapehu revealed itself in all its glory, sparkling from top to bottom in the noonday sun against a cornflower blue sky. Two other nearby volcanoes - Tongariro and Ngauruhoe - sprang from the mist too. It was the most glorious sight. You could see why this has been christened the Magic Mountain. It is also an active mountain, as are the other volcanoes: notices at the Grand Chateau Hotel have a 'Lahar' warning (an Indonesian word for the torrential flow of water-saturated debris and mud channelled from crater lakes into the valleys during an eruption, which can reach speeds of more than 30mph). The last big mud-slide was in June 1969. In the event of another one, guests are urged to 'proceed calmly to assembly area'. The notice continues: 'Do not attempt to leave the village. Remain calm and wait for all-clear to be given by rescue officials.' North Island is often dismissed by skiers as the poor relation to South Island. This is a myth. South Island has more ski areas, many more mountains and often better snow than the north. But the resorts of Whakapapa and Turoa on either side of Ruapehu (9,175ft) are each bigger than anything in the south. And when they get good snow - as they did during our visit - they are simply the best in Australasia. In 1887, the paramount chief of Ngati Tuwharetoa gifted the top of the volcanoes to the Crown as a national park and by 1913 there were skiers on Ruapehu. The first rope tow at Whakapapa was installed in 1936 - but it broke down after a few hours and never worked again. Such was the build-up of skiers over the years that Turoa was opened 15 years ago to provide another outlet. Whakapapa has everything from Happy Valley, a separate area for beginners, to extreme skiing in the couloirs and chutes off the Pinnacle Traverse on Front Stage (where everyone can see you) and Back Stage (where your faceplants are private). Two towers of rock resembling policemen, called Two Coppers, stand guard at the limit of sensible recreational skiing. Just across from the Two Coppers are two runs not on the trail map: 5150 (the police code for an emergency incident) and Not Drowning Only Waving (inspired by an avalanche which buried four skiers who managed to keep one hand above the snow enabling rescuers to pull them out). There is also an extensive back-country area outside the ski boundary called Black Magic. Turoa's rolling terrain is much more open, with bowls and long, natural gullies, and a vertical drop of 2,360ft (about 150ft more than Whakapapa and the biggest vertical drop in Australasia). The Mangaehuehu Glacier provides challenging off-piste skiing and the really adventurous can climb even higher to the chutes on Girdlestone or even ski down from the crater lake (but check conditions first with the ski patrol . . .). Turoa and Whakapapa are about an hour's drive apart, although it is possible to traverse on skis from one to the other with an instructor. Temperatures were in the high 70s when we arrived in Melbourne, Australia. And our second day produced a surprise. We were driving through a forest of Giant Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) which grow up to 300ft and Lucy was studying the Lake Mountain trail map. At first sight it looked just like any normal map: Snow Gum Trail was a green, Woollybutt a blue, and Jubilee Trail a black. 'But there's no sign of any lifts,' said Lucy. When we arrived, I asked for two lift tickets. 'Well, if you can find a lift, feel free to use it,' said the woman at the ticket office. We had arrived at Australia's biggest cross country ski area. The place was swarming: 3,000 cross country skiers, 1,000 tobogganers, a few Leadbeater's Possum, Broad-toothed Rats, Marsupial Mice, the odd Kookaburra, and us. We had neglected to inform the Victoria tourism department that we were downhill skiers. 'You're not the first downhill skiers to come here by mistake,' said Gillian Pannan in administration. 'When they discover their mistake they sometimes try to ski our cross country trails which infuriates our members, because their skis are too wide and they wreck the track.' We began to feel like social outcasts. 'There is a bit of a them-and-us syndrome between Nordic and downhill skiers,' Pannan admitted. 'Nordic skiers are a bit, you know, greeny . . .' Indeed, their literature demonstrates their environmental concerns: 'Prior to construction of any ski trail, a three-year scientific survey is required to comprehensively cover floral, fauna surveys, water and erosion impact studies, user impact studies, a complete engineering and topographical survey and a survey of drainage patterns, soil type and base strata patterns.' Having heard all this, we hardly dare ask the next question. 'Can we just ski a little in the trees?' we said. 'That would cause chaos,' said Pannan. 'It would upset most of our skiers, and it might encourage the rest of them to join you. But you could go and ski the toboggan run at Berry Higgs playground.' Which is what we did. All 90 vertical feet of it. Arrangements for the visit of Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker to New Zealand were made by the New Zealand Tourism Board, Haymarket, London SWlY 4TQ, tel: 071-973 0360 and Air New Zealand, Elsinore House, 77 Fulham Palace Road, London W6 8JA, tel 081-846 9595. In New Zealand they stayed at the Grand Chateau Hotel at Mt Ruapehu and the Sunbeam Motor Lodge, Ohakune. In Australia, they stayed at the Cumberland Hotel, Marysville, Victoria, about 15 miles from Lake Mountain.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Facts and Figures  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- August statistics  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Miles skied: 283 (Total since January 1: 2,289) Vertical feet: 309,195 (Total: 2,598,805) Vertical miles: 58.5 (Total: 491) Miles driven: 3,173 (Total: 23,355) Miles flown: 9,356 (Total: 59,131) Mileage (all means of transport): 12,812 (Total: 86,968)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Resorts visited so far: 181.

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Management: The Major problem with quiet leadership VISIONARY, charismatic, inspirational, extrovert, relentlessly energetic and assertive, even autocratic and arrogant. That, in a cliche-clad nutshell, is most people's picture of the effective leader, whether in politics, the military, or business. Consider a representative list of such leaders: Churchill, Kennedy, De Gaulle, Thatcher, Montgomery, MacArthur, Alfred Sloan, Jack Welch, Lee Iacocca, John Harvey-Jones, Anita Roddick. But what about Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman? To quote the inimitable Peter Drucker, they were singularly effective yet 'possessed no more charisma than a dead mackerel'. Nor, in the usually accepted sense of the word (charisma, not mackerel), did Abraham Lincoln, Clement Attlee - Britain's first post-war prime minister - or Konrad Adenauer. In our day the same goes, for such manifestly successful and 'transformational' business leaders as Donald Petersen, ex-chairman of worldwide Ford, Geoffrey Whalen of British Peugeot-Talbot, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy of Kingfisher (UK Woolworths) and - arguably - Sir Christopher Hogg of Courtaulds and Reuters. All are shy and at best are average communicators on a public platform. Some are downright grey: the remarkably successful Mulcahy has been dubbed 'Mogadon Man'. Most are keener to listen and consult than to hold forth and believe strongly in team leadership. Which brings us to the unfortunate and accident-prone John Major, Britain's nice prime minister. Over the past fortnight he has been vilified as never before - for possessing what appear, at first sight, to be similar characteristics and style of my second group of heroes. How come the paradox? Does what works in business fall flat in politics? Or is Major a Petersen or Mulcahy in the making, if only his critics will get off his back? Sadly for Major, he is less similar to the second cast-list than his admirers might think. The most obvious contrast is with Hogg. Hogg may be 'ultra-cerebral and terribly reserved' as a UK academic puts it, and he certainly inclines to consensus rather than assertive leadership-from-the-front. Yet he conforms completely to a description of outstanding leaders given by Peter Senge, a US academic expert on the subject. Rather than conventional charisma, 'What distinguishes them is the clarity and persuasiveness of their ideas, the depth of their commitment and their openness to continually learning more,' says Senge. 'They instil confidence in those around them.' To some extent, Whalen and Mulcahy also fit this picture. They may be reticent, but at the same time their manifest drive and sense of strategic direction - even if not quite a vision in the usual sense - create a sort of charisma, at least among close colleagues. Petersen had that too, but also something rather different. His 'vision' was as much to do with reforming Ford's internal structures and processes - creating what he called 'a teamwork dynamo' - as with achieving distinction in the US car market, though he did that in spades. Every account of his tenure during Ford's remarkable revival in the 1980s stresses his collegial, listening, and 'enabling' style. In theory, that makes Petersen the closest parallel to John Major - or, rather, to the way Major tries to operate. Which brings us to what academics would call the 'systems differences' between political and business leadership. Andrew Kakabadse, a Cranfield professor who studies business leadership in nine countries, boils the usual long list of key attributes down to three: 'visioning'; good communications; and a 'team orientation'. Visioning involves a degree of creativity, but also the ability to make sense of immense 'systems detail', he says. Communications must be consistently excellent, both internally and externally. Teamwork is more a matter of open, thorough dialogue, than whether the final decision is taken by consensus or autocratically. Few leadership experts would score Major highly on clarity and consistency of vision. Most would agree with Philip Sadler, the former head of Ashridge Management College, that Major's goals are 'unstrung beads'. They lack the unifying thread which a good business leader finds vital. On the second attribute, communications, Major has demonstrably failed to perform. Unlike reticent chief executives, who can delegate much of their external relations downwards to specialists, or upwards to an extrovert chairman, political leaders are only as effective as their own ability to communicate. It is a moot point whether Major deserves a high score on the third key attribute, teamwork, in spite of his belief in it. Given the poor quality of so many of his government's decisions and subsequent climbdowns - or inconsistent refusals to compromise - it is far from clear that he is stimulating a sufficiently thorough team dialogue. Moreover, instead of allowing his more headstrong colleagues to take ill-considered decisions, he should, in common with Attlee or Petersen, show he has the steel to overrule them from time to time. In politics as well as business, leaders who want to have staying power must tailor their style to changing situations. At US General Electric, Jack Welch has done that, becoming more consultative than a decade ago. Thatcher could not recognise or accept the need and suffered the consequences. In Major's case the question may be more whether a halfway adequate manager can transform himself into someone who, however quietly, can galvanise others into cohesive action. Mulcahy had a decade to do so, Petersen two. Major has no such luxury.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> REBECCA HORN CLOBBERS CONVENTION  </P> <P> A major exhibition for German artist Rebecca Horn opened Sunday at the Museum  of Contemporary Art on Bunker Hill. It should upset a regular apple cart of  conventional expectations. Imagine the apple cart as a self-propelled robot  full of slightly kinky mechanical passion fruit and you begin to get the idea.  The artist is little known in these parts, although widely recognized in Europe  and New York. She is a performance artist-sculptor-filmmaker.  </P> <P> Uh-oh.  </P> <P> What is it about those multiple monicker occupations that immediately causes us  to catch a whiff of the flaky poseur who does many things badly? And Horn's  roles are so contradictory. Despite the recognition of performers like Laurie  Anderson and Rachel Rosenthal, the generic performance artist is still  stereotyped as an underground animal acting for voyeurs in scruffy lofts and  being denied NEA grants for having amorous relations with jars of lard. The  only way for such an imagined archetype to be a filmmaker is with an 8mm camera  trained on themselves. Betcha the "sculptor" part comes from the performer's  dippy fantasy that by putting on a leotard he/she is "sculpting" his/her body.  It seems all those slashes just mean we live in a society that can't make up  its mind.  </P> <P> OK, now try this on for art-and-culture shock. Horn's exhibition consists of 18  motor-driven sculptures that are more inventive, funny, apt and ominous than  any kinetic art seen here in years. Horn's tatty little home movie is a  two-hour color feature called "Buster's Bedroom." It was shot by the Academy  Award-winning Sven Nykvist, stars Donald Sutherland and Geraldine Chaplin, and  has a screenplay by Martin Mosebach and Horn, who also (puff) directed.  </P> <P> Which serves to remind us here in the land of the decreasingly free that they  can do things a little differently in Europe. In the '60s, Andy Warhol made  considerable strides in busting the border between U.S. fine visual arts and  the commercial film, but it didn't take. Today, the spheres remain more divided  than the two Berlins of old. But in Berlin and elsewhere on the Continent, it's  perfectly natural for a performance artist like Horn to know film people like  Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders as part of a yeasty artistic stew that takes in  writers and intellectuals as well. While we tend to specialize and  commercialize, they can still hybridize for infusions of vigor.  </P> <P> Not that "Buster's Bedroom" is a perfect movie. Its tone is set when we see the  ingenue film student, Micha (Amanda Ooms), driving her convertible across the  desert toward Hollywood, blindfolded. The impression she is a little nuts is  reinforced by her habit of playing mumbletypeg very fast between her  black-leather-gloved fingers. Her main obsession, however, is Buster Keaton.  When she learns he was once incarcerated in an upscale loony bin called Nirvana  House, she sets off on a pilgrimage.  </P> <P> Meantime, the hospital's only doctor has expired from an overdose and the six  inmates have taken over the asylum. They are mostly old silent-movie people  rendered unglued by the talkies. They love Nirvana House, where they are free  to be crazy in bedraggled luxury. An aging grande dame talks to butterflies she  keeps in the armoire. One old boy dresses as a bee and another plays gardener  looking for a place to plant the doctor's body. Sutherland is a snake freak. He  ministers oddly to Chaplin, who is confined to an automatic wheelchair with a  mechanical arm that periodically gives her a slug of whiskey. When Micha shows  up, the loonies mistake her for an inspection committee they fear will shut the  place down. Sutherland poses as the dead head resident trying to get rid of the  girl while falling love with her.  </P> <P> The slapstick-surreal plot unfolds to a somewhat murky conclusion where Micha  may be dead, drowning or liberated. The film always looks beautiful, thanks to  Nykvist. The cast, including Valentina Cortese, David Warrilow, Taylor Mead,  Ari Snyder, Martin Wuttke and Mary Woronov, is unfailingly entertaining.  </P> <P> But flaws are serious and point an accusing finger at the director-writer. The  film lacks cohesion -- there's too much air in it. Story points are dropped and  symbolism often obscure. Special effects that are supposed to be magical are  merely mechanical, so we're unwilling to suspend disbelief, as in a scene where  Chaplin chases Ooms in her wheelchair, cracking a bullwhip. Cocteau or Bunuel  might have brought this off, but here we just realize the girl has nothing to  fear, even before Chaplin falls in the swimming pool. For all its professional  troops, "Buster's Bedroom" still smacks of amateurism.  </P> <P> So much said, the film is still five times more interesting than your average  Hollywood potboiler. It's to be screened twice weekly until the show closes  Jan. 6. Intelligent and seriously intended, it deals with the asylum as a  double symbol of lunacy and art. The neurotic Micha has to think twice when  faced by real psychos. Does she really want to slip into their world of  fantasy? It seems as free as childhood but once you're in it, it's prison.  Nirvana House doubles for the art world, where people pay a price in  obsessiveness to achieve their dreams.  </P> <P> Bristling with kinks and fetishes, it borders on having sheer compulsiveness as  its main theme. To its credit, it avoids leanings toward Teutonic  whips-'n'-leather sadomasochism. Finally, Micha meets boy and they escape -- or  almost.  </P> <P> The movie is compelling just by the bewitching nature of the medium, but the  exhibition is a more complete artistic success. Horn sees Buster Keaton as a  kind of alter ego, with his incredible mechanical ingenuity and pathetic  persona. He goes through hell to get the girl and winds up kissing the dog.  That kind of absurdity comes through best in the sculpture.  </P> <P> It consists mainly of props from the movie or free-standing works inspired by  it. The introductory piece, "Times Goes By," is a direct homage to Buster  Keaton, with its reams of film and Keatonesque Oxfords. The exhibition title,  "Diving Through Buster's Bedroom," derives from Chaplin's plunge into the pool.  In the main gallery, Horn does a magical job of making us feel under water,  using reflections bounced from a mirrored pool by strong stage lights. The  empty wheelchair circles, periodically stopping for a slug from its Dr.  Strangelove arm. The piano floats from the ceiling, quiet until its guts  explode with a musical diminuendo.  </P> <P> Nearby, a fan of sheet music opens and closes -- the show's most delicate  lyric. Sutherland's snakes inspired works that include a long low black box  containing a rivulet of mercury that shudders ominously at passersby.  </P> <P> On one wall a pair of mechanical arms scrub the surface black with copper  brushes. It alludes to a moment when Sutherland brushes Chaplin's hair with  manic tenderness. You don't have to know that to appreciate how incredibly  lifelike mechanical motion can become. A motorized blue butterfly on the old  film queen's bed is eerily convincing and when the nurses' blue shoes tap-dance  all by themselves, you look around for the invisible girls.  </P> <P> German art and crafts have a long history of fascination with robotics from  mechanical dolls to Frankenstein, a flesh-and-blood robot. In Horn's work,  creepiness, absurdity and affection go hand in hand. All come from man's  exalted, mad notion that he can create life without nature's help.  </P></p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Monday Interview: Centrist at a golden crossroad - Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai Mr Huang Ju, the mayor of Shanghai, is a man with a mission. His aim is to set his city on course to become a finance and trade powerhouse in Asia and the Pacific by 2010. Twelve months ago, Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo and Seoul may have scoffed at Mr Huang's presumption, but it is unlikely today that financiers in any of these centres would doubt Shanghai's capacity to assert itself regionally by early next century. The 'city state' is already proving a strong magnet for new investment, sucking in billions of dollars of foreign funds - Dollars 3.5bn last year alone, equivalent to almost the entire amount over the past decade. In the process, Shanghai is becoming more closely attached to the economies of Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers such as Singapore and Thailand. 'Between 2000 and 2010 we want to turn Shanghai into a financial and trading centre of the Asian and Pacific region. Our objective is to achieve complementarity with other regional financial and trade centres,' Mr Huang said. The 55-year-old engineer who became mayor of China's most populous city in 1991 speaks the language of a salesman when extolling Shanghai's advantages as the 'dragon head' of his country's economic development. The city sits, for example, at the point where China's 'golden highway', the Yangtze, runs into the sea; it is also located mid-way between north and south on China's coastline. 'We are at the cross-roads of the golden highway and golden coastline. We stand at the gateway to the world outside,' Mr Huang said of the Yangtze river delta and Yangtze valley whose cities and towns account for half China's industrial output. His dream of Shanghai's golden future will depend on sustained revitalisation of the city's crumbling infrastructure and industrial base. It will also require a revolution in China's state-dominated financial sector whose old-fashioned ways are incompatible with Mr Huang's aspirations for Shanghai as a modern financial services sector. The mayor fits the mould of the modern Chinese technocrat-cum-official. He dresses neatly in conservative western suit and tie and tasselled black shoes; and he is cautious in his political observations, as befits someone with a reputation as a centrist with links to the two broad factions of the communist elite. Among his mentors is said to be the 88-year-old Chen Yun, patron of the central planners and a conservative counterweight to the reformists led by senior leader, 88-year-old Deng Xiaoping. Mr Huang deflects questions about the relevance of Marxism in modern China. He would rather quote statistics than Marx; the thoughts of Deng Xiaoping than those of Chairman Mao. China's turbulent past, its adherence to class struggle, its Soviet-style central planning, and the disruption caused by mass political campaigns are 'part of history', he said. What was important was to look forward. Mr Huang joined the Communist party in 1966, three years after he graduated from Qinghua university, one of China's most prestigious, and a few months before the Cultural Revolution brought years of chaos to China. Looking forward provides the Chinese official with an opportunity to sketch in some grand plans for Shanghai. These involve three stages of development: from 1991-95; 1996-2000; and 2000-2010. Shanghai would continue to invest heavily in infrastructure at a rate of about Dollars 1.75bn annually to the end of the century, creating the right environment for the city to achieve its broader ambitions; municipal planners, through tax incentives and other measures, would shift the balance of industry from heavy to light manufacturing, preferably high-tech; and services would be given every encouragement to grow from their present 30 per cent share of the city's GNP to 45 per cent. Shanghai has a lot of catching up to do. Its share of national industrial output is down from 18 per cent in the 1950s to about 7 per cent today. In 1985 it yielded to Guangdong province in the south the mantle of number one exporter. It is this latter development that the proud Shanghainese find particularly irksome. And although Mr Huang is too shrewd a politician to make negative remarks about the southern province - he almost certainly harbours national ambitions - it would be surprising if he did not share in a general desire to put Guangdong and the energetic Cantonese in their place. 'We want Shanghai to lead in economic development in China,' is about as close as he is prepared to go in throwing down the gauntlet. Mr Huang is also careful not to criticise Beijing for keeping Shanghai on a tight leash longer than was perhaps necessary until recently. Shanghai businessmen chafed for years at what they saw as unfair restrictions on their activities, while their Guangdong counterparts were permitted to engage in an entrepreneurial free-for-all. Shanghai has also been obliged to contribute a bigger share of its revenues into national coffers, leaving itself short of funds to deal with manifest infrastructural problems - housing, roads and sewage systems all need urgent attention - in one of the world's most overcrowded cities. Loyally, Mr Huang ascribed Beijing's restrictions to Shanghai's importance as a stabilising factor during the politically risky early reform process of the 1980s. 'Shanghai has been obliged to play a role like a big brother,' he said diplomatically. 'As the source of one-seventh of state revenues in the 1980s it had to bear its duties and responsibilities. It was too risky to experiment.' Mr Huang compared Shanghai's role in the 1980s to that of a defensive player in soccer. But in the 1990s it was moving onto the offensive as a 'pioneer for reform'. Among privileges now being ceded by the central government to Shanghai is the right to borrow internationally. Mr Huang estimates that Shanghai raised about RMB10bn last year for infrastructure projects, of which about 80 per cent had been borrowed abroad, most from international lenders such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Shanghai is now also allowed to buy construction materials from the cheapest international source without first obtaining permission from Beijing, a process that could often take three months or more. Mr Huang expects the city to continue to grow at rates well above the national average. Shanghai's economy last year expanded by 14.8 per cent, compared with national growth 12.8 per cent. The city's target is 10 per cent annually until 2000, but the mayor is confident it will exceed that target without provoking crippling cost-of-living increases. Western concern about China's economy overheating was exaggerated, he declared, and some inflation was, in the present circumstances, unavoidable. The Chinese had, in any case, learned to cope with price rises. 'You look at China from the point of view of a foreigner. I look at it as a Chinese,' he said. Mr Huang, whose full name means 'yellow Chrysanthemum', would probably describe himself as a pragmatist in the tradition of Mr Deng. Indeed, he spurned any suggestion that accepting the failure of rigid central planning was painful for someone whose political views were nurtured during the Mao-dominated 1950s and 1960s. 'We've got to seek truth from facts,' he said, using a well-worn Deng slogan. 'We must explore ways for development with actual conditions in mind to recognise what is right and correct and what is mistaken. 'We realise it is impossible to have a perfect market economy,' he added. 'But we are learning from the European and the Americans and from our own experience.' Mr Deng, one of whose most famous slogans is 'practice is the sole criterion of truth', would approve.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Running Out of Airport Options"] </F>   [Text] From the sublime to the ridiculous. First came the  accusation of a secret deal, which is now said not to exist.  Then, yesterday a bizarre dispute erupted over a change of name.    Given these developments over the past few days, the casual  observer could be forgiven for thinking that the long-running  dispute over funding of the Chek Lap Kok airport project has  turned into something of a farce.    Both sides must share some of the responsibility. The  Government certainly seems to have paid too little attention to  the debt issue which was the cause of the most recent war of  words.    When Executive Councillor Edward Chen Kwan-yiu accurately  predicted last summer that a dispute would arise precisely over  the definition of government debt, Financial Secretary Sir  Hamish Macleod promptly shot such a notion down.    At the time, Mr Chen warned that China would insist debts  incurred by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and Airport  Corporation be included in the $5 billion limit laid down in the  Memorandum of Understanding on the new project. Mr Macleod, as  he was then, denied this, saying there was no reason to make  such a presumption.    Perhaps the administration also under-estimated the  difficulty of explaining the difference between government debt,  and that of its statutory corporations, to Chinese officials  unused to drawing such fine distinctions over the financial  liabilities of their own companies.    Whatever the faults of the Hong Kong administration, the  events of the past few days clearly show that the greater blame  must lie on the Chinese side. First, there was Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office chief Lu Ping's claim of a secret deal over  the definition of government debt--which the vehemence of  subsequent British denials strongly suggest was a fabrication.    Perhaps Mr Lu thought he could pull a fast one, by claiming  to have reached an agreement with Sir Percy Cradock, the one  British official who has since broken ranks with his  government's policy. He calculated badly, judging from the speed  with which Sir Percy issued a denial.    Then came yesterday's absurd allegation that Britain had  changed the name of the Airport Authority to Airport  Corporation, simply to avoid consulting China over its debt.  Absurd because the Government has already told Beijing it is  happy to use whichever title it likes.    Such outbursts suggest that China is more interested in  placing obstacles on the flight path to Chek Lap Kok than in  seeing it built. This can only cast doubt on the sincerity of  its commitment to separate the airport from political issues.  There was a time, late last year, when the Chinese did seem  genuinely committed to the Chek Lap Kok project, even signalling  approval for some steps that were necessary, just as the  political reform talks broke down. But the events of the past  few days have shattered any such illusions.    The Government has few options. Some argue the  administration should abandon its seemingly-endless wait for  Chinese approval, and simply go-it-alone, loans and all. While  that may sound tempting in some sectors, it would breach the  Memorandum of Understanding where consultation between both  sides is crucial.    Similarly, privatisation, while superficially attractive,  can  only further enrage Beijing, which has already expressed concern  about the project slipping out of Government control.    With those two options not without problems, the Government  has little choice but to proceed with its present piecemeal  approach of continuing to seek funds when needed from the  legislature while seeking to reach an overall agreement on  funding from China. It may not be a pleasant option, but the  hard reality is that there is no real alternative course of  action.</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOODBRIDGE, LOADED IN TRADITION AND EXPERIENCE, IS THE TEAM TO BEAT  </P> <P> Woodbridge High School Coach Bill Shannon started to explain why his basketball  team was the favorite to win the Pacific Coast League title this season when he  paused and asked who Trabuco Hills Coach Rainer Wulf had picked.  </P> <P> Wulf had predicted Woodbridge would win the league for the third time in the  last four years.  </P> <P> "Oh, then Trabuco is by far the favorite," Shannon said. "But then again, if I  could predict stuff, I would be in Las Vegas and not coaching here."  </P> <P> Nice try, coach, but your Warriors are the team to beat this season after  finishing second to Trabuco Hills last season.  </P> <P> Just ask the league's other coaches.  </P> <P> "Woodbridge is a head above everyone," Wulf said. "The biggest difference  between Woodbridge and us is that they have experience in the front line and we  don't, and we have an experienced backcourt and they don't."  </P> <P> Orange Coach Don Burnette said, "Woodbridge is loaded. They have guys who won't  play for them that would probably start for me."  </P> <P> From Costa Mesa Coach Dean Cooper: "Trabuco Hills can light it up from  three-point range and that will make them tough, but Woodbridge is going to be  the toughest with all its people back. They have an outstanding program."  </P> <P> Woodbridge returns six players, including starters Joe Cohen, Romalis Taylor  and Bryant McLemore from a team that finished 9-13 overall and 7-3 in the  league. Cohen, a 6-3 senior, averaged 16 points a game and Taylor and McLemore,  6-3 juniors, averaged eight and six points, respectively.  </P> <P> And what about the seven players lost to graduation?  </P> <P> No problem. Shannon just promoted seven players from last season's junior  varsity team that won the league championship.  </P> <P> That's how it's done at tradition-rich schools. The Warriors have a 27-3 league  record in the league the last three years. They won the league title in 1987  and '88. They were the state 2-A champions in 1987 and runner-up the next year.  </P> <P> "We're shooting for our fifth year in a row in the playoffs," Shannon said.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills lost leading scorer Rick Swanwick to graduation, but guards Randy  Kriech and Tim Manning return from last season's team that reached the state  3-A final.  </P> <P> The Mustangs, 25-7 overall and 9-1 in the league last season, also picked up  Beau Hossler, a 6-2 swingman who transferred from Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> "There's not a better backcourt in Orange County," Wulf said. "Those three are  all seasoned players.  </P> <P> "At times we could have five guards on the floor. People say we will have  matchup problems, but so will other teams because of our speed and quickness."  </P> <P> Wulf said there's no pressure to repeat as league champions. Everyone is too  busy watching the school's football team try to win its second consecutive  Division VIII football championship.  </P> <P> "No one expected us to do what we did last year," Wulf said. "I told them they  had a shot to win a league championship again. But with our football team  winning, a lot of fans think if you just predict it, it will happen."  </P> <P> Here's what's happening in the league:  </P> <P> COSTA MESA -- Cooper hopes one returning starter and two transfers will make  his second season as coach easier than his first.  </P> <P> But he doesn't expect any miracles.  </P> <P> Leading scorer Tim Nguyen (22 points) graduated and only one starter, guard  Bret Dieball, is back from last season's 4-17 team. Costa Mesa finished fifth  in the league at 2-8.  </P> <P> Dieball, a 5-10 senior, started the second half of the season and averaged 12  points a game.  </P> <P> Cooper said transfers Xavier Hana, a 6-2 forward, and Ryan McEvoy, a 6-0 guard,  will give the Mustangs the depth and quickness they lacked last season. Hana  transferred from Valencia and McEvoy moved from New Jersey.  </P> <P> With a short lineup, the Mustangs will run a fast-break offense. But they need  rebounds to run, and Cooper has switched from a man-to-man to a matchup zone  defense in hopes of cutting taller teams down to size.  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH -- Leading scorers John Trevino (16 points) and Dain Blanton (15)  return from last season's 10-13 team, but Coach Ed Bowen promises the Artists  will spread the scoring around this year.  </P> <P> "Last season, we built everything around Blanton and Trevino," Bowen said.  "This year, everyone can pop it in. We'll be 10 times stronger off the bench.  Last season, we had only five or six (key) players."  </P> <P> And the player who will be spreading the ball around for the Artists will be  5-11 point guard Josh Borell, one of eight varsity players up from last  season's junior varsity team. Borell averaged 10 points a game last season.  </P> <P> LAGUNA HILLS -- The Hawks, who have never won a league title, have a new coach  who knows all about championships. Dave Brown replaces Joe Reid after leading  Fountain Valley to seven Sunset League titles in his 20 years at the school.  </P> <P> But don't expect too much from Brown and the Hawks right away. They lost 10  players, including the top two scorers, from last season's 16-9 team. Chris  Sheff, a four-year starter who averaged 18.7 points, has graduated and Hossler  transferred to Trabuco Hills.  </P> <P> Brown will build around Pat Nelson, a 6-4 forward and the only returning  starter, and reserves Al Saldana and Todd Peterson.  </P> <P> ORANGE -- The Panthers find themselves in a similar situation as Costa Mesa --  only one returning starter from a 4-18 team and a second-year coach trying to  replace 12 players who have graduated.  </P> <P> Carlos Duran, a 5-10 point guard, returns for the Panthers, who finished last  in the league at 1-9. Duran, a junior, averaged seven points and three assists  a game.  </P> <P> "We'll do what we did last year," Burnette said. "We'll play a little better  defense and take care of the ball on the press, which Carlos does really well."  </P> <P> TRABUCO HILLS -- The Mustangs lost Swanwick, but don't be surprised if Kriech,  Manning and transfer Hossler pick up the scoring slack.  </P> <P> Swanwick, a 6-10 center who averaged 20.3 points last season, is now a redshirt  at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> But with Kriech (13.7 points), Manning (10.2) and Hossler (14), Wulf has  leadership and three-point shooting threats in the backcourt.  </P> <P> Wulf will have to do without Manning and Jim Farbaniec, a 6-4 center, for the  first five games. Both are playing for the Mustangs' football team.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Khoa Tran, a 5-9 transfer from Westminster, will fill in for  Manning and Brian Sawa, a 6-2 senior, will replace Farbaniec.  </P> <P> WOODBRIDGE -- Shannon always schedules a tough nonleague schedule and this year  is no exception with games against Estancia, Centennial, Corona del Mar,  Mission Viejo and a trip to Las Vegas for a holiday tournament.  </P> <P> "It's a brutal schedule," he said. "We played a tough preseason last year and  it really paid off for us in the league."  </P> <P> Shannon said the Warriors have more experience and depth than any team he has  coached.  </P> <P> "Even when we won state and were runner-up, we didn't have people from top to  bottom who could contribute," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PREVIEW '89  </P> <P> PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE  </P> <P> 1988 Overall, League Records in Parentheses  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.87IN:4.86IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> SCHOOL  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> '89-'90 COMMENT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Costa Mesa (4-17, 2-8)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> One returning starter,  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> but two key transfers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Laguna Beach (10-13, 4-6)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Top two scorers return  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Laguna Hills (16-9, 7-3)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dave Brown replaces Joe Reid  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> as coach  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Orange (4-18, 1-9)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Climb out of cellar is a steep one  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Trabuco Hills (25-7, 9-1)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Strong backcourt will be  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> key to title defense  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Woodbridge (9-13, 7-3)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Three returning starters  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> give Warriors the edge  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Tuesday: Sea View League  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Ishchenko report: "President Informed That Butcher </F> and Plumber Are Trading Uranium"]    [Text] Usually the reports of the arrest of Russian  citizens attempting to earn foreign currency from trading in  radioactive materials arrive from abroad -- from Germany,  Hungary, or Poland. But it turns out that our own special  services do not always allow wrongdoers to cross the state  border freely. As transpired just the other day, back in March.  Showing exceptional vigilance, staffers from the Russian  Federation Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] St.  Petersburg Directorate's Antiterrorist Service arrested a group  of people intending to sell more than three kilograms of highly  enriched uranium dioxide (Yevgeniy Lukin, chief of the St.  Petersburg FCS Public Relations Directorate, reported that the  mole fraction of the uranium-235 in the mixture of isotopes was  90 percent). The FCS believes that this time too the stolen  uranium-235 was destined for foreign buyers.    In February St. Petersburg's counterintelligence officers  received their first information on the planned deal. In order  to locate all uranium storage sites and not miss a single gram  of this strategic raw material, the FCS operatives "played  along" with the dealers and rounded up all those involved in  March. They confiscated 3.05 kg of uranium powder, which had  been stored in a half-liter glass jar and metal flask -- the  dealers were clearly not too worried about their own health.    But that is not the most important point. The fact is that  until recently most of the "unorganized" traders in radioactive  material (one of the people arrested turned out to be a butcher,  another was a plumber) had been trying to sell as strategic raw  materials radioactive waste, or even real uranium, but minimally  enriched -- turning it into dangerous bomb material would  require huge amounts of money and a highly complex production  process. But this time, if the St. Petersburg FCS directorate's  information is to be fully believed, we are dealing with real  weapons-grade raw material. It was stolen "from an enterprise  near Moscow" (presumably the cities of Bolshevo, Elektrostal, or  Noginsk -- Ed.). This was where the butcher, the plumber, and  co. removed three whole kilograms of highly enriched uranium (in  gloves, they claim) without being stopped.    All the arrested men are now in St. Petersburg, where they  are being interrogated. A case under Article 223 Note 3 (theft  of radioactive materials) is being brought in the place where  the crime was committed -- the Moscow area. The president has  been notified of the incident in a special report.  <H5>  Instead of Commentary </H5>   We would recall that last fall our newspaper published the  results of an investigation which resulted in our journalists,  posing as buyers of fissionable materials, acquiring  weapons-grade (highly enriched) plutonium and uranium from  illegal traders. We had also come across an SS-20 warhead in  private hands. People tried to refute the results of our  investigation until the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Editorial  Office received a document from Ministry of Security experts  fully confirming that our correspondents had indeed obtained  weapons-grade plutonium.    When the RTV program "Eks" broadcast some of the results of  our work, V. Mikhaylov, minister of atomic energy, issued an  angry letter through ITAR-TASS categorically denying that it was  possible to steal uranium and plutonium from the enterprises  under his jurisdiction.    But now there is today's case.... We are not gloating, it is  simply that in our reports of last year we cited Elektrostal as  a city where uranium was being filched from a plant in milk cans.    The NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA investigative service and  science department will henceforth be conducting joint  investigations into the ways in which strategic materials and  nuclear weapons are being lost. We would recall that there are  two days to go until subscription closes.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties in favour again FURTHER signs that investor confidence is returning to the property market was signalled by improved results and positive comments from Chesterfield Properties, and shares rose impressively across the sector. The Chesterfield improvement follows more bullish reports from other property groups, most recently Land Securities, the biggest in the sector. Property analysts remain largely cautious towards the sector as a whole, arguing that the selective nature of the recovery in property is mirrored in the diversity of property stocks. Yesterday, however, investors appeared keen on a wide variety of shares, among which Chesterfield surged 58 to 330p, Bilton 16 to 531p, helped by news on housing starts from Laing, British Land 11 to 302p, Hammerson 'A' 14 to 339p, Land Securities 12 to 565p and Slough Estates 14 to 209p.</p>

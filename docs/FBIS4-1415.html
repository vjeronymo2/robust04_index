			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban April 28 SAPA -- A helicopter from 15  Squadron in Durban left Newcastle on Thursday to distribute  ballot papers throughout the rural areas of northern Natal, SABC  [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. An  estimated 600,000 ballot papers will be distributed, following a  massive shortage in the area. Helicopters have also been sent  to southern Natal where a shortage of papers caused major  problems on Wednesday.    Meanwhile angry voters were staging a sit-in at Nqutu in  northern Natal in protest against the disorganisation at polling  stations. Very little voting has taken place in the area.    At Charlestown on the Natal/Transvaal border, voting only  started at 5PM on Wednesday while voting only got underway at  Ingogo near Newcastle at 3PM.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / E German land claim quashed by court THE Soviet land reform in east Germany between 1945 and 1949, involving the expropriation and redistribution of nearly one-third of the former communist state's land, cannot be reversed, according to the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe. The Bonn government, under pressure from Moscow and from the short-lived democratic government in east Berlin, had already accepted the Soviet land reform in last year's unity treaty, but 14 individuals lodged formal complaints that such acceptance was unconstitutional. Yesterday's ruling, that the Bonn government was justified in accepting the land reform, affects 3m hectares of land. The court advised that the government should pay compensation to the former owners. Ministers in Bonn welcomed the decision and said that it removed an uncertainty that had held up new investment in many rural areas. Property expropriated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945 or by the East German government after 1949 is, with some qualifications, still being returned to former owners. The uncertainty created by this slow and difficult process is still regarded as one of the biggest obstacles to new investment in east Germany. In the second half of 1990 east Germany had a GNP of DM105.3bn (Pounds 35.2bn) about 8.3 per cent of west Germany's GNP over the same period, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said. Average gross monthly income in east Germany was DM1,357, 37 per cent of the west German level.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Gypsy' shows its class - Theatre The famous 1960 musical Gypsy is many things. It is the Cinderella-to-celebrity biography of the stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. It is also, more importantly, an expose of the last days of American vaudeville, in which Gypsy (then Louise Hovick) received her training as a child performer. More vividly yet, it is simply a let's-get-this-show-on-the-road backstage musical - in which the show only takes flight when everyone has lost faith in it, and in a form nobody had imagined (striptease). But all that could just be read as metaphor. We follow the story of Gypsy's early career the way we watch all ugly-duckling stories - as a parable for a child's transformation into adult maturity. The highly ironic fact that Gypsy shakes off her immaturity when she becomes a stripper adds a layer of sexual meaning to the story of growing-up: the girl becomes a woman by learning to please men, by enjoying that, and by being in control of the situation. The brilliance of Gypsy lies in that it is, above all, about the girl's mother, and about the course of her maternal ambition. When Gypsy finally becomes a star - and a sexual being - the show homes in on her mother's sudden frustration. Here is a classic demonstration of a parent finding herself superfluous (I gave you life, I taught you everything, I created you  -how dare you be independent?) Very skilfully, Gypsy shows us this from both sides - mother and child. In most respects, Jude Kelly's staging for the West Yorkshire Playhouse is first-rate. Paul Andrews' sets fluently conjure up scene upon scene of midwar America. Terry John Bates' choreography is wholly worthy of the show (which was originally directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins); little June's high kicks are ideally ludicrous and musical. Jane Arden and Marsha Ward, excellent as Louise and June, sing 'Little Lamb', 'If Mama was Married' and the old chestnut 'Let me Entertain You' with complete command. Supporting roles are well taken. American accents, though imperfect, are seldom a problem (some minor syllables get slurred into inaudibility, even by the leading performers). Sheila Hancock takes the part of Mama Rose with splendid attack and verve. Though she lacks the blast power of Ethel Merman (the original) or even the sheer force that Tyne Daly displayed in the 1990-91 Broadway revival, she has always plenty of bite. As yet, however, her pacing is sometimes too pat; and it is too obvious too soon that her ambition is really for herself. Michael Cashman gives a wholly grey and lightweight account of her loyal stooge and lover Herbie - a role that should provide tone and ballast. (Impossible to believe in any sexual chemistry between them.) And so Gypsy packs less that its proper psychological punch. Even so, much of it works so well that this production should be seen. 'You Gotta Get a Gimmick', one of the surefire numbers of musical theatre, is delicious. Gypsy is frequently described as a great musical: which it isn't. Could a great musical end without a song, as this does? In fact, its music (by Jule Styne) is just vaudeville shlock - effective, charming, undistinguished - and this very fact helps to make Gypsy perfect. It never lets us make the mistake of thinking 'With luck, these people could be great theatrical artists'. There is something humdrum about even their private life: which is what numbers like 'Small World, isn't it?' catch so well. The words, you may recall, are by Stephen Sondheim - who after this show was to grow a lot more clever and a lot less wise. Everything in Gypsy is about the tension between ambition and achievement. This comes to a climax in 'Rose's Turn', Rose's very tricky soliloquy, in which Hancock suggests that she really nearly might have 'made it', had only things, from her birth onward, been different. The irony is tremendous. No, not a great musical, but a great show. At the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, 0532-442111, until January 29. Sponsored by Yorkshire Bank.</p>

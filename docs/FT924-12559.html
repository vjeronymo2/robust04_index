			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Paris to start express clearing of Ecu securities A SAME-DAY clearing system for Ecu securities will come into operation in Paris at the start of next year, before the launch of a similar system planned in the UK. The creation of competing systems comes despite the downturn in the Ecu market, which many investors now feel will revert to being a quiet backwater of the Eurobond market. The Bank of France said yesterday that it and Sicovam, the securities clearing house, would launch the system to strengthen the Ecu market in Paris, helping to make it a more competitive financial centre. The new system, to be called Sire, will offer sale and repurchase facilities, helping the encourage the development of the Ecu repo market.</p>

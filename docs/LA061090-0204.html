			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN NEWS;  </P> <P> ANTIQUE SHOW AND SALE  </P> <P> An unusual collection of antiques, all from gardens past, is the theme of a  show and sale at the antique shop named Main St. U.S.A., 1325 West Washington  Blvd., Venice, (213) 392-6676. The show will run Saturday through June 30  (hours are 11 a.m..  </P> <P> -5 p.m. daily), but they will also have garden collectibles through the summer  (regular hours are 11 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday-Saturday).  </P> <P> Owner and avid gardener Tauni Brustin says they will have ornamental iron,  fountains, birdbaths and houses, furniture, pots and garden sculpture, gathered  from across the country. Don't look for the cast-iron frog seen in the  photograph; it is now attached to the end of a hose in a certain editor's  garden, who couldn't resist. Robert Smaus  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress  (NPC), said here today that there were good prospects for the  mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Australia.    Meeting with visiting Australian Governor-General Bill  Hayden  at the Great Hall of the People here this afternoon, Qiao  praised the positive contributions that Hayden has made in past  years for the promotion of Sino-Australian ties.    He said that the two countries have had effective exchanges  and cooperation since they were linked diplomatically.    Qiao noted that in recent years the exchanges between the  parliaments of the two countries have grown rapidly, adding that  there are also frequent exchanges between the legislative bodies  of Chinese provinces and Australian states.    "At the beginning of this month we received a delegation  from  the foreign affairs, trade and defence committees of the  australian parliament, and a Chinese NPC delegation headed by  Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Tian Jiyun will  visit Australia soon. These events would contribute to further  development of Sino- Australian relations and friendship of the  two peoples," Qiao said.    The NPC chairman pointed out that China and Australia, both  in the Pacific region, are complementary in their economies.  China is willing to forge deeper and closer cooperative ties  with Australia on the basis of the peaceful co-existance,  equality and mutual benefit, he stressed.    Qiao also briefed Hayden on the work of the npc and the  construction of China's socialist market economy.    Hayden expressed thanks for the warm reception he has met in  China.    He said he was pleased with the achievements gained in  Australia- China economic cooperation, which he described as  "instrumental" to the two countries and as "favorable factors"  for the economic development and political stability of the  Asia-Pacific region.</p>

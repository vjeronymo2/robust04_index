			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Hungarian party split may force election TENSIONS within Hungary's governing conservative party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF), have led to an open split which could lead to the party's defeat in parliament and an early general election. HDF members voted late on Tuesday to expel Mr Istvan Csurka and three other right-wing nationalists from the parliamentary party. Mr Csurka, is a well-known writer and author of an anti-Communist and anti-semitic manifesto which threw Hungarian politics into turmoil when published last August. Three far-right associates were also cast out including Ms Izabella Kiraly, a campaigner for the 'peaceful reunification' of the Carpathian basin once ruled by Hungary. Mrs Kiraly has organised a demonstration tomorrow against the 1920 Trianon treaty, which took away two thirds of former Hungarian-controlled territory and left more than 3m ethnic Hungarians as minorities in neighbouring Romania, Slovakia, Croatia and Serbia. A nation-wide HDF party meeting this weekend is set to confirm the expulsions and sanction the resulting split. It remains to be seen how many MPs from Mr Csurka's Hungarian Justice faction will follow him out of the HDF. Government officials hope that only 10 MPs are solidly behind the populist leader, but a defection by all or most of the 29 Justice faction MPs would cost the government headed by Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, its parliamentary majority. Hungary's constitution makes it difficult for parliament to pass motions of no-confidence, but Mr Antall said this week that he was unwilling to lead a minority government. The Antall government has enjoyed a longevity unmatched in eastern Europe. But ministers, previously determined to survive until elections scheduled for May 1994, are now for the first time talking openly about the possibility of an early vote. The first test of the Forum's majority will be the parliamentary vote on measures to bring the public-sector deficit down to 5.6 per cent of GDP in 1994 in line with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund. Protests against the government's proposed austerity measures are making it more difficult to keep parliament in line. Teachers this week demonstrated against the planned freeze on public-sector pay and the public is irate at the government's intention to increase value-added tax on food, pharmaceuticals and household heating.</p>

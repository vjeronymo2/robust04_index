			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Filthy fuels foot the bill The 'greenness' of one kind of fuel over another has been hotly contested in the debate on the future of the UK coal industry. But putting numbers on the environmental damage done by each fuel type to clarify that debate is notoriously difficult. In the US many states have been forced to do just that by two decades of ambitious environmental legislation: frequently they force utilities to include environmental costs in their applications for new energy contracts. A consultancy report* for the European Commission analysing the US experience concludes that environmental costs add between 50 per cent and 100 per cent to the conventional 'economic' costs of generating electricity. The report, prepared by the Association for the Conservation of Energy, says that 32 US states 'have taken some action to account for environmental externalities' - the costs normally 'external' to the electricity market's prices. But the methods used to put money values on environmental damage vary widely - as do the values themselves. Most methods avoid 'damage cost assessment' - putting a figure directly on environmental and health damage from pollution. That approach runs into difficulty over the treatment of different probabilities of damage - how, for example, to deal with the uncertainty over whether carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming or not. Instead, most measure 'control costs' - the extra costs imposed by legislation - and assume that the money value of environmental damage is greater, or the law would not have been passed. This makes the figures easy to find, but the report comments that it assumes unrealistically that legislators accurately estimated environmental damage. One study by the Tellus Institute, a US think-tank quoted by the EC report, says US power plants face costs between 47 per cent and 103 per cent higher than older plants because of new legislation. The conventionally-measured cost of generating power with 'new coal' - stations equipped with filters for nitrogen and sulphur oxides - is about 8.6 c/KWh (cents per kilowatt hour), but air pollution legislation adds 4 cents, or 47 per cent. The conventional cost of generating with existing coal, about 6.9 c/KWh, rises with environmental costs to 14 cents, 103 per cent higher. Oil emerges as the 'cheapest' on this basis, with conventional costs of 6.9 c/KWh and total costs of 11.7 c/KWh. That estimate emphasises the difficulty of international comparison: a similar 'provisional' study of UK environmental costs published by the Department of Trade and Industry in December had oil as the 'dirtiest'. The report found too that there was wide variation at state and even district level. California, which has some of the most stringent environmental legislation in the US, has 'different externality values across the state' because air pollution rules are set at regional level. Environmental costs of building 'new coal' plants in California were around 6.7 c/KWh, the report says, more than 10 times those given by the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal agency in charge of power for five north-western states. This is because BPA calculations are based on the alternative 'damage cost' approach and exclude estimates of the damage caused to the atmosphere by carbon dioxide emissions. The BPA felt it would be 'premature' to judge whether global warming was occurring. In a different attempt to address that uncertainty, New York state directed that planning applications should not set costs of controlling carbon dioxide emissions at more than 20 per cent of a low-cost technology such as tree planting. As a result, it has some of the lowest figures for 'new coal' externalities: only 1.4 c/KWh. Despite the shortcomings of these estimates, the report concludes that the attempts reduce the risk that future electricity customers will be hit suddenly by the costs of cleaning up. *Accounting for the Environmental Costs of Energy Resources, a report for the European Commission by Timothy Woolf and the Association for the Conservation of Energy. 9 Sherlock Mews, London W1M 3RH</p>

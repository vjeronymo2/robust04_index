			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Arts: Swiss put Massenet on the European opera circuit - A new production of 'Thais' in St Gallen reveals the opera to be a parable of self-discovery, at once noble and tragic Britain may be enjoying a Massenet revival, but German-speaking Europe remains impervious to his charms. Massenet's music is too pretty to appeal to German taste. His romantic subjects lack the psychological breadth on which the German opera world thrives. Massenet was, quite simply, the most un-German composer of his time. Now comes a revelatory production of Thais in eastern Switzerland to challenge all those assumptions. It has been mounted by the St Gallen city theatre exactly 100 years after the work's premiere, and is the first Thais to be staged in German-speaking Europe. The opera emerges as a sensuous, sensitive duo-drama, a conveyor of potent human truths, an example of theatre musical at its bravest and least sentimental. The tale of a prostitute finding God and a monk who succumbs to carnal lust is an open invitation to kitsch - or to the kind of crude sexual imagery in which German theatre abounds. The Austrian producer Franz Winter, with Hans-Martin Scholder (decor) and Eva-Maria Dessecker (costumes), avoids both extremes, finding instead a parable of self-discovery, at once noble and tragic. The performance unfolds between two white walls, supplemented where necessary by a transparent curtain or a simple prop. The Egyptian setting is captured by the lighting and by the mildly exotic costumes, more colonial than early Christian. But the opera's decorative potential is deliberately underplayed in order to enhance the psychological insights. With no breaks for scene changes (and no ballet), the production mirrors two contrasting sides of the human condition - spiritual frugality and worldly hedonism - with a seamlessness reflected in Massenet's score. St Gallen deserves credit for finding a near-ideal Thais and Athanael. The Greek soprano Jenny Drivala achieves the transition from sinner to saint with lifelike conviction. For the first part of the evening she is very much the femme fatale. Her costume and body language match the erotic and fragile quality of the music, while her spartan demeanour in the final act is exactly right. In between comes Thais's conversion. Here Winter introduces a non-singing extra - a black chambermaid-cum-confidante - who provides a private audience for Thas's aria, before stripping her, bathing her and gently, comfortingly embracing her to the accompaniment of the famous Meditation. This intimate scene achieves its impact by power of suggestion, rather than fully-frontal nudity, and is mesmerising. Miss Drivala not only has a figure most prima donnas would kill for, but enough high-wire courage and musical intelligence to make the part her own. The voice has a delicate, intense quality, neither big nor sumptuous. She is partnered by the young American baritone Philip Zawisza, whose warm timbre and more-than-acceptable French are a boon to Massenet's vocal lines. His acting is equally convincing, notably in the way his Jimmy Swaggart-like zeal turns into sexual obsession. The musical quality is underpinned by Patrick Fournillier, the French conductor who played a key part in the success of WNO's recent Cendrillon. He allows the singers to be heard above Massenet's large orchestra and - despite the undernourished St Gallen strings - negotiates the delicate harmonic progressions, soft melodic contours and instrumental colouring with complete stylistic assurance. The entry on Thais in New Grove concludes that 'it is, in many ways, an opera still awaiting its first serious production'. In the unlikely setting of St Gallen, that landmark has surely been reached.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Double vision mars clearway for trailers - Two strategies EUROPE'S two largest trailer and truck rental companies have a double vision of the single market. Central Trailer Rentco, a subsidiary of Tiphook, the British transport group, has visions of a unitary Europe, where its trailers can be picked up or dropped off in any country to suit customer needs. TIP Europe, another British company, sees Europe as a collection of separate markets which must be addressed individually. The difference in outlook stems mainly from each company's customer base. CTR serves a few large transport groups, such as Frans Maas, while TIP works with smaller, local customers in 10 separate countries. Despite their alternative strategies, both companies agree that the Single European Act has removed some important barriers. Equally, they say problems remain which could take years to solve. 'We will see steady progress,' says Mr Robert Montague, chairman of Tiphook. 'But I think it's going to take at least five years for us materially to see the change.' Trailer rental is most developed in the UK, where there is more of a tendency for companies to contract out distribution and less inclination to own trucks. About 15 per cent of trailers in the UK are owned by trailer rental companies, compared with less than 10 per cent in Germany. Road haulage permits, which were needed to cross some national boundaries, were abolished on January 1. Vehicles no longer require customs documentation for their loads, which in turn no longer need to be bonded. This should save time and paperwork for trailers making cross border journeys. However, the benefits will only be fully felt if vehicles are making return journeys to their place of origin. Because of a number of structural problems, the free movement of vehicles remains elusive. Once a border has been crossed, it will still be difficult, or sometimes impossible, for vehicles to make onward journeys after unloading. French hauliers, for instance, find it very hard to transport goods between two points in Germany. This restriction on hauliers operating in countries other than their own is imposed by a system of cabotage permits. It is one of the reasons why trailers are empty for about 30 per cent of journeys. Cabotage is due to be phased out over the next five years, although some observers say it will take longer. Even when it is abolished, other factors will prevent the truly free movement of vehicles. For example, vehicles have to be registered with national licensing authorities, each of which imposes different requirements. Some countries, such as Germany and Denmark, require a vehicle's brakes to be tested twice a year. This means the trucks returning to their place of registration - often at great cost - for the tests. Only two countries, Belgium and the Netherlands, recognise each other's annual road worthiness tests. Mr Grant Findlay, finance director of TIP, says the registration problem is holding back cross-border rentals. 'If we have surplus fleet in the UK, it is very difficult to move them to Germany, for example, if we have demand there. Because of these differences between the countries, we still prefer to look at them as separate territories.' Price differentials also exist between markets. Germany's preference for heavy loads to be carried by rail rather than road has led to average road taxes for articulated lorries being almost twice levels in the UK. UK rental rates are 30 per cent below continental rates, partly because of competition and partly because UK fleets tend to be older. These remaining barriers within the EC could take years to erase. In the US, similar problems have only recently been ironed out - 10 years after deregulation.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LITTLE INFORMATION  </P> <P> In recent weeks you published an article ("Normandy Memories Still Sharp," by  Bob O'Sullivan, Nov. 19) about the little French village of Sainte-Mere-Eglise,  where on day one of the Normandy invasion a U.S. paratrooper landed with his  parachute caught in the steeple of the church. I would like to add a little  information.  </P> <P> The little church was built between the 11 and 13th centuries. Repairs made  after World War II include a large stained-glass window showing the American  parachute drop, a beautiful combination of an ancient art, an ancient building  and a relatively current event. Information given to us at the church says the  paratrooper involved was John Steele and that he died in 1962.  </P> <P> JAMES T. HUMBERD  </P> <P> La Quinta  </P></p>

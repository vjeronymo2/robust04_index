			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> WHO DEFERS PALESTINE STATUS DEBATE  </P> <P> The World Health Organization annual assembly voted by a slim majority today to  postpone debate by 48 hours on a divisive Palestinian bid for membership in the  U.N. agency.  </P> <P> The United States has warned that it will immediately cease all payments to the  agency if Palestinian observer status is changed to that of member state  "Palestine."  </P> <P> Austria, seconded by Canada, proposed a 48-hour delay until Friday to give  delegations time to consult their governments and try in private negotiations  to find a compromise on deferring the issue until next year. Fifty-six of the  160 nations attending the conference voted in favor of postponing debate, while  47 opposed it and 20 abstained. The remainder did not take part in the vote.  </P></p>

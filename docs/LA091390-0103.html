			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 4 BRIDGES PICKED FOR QUAKE FORTIFICATION  </P> <P> The California Department of Transportation has identified four bridges in the  unincorporated area of the county that should be strengthened to better  withstand earthquakes.  </P> <P> However, Ventura County officials will decide whether improvements will be  made.  </P> <P> The bridges are located at the Ventura River at Casitas Vista Road northwest of  Ventura, Calleguas Creek at Hueneme Road near Point Mugu, Coyote Creek at Santa  Ana Road in the Ojai Valley and the Santa Clara River at South Mountain Road  northeast of Ventura.  </P> <P> The total cost for the bridge improvements was estimated at $978,000 -- the  most expensive being the Santa Clara River bridge at $575,000. The work would  involve installing cables to prevent the bridge from falling off the abutments  during an earthquake.  </P> <P> New legislation in the wake of the Oct. 17, 1989, earthquake near San Francisco  calls for the identification of bridges statewide that need renovation. Ventura  County was among four governmental agencies selected for a pilot program to  implement the improvements before they are done statewide.  </P> <P> The Legislature appropriated funds for the statewide improvements, but the  money is far less than what is required, according to a county public works  agency report given to the Board of the Supervisors on Tuesday. The work may  require a 30% match of local funds, according to a report by Al F. Knuth,  deputy director of public works.  </P> <P> Knuth said Caltrans is letting local officials decide whether to proceed with  the work. His office will evaluate the risk for the four bridges first and  evaluate cost estimates.  </P> <P> Ken Gordon, principal engineer with the transportation department, said all the  bridges except the one over Calleguas Creek have low traffic volumes. The four  were picked, he said, because of their age and their proximity to areas  vulnerable to earthquake damage. JANE HULSE  </P></p>

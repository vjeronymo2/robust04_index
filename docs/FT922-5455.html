			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Correction Yesterday's review of Venus Observed wrongly attributed the parts of Perpetua and Rosabel to Heather Stannard and Valerie Taylor. It was they who played in the original production. At Chichester the parts are played by Susannah Harker and Kate O'Mara. I apologise for the error. The compliments stand. MR.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE?  </P> <P> Chevron's proposal ("Torrey Pines Research Park Approved," April 13) to skim  off 2 million cubic yards of soil from the tops of hills and relocate it in  canyons to build offices to accommodate thousands of employees will generate  16,000 additional auto trips daily, disturb the habitat of endangered birds and  destroy acres of valuable coastal sage scrub. All of this to take place in an  already heavily compacted and trafficked area.  </P> <P> Chevron's well-publicized advertising that it protects tiny blue butterflies,  eagles and fish fails to mention preserving the well-being of humans. What  happened to "Do people really care -- PEOPLE DO"?  </P> <P> MARY JANE ORR  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

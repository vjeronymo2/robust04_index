			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Spike may foil cemetery vandals Professor John Knapton, professor of structural engineering at Newcastle University, is to visit Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia next month to offer advice about a structural problem encountered there. Mr John C. Metzler, superintendent at the cemetery - at which John F. Kennedy is buried - said yesterday that the 150,000 US government headstones at Arlington, all marking graves of military personnel, had for cost reasons simply been set 22 inches into the ground without foundations. He said: 'The headstones constantly shift up and down, with the ground freezing and thawing. We have tried a number of suggestions over the years and nothing has been successful.' Prof Knapton and his students may have the answer. They have developed a simple spike and lock to anchor gravestones to the ground and fix them in position. The mechanism was devised initially as part of a research project for the Memorial Advisory Bureau, the main UK marketing and advisory body for monumental masons. It is intended to foil vandals and permit masons to unbolt headstones for temporary removal to the workshop when a new inscription is required. The device would cost about Pounds 35 a unit to manufacture, and would not be visible above ground. It has been patented by Nuventures, the university's technology transfer company. The North-East Co-operative Society's Funeral Service, which carries out 15,000 funerals a year and is the largest in north-east England, said vandalism of gravestones caused great distress to relatives. 'We would be very interested in seeing this new type of device. We would always look at anything which might help the problem of vandalism,' it said.</p>

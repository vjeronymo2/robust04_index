			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (6): The greed behind the glamour FRAUD: PREVENTION AND DETECTION by Ian Huntington Butterworths Pounds 55, 234 pages A COMPANY once claimed that a large part of its profits were earned on exports by an overseas subsidiary. But an investigator found that the subsidiary's claimed sales figures far exceeded the exports recorded in the particular country's own Official statistics. Fraud is a topical subject and this comprehensive book is being published at a time when many businesses and their auditors and other consultants are concerned at the risks. How can fraud be deterred or, if all else fails, at any rate detected? Ian Huntington, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, and currently at the Serious Fraud Office, packs a great deal of expert knowledge into this book, although he confesses that there is a risk that not only investigators but also potential new fraudsters might learn something about the tricks of the trade. Sensitive antennae are required. The author mentions the case, for example, of a Far East bank branch where an investigator noticed that the accounting machines were being used on a Sunday. It turned out that key customers of the branch were routinely allowed to produce their own versions of their bank statements. This book is not, however, intended to be a popular exposition of various entertaining scams, but rather a step-by-step guide to how the risks can be minimised. Fraud is 'concealed stealing' says the author. The task is therefore to make it more difficult for rogues to hide payments or invent transactions. Various standard dodges can be checked for, and fraudsters entrenched in an organisation may at least be discouraged if they fear that new systems increase the risks of discovery. Nevertheless it will always be harder to catch the more slippery characters who are capable of innovation. Ian Huntington provides instructions on how to carry out a fraud 'health-check' and gives checklists for investigators. Fraud, he admits, may be clever, and it may even seem glamorous. But he points out that the fraudsters are motivated by nothing more attractive than pure greed. Those seeking to deal with fraud must begin by casting aside any mystique and focusing on the unpleasant underlying reality.</p>

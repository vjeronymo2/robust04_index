			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWS THAT EZELL MAY BE REPLACED GETS MIXED REACTION  </P> <P> Orange County Latino leaders greeted news of the imminent departure of regional  immigration commissioner Harold Ezell with mixed emotions Friday. Some  professed unrestrained joy while others who had battled Ezell expressed  grudging respect for him.  </P> <P> Ezell was named the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service western  regional commissioner by President Ronald Reagan in 1983. This week, a  spokesman for the Justice Department described Ezell as a "short-termer" likely  to be replaced soon.  </P> <P> Some immigrant rights activists who once would have reacted with glee to such  news offered surprisingly mild assessments.  </P> <P> "Harold Ezell today is not the Harold Ezell that we knew when he first came  into the position," said Nativo Lopez, director of the Orange County chapter of  Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, an immigrant rights group. "Amnesty -- the wave of  people and the enthusiasm -- had an impact on his public posture. He seemed to  be more accessible, more compromising. He developed a different face."  </P> <P> That is not to say that Lopez wishes that his old adversary would be sticking  around under the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Reaping What He Sowed'  </P> <P> "Ezell is reaping what he sowed," Lopez said. "He did a lot of things that were  outlandish, and that made him the target of much criticism."  </P> <P> Jose Vargas, the Santa Ana Police Department liaison to the Latino community  and whom Ezell once accused of transporting illegal aliens, prompting police to  file a formal complaint against Ezell, said: "I think the man did some good . .  . he was a hard worker. But some people did not agree with the kind of work  that he was doing."  </P> <P> One who most certainly did not agree is Amin David, president of Los Amigos of  Orange County, a group of Latino business people.  </P> <P> "This is as important a day as Cinco de Mayo," David said. "We celebrate with  due cause. Never have we experienced the likes of an Ezell, who was outrageous  both in his policies and practices as he was in his hypocritical style . . . or  wearing our sacred Mexican hat."  </P> <P> Ezell drew both criticism and praise for donning a sombrero and singing Mexican  ranchero songs with the Trio Amnistia last year in an effort to publicize the  federal government's legalization program for undocumented aliens.  </P> <P> Ezell, now 52, become the first non-career INS bureaucrat in 20 years to be  appointed to the western regional commissioner's post. He used his position to  argue for vigorous enforcement of U.S. immigration laws and for more Border  Patrol officers. His frequent use of news conferences and other public forums  enraged opponents who saw those actions as grandstanding.  </P> <P> David also accused Ezell of fomenting a fear of a Latino "invasion" and of  foreigners in general through his actions and comments early in his tenure.  </P> <P> "It will take a long time to wear down, to where people will not be afraid of  brown-skinned people in close proximity other than in their yards," David said.  </P> <P> Manuel Pena, a founder of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Orange County,  echoed David's view that Ezell's departure will not be mourned by the local  Latino community.  </P> <P> "I think it's a great day and another opportunity for the President . . . to  appoint someone who is a little more sensitive," Pena said. "We've had years  now of dealing with Mr. Ezell and his calloused approach . . . . It's nothing  personal against the man, but I don't agree with his interpretation of how  things should be done."  </P> <P> Pena said that Orange County Latinos were particularly incensed over the INS's  continuing its sweeps of street corners during the amnesty period and over the  arrest of several illegal aliens in an Orange church during a Catholic Mass.  </P> <P> Last month, the INS sent a new community liaison to a meeting with Latino  leaders in Santa Ana, hoping to establish closer ties, Pena said. But the  consensus at the meeting was that as long as Ezell was in office, the  relationship would remain marked by distrust.  </P> <P> "We listened to him for about an hour," Pena said. "We made it clear we weren't  there to kill the messenger. . . . We said: 'Look, we've heard the message . .  . . We think it's too little too late. We've already told them (the INS) what  we want. It's time for them to put a plan into action.' "  </P> <P> Father Jaime Soto, the Diocese of Orange vicar for the Hispanic community,  recalled that Ezell assisted the church in bringing in from Mexico family  members of Nadia Puente, the 9-year-old Santa Ana girl who was murdered earlier  this year.  </P> <P> "There have been those situations on individual cases where he has demonstrated  a spirit of compassion," Soto said. "I have been appreciative of those moments.  I regret it was not more reflective of the general policies and practices of  the INS."  </P> <P> Soto said he hopes that whoever succeeds Ezell will change what Soto sees as a  generally restrictive attitude on the part of the INS toward immigration policy  to a more open one.  </P> <P> "We have always been trying to amplify the opportunities that have been  available," Soto said. "With the INS -- with legalization in particular -- it's  always been a matter of . . . trying to interpret it narrowly."  </P> <P> Laguna Beach Deputy Police Chief Jim Spreine, for one, said he would miss  Ezell. The INS has swept through Laguna Beach on many occasions, apprehending  illegal aliens along Coast Highway, but Spreine said the immigration agency has  respected the Police Department's policy to not assist in such raids.  </P> <P> "I'll be sad to see him leave," Spreine said. "We might have had some  differences of opinion, but it never estranged the working relationship that we  had."  </P></p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News - Wace: New technology, rights issues and acquisitions fuel the rapid growth MR JOHN Clegg's departure throws a spotlight on the past eight years of Wace Group's extraordinary expansion, one of the most dramatic corporate transformations of the 1980s - and on the last three years, when its glittering record began to falter. Under Mr Clegg's direction Wace swelled through some 40 acquisitions to become the world's largest pre-press printer, repeatedly treading a path from its north London headquarters to the Stock Exchange to raise more money. But shareholders, at first dazzled by the young managing director's transformation of the profits, gradually became more worried that it was simply a one-man band, and after the near disastrous 1990 rights issue they began to ask whether the magic had gone. Clegg saved Wace from near bankruptcy in 1983 when he chose it as the vehicle for his entry into the business world. It had lost about Pounds 1m in the three years before his arrival, but in his eyes it was an ideal shell company: it had a stock market quote, and needed the injection of only a small amount of capital to recover. He joined Wace's board together with his friend Mr Michael Berry, who was owner of a small printing company. Mr Clegg had no experience of printing but he did have capital - his cousin, Miss Jayne Wright, had left her small inheritance in his hands when she emigrated to South Africa. Miss Wright, who is now married and living in South Africa, took a 24 per cent stake in 1983, then underwrote a Pounds 610,000 rights issue in May 1984 giving her a third of the company. Two years of text-book cost-cutting followed before Wace made its first acquisition, of a rival printer, for Pounds 330,000. Mr Clegg's argument was that pre-press, which prepares text and photographs for publication, was the most fundamental stage of printing but had been commercially neglected. New technology was transforming the techniques, by enabling images to be captured digitally and so allowed photographs and page lay-outs to be altered by computers. But the traditional family 'corner-shops' which made up most of the highly-fragmented pre-press market could often not afford to keep up with the changes. Mr Clegg argued that Wace should keep investing in the latest equipment and keep mopping up its tiny competitors, so that it could rapidly become the biggest player as the market consolidated and became more sophisticated. If additional encouragement were needed for his masterplan it came in the form of an advertising and magazine boom, which stimulated the demand for pre-press. In 1983 Wace's turnover was Pounds 4.5m; it had soared to Pounds 235.2m in 1990 by swallowing one competitor every two to three months. The fuel for that rocket was capital. In four years Wace had four large rights issues, all of which had a poor reception in the City. The first, for Pounds 16m in September 1987, fell foul of the October stock market crash. In October 1988 the company raised Pounds 34.4m for the acquisition of Techtron, the largest colour pre-press services group in the US. But only 20 per cent was taken up by institutions and the rest was left with underwriters, because the stock market suddenly slumped again. Shortly afterwards, on November 17 1988, Miss Wright sold 2m shares at 295p, the bulk of her total holding of 2.866m shares, and sold the rest shortly after. For an initial investment of around Pounds 1m, she made an estimated Pounds 8.5m on selling the stake. It is not known whether her cousin who effected the transformation received any of this. Mr Clegg's own holding has always been small; at the end of 1990 he held just under 100,000 shares. Wace waited scarcely a year before calling, in September 1989, for Pounds 44.6m. But again the market fell precipitously during the rights period and again only 20 per cent of the offer was taken up. The pattern led to City jokes that Wace's cash calls were the best way of forecasting a market plunge. But many institutions were still enthusiastic supporters of the company and the shares eventually recovered and rose above the rights issue prices, helped by several sets of excellent profits from the company. However, in August 1990 the company went back to the market for Pounds 37m in convertible shares, partly to finance the takeover of its financially-troubled rival, Parkway, for Pounds 12m. This time less than 4 per cent was taken up - it was issued just before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Institutions had also begun to tire of the constant calls for cash, and advertising had begun to deteriorate. Some had also become wary about the vulnerability of 'one-man bands'. Last year Wace unveiled the first serious blemish in its growth with a 34 per cent fall in interim profits to June 1991, blaming the recession-hit advertising market and a sharp increase in interest charges. Parkway, as Wace's shareholders had feared, had continued to have problems, particularly in its US subsidiaries. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 8.11m even though turnover rose from Pounds 104.2m to Pounds 148.3m. Mr Clegg was nevertheless upbeat, estimating that a quarter of his competitors had shut down: 'I would say that in two years' time we will look back on this recession and say it was probably the best thing that ever happened to us.' Despite recent disappointments, there were still many investors, particularly in the US, who were happy to share his optimism. They are now trying to assess the prospects for the company without its most charismatic director.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRM WINS $1.5 MILLION IN CORPORATE SABOTAGE CASE;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: A LOCAL PRINTING SUPPLY COMPANY CLAIMED THAT A NEW JERSEY FIRM USED  UNFAIR TACTICS TO DRAW ITS MAJOR CLIENT.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court jury Thursday ruled that a New Jersey company  sabotaged the business operations of a local printing supplies firm. The jury  awarded the local company more than $1.5 million in damages.  </P> <P> The verdict upheld a claim by American Technical Supply of Los Angeles, which  sued Harold M. Pitman Co. of Secaucus, N.J., for unfair competition and  deception. Both companies provide publishers with graphic arts supplies and  with film and plates used in the printing process.  </P> <P> The 12-member jury heard Pitman and American Technical accuse each other of  competing unfairly for the business of a client they once served simultaneously  -- Treasure Chest Advertising Co., a Glendora-based publisher of newspaper  advertising inserts.  </P> <P> American Technical said in its complaint that it started supplying Treasure  Chest's West Coast operations in 1978, and Treasure Chest became its largest  customer, generating $5 million worth of business a year. In 1981, American  Technical helped Pitman become Treasure Chest's East Coast supplier. The two  suppliers split the business geographically, the complaint said.  </P> <P> However, with the help of an American Technical employee -- Virginia Moore --  Pitman began to disrupt American Technical's relationship with Treasure Chest,  finally causing Treasure Chest to drop American Technical as a supplier, the  suit said.  </P> <P> Moore, an account representative responsible for keeping Treasure Chest  adequately stocked with American Technical supplies, purposely allowed the  supply levels to dwindle on occasions in 1984 and 1985, according to the  complaint.  </P> <P> American Technical's attorney, Allan Browne, told the jury that Moore was a  disgruntled employee who tried to hurt her employer. He said Moore falsely told  Treasure Chest that American Technical had not been a cooperative supplier and  had difficulties meeting stock orders. Browne said Moore also helped Pitman set  up operations in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Treasure Chest ended its relationship with American Technical Aug. 31, 1985 --  the same day Moore resigned to join Pitman, the complaint said.  </P> <P> Pitman failed to act in good faith and dealt with American Technical unfairly,  the jury verdict said. American Technical had sought $3 million in damages but  the jury awarded the firm $1,534,100. Pitman executives were not immediately  available for comment.  </P></p>

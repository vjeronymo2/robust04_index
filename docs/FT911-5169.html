			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Morgan Crucible However it is presented, the Pounds 96m rights issue accompanying Morgan Crucible's annual results is pretty cheeky. The ink has barely dried on last summer's Pounds 79m acquisition-driven cash call, when new shares were offered at 30p more than yesterday's issue. While there was a healthy Pounds 10.3m profits contribution from the businesses bought with the proceeds, Morgan shares have underperformed the index by 11 per cent since last July and by 24 per cent over five years. Yesterday's call at a mere 218p was not helped by accounting of the sort discouraged by the new Accounting Standards Board. A one-off Pounds 4.3m currency gain was taken straight into operating profit, while Pounds 2.5m of back-dated interest receivable was curiously booked to financing charges when it should logically have been treated as either an extraordinary item or an occasion to adjust previous years' figures. This distorted the picture of what otherwise was a poor second half in which underlying profits fell by more than 15 per cent from 1989 to Pounds 26.2m, and margins slipped below 10 per cent. Put like that, the rights case looks somewhat weaker. All the same, there are signs that Morgan has hit upon a better strategic plan. Getting out of defence and car care marks the expensive end of a failed 10-year experiment, but the core businesses should be the stronger if some of the promised acquisitions can be completed at bombed-out prices. Patient shareholders will probably find the 7.6 per cent yield on the new shares irresistible. Morgan may be given the benefit of the doubt this time, but it will need to mind its manners.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Textiles behind fall at British Mohair A setback in its textile activities was behind a 20 per cent annual profits contraction at British Mohair Holdings. On turnover ahead from Pounds 36.5m to Pounds 39.2m, pre-tax profits in 1992 amounted to Pounds 2.1m, down from Pounds 2.62m last time. Mr Charles Fenton, chairman, said that both British Mohair Spinners and Geo Ackroyd had suffered from reduced activity. Any improvement in profit was unlikely until trading levels increased. The final dividend is held at 7.1p, maintaining the total at 8.5p, covered 1.3 times by earnings of 10.8p (13.71p) per share.</p>

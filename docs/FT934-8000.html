			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (1): A fraught period ahead - As the people of Hungary prepare for an election, they can ponder the costs of a turbulent period of change in their country. The coalition government has achieved peace, liberty and prosperity for some, but the economy is still struggling HUNGARIANS go to the polls in six months' time to give their verdict on a unique phenomenon in post-communist Europe - a democratically-elected coalition government which will have served its full four-year parliamentary term. In the run-up, the electors of this small, landlocked country of 10m people, who share an impenetrable language and a thousand years of settlement in the Carpathian basin, are pondering on the achievements and costs of a turbulent period of change. The Soviet army, which re-invaded the country in 1956 to suppress Hungarian aspirations for freedom and democracy, has quietly departed. The cautious economic reforms begun more than 20 years ago by the late Janos Kadar's 'goulash communist' regime have been used as a springboard for the transition to a fully-fledged market economy. The crucial decision to honour the burdensome foreign debts inherited from the communist years has helped give foreign investors the confidence to inject Dollars 5.5bn of equity capital and continue buying Hungarian government bonds - Dollars 4bn worth in 1993 alone. Above all, the three-party coalition government led by Mr Jozsef Antall, the historian-archivist turned politican who led his Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) to victory in June 1990, has maintained internal stability and proceeded with building the institutions required to give substance to democracy. Hungary was in many ways better prepared than most in the region for a system change. But breathing life into institutions such as parliament and the legal system, and removing the habits of thought control and mind manipulation in other crucial areas such as the media, has been neither easy nor yet complete. The government's controversial closure of the second channel TV news programme has been widely interpreted as an attempt to stifle criticism in the run up to elections, and as a sop to right wing nationalists whose voice in the state-run media has been increased by personnel changes. The key institutions managing privatisation and macro-economic policy - the State Property Agency (SPA), the National Bank of Hungary and AV RT, the recently formed state asset management corporation, also have their critics. But the dedicated, high quality officials who run them are impressively capable and have gained valuable experience over the past four years. Hungary has also been fortunate in the quality of its foreign investors. It has had its carpet-baggers, and would-be small investors who have fallen foul of the home-grown Mafia. But Hungary has also welcomed a host of top rank multinational corporations, including Alcoa, Electrolux, General Electric, General Motors, Ford, Suzuki and Unilever. All are intent on integrating their new Hungarian subsidiaries into their existing global operations and bringing invaluable know-how, technology and managerial expertise in their wake. Expatriates of Hungarian origin have also played a valuable role in trying to re-tie links with a severed past. An outstanding example is the way Mr George Lang, the famous American-Hungarian restaurateur, and his partner Mr Ronald Lauder, have recreated Gundel's restaurant, the pre-war Mecca of Hungarian high-cuisine. After a shaky start when Croatia received guns illegally from Hungarian sources, careful diplomacy has kept Hungary free from entanglement in the bitter ethnic wars across its southern border in former Yugoslavia. Budapest has also sought to defuse potential conflicts over dams, frontiers and ethnic minorities which have arisen with the birth of independent Slovakia and outbreaks of intolerant nationalism in Romania, another neighbour with a sizeable ethnic Hungarian minority. Peace, liberty and moderate prosperity are respectable achievements. But how much thanks the ruling parties - the MDF, the Christan Democrats and the now bitterly divided Smallholder peasants party - receive from the electorate next May remains to be seen. The coalition's original game plan called for an economic upswing to begin in 1993, leading to re-election on a rising and palpable tide of economic well-being. Instead, the economy is still struggling, like the heavily laden barges which push upstream against the current of the River Danube as it flows under the bridges of Budapest. Some of the problems are home-grown. The disappointing pace of privatisation has left the bulk of big enterprises still in state hands. The losses accumulated by the state sector, and bad loans granted to the private sector by inexperienced bankers, have brought many state banks to the point of technical insolvency. Large financial infusions are needed to bring their capital adequacy ratios up to the minimum internationally required levels. At the same time unemployment, which has stabilised at around 13 per cent of the workforce, has raised demands on a state budget already burdened by heavy pension and other commitments. The net result is a budget deficit which will require politically painful pruning if the 1994 public-sector shortfall is to be kept under the 5.5 per cent of GDP ceiling required by the standby agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund in September. Government spending and a 25 per cent fall in the value of exports has already led to tensions in money markets and a shock 5 per cent rise in central bank lending rates in recent weeks. Economists fear that the private sector, including the parallel 'black economy', risks being crowded out of the market for working and investment capital. Starving the private sector would inevitably depress private sector investment and future job creation. Not all the economic and political woes are policy-linked. The sharp decline in exports is partly a sign of an over-valued currency, and has been rectified by recent devaluations of the forint. But it also reflects the recession in western markets, especially the all-important German market, and the impact of another year of severe drought on farm output. Equally important, however, is the widespread confusion over land ownership caused by the break-up of the old state co-operatives. Regional instabilty is another negative factor. The UN-imposed trade embargo on former Yugoslavia has cost Hungary an estimated Dollars 1bn. The embargo has not only decimated a once flourishing bilateral trade but hindered passage along the Danube and cut income from transit traffic to and from southern Europe and the Middle East. Tourism receipts have also lost their buoyancy. Without the hoped-for boost from economic recovery the governing coalition faces a tough fight against the Socialist Party, led by Mr Gyula Horn, whose prospects for emerging as the largest single party have soared after the recent electoral come-back of the former communists in Poland. Even so, it is unlikely that the socialists, with few allies in sight, would be able to form the next government. More probable is some form of coalition between the MDF and Fidesz, the Young Democrat party led by Mr Viktor Orban, after elections which are likely to see a substantial shift in allegiances and voting patterns compared with 1990. Such an outcome, leaving both the right wing nationalists and socialists in opposition alongside the probably reduced liberal Free Democrats, would confirm Hungary's attachment to moderate, democratic government and its commitment to market reforms. But six months is a long time in politics, and they promise to be somewhat fraught.</p>

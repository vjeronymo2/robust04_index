			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Technology: A cautionary computer tale - Technically Speaking THE acquittal last week of Paul Bedworth, the 19-year-old former hacker charged under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, begs several questions, not least whether the act is ripe for review and redraft. Before the UK lawmakers start to fiddle with the fine detail, however, two points need to be resolved. First, is Bedworth's case evidence of a genuinely new social phenomenon, in which immature and susceptible minds are being damaged through prolonged exposure to personal computers? Second, what measures can individuals and organisations take to protect their computer systems against unauthorised access, whether motivated by malice or not? Bedworth's case raised widespread interest because it was the first test of the Computer Misuse Act, designed specifically to put a stop to hacking and other attempts to interfere with computer systems. He admitted he hacked into a number of systems including one operated by the Financial Times. To secure a guilty verdict under the act, the prosecution had to show he intended to modify the systems he broke into. His acquittal was secured on psychiatric evidence that he had become clinically addicted to hacking; he no longer knew why he did it and was no more able to stop than a heroin addict can give up the drug without help. There are fears Bedworth's acquittal could form the basis of a 'hackers' charter', the green light for an army of computer-literate hooligans to pillage the world's databases at will, pleading insanity when caught. Certainly, future cases will require the most careful assessment. Assuming, as one must, that the psychiatrists interpreted Bedworth's symptoms accurately, however, there are profound questions to be asked about our understanding of the effects of exposure to computers. Bedworth, as his barrister pointed out, is a second-generation hacker, an individual who grew up as familiar with computers as earlier generations did with television. There are still unresolved arguments about the influence of television on individual behaviour, so it is no surprise that almost nothing is known of the consequences of close contact with personal computers over a protracted period, especially where individuals with personality disorders are concerned. Computers are now bought for young children on the grounds they are educational accessories. It is clearly an area that would repay further study. The computer is the most complex machine mankind has invented; for some it can be a tool, a way of amplifying personal abilities. For others, as Bedworth and others have so amply demonstrated, it can be an escape to another kind of existence where the rules and disciplines of the real world have been suspended. Computer users and suppliers have to live in that real world and it is high time they took their responsibilities seriously. It is a nonsense that a youngster with a cheap microcomputer was able to break into important computer systems with, apparently, no great effort. As the British Computer Society observed, the law can no more protect those who do not safeguard their information systems than it can prevent burglary at unprotected premises. The greatest benefit of the Bedworth case may be to raise awareness of the threats to computer systems through the telecommunications links which connect them together. Premises are locked on the assumption that an open door is an invitation to crime. Computer users have to assume their systems are under continuous threat and apply the appropriate safeguards. Some are cheap and simple - an automatic call back device which only allows access from authorised telephone numbers, for example. Unless computer users protect their systems adequately, invoking the law against obsessed individuals as Bedworth has been portrayed seems merely vindictive.</p>

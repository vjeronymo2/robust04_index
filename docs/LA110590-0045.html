			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> A HARD LESSON;  </P> <P> FOR HOMELESS CHILDREN, GETTING AN EDUCATION IS A CHALLENGE  </P> <P> The term homeless conjures up many images: disheveled drifters trudging through  downtown Ventura, drunken men sleeping it off in Oxnard's Plaza Park,  weather-beaten women panhandling at grocery stores in Simi Valley.  </P> <P> What may not leap to mind are images of children -- homeless kids struggling to  learn despite frequent absences and moves from school to school; children  skipping school to baby-sit while their parents look for work; children who  face taunts and snickers when the school bus stops at the campground where they  live.  </P> <P> Of the estimated 4,000 homeless people living in Ventura County, about a third  are school-age children, according to county social workers. Although many of  them attend school, lack of a stable home makes getting an education almost  impossible.  </P> <P> "Nobody focuses very well on academics when their lives are in chaos," said  Nancy Nazario, homeless ombudsman for the Ventura County Public Social Services  Agency.  </P> <P> Jeff Nelsen, principal of Lincoln Elementary School in Ventura, said that last  year he had a pupil from a homeless family who had attended 18 schools. She was  only in the third grade.  </P> <P> "She was performing at kindergarten level in reading and math but was obviously  average in intelligence," Nelsen said. He said school officials and social  workers helped the girl's family find a permanent residence in Lincoln's  attendance area so she could stay at the school.  </P> <P> Today she is in fourth grade at Lincoln and is performing almost at the  appropriate level for her age, Nelsen said.  </P> <P> But many more homeless children continue to come and go at Lincoln, which has  one of the highest transient rates in the county, Nelsen said. Only two-thirds  of the students stay for an entire school year, he said. The other one-third  turns over 3 1/2 times a year.  </P> <P> Lincoln gets a lot of homeless children because it is near motels on Thompson  Boulevard where the county puts up welfare families, Nelsen said. E.P. Foster  Elementary, De Anza Middle School and Ventura High School also have significant  numbers of homeless students, district officials said. Homeless students also  attend schools in Oxnard and Ojai, officials there said.  </P> <P> The term homeless, according to the federal government, applies to anyone who  lacks a "fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence." The definition takes  in people who live in congregate shelters, welfare motels or anywhere not  ordinarily used as a permanent dwelling.  </P> <P> It also includes Lot 37 at Camp Comfort County Park near Ojai, where Dale  Schmidt, Shirley Chambers and their four children have eked out an existence  since July.  </P> <P> When they arrived, camp manager Barbara Warfield recalls, "it was like 'The  Grapes of Wrath.' " The family, which lives on Schmidt's $140-a-week disability  checks and Chambers' $86-a-week welfare grants, had been evicted from a house  in Ventura. At first, they slept in their two old cars. Then somebody gave them  a tent. Finally they acquired a small one-room trailer where all six sleep --  Schmidt and Chambers on the floor.  </P> <P> "With four kids, it is very rough," said Schmidt, a roofer who injured his back  three years ago. "I don't consider myself homeless. It's better than sleeping  in the car."  </P> <P> In the morning, their son Michael, 7, daughter Renee, 6, and about 10 other  children who live at the campground board a school bus for Mira Monte  Elementary School just outside Ojai.  </P> <P> For Michael, a second-grader, it's his second school. He spent first grade at  E.P. Foster and liked it better than Mira Monte. "My teacher at Foster was real  nice, and I can't go there any more and visit her. I'm sorry I had to leave  there."  </P> <P> Mira Monte isn't too bad, he said, but "one kid in my class says Camp Comfort  is a stupid place to live."  </P> <P> The principal at Mira Monte, Larry Hartmann, said the children from the  campground are "a good bunch, considering their living conditions, the hubbub  of the campground and all. Their parents seem to be supportive."  </P> <P> One problem, he said, is that the school can't call the parents if a child from  the campground becomes sick or has some other problem at school. Another  hindrance is a county rule that forbids staying at the park more than 30  consecutive days. One night a month, each family at the park has to stay  somewhere else, and sometimes the kids miss school, Hartmann said.  </P> <P> "There's probably a higher rate of movement and they're less likely to finish a  school year," he said.  </P> <P> Nelsen at Lincoln Elementary said homeless schoolchildren have to deal with the  stigma of being poor. "It affects their image of themselves," he said. "Often  they only have a couple of outfits of clothing, and they're wearing the same  thing all the time. For some, it's hard to get showers and clean clothes."  </P> <P> And it's harder to feel comfortable in class, he said. "They move so much, it's  difficult for them to develop friendships and feel that they fit in."  </P> <P> Social workers and education officials say the districts have flexible  enrollment policies for homeless children.  </P> <P> "They don't have to have a home" to enroll, said Michael Sellwood, director of  administrative services for Ventura Unified. "We have had homeless families  living in the parking lot of the district office. If people move here for a  week and want to enroll, we enroll them."  </P> <P> The Oxnard Union High School District offers independent study programs or  alternative school enrollment to homeless students, Assistant Supt. Gary Davis  said.  </P> <P> The problem, officials say, is lack of affordable housing.  </P> <P> "Housing is the only way to solve the problem," said Nazario, the county social  worker. "To set up education programs without stable housing, why bother? I  think the schools will have a difficult time until these kids are housed  stably."  </P> <P> The parents of homeless families usually want their children to go to school.  "They know the value of an education," Ventura Unified teacher Beverly Thanos  said. "They've gone without it."  </P> <P> Thanos has encountered many homeless children in nearly 40 years of teaching.  </P> <P> "Even if they are in class, they often are not functioning," she said. "The  fear of being thrown out of your house, no food -- all of these things take  just an unbelievable toll on a child's life."  </P> <P> Thanos is a "home teacher," an instructor who normally teaches in the houses of  children with broken legs and other physical problems. She has followed  families from campground to campground, park to park, even into other school  districts.  </P> <P> "There's never a chance for those cherubs to go through a whole school year,"  she said. "I've seen several children who started in school, were doing  beautifully, then they couldn't pay the rent so out they went. I never saw them  again.  </P> <P> "It just crushes you to see these kids not having a chance."  </P> <P> It also makes her mad, Thanos said. "All we're doing is perpetuating this  welfare thing. How are they going to get off it without an education?"  </P> <P> At Camp Comfort, Schmidt and Chambers say they expect Lot 37 to be home for  several more months, and Michael and Renee will probably finish out the school  year at Mira Monte.  </P> <P> It will take at least that long before they can come up with the first and last  month's rent, a deposit and utility fees needed to move into a house that will  accommodate a family of six, Schmidt said. "It's going to be tough to get out  of here."  </P> <P> That suits Michael just fine.  </P> <P> "There's mountains to climb and stuff," he said, as he pedaled a bicycle with a  flat tire along a dusty trail.  </P> <P> But Renee, who was watching television in a neighbor's trailer the other day,  said she misses the house they had in Ventura. "The kids on TV with houses and  stuff, that's what I want," she said.  </P></p>

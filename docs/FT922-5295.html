			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (3): Heirs not so apparent are waiting in the wings - Some of the leaders who could one day win the top job THE Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) is a tightly disciplined and very effective machine. It has dominated Spanish politics for nearly a decade because it is better organised than any of its national conservative or radical rivals. But its very discipline has meant it has been impossible for good politicians to project themselves beyond the party and, assuming Mr Felipe Gonzalez fights only one more election as Prime Minister, it is hard to be precise about his possible successors. An election has to be held before October 1993 and the next one four years later. All that is too late for one of the wisest men in the Cabinet, the foreign minister, Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, and too early, probably, for one of the brightest battle tested politicians in the party, Mr Ramon Jauregui, PSOE leader in the Basque Country. Two things are, however, likely: a replacement to fight the last election of the century will come from within the party and, second, anyone too closely associated with the former left wing deputy prime minister and current party vice president, Mr Alfonso Guerra, would probably be unelectable. Five possible candidates to replace Mr Gonzalez are briefly profiled, in alphabetical order, below: Jose Bono Martinez: A lawyer and president of the autonomous region of Castilla-La Mancha in central Spain since 1983. He was once considered a confidante of Alfonso Guerra, who runs the party machine. But Felipe Gonzalez has begun to lean on regional leaders like Mr Bono to offset left wing pressure from party headquarters in Madrid, drawing them closer to Government and away from party. Mr Bono is developing a reputation as a socialist powerbroker and allowed himself to be associated in public with the conservative finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, when the latter was being shunned by many party colleagues. That did not necessarily mean support, but rather an attempt to appear above intra-party bickering. The press likes him. Jose Borrell Fontelles: Young and intense, Borrell is minister of Public Works and Transport, the biggest spender in the Cabinet. Secretary of State for the revenue service until his elevation to the Cabinet last year, Borrell has, along with the Prime Minister, probably the most pristine reputation in Government. It was Borrell who persuaded tax evasion charges against the brother of former deputy premier Alfonso Guerra. Increasingly independent, he is not greatly liked in party headquarters but that may not be a long-term handicap. The longer Gonzalez remains in office, the brighter Borrell's prospects. As minister for public works, he is able to score political points by associating himself with the country's grandest projects. Narcis Serra i Serra: Deputy Prime Minister and the most likely successor to Gonzalez in the short term. A consummate politician, Serra has been given the task of smoothing poor relations between the Government and party officials unhappy with conservative economic policy. Also, he is Catalan (and speaks it) which is a plus for any PSOE leader as Spain's regions - Catalonia being the strongest - press for more autonomy. An accomplished pianist, Serra was Mayor of Barcelona in the 1970s and made his political mark as Defence Minister between 1982 and 1991, familiarising an unhappy military with the joys of democracy. The party machine is warming to him but he has little public charisma and would not be an impressive campaigner. Javier Solana Madariaga: Education Minister and former culture minister and government spokesman. Solana has managed to push controversial education reforms through without alienating the unions or students. He nevertheless keeps a low profile. His position in the party is strong and he is the senior Madrileno in the executive. Solana has managed to escape being identified too closely with either the left or right of the party, though for a while in the 1980s his brother's chairmanship of the telephone monopoly Telefonica and, later, the state-owned television and radio stations invited some accusations of nepotism. Probably a conservative, he would become a compromise candidate in a race between stronger claimants. Carlos Solchaga Catalan: The architect of the socialist government's rapid drift towards liberal market economic policies, Solchaga probably has more political enemies than any other Spanish politician today. He has a small power base in his home region of Navarra but the party is deeply suspicious of him. Relenting on big budget cuts planned for this year helped that relationship. Mostly, Solchaga speaks to Gonzalez and Serra, who then tell the party what new misery he plans to inflict on socialism. It makes it unlikely the party could ever bring itself to elect him leader, or prime ministerial candidate, but that does not mean he would not want the job. Confident and dismissive of doubters, he is the best infighter in the Cabinet.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lena Slachmuiljder] </F>   [Text] Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini will remain the  official trustee of all land belonging to the formal KwaZulu  homeland, but will not own or have governing rights over the  land. This is the result of a report made to the Cabinet this  week by Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom, who chaired a  commission to investigate the implications of the Ingonyama  Trust Act.    The Act, which makes the king a trustee over about  three-million hectares, was singed by former State President  F.W. de Klerk two days before the April 27 elections. The Act  came under wide criticism because neither the Transitional  Executive Council (TEC) nor the ANC had been consulted before it  was passed.    Hanekom said that the Act would need to be amended or  substituted to clarify that as a trustee, the king is not the  sole owner of the land, nor is he able to act in any governing  capacity over the affairs of the people living on it.    For example, issues of tribal disputes would not be decided  by the King purely because he is the trustee. Hanekom also said  that the Act would be amended to ensure that amenities for  public use as well as urban areas that fall under the territory  will not be under the control of the King, but will instead be  governed by the provincial government.    Furthermore, the people living on the land will be  guaranteed  security of tenure, and will be able to convert that tenure to  ownership if need be.    Land Affairs spokesperson Helmuth Schlenther said that  although the King was vested with "thousands" of hereditary  powers as King, he would not, as the trustee, be able to use  these powers over the Trust land.    He stressed that all of the people living on the land were  the official beneficiaries of the Trust, and could thus veto any  decision made by the King concerning the land or its inhabitants.    "Basically, the King can't do anything without the consent  of  the people living on the land," Schlenther said.    This erases concern by some sectors that the King, as  trustee, would be able to appoint or remove chiefs if they fell  in or out of favour. It also means that because of the King's  lack of control, other than ceremonial, over the land, attempts  by the Inkatha Freedom Party-dominated provincial government to  use the King's power over the land and its people to gain  political support will be unlikely.</p>

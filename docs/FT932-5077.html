			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: UK house prices The two main house price indexes may have been pointing in opposite directions this week, but there is no doubting the upward trend. There are sound reasons for the increase. As house prices have fallen and earnings risen, the market has started to return towards stable valuations. When prices are compared to earnings, houses are now more affordable than at any time since 1985. In addition the cost of servicing the loans is at a 25-year low. Repayments as a percentage of earnings have fallen from 45 per cent in 1989 to 15 per cent now. Value may underpin the market, but price inflation is unlikely to be rapid. Some 50,000 repossessed houses are currently on the market and another 70,000 may be repossessed this year. That compares with only 140,000 new starts, and will be a drag on a market which will struggle to turn over 1.2m properties in 1993. The market is also gridlocked by a lack of good property on sale, while with the experience of the last three years still fresh, buyers are not even prepared to bid up for prime houses. Price rises will also be patchy, with negative equity slowing recovery in the south more than elsewhere. The highly priced studio flats and rabbit-hutch conversions which soared at the market's peak market will also languish as first time buyers leapfrog them for better value homes. Smaller family houses which trade between second time buyers may also lag, as potential buyers take time to work through negative equity and rebuild deposits. There is a recovery on the way, but not for everyone.</p>

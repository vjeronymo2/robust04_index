			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Living with the bomb: North Korea's actions have highlighted flaws in the nuclear treaty The biggest problem facing American diplomats, ahead of Friday's negotiating session with the North Koreans in Geneva about their secret nuclear programme, is to guess the ultimate objectives of the Stalinist regime in Pyongyang. Optimists like former US President Jimmy Carter, who made a lightning freelance trip to Pyongyang last month, hope Kim Il Sung may be ready to trade his nuclear ambitions against international recognition and economic aid. But pessimists fear that he is committed to the nuclear weapons programme. Carter may know something we don't; but the circumstantial evidence, from all the ducking and weaving over many years, tends to support the pessimists. North Korea was always a reluctant member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It signed the treaty under pressure from the Soviet Union in 1985, but it did not ratify the accompanying inspection arrangements with the International Atomic Energy Agency until 1992, five years after the NPT deadline. Not long after ratification, North Korea informed the IAEA that it had seven nuclear installations; the agency had only previously been aware of two. But when the IAEA demanded to inspect two hitherto secret sites at Yongbyon, North Korea announced it would leave the treaty. Under pressure from the US and others, North Korea backed off; but last month, after further hindrances over inspection, it announced that it would leave the IAEA. Because of Pyongyang's obstructiveness, we still do not know what has been going on at the secret nuclear sites. But the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty cannot remain un-scathed by the North Korean experience; the question is whether it is fatally damaged. Current speculation is that North Korea may be diverting fuel rods from nuclear reactors to acquire and reprocess plutonium, which could be used for nuclear weapons. But American intelligence believes North Korea already has one or two nuclear weapons, which it had constructed before 1992; maybe that is why it delayed so long in submitting its pretend compliance with the NPT. Here we have a classic stable-door dilemma. If North Korea does have a couple of nuclear weapons, there is no point in the Americans raising the issue, because the North Koreans will deny it; they will certainly not leave them out in the open to be inspected. Therefore, the Americans are almost bound to turn a blind eye to this more fundamental problem. What they are left with instead is a deadpan debate over the controversial fuel rods. The trouble is that this is a negotiation. The Americans want North Korea to conform absolutely to the NPT and reaffirm its formal status as a non-nuclear state. Since no negotiation ever leads to 100 per cent success for one side, this result is impossible. So if there is a negotiated settlement, it must involve a significant weakening of the rules of the NPT. Many people look for a scapegoat; and the first scapegoat they spot is the IAEA. 'Aha]' they say; 'if the IAEA inspection systems had been more rigorous, we would have known about the North Koreans long ago, and about the wicked Iraqis before them.' Well, they may have a point; but it is, in any political reality you or I would recognise, only a small point; for the issues at stake are much more complex than that. In the world of arms control, verification is a subject on which there is only one certainty: you cannot have certainty. It may be possible to imagine an international inspection regime so thorough and so intrusive that no state would have a secret it could call its own. In theory this would guarantee complete compliance with any arms control treaty; but the treaty would not be signed, let alone ratified, by a single one of the 160 sovereign states in the UN. The best you can hope for is some degree of probability; the arms control experts will argue till dawn over how much is enough. But the starting point is that an arms control treaty should seem, to all the sovereign signatories, to be self-justifying in itself: on balance, joining should seem a better bargain than not joining. For then verification can play the modest role of circumstantial indicator of willing compliance, not pretend to be an alternative to it. There are two reasons why these principles are not working out in the case of the NPT. The first is that this treaty is deeply discriminatory between the signatories. Its very purpose is to discriminate against non-nuclear-weapon states; and, as a result, its inspection regime also discriminates against them. Moreover, the NPT mainly discriminates against less developed states, because some of them are still tempted by the nuclear option. The NPT's second weakness is that it is a child of the cold war, the product of the arms control which grew out of the nuclear confrontation between the two superpowers. North Korea and Iraq signed, only because they were put under pressure by the Soviet Union; and today no other country can exert that pressure on them. Last November, US President Bill Clinton said: 'North Korea cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb.' But the administration subsequently backed off from that absolute position, no doubt because it was not sure how it could be enforced. Henry Kissinger, former secretary of state, seems to believe that the US should be prepared to go to war to enforce it; but this seems unlikely. We may have to live with the possibility, or perhaps the probability, that North Korea, like Israel (client of the US), is an undeclared nuclear power; because we can't do anything reasonable about it.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Arts: Colourful Berlioz A decade or so ago the BBC Symphony Orchestra would probably have called its exploration of the music of Hector Berlioz, which began in the Royal Festival Hall on Saturday, simply 'Berlioz Series'. These days, in deference to the marketing men, such projects have snappy titles, often only tangentially relevant. In this case, however, the title 'Reinventing the Orchestra' actually encapsulated Berlioz's achievement as a creator of sounds and colours which until then had been essayed only tentatively by his contemporaries. For Berlioz, orchestration was an integral part of music. His artistic intentions in the Symphonie fantastique - not least its autobiographical content - were made explicit by the composer. Yet there is no sense in which Berlioz's orchestral technique, even at this early stage in his career, lags behind his poetic vision. He may have become more resourceful as he grew older, as was evident by the nimbly delivered Corsair overture which began the evening, but the orchestral effects of the Symphonie are precise, from the Chiaroscuro delicacy of the opium-induced 'Reveries' to the brashly scored nightmare of the 'Witches' Sabbath'. Given the hackneyed status of the work, Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra turned in a surprisingly fresh and powerful performance, notable for the assurance of the solo instrumental contributions and the cohesion of the ensemble work. Berlioz's legacy continues in the importance which many of today's composers attach to sound as pure sensation. Future concerts in the series (7 and 10 October) will include works by two of Scandinavia's leading young composers, Magnus Lindberg and Kaija Saariaho, already well known in the UK, for whom colour is indispensable. On Saturday it was the turn of the Dutchman Tristan Keuris, whose Concerto for Saxophone Quartet was receiving its belated London premiere eight years after it was completed. Despatched with virtuosity by its dedicatees, the Rascher Saxophone Quartet, it emerged as an attractive, rumbustuous jeu d'esprit, overlong perhaps, but teeming with incidental detail and displaying an orchestral facility of which Berlioz himself might have been proud.</p>

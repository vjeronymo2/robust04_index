			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / A shine on its financial face: Domestic and foreign pressures are forcing reform on Germany's capital markets German bankers are normally a self-confident breed. Lately, however, they have started to worry, loudly and publicly, about the need to speed up necessary reforms in the country's financial markets. The mood is all the more sombre because it comes in the middle of a deep recession. Summing up the anxieties, Mr Rolf Breuer, chairman of the German Stock Exchange and a board director at Deutsche Bank, said recently: 'The German capital market still has an international credibility problem.' Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, board director in charge of securities at Dresdner Bank, adds: 'If Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre - wants to improve its international acceptance, it must observe international standards.' The mood of soul-searching has been touched off by several developments. First, companies need to find capital abroad as the government soaks up the bulk of domestic savings to finance the costs of reunification. This is exemplified by the recent decision of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial group, to become the first German company to seek a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 'Germany is much less of a financial island than it was 10 years ago, much more dependent on foreigners,' said Mr Herbert Jacobi, chief executive of Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt, a Dusseldorf bank principally owned by Midland Bank of the UK. Second, banks recognise the need for changes in the regulatory environment to face up to foreign competition. Unless Germany can match the regulatory infrastructure of the US and the UK, Frankfurt will find itself at a disadvantage in the global competition for capital. German financial institutions will also lose business to other centres - and the manufacturing companies which are their prime clients could suffer as a result. Mr Joseph Lufkin, managing director of Global Proxy Services, a company which advises US institutional investors, said: 'Anglo-American money has a whole set of different strings attached to it. Recognising this, the German financial and industrial establishment is taking deliberate steps to improve its international image.' Third, the scandal over share transactions by Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the former head of the IG Metall trade union, focused international attention on German delays in drawing up laws to combat insider dealing. On Monday, after sustained criticism of apparent foot-dragging in outlawing insider trading, the finance ministry finally published a draft law to criminalise the practice and to introduce other long-awaited reforms. Mr Wolfram Freudenburg, head of the Stuttgart branch of Deutsche Bank, said of the Steinkuhler affair: 'In the interests of both the company (Daimler-Benz) and Germany as a financial centre we simply cannot put up with this sort of thing.' Of the three factors acting as a catalyst for reform, the need to attract outside capital to meet the costs of reunification is most significant. After years of registering large current account surpluses, united Germany is now registering a moderate deficit. Whereas Germany in 1990 exported DM66bn of long-term capital, last year it imported a net DM47bn of long-term funds from abroad. With Germany's public sector borrowing requirement likely to stay high for several years, the implications for corporate and financial Germany are clear. 'Whenever they look for capital, German companies will face strong competition from the state,' said Mr Thomas Mayer, senior economist at the Frankfurt office of investment bank Goldman Sachs. 'This will drive up the cost of borrowing money and force companies to look abroad for capital.' One important development is that companies are stepping up their marketing efforts to attract foreign investors. They are more willing to provide the kind of 'investor relations' services common in the US and the UK - such as 'roadshows', where senior managers visit investors and promote the benefits of owning their shares. Ms Corinna Arnold, senior analyst at Investor Responsibility Research Centre, a US organisation which advises American institutions on corporate governance issues, said: 'There is a greater understanding of what US investors and analysts are trying to do. German companies are helpful in providing information now.' The importance of the international investment community is underlined by foreigners' large stakes in big companies: nearly 40 per cent at Siemens, the electronics group, more than 40 per cent at Deutsche Bank, nearly a third at Veba, the energy-based conglomerate, just under 40 per cent at Commerzbank, and over 20 per cent at BASF, the chemicals company. While companies are improving investor relations in general, Germany's biggest company is taking a more radical step. In seeking a full New York listing, Daimler-Benz is submitting to American-style regulation for the first time. For decades German companies have refused to comply with the listing requirements set by the Securities and Exchange Commission - the regulatory body for the US securities industry. The reason was their reluctance to disclose financial information in line with US rules. As part of its attempt to meet US investors' requirements for openness in business dealings, and to show that it was ready to play by international rules, Daimler announced in early April it would wind up Mercedes Holding (MAH), a holding company which owns a 25 per cent stake in Daimler, because it served no purpose other than to block takeover bids. Daimler intends to convert MAH shares into ordinary Daimler shares for two reasons: first, the shareholding structure means MAH would interfere with plans for a DM2bn-DM3bn Daimler rights issue next year; and second, because of the perception that US investors would find the anti-takeover device an affront to their notions of fair play. MAH was propelled into the limelight when Mr Steinkuhler of IG Metall, a former member of the Daimler-Benz supervisory board, bought nearly DM1m worth of shares in the company, most of them just before it was revealed that MAH would be dissolved. The announcement led to a substantial rise in MAH's share price, leading to the suspicion that Mr Steinkuhler had made his investment on the basis of insider information. Mr Steinkuhler denied this, but resigned anyway, in the face of criticism from Germany's financial es-tablishment as well as international investors. Mr Tom Homes, head of research at Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, a bank majority-owned by Lloyds Bank of the UK, said: 'The suspicion alone that he was insider dealing degrades the quality of Germany's financial markets.' While the Steinkuhler affair heightened awareness that the rules needed to be changed, his dealings also served 'to revive foreigners' perceptions that the German market is an insiders' market', said Mr David Hale, chief economist at Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Group. Deutsche Bank and other large German institutions are striving to allay this perception by bringing their internal compliance regimes up to international standards. The emphasis has been on stopping practices such as 'front-running' - whereby traders would buy shares on their account before buying shares for clients. This would be classified as a form of insider dealing in the UK or the US. Foreign investors nevertheless remain concerned about an 'insider culture' within German capitalism: foreigners will always be at an 'information disadvantage' compared with German banks and insurance companies. Domestic institutions still own the bulk of shares in quoted German companies and have access to detailed information about companies' performance via their seats on German supervisory boards. One consequence of Daimler-Benz's New York listing is that foreign investors will receive more details about the group's financial performance. Change will be slow. But the inevitability of Germany's increasing capital needs over the next decade will mean further change is ineluctable. 'If you want equity capital,' said Mr Barthold von Ribbentrop, former head of securities sales and trading at Deutsche Bank, 'the biggest suppliers are English and American pension funds. If you want this equity, you have to adjust to their way of thinking. You have to swallow your pride and present yourself differently.'</p>

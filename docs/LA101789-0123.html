			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> World Wrestling Federation stars Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, Rowdy Roddy  Piper, Randy Savage and others may be moving out of the ring and onto the  screen. Shane Distribution, pleased with the results of its first feature film  production, last summer's "No Holds Barred," has opened a development  department to produce films, television and video programming that would  spotlight the giant names of the WWF. Shane turned professional wrestling into  a craze in the mid-1980s and is the movie-making and financing arm of Titan  Sports, Inc., a Stamford, Conn.-based firm which is the parent company of the  WWF.

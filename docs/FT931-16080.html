			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Danisco sells engineering unit for DKr950m DANISCO, the big distilling, sugar and food processing group, has sold Niro, an engineering subsidiary, to Germany's GEA for DKr950m (Dollars 150.5m) cash. Niro is a leading company in the manufacture of spray-drying equipment for the food and other industries. It has a workforce of about 2,200 worldwide. Turnover last year was DKr2.35bn, and pre-tax earnings were DKr141m. The sale of Niro to a German company means that both Denmark's spray-drying manufacturers will be under foreign control. The other, Anhydro, is a subsidiary of the UK-based APV. Danisco said it was selling Niro, which it has controlled since 1976, because the engineering company did not fit the group's focus on food-related business. GEA is an engineering group with turnover of about DKr8bn and 10,000 employees. One of its business areas is food and process engineering, but not related to Niro's area, said Danisco. Danisco also announced yesterday a strategic alliance between its seeds business, Maribo Seeds, and Switzerland's Sandoz Seeds for research and development on sugar beet.</p>

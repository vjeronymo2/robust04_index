			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu sent a letter of appreciation to the  French Government Thursday thanking it for transporting Korean  evacuees out of strife-torn Yemen.    In the letter addressed to French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe, Han noted that the French Government's efforts in  carrying foreign residents to safety will receive strong support  and applause from the world community.    Twenty-five South Koreans in Yemen, including businessmen  and  family members of the embassy staff, were brought to Djibouti  from Yemen aboard French military aircraft.    Officials here said Seoul may ask Paris for further  assistance in transporting the remaining 14 Koreans in Yemen,  including the ambassador.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Nationalists strive for elusive final breakthrough - The SNP is stuck at around 27% in the polls MR ALEX Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, yesterday came close to admitting that the party is unlikely to succeed in its aim of winning a majority of seats in Scotland. 'When you are in a race you conduct yourself on the basis that you are going to win,' he said. 'But I fully concede that it would be a substantial task to obtain and sustain a mandate for independence over the next week.' The SNP is stuck in the opinion polls at around the 27 per cent mark which it reached and slightly exceeded in early February. To win the election in Scotland and take 37 of the 72 Scottish seats, it needs about 40 per cent of the vote. Last night Mr Salmond welcomed a poll which suggested SNP support had reached 31 per cent, but this was dismissed by other parties as being out of line. The poll was carried out by Market Research Scotland and commissioned by the Aberdeen Press and Journal and Grampian Television. According to most polls, the party may add about half a dozen seats to the five it already holds (one of which, Dunfermline West, came to the SNP with the defection of a Labour MP and looks likely to return to Labour). Yet the likely tally of seats belittles the party's achievement. The SNP could match its performance of October 1974, when it won 11 seats with 30 per cent of the vote. It has doubled in popularity since the 1987 election, when it had only 14 per cent of the vote and took three seats. That rose to four when Mr Jim Sillars won Glasgow Govan from Labour in a by-election in 1988. Although it has policies on virtually everything, the SNP's first aim is independence. This means it can often command a degree of commitment among large numbers of sympathisers which in other parties would only be expected from regular party workers. Sometimes the SNP resembles a covert resistance movement: people in senior positions confess in private to helping the party, but are unwilling to be identified publicly with it. This election is crucial for the SNP. The main issue in Scotland is the country's constitutional future - and the SNP believes it offers the best chance in a generation of Scotland winning independence. Since 1987 the SNP has carefully laid the foundations for success. It adopted the policy of seeking independence as a member of the European Community, which reassured those who believed it wanted Scotland to sail off into isolation. Its leaders, Mr Salmond and Mr Sillars, are highly able and, in the case of the latter, almost charismatic. It has abandoned any association with 'tartan and haggis' nationalism, and talks mainly about economics. Above all, it offers a reasonably clear message. If the SNP wins a majority in Scotland, it will claim its mandate to negotiate independence from London, then put the terms to a referendum. It would then hold elections under proportional representation to the new Scottish parliament and would hope to win. But the SNP campaigns simultaneously on its independence platform and on the policies it would implement if elected to run Scotland. It would withdraw from the Trident nuclear weapons programme and inject Pounds 9.8bn of public spending into the Scottish economy over four years to get unemployment down from 9 per cent to zero. The main aim is to attract the Labour-voting working class in the industrial central belt. Somehow the party manages to finesse the fact that these policies are not tailored for its supporters in rural north-east Scotland, where three of its five seats are and where its main opponents are Tories or Liberal Democrats. To an extent the strategy is working. The SNP has strong support among the young, cemented by several Scottish rock stars such as Pat Kane of the group Hue and Cry. Actor Sean Connery has done voice-overs for election broadcasts. In the posh Glasgow constituency of Hillhead, held by Mr Roy (now Lord) Jenkins before he lost it to Labour in 1987, a System Three poll this week showed SNP support up from 6 per cent in 1987 to 22 per cent. But though the party says 'no Labour seat is safe', Labour's majorities still look too big for the SNP to scale. There is a disappointing gap between the SNP's 27 per cent in the polls and the 35 per cent who back independence, suggesting that independence supporters back Labour or the Liberal Democrats. The SNP still nurses hopes that the Tories may look set to win the election in Britain and trigger a last minute flight of Labour voters. It hopes to win urban Labour seats such as Kilmarnock, Paisley, Motherwell South and Clackmannan, as well as Dundee East, which it lost in 1987. But its best hopes lie in taking three Tory-held rural seats, including that of Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, in Galloway; and in wresting Argyll &amp; Bute from the Liberal Democrats. THE Scottish Liberal Democrats yesterday launched a manifesto for business, claiming that they were the only party which offered a stable environment for business in Scotland, Bethan Hutton writes. The manifesto will be circulated to 2,000 businesses and invites them to 'imagine a business climate governed not by political expedience but by common sense.' Recent surveys have shown most Scottish businesses to be opposed to constitutional change, but Mr Malcolm Bruce, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said businesses should realise that the status quo was 'no longer an option'. Opinion polls show the Liberal Democrat vote slipping in Scotland, but Mr Bruce said that polls had put the party in a similar position before the 1991 Kincardine and Deeside by-election, which the Liberal Democrats won with a record swing.</p>

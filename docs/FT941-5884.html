			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Three jailed after accepting bribes Three businessmen who admitted accepting bribes to influence the awarding of contracts for big engineering projects were jailed for between six months and two years at Southwark Crown Court yesterday. Mr Donald Richards, the former head of Donnar Services, a marketing and personnel company, was imprisoned for two years and fined Pounds 30,000. Mr Robert Wilcox and Mr Colin Read, both former employees of NEI Thompson Kennicott, the engineering company, were jailed for one year and six months respectively. All three had admitted various charges of conspiracy to corrupt. Mr Read and Mr Wilcox had passed confidential information about bids for contracts to Mr Richards. He then passed it on to rival bidders, who were able to win subcontracts from NEI. The bulk of the contracts involved work on the Sizewell B and Drax power stations. Judge Valerie Pearlman said: 'Each of you knowingly and willingly behaved in the way you did for money, motivated solely by greed. Corruption does a grave injury to the commerce of this country and . . . those who indulge in it must expect to receive immediate sentences of imprisonment.'</p>

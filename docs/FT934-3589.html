			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: European party line The much-touted marriage between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom appears to have been watered down to cohabitation in a service flat in Brussels. The partners are pooling sophisticated services for multinational companies - very much in line with the joint venture between BT and MCI. Yet there is no comparable sharing of equity, nor a merging of mainstream international telecoms businesses. In part, that may be because the two companies are not ready - France Telecom may not even become a limited company and the privatisation of Deutsche may be postponed. The suspicion must be, however, that the European Commission would take a dim view of the two companies collaborating in markets which are not yet open to competition. Pitching into competitive data services is merely to follow the herd. But the market is not large by telecoms standards, and margins are unlikely to be high. Perhaps telecoms companies have focused on this area because it is one of the few where regulation does not currently prevent competition. The limited capital commitment also means that it will be hard to come to much harm. Still, alliances made in haste for niche markets may be repented at leisure when wider competition is allowed. The participants will, however, probably have plenty of time to reflect on that. Closer links between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom would have to be offset by more open access to domestic markets. Neither would be keen to allow that, at least while their high business tariffs subsidise domestic users. That would be an open invitation for BT and Mercury to pick off their best customers.</p>

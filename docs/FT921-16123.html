			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Poland's new prime minister hints he may resign POLAND's new centre-right government, formed just before Christmas after two months' political manoeuvring, is already looking fragile after a series of clashes with President Lech Walesa, the recently-elected parliament, and the trade unions, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Mr Jan Olszewski, prime minister, hinted over the weekend he would resign if both the Solidarity trade union movement and the former communist OPZZ union movement acted on threats to strike in protest against a near-doubling in energy and central-heating prices on January 1. The OPZZ has said it will call a token national stoppage on January 16, and Solidarity has threatened action unless the rises are suspended. Adding to the government's woes is a row with Mr Walesa over the decision last week by Mr Jan Parys, Poland's first post-war civilian defence minister, to pension off his predecessor, Admiral Piotr Kolodziejczyk. The move has angered Mr Walesa, commander of the armed forces. The president, who last year opposed Mr Olszewski's appointment as prime minister, wanted to keep the admiral in a senior military post to reassure a nervous officer class, despite his Warsaw Pact communist background. The row with Mr Walesa and union opposition to phasing out energy subsidies have underlined the fragility of Mr Olszewski's position as leader of a coalition government with only tenuous support. The new parliament, elected at the end of October, has shown little enthusiasm for approving welfare cuts demanded by the government in an interim budget for the first quarter of the year. Last week, the government announced a 20 per cent increase in alcohol and tobacco prices to shore up collapsing budget revenues. Tax revenues from the ailing state sector have declined sharply in line with two years' rapid fall in state-sector production and a slower-than-hoped rate of privatisation. To trim a budget deficit which exceeds targets originally agreed with the IMF, the outgoing government aimed to cut plans for government spending by a third. On Saturday, Mr Karol Lutkowski, finance minister, asked parliament to approve the interim budget without amendment. This assumes a Zl 17,600bn (Pounds 890m) deficit for the first three months, and forecasts inflation rising by 15 per cent for the quarter, against 60 per cent over the whole of 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO's Economic </F> Department, by Kamal Tarabayh in Paris on 29 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Quray'] The most important positive point is that  this agreement has been signed and laid the foundations for  satisfactory and convincing policies for the process of an  economic construction during the transition stage in the  occupied Palestinian territories...    [Tarabayh, interrupting] Concerning the details...    [Quray'] Concerning the details, there is now a Palestinian  monetary institution that enjoys almost 90 percent of a central  bank's powers. With the exception of issuing banknotes, this  institution enjoys all of a central bank's jurisdictions and  powers. There is now a right to trade with the Arab world, with  the Islamic world, and with the foreign world. Consequently,  for the first time, borders are now open for Palestinian  agricultural products to enter the Israeli market. In the past,  the Palestinian market was open to the Israeli agricultural  products, but Palestinian products were not allowed to enter the  Israeli market. Now, the market is open. Industry has also  become the right of the Palestinian authority which decides,  defines, and issues licenses. It even defines the standards of  the Palestinian industry. There are important issues  which....[sentence incomplete as heard]    [Tarabayh] Concerning the Palestinian workers' movement  between the autonomous region and Israel, are there any specific  measures which contribute to the freedom of their movement?    [Quray'] The agreed upon thing is that there will be freedom  of movement for both sides' workers, and any of the two sides  has the right to determine the number of these workers.    [Tarabayh] Do you consider this economic agreement a basic  pillar for the completion of the autonomy agreement and the  establishment of a national authority?    [Quray'] I believe we have made the basic and major step  toward the establishment of the independent Palestinian state.    [Tarabayh] Still, there are pending issues over which there  are differences. In short, what are the most important of these  issues?    [Quray'] There are points. This is a big, complicated, and  long issue. There is an occupation which will be replaced by a  new national authority. Therefore, there are many pending  issues.    [Tarabayh] What about customs and fees?    [Quray'] Many issues and problems have been solved, and  policies have been drawn. These policies might be reconsidered  and developed at a later time in light of experience and  implementation on the ground.    [Tarabayh] What about currency?    [Quray'] Currency is not the main point, but one of the  points. When the authority is established on the ground, our  people, everywhere, will have an authority to take care of them  and of their affairs, and to adopt their issues.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODERN ADVICE:;  </P> <P> GO EAST, YOUNG BUSINESS PERSON  </P> <P> After being in Monterey Park for 20 years, Robert Cope's computer services  business was bursting at the seams.  </P> <P> Auto-Graphics' cramped quarters in the 700 block of Monterey Pass Road was half  the space that the $10-million-a-year business needed, Cope said, and, besides,  it was too far away from Ontario International Airport, which he preferred over  Los Angeles International to ship products.  </P> <P> The move east to a business park in Pomona was "110% positive," Cope said,  especially because it meant half as long a commute, against traffic, for his  150 employees, most of whom live in the eastern San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> For Philip Vaughan, a manufacturer of drafting equipment, it was available,  cheap property that lured him to San Dimas from Pasadena, where there is almost  no vacant industrial land and where construction costs are among the highest in  Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> "It's the only way you can go if you have to move," he said. "There's no  contest."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bargain Rates  </P> <P> Slowly, the east San Gabriel Valley is becoming a mecca for businesses  suffocated by the squeeze of development on the west. To some, moving to the  east means bargain rates for large tracts of industrial and office space. To  others, it simply means following upscale residential growth that's taking  place in the bedroom communities of Walnut, Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights,  Rowland Heights and Glendora.  </P> <P> The Southern California Assn. of Governments predicts that by the year 2010,  the number of jobs and people in the east valley, from the San Gabriel River  Freeway (605) east to the Los Angeles County line, will have grown more than  twice as much over 25 years than in the west valley.  </P> <P> According to a SCAG forecast to be released this month, areas likely to witness  the most development are San Dimas, where SCAG predicts that the population  will grow 103% between 1984 and 2010 and where 55% more jobs will be created in  the same time period; La Verne, where the population and employment will  increase by 79% and 39%, respectively, and Walnut, where the population will  grow 250% and jobs 32%. People are already inching their way eastward. Between  1980 and 1988, population in the east valley grew almost twice as fast when  compared to the west; in the east, it climbed from 688,055 to 825,900, a 20%  increase, while in the west it grew 11.5%, according to figures from the Los  Angeles County Department of Regional Planning.  </P> <P> Jim Center, a senior marketing consultant at the financial consulting firm  Grubb &amp; Ellis, said that as land in Pasadena, Monterey Park and Alhambra  becomes more scarce, the area east of the 605 Freeway will become the focal  point of business activity in the county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Hub of the Wheel'  </P> <P> "The 605 and Pomona (60) freeways are like the hub of the wheel, with downtown  as the west rim and Ontario (in San Bernardino County) being the east rim," he  said.  </P> <P> Casey Griffin, an industrial broker specializing in sales transactions west of  the Orange (57) Freeway for Coldwell Banker, said eastward drift is "a natural  course of business. Since there's a limited industrial base west of the 605,  most new developments are in Walnut, San Dimas, Glendora. In essence there's a  greater selection in the east San Gabriel Valley because it's the most recent  area to be developed."  </P> <P> There are those on the west who insist that it's not a mass exodus, and the  trickle isn't anything to be alarmed about.  </P> <P> "Nobody wants to leave Pasadena," said Bruce Ackerman, executive vice president  of Pasadena's Chamber of Commerce. "It's not a burning desire to get out of  town."  </P> <P> Although traditional industrial users may be moving east, "there's no reason  for the commercial to go out east," said Alhambra Redevelopment Agency  Executive Director Michael Martin, arguing that successful businesses that can  afford the higher land prices tend to stay in the west.  </P> <P> "One of the advantages of being in an urbanized area is that most retailers  looking for quality commercial space like it here because people here are  willing to spend money," he said.  </P> <P> Martin added that an eastward drift of industrial companies hasn't hurt  Alhambra's economy because for every business that moves from Alhambra to  Glendora, there's another moving from downtown Los Angeles to Alhambra, which  is still relatively inexpensive compared with downtown.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the trend worries cities that are losing the businesses. In  Pasadena, for example, officials feared that auto dealers, one of the largest  generators of sales tax revenue, would be lured eastward to Duarte, Monrovia  and Glendora, which boast shiny new auto malls close to the Foothill Freeway.  </P> <P> To entice dealers to stay on Colorado Boulevard, the Pasadena Board of  Directors is offering sales tax rebates of up to 50%.  </P> <P> City officials hope that the incentive will reverse a steady decline in sales  tax revenue from auto dealers at the same time that the total sales tax revenue  has gone up. Auto sales tax revenue in Pasadena slipped from $3.03 million in  fiscal 1986-87 to $2.81 million in 1988-89.  </P> <P> In the east, cities are providing their own strong incentives. San Dimas'  Redevelopment Agency has given generous financial support to businesses moving  to the city. Recent help included issuing tens of millions of dollars in bonds  for the construction and acquisition of buildings for an engineering firm and  the Bushnell Division of Bausch &amp; Lomb, the nation's leading manufacturer  of sports optics.  </P> <P> The upper-middle-class bedroom community of Walnut, although zoned 95%  residential, is trying to attract businesses to match its burgeoning  population, which more than doubled between 1980 and 1988. The City Council  recently created an ad-hoc economic development committee to study ways to  strengthen the city's commercial base.  </P> <P> Glendora has been slower to attract residents; its population increased by  22.8% in the same period. But City Manager Arthur Cook said that after a brief  spurt of growth during the 1960s, followed by a prolonged lull, "the second  wave of it is coming now, especially with the population growth in the east  valley. Retail is following that growth."  </P> <P> With construction under way of an auto mall on Allen Avenue for which seven  dealers have signed contracts, the city anticipates annual sales tax revenues  to skyrocket $2 million once all nine spaces are filled.  </P> <P> That promise of growth has already brought corporations from Pasadena and El  Monte to Glendora in search of economic opportunities, Cook said. Caltrol, an  El Monte-based manufacturer of control devices, is moving its entire operation  to Glendora, where commercial land, at $15 to $18 a square foot, is half what  it would be on the west, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Market Is Here'  </P> <P> "The land is cheaper, the rent is cheaper, the market is here, the purchasing  power is in this area," Cook said. "The economic level of Glendora is higher  than other areas, but commercial land isn't as expensive as other areas that  are fully developed."  </P> <P> On the other hand, some in the east say the eastward drift is blowing right  past them into San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> While Pomona has found a niche in the marketplace for small manufacturing  facilities of less than 25,000 square feet, larger developers have passed it  over when looking for places to set up heavy industrial firms, known as "big  boxes." Retail development is similarly scarce, so that Pomona residents  typically drive across the county line into Ontario and Montclair to shop for  clothing and furniture.  </P> <P> "Those stores don't exist here," said Ray Bragg, interim operations manager for  Pomona's redevelopment department. "The downtown Pomona area wasn't able to  keep up with other communities. The buying public goes for the new and the  flashy. When Montclair Plaza was built, we sort of lost out to the glitz and  the flash."  </P> <P> But Pomona, too, is trying to fill the gap in its economic base with more  retail outlets. Through the efforts of the Redevelopment Agency and the Pomona  Economic Development Corp., West Holt Avenue is being transformed from a  run-down, underdeveloped stretch of land into a revitalized light-industrial  center. Commercial retail centers are sprouting up too, but are mostly  concentrated near the higher-scale residential areas of Phillips Ranch and  Chino Hills.  </P> <P> Perhaps the trickle eastward can best be explained by a combination of factors.  First of all, houses are popping up fast in the east, whether it's in Walnut  and Diamond Bar, where the average house costs $300,000, or in Fontana and  Ontario, where homes are more affordable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jobs Follow Housing  </P> <P> Naturally, jobs are following the housing tract boom. Although it's San  Bernardino County that's witnessing the most rapid growth in the nation,  according to a recent U. S. Census Bureau report on metropolitan growth, east  valley businesses are drawing on the neighboring county's expanding employee  base, according to Center of Grubb &amp; Ellis.  </P> <P> In fact, he said, there's a dearth of higher-skilled jobs in the Inland Empire,  and mid-income-level residents in the Inland Empire are finding more employment  in the east San Gabriel Valley's more diversified economy.  </P> <P> Land prices and office rental rates may not be as cheap as in the Inland  Empire, yet are still considerably lower than anything to the west. And the  area east of the 605 is a safe distance from gridlock on the Foothill and  Ventura freeways, yet isn't too far away for businesses that need access to  downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> For example, Randy Hoffman, former president of Bushnell, was able to sell his  old building in Pasadena for $22 a square foot and buy space in a San Dimas  business park for $8 a square foot. On top of that, the city's Redevelopment  Agency issued $5 million to $6 million in bonds to finance the purchase.  Hoffman originally wanted to stay in Pasadena, but there wasn't any room along  Foothill Boulevard to expand and the city couldn't find another site that  permitted 18-wheel trucks easy access to a distribution facility.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Real Good Deal'  </P> <P> So Hoffman decided to move east. "We got a real good deal," he said, adding  that he would have saved even more money if he went farther east into San  Bernardino County but would have lost too many of his employees, most of whom  live in San Dimas, Glendora and Pasadena.  </P> <P> "We didn't want to be out in the middle of nowhere," he said. "We drew a circle  and said we'd stay somewhere within a 10-mile radius. It was a balance between  costs and services. We wanted to be within a few minutes of restaurants and had  to be able to draw on local vendors and printing shops, office supply places  and banks."  </P> <P> Although the move wasn't a great financial loss to Pasadena -- Bushnell handles  only a limited volume of retail sales -- it underscored a dilemma facing cities  on the west that have almost reached the saturation point in development, yet  aren't able to retain rapidly growing businesses.  </P> <P> Ninety-nine percent of the developable land in Pasadena and San Gabriel is used  up. Ninety-seven percent of West Covina is built on. And only 4% of Monterey  Park and 2% of Alhambra is undeveloped. In contrast, Pomona is 10% vacant,  Walnut is 21% vacant and in San Bernardino County, Rancho Cucamonga and Ontario  are 39% and 26% vacant, respectively.  </P> <P> The scarcity of land in Pasadena is exacerbated by a growth-control ordinance  limiting future commercial development in the city to a total of 250,000 square  feet a year for projects of more than 25,000 square feet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fees Higher  </P> <P> In addition, building permit fees in Pasadena are substantially higher than  neighboring cities for all types of projects. In Monterey Park and San Gabriel,  temporary building moratoriums have put a hold on residential projects, which  city officials acknowledge may indirectly slow commercial growth.  </P> <P> "Certainly we're concerned when businesses leave Pasadena, especially  businesses that generate substantial sales tax revenue or provide employment  opportunities, that are out migrating to areas in the immediate region," said  Bill Reynolds, Pasadena's director of development. "But when a city's as fully  developed as Pasadena, we don't have the luxury of having cheap land that is  readily available and vacant to offer."  </P> <P> Even Pacific Rim businesses, which for the last decade have flocked to Monterey  Park, San Gabriel and Alhambra because of the cities' large Asian populations,  are responding to the eastward drift. A recent migration of Asians to Hacienda  Heights, Rowland Heights and Walnut, where housing is often more affordable and  available than in Monterey Park, has drawn businesses that cater to the area's  growing Chinese population.  </P> <P> In Rowland Heights and Hacienda Heights, one need only drive down major streets  to notice that Asian businesses are popping up. Typically in those areas, once  a large Chinese supermarket opens in a shopping mall, small businesses and  restaurants follow.  </P> <P> William Chan, president of Great West Realty in Alhambra, said the area around  Monterey Park is still an Asian business owner's first choice, but when he  finds out how stiff the competition is, how expensive land is and how  restrictive the city's building code is, he often starts looking elsewhere.  </P> <P> "The competition here is too great," Chan said. "There are too many Chinese  groceries already. There are 200 Chinese restaurants in Alhambra. I for one  would never develop here."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROJECTED GROWTH IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY  </P> <P> Projected growth in population, housing, and employment opportunities in the  San Gabriel Valley from 1984-2010.  </P> <P> All figures are expressed in percentages.  </P> <P> Overall numbers include unincorporated areas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WEST SAN GABRIEL VALLEY AREA  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.10IN:2.22IN:1.89IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Population  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Housing  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Employment  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> West Valley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +17.5%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +21.4%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +26.9%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> BY CITY  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.

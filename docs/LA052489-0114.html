			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IDENTIFIES CHILDHOOD FRIEND AS ROBBER  </P> <P> Former Harvard University student Jose Razo on Tuesday identified a childhood  friend as the real Ski Mask Bandit accused of a string of holdups that Razo is  charged with committing while home in Orange County on break.  </P> <P> Razo's revelation, which came as he took the stand for the second day in an  attempt to repudiate earlier confessions to the crimes, drew skepticism from  the trial prosecutor, who said Razo was doing nothing more than "reaching out  and naming a scapegoat."  </P> <P> On Monday, Razo testified that a friend from his hometown of La Habra was the  actual criminal, whom police had dubbed the Ski Mask Bandit. Razo refused to  name the friend.  </P> <P> But under pressure from Superior Court Judge Jean M. Rheinheimer on Tuesday,  Razo relented and said the man is named Richard Longoria, is about 27 years old  and lived on Ashley Circle in La Habra.  </P> <P> The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravinder Mehta, said in interviews outside  of court that such a person exists and that investigators from the Orange  County district attorney's office are trying to locate him. Mehta said that  Longoria, if found, may be subpoenaed to testify in Razo's trial, which began  May 5.  </P> <P> Mehta emphasized that he does not think Longoria was the real bandit in the  nationally publicized case. "Mr. Razo had to name someone, so he just found a  scapegoat."  </P> <P> Razo, 22, is the key witness in his own defense. He is charged with 10 armed  robberies in Orange and Los Angeles counties between December, 1985, and June,  1987, in which about $27,000 was taken. If convicted of all the counts, the  former honor student and star football player from Anaheim's Servite High  School could be sentenced to as much as 21 years in prison, according to Mehta.  </P> <P> Razo told the jury in the Santa Ana courtroom Tuesday that he did not commit  any of the robberies. He said that Longoria made all the holdups and then told  him the exact details. Razo said that he was academically interested in the  crimes because he was taking a course at Harvard in 1986-87 entitled "Crime and  Human Nature."  </P> <P> According to defense attorney John Barnett, Razo was gathering material in La  Habra on why a disproportionate percentage of Latinos become criminals.  </P> <P> "The barrio, in a sense, became his laboratory," Barnett said. The attorney  also said Razo was mentally unstable from recent use of the drug PCP  (phencyclidine, also known as "angel dust") when he confessed in June, 1987, to  the robberies.  </P> <P> In cross-examination by Mehta on Tuesday, Razo described details of armed  robberies by the Ski Mask Bandit. Razo said he had learned the details from  Longoria, whom he generally referred to only as "the robber."  </P> <P> Mehta asked Razo when he first learned that Longoria was committing armed  robberies.  </P> <P> Razo said it was in December, 1985, when he was home from Harvard on Christmas  break. Razo said he was in the back yard of his parents' home on Marian Street  in La Habra when "this person jumped the fence into the back yard." Razo said  the person was Longoria and said Longoria later told him that he had just held  up the nearby Driftwood Dairy and escaped with $50.  </P> <P> Razo testified: "He (the alleged bandit) appeared very nervous. He told me to  shut up and to help him out." Razo said he then brought the man into his  family's house. "He took a ski mask and gun out of his pocket and placed them  behind a chair we have in the living room."  </P> <P> Razo testified that he had been mowing his parents' yard when the alleged  bandit unexpectedly came to visit. But under further questioning by Mehta, Razo  conceded that the Driftwood Dairy robbery actually occurred after dark in the  evening. Mehta said he doubted that Razo was mowing the yard in the dark.  </P> <P> "Are you telling the truth?" Mehta asked Razo. "Are you making things up as we  go along? Why tell us you were doing yard work if you don't remember it?"  </P> <P> Razo, in response, said that he cannot recall some details of his dealings with  "the robber."  </P> <P> But Razo, under questioning, was able to give the prosecutor very specific  details of the robberies, noting that he was only repeating information "the  robber" had told him.  </P> <P> This is how Razo, on the witness stand, described a 1987 holdup of a Carl's Jr.  restaurant in Garden Grove, of which he is accused:  </P> <P> "He (the robber) entered the store. He entered along with a customer and walked  so that he was as least visible as possible past the customer into a restroom.  After which the customer followed, came into the restroom. He (the robber)  believed this man at the time to be an undercover police officer.  </P> <P> "He became frightened and exited the restroom. He hid under a table near the  salad bar. Waited there for a period. The customer left. After which he  approached the female working in the restaurant at the time. He asked her if  she were the manager. He told her to open the safe and asked for all the money.  Told the employees to lay on the floor and exited the restaurant."  </P> <P> A former altar boy and model student, Razo became a role model for Latino  youths in La Habra, community leaders have said. He had just completed his  sophomore year at Harvard when he was arrested in June, 1987. National news  media have given wide attention to the case because of the unusual  circumstances.  </P> <P> Razo on Monday testified that he had used PCP about 50 times in May and June of  1987 and contended that the drug caused him to have strange thoughts, including  the compunction to confess to crimes he did not commit.  </P> <P> Mehta, however, said in interviews outside of court that Razo is simply groping  for a defense. "Mr. Razo was the real robber," the prosecutor said.  </P> <P> Mehta is scheduled to continue cross-examining Razo when the trial resumes this  morning.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEWBURY PARK'S 8-3 VICTORY DROPS SIMI VALLEY FROM 1ST  </P> <P> Nobody does anything in Marmonte League baseball without first checking with  Simi Valley High.  </P> <P> Think you're good? Think you have a shot? Not until the Pioneers say you do.  Not until you have taken the title away from them.  </P> <P> Consider it all but taken.  </P> <P> The brash boys from Newbury Park, the guys with all the gall to do it, beat  Simi Valley, 8-3, Friday at Newbury Park to move into first place, a half-game  ahead of the Pioneers, whose run of three consecutive league championships is  in jeopardy.  </P> <P> Newbury Park (17-2-3, 8-1 in league play), which defeated Simi Valley, 6-4, the  first time the teams met, is the first league team to sweep a season series  from the Pioneers since Camarillo in 1984.  </P> <P> "I don't think we doubted it for a second," Newbury Park pitcher Jeremy Dewey  said. "I have confidence in our team that we can beat them with whoever's on  the mound."  </P> <P> Dewey was thrust into the team's No. 1 role when Tim Beal was banished from the  team a week ago for violating school rules. Dewey, who improved to 6-1 with his  complete-game victory, pitched in and out of trouble and kept throwing  curveballs. By his own account, "well more than half" of Dewey's pitches were  curves.  </P> <P> That was by design.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to spot the ball, keep them off balance and make them think," he  said. "Where I got in trouble is when I threw it down the middle and they just  bombed it."  </P> <P> Dewey gave up 11 hits, including at least one in each inning but the seventh.  But Simi Valley (19-3, 8-2) stranded 11 runners -- 10 in the first five  innings.  </P> <P> "I think we were waiting for the three-run dinger to happen for us," Simi  Valley Coach Mike Scyphers said. "And it didn't."  </P> <P> While the Pioneers craved the clutch hit, Newbury Park wracked Simi Valley  starter Rich Langford for five hits and six runs in three innings.  </P> <P> Already leading, 3-1, the Panthers scored five runs in the fourth after  Langford walked the bases loaded with none out. He was replaced by left-hander  Kenny Hood, whose second pitch to left-hander Eric Greene was whacked into the  gap in right-center field. All three runners scored on the triple.  </P> <P> Greene came home on Geoff Black's single and Black scored on Brian Smith's  grounder to give Newbury Park an 8-1 lead.  </P> <P> Newbury Park Coach Gary Fabricius said that his hitters wanted a look at  Langford, who had an earned-run average of 0.50 entering the game.  </P> <P> "They were looking forward to him, that's how confident they are," he said.  "They wanted to see how good they are.  </P> <P> "This group has been loose all year, and there was no reason to change now with  the league championship on the line."  </P> <P> Newbury Park nicked Langford in the first inning when Danny Madsen, who singled  in each of his first three at-bats, scored Greene from third. The Pioneers tied  it in the third, 1-1, on Greg Santos' run-scoring single.  </P> <P> Madsen and Wayne Cook singled home runs in the third to give the Panthers a 3-1  lead.  </P> <P> Mike Jenkins' two-run single in the fifth was all Simi Valley could muster in  the way of a comeback.  </P> <P> Dewey pitched to only seven batters in the final two innings and struck out the  last three he faced in the seventh -- all on curves in the dirt.  </P></p>

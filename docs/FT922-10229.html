			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building for Asia's Future (11): Another Asian dragon rises AN economic power house is being created in the southern provinces of China, Hong Kong and Macao. In Guangdong, Hainan, Fujien and to a lesser extent Shanghai, the dead hand of central government control has been lifted and enterprise is being given its head. Development in Hong Kong and Macao  - airports, ports, electric power and telecommunications  - is occurring as a result of the southern Chinese economic miracle. The scale of the task in developing the region's infrastructure is illustrated by the fact that Guangdong, with a population of 63m, is larger than the UK but its total electricity generating capacity equals only 5 per cent of Britain's. This decade may see the electrification of southern China, construction of big airports, creation of a telecommunications network, and the paving of thousands of miles of highways. Guangdong and Hong Kong are planning large rises in electricity capacity. Generating capacity in Guangdong amounted to 8,280MW in 1990, but is planned to increase to 14,300MW by 1995 and to produce 20,000MW by the year 2000. GEC-Alsthom has just won a Pounds 550m contract to build two coal-fired 650MW units at Shajiao, on the Pearl River. In Hong Kong  - where electricity generating capacity of 8,387MW is greater than Guangdong's  - there are plans to increase nearly double capacity over the next 15 years. Anyone who has travelled on Guangdong's road system will appreciate the need for improvement. Most roads in Guangdong are single-lane dual carriage ways, with traffic moving at a snail's pace. Mr Gordon Wu, managing director of Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong, is building a six-lane 304km super-highway, the first phase of which will connect Shenzhen, on the Hong Kong border, with the provincial capital of Guangzhou. By the end of the century, within a radius of less than 50 nautical miles from the centre of Hong Kong, there will be three airports capable of dealing with international passenger and cargo traffic, and internal China trade. The largest of the three will be situated at Chek Lap Kok, a small island to the north of Lantau. Due for opening some time in 1997  - the year China resumes sovereignty over the British colony  - the airport will have a cargo capacity of 1m tonnes a year and ability to handle 20m passengers a year. A planned international airport for Macao  - which reverts from Portugal to China in 1999  - will open up the Zhuhai special economic zone. By the year 2000 it is forecast to handle over 6m passengers and 123,000 tonnes of cargo a year. The smallest is an airport just completed at Shenzhen, the special economic zone which borders Hong Kong. It has a planned capacity, by 2000, of 5.5m passengers and nearly 200,000 tonnes of cargo a year. In Hong Kong there are an average of 54 telephones for every 100 people; in Shenzhen, there are 17; in Guangdong the figure falls to three; and for the whole of China it is less than one. China has embarked on a Dollars 6bn telecoms programme, but that is just the beginning. Hong Kong's biggest infrastructural advantage has been its natural harbour. But its franchise is coming under threat from a more outward-looking China. Work on an ambitious container terminal at Yantian, just across Hong Kong's eastern border, is already advanced. To the west, Shekou has succeeded in attracting one Middle Eastern shipping company to its shallower container facilities in the Pearl River and a European shipping line is negotiating to set up a direct route. A third big deep-water port is planned in Gaolan, next to the Special Economic Zone of Zhuhai. Further afield, free ports are being set up in Yangpu in Northern Hainan island and in the city of Xiamen, opposite Taiwan. These two special zones have the avowed intent of mirroring the success of Hong Kong and are well located to do so. Local business remains confident that Hong Kong's infrastructure will give it the edge. 'The cake is getting sufficiently bigger, so there is enough for all of us', said one terminal operator. This view is reflected in the growing number of consortia preparing to bid for the territory's ninth container terminal. 'Transport infrastructure is fundamental to Hong Kong's future success,' said Mr Alisdair Morrison, managing director of the Jardine Matheson group's property arm Hongkong Land, one of a number of companies to express an interest in bidding for the new terminal, due to open in 1995. 'As Hong Kong integrates with southern China, it is the manufacturing sector and the physical movement of its goods which is at the forefront of Hong Kong's growth. The port is the mechanism for taking advantage of that', said Mr Morrison. The emerging ports over the border seem likely to act as feeder ports for Hong Kong, as will also be the case with the new deep-water port in Macao. All the Pearl River ports suffer from silting and offer difficult access. In the short term, they should enhance Hong Kong's position as a regional hub. Total container output for the whole of China was only 1.5m Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) in 1990, compared with in excess of 5m TEUs out of Hong Kong. The turnaround for a container in Hong Kong is measured in hours, while operators claim that in China it has to be measured in days or even weeks. The Hong Kong government estimates that the number of fully-containerised vessels utilising the port will increase from 8,390 in 1990 to 21,000 by 2001. 'I would even question whether Hong Kong can offer enough capacity in the next five years. It's going to be very tough. Some of the business is going to go to other places, but there's more than enough business for everybody', said Mr David Allen, managing director of Asia Terminals.</p>

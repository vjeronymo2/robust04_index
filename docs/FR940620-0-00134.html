			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Commenters' concerns regarding the width of the adjoining portion of a T-shaped maneuvering space are addressed at ADAAG 13.3.4(4). This provision does not increase the 40 inch dimension between base cabinets since doing so would then exceed the requirements of ADAAG 4.2.3 with respect to that portion of a T-shaped turn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters asked for clarification regarding the definition of a U-shaped kitchen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Language has been added to clarify that a U-shaped kitchen is a closed end space having fixtures, storage or other usable elements on three sides. A kitchen that is open at both ends, or, closed at one end which has no fixtures, storage, or other usable elements at the closed end is not a U-shaped kitchen. In a U-shaped kitchen, a person will need a 60 inch clear floor space for maneuvering between elements located on three sides of a kitchen, while a T-turn should provide sufficient maneuvering space if elements are only located on two sides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.3.4(2)&blank;Clear Floor Space  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision requires clear floor space that allows either a forward or a parallel approach at fixtures and appliances in the kitchen, including, but not limited to, the range or cooktop, oven, refrigerator/freezer, dishwasher, and trash compactor. The provision also requires that sinks shall have a forward approach. The provision also requires that laundry equipment located in the kitchen comply with ADAAG 13.3.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Very few comments were received on this provision, however, an architect noted that some of the dimensions are redundant. The commenter felt that dimensions should not be repeated unless they are ``an exception to the referenced standard.'' Also, it was noted that sinks should be required to have a forward approach. In addition, the commenter noted that the requirement for maneuvering space in compliance with ADAAG 4.2.3 duplicates requirements already stated in ADAAG 13.3.2(2). The commenter recommended that redundant provisions be deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some redundancy is necessary as it is not uncommon for requirements for maneuvering space to be overlooked. However, repeating the dimensions along with the referenced section is unnecessary and the provision has been changed accordingly. Further, language has been added to clarify that accessible sinks must have a forward approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An architect requested that the guidelines clarify that the provision also applies to kitchen fixtures. In addition, the commenter recommended adding a number of fixtures to the list with an indication that the list of fixtures and appliances is not exhaustive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The guidelines have been revised to add ``fixtures'' to the requirement and indicate that the list is not exhaustive. Counter work surfaces and sinks have not been added to the list because both require knee clearance for a front approach. This provision allows either a front or parallel approach. Adding kitchen sink or work surfaces to this provision might be interpreted to mean that knee clearance is not required at sinks or work surfaces. See ADAAG 13.3.4(4) and ADAAG 13.3.4(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.3.4(3)&blank;Controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision requires that all controls in kitchens comply with ADAAG 4.27. No comments were received on this provision and no changes have been made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.3.4(4)&blank;Counters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This provision requires at least one 36 inch section of a counter for an accessible work surface. The provision allows the accessible work surface to be either adjustable within a range from 28 to 36 inches or mounted at a fixed height not exceeding 34 inches. It also requires that the counter thickness and supporting structure be two inches maximum over the required knee clearance. Clear floor space at the accessible work surface allowing for a forward approach is required. This provision limits the amount of clear floor space that may be provided under the work surface to 19 inches, and specifies that knee space must be 30 inches wide and 19 inches deep.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM proposed to require a work surface 30 inches long. As noted in ADAAG 13.3.4(1), a number of commenters pointed out the inconsistency of requiring a T-shaped maneuvering clearance in a kitchen when the clearance under the work surface is less than 36 inches. Further, an architect pointed out that ADAAG 7.2(1) requires a 36 inch wide counter for ``incidental use'' and only 30 inches for spaces that affect a ``person's ability to be self-sufficient.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Paralyzed Veterans of America conducted informal research which may suggest that a T-turn is possible if corridors are wider than 36 inches to compensate for doorways which are slightly narrower than 32 inches clear. However, further study is necessary before changes are made in this area. Although the work surface is not required to be part of a T-shaped turn, it seems probable that it will serve that purpose. Because a T-shaped turn is required by ADAAG 13.3.2(2) in accessible spaces, the required kitchen work surface should be a minimum 36 inches in width. In addition, no other usable surface required in ADAAG, including those for incidental use, is only 30 inches in width. It is likely that food preparation will require some room for elbows in order to have adequate room to perform standard kitchen operations. A change has been made to require a 36 inch work surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.3.4(5)&blank;Sinks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision requires that the sink and surrounding counter comply with ADAAG 4.24. This provision allows for the sink to be capable of being adjusted to alternative heights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters suggested that the sink should be required to be adjustable and not fixed. They reasoned that individuals vary greatly in their seating, height, and reach ranges. One commenter noted that the proposed guidelines, in specifying adjustable mounting heights, had left out an option for 30 inches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The original proposal has been changed to specify that the sink, if adjustable, must be adjustable at two inch increments from 28 to 36 inches. The Board recognizes that sinks that are adjustable are preferred over those that are fixed by many people with disabilities. However, very little information was received regarding this option. The Board is reluctant to depart from UFAS 4.34.6.5(1) in the absence of more detailed information, including costs and availability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPVA and a few other commenters suggested that removable base cabinets should be permitted under sinks to increase storage and for aesthetics. They further suggested that ``the Department of Justice can require that removal costs be assumed by the government landlord, not the tenant.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ADAAG 13 requires fully accessible dwelling units. Tenants often experience difficulty with elements that require adaptation by the landlord. For this reason, cabinets are not permitted to be constructed under sinks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.3.4(6)&blank;Cooktops  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision requires that cooktops have accessible controls which do not require reaching across burners. Cooktops with knee space underneath must be insulated or otherwise protected on the exposed contact surface to prevent burns, electrical shock, and abrasion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Few comments were received on this provision. However, one commenter did recommend that the cross-references to ADAAG 13.3.4(2) and 13.3.4(3) be deleted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This change has been made since the referenced provisions are in the same section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HANK GREENSPUN, FIERY PUBLISHER OF LAS VEGAS SUN, DIES  </P> <P> Las Vegas Sun publisher Hank Greenspun, who built a communications empire and  helped transform Las Vegas from a small desert town into an entertainment  mecca, died Saturday of cancer. He was 79.  </P> <P> Greenspun died at his home in Regency Towers at the exclusive Las Vegas Country  Club after a yearlong battle with the disease.  </P> <P> He was a man of contrast, reckless and reasoning, combative and compassionate,  a news writer and a news maker.  </P> <P> The New York-educated lawyer was a decorated World War II combat officer, a  one-time publicist for mobster Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel's Flamingo Hotel, a  pioneer real estate investor and developer, and a crusading newspaper  publisher.  </P> <P> Greenspun founded Las Vegas' first television station, first competing daily  newspaper and first cable television company.  </P> <P> A man of action and influence who once was a Republican candidate for governor  of Nevada, Greenspun mingled with world leaders and superstars.  </P> <P> He played a behind-the-scenes role in Middle East affairs for Israel, where he  became a national hero, cited by then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion for  extraordinary service during the 1948 War of Independence.  </P> <P> Greenspun executed a daring gun-smuggling operation that delivered surplus U.S.  arms to Israel during its struggle. He was convicted of Neutrality Act  violations in 1950 and fined $10,000, but President John F. Kennedy pardoned  him, and in his 1966 autobiography, "Where I Stand," Greenspun said it was "the  proudest thing I've ever done."  </P> <P> He hobnobbed with celebrities and attended the wedding of Frank Sinatra and Mia  Farrow when the rest of the news media was shut out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Friend of Howard Hughes  </P> <P> His friendship with Howard Hughes led to the billionaire's move to Las Vegas in  1966 on Greenspun's invitation. Hughes bailed the city out of a recession,  whitewashed its mobster reputation and bought more than $100 million in hotels  and land.  </P> <P> Articulate, dynamic and fearless, Greenspun was a favorite interview subject  for the national media in search of Las Vegas exposes and often appeared on  network television.  </P> <P> His widely read front-page column, "Where I Stand," which he pounded out on a  battered Underwood typewriter, was feared and loved, ruthless and  heart-rending.  </P> <P> He both attacked and defended politicians, suspected mobsters, the federal  government, organized labor, judges, lawmakers and citizens as he played a  major role in shaping the skyline, reputation and policy of Las Vegas as it  grew from a small desert town into the state's largest city and a worldwide  tourist destination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Showed Compassion  </P> <P> Greenspun never backed away from a good fight, whether the foe was a powerful  politician, law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service or a business mogul.  He was compassionate toward the disadvantaged and downtrodden, employing many  handicapped people, supporting local charities and doling out toys from a  closet in his office to children who stopped in off the street.  </P> <P> His battle scars were numerous. He triumphed over an advertising boycott of his  newspaper instigated by U.S. Sen. Pat McCarran, and when Sen. Joseph R.  McCarthy publicly denounced him as an "ex-communist," Greenspun turned the  tables and accused McCarthy of being a Nazi sympathizer with communist  leanings.  </P> <P> During the 1972 Watergate scandal, burglars broke into Greenspun's office at  the Las Vegas Sun and tried to open his safe. The publisher believed the  intruders were White House "plumbers" seeking documents he possessed relating  to a $100,000 contribution from Hughes to President Richard M. Nixon to lift a  Justice Department order blocking the tycoon from buying any more Las Vegas  hotels.  </P> <P> E. Howard Hunt later testified that he and G. Gordon Liddy had, indeed, planned  a burglary of Greenspun's safe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defends Claiborne  </P> <P> In the mid-1980s, the Sun boldly defended Nevada federal Judge Harry Claiborne  throughout the investigation and trials that led to Claiborne's historic ouster  from the bench.  </P> <P> Born Herman Milton Greenspun in Brooklyn, N.Y., Aug. 27, 1909, Greenspun  graduated from St. John's School of Law and aspired to be a trial lawyer but  changed his mind after a client admitted stabbing a man to death, saying he  could not defend such people.  </P> <P> Greenspun fought in France as a captain in General George S. Patton's 3rd Army.  He was awarded the Croix de Guerre with silver star, Conspicuous Service Cross  for the State of New York, four battle stars and a commendation from Gen.  Dwight D. Eisenhower.  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife, Barbara; sons, Brian and Danny; daughters Janie  Gale and Susan Fine; a brother, David; a sister, Alice Goldberg, and nine  grandchildren, all of Las Vegas.  </P></p>

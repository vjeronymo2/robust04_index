Think  not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they  live, finding their sustenance from their Lord. [Koranic verse]    The General Committee of the GPC announces the death of  brother 'Abd-al-Hamid Ahmad Mahmud al-Sarfi and Mahdi Muhammad  Subayh, members of the GPC and two of its leading cadres in the  Bani-al-Harith District, (?Sa'dah) Governorate. The two were  killed in a criminal assassination attempt carried out by a  professional group belonging to one of the political  organizations that adopt violence as a means to deal with those  who differ with them. The incident took place the day before  yesterday.    We in the GPC denounce and condemn this incident and all  acts  of terrorism and ask the security agencies to promptly arrest  the killers, put them on trial, and give them a just punishment.  The security agencies should also uncover the motives of those  behind the plot.    We also take this opportunity to reassert to our people our  absolute faith and full commitment to national principles and  state that we will be the first to champion those principles,  for which the two martyred died.    The GPC urges all its members, supporters, and sons of the  great Yemeni people to be vigilant and foil any feverish  attempts that seek to undermine Yemeni national gains and the  achievements of the Yemeni people.    We share with the GPC branch in the Bani-al-Harith and its  supporters, members, the families of the martyrs, and the sons  of the Bani-al-Harith, the sorrow of this loss. We also beseech  God to have mercy on the two and place them in paradise, along  with martyrs and righteous people, and to grant their families  patience and solace. To God we are and unto Him we shall  return. May the eyes of the cowardly remain sleepless.    Issued by the General Committee of the GPC on 17 February  1994.    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. To the  righteous soul will be said: O thou soul: In complete rest and  satisfaction, come back thou to thy Lord, well pleased thyself  and well-pleasing unto Him. Enter thou, then, among My  devotees. Ye, enter thou My heaven. [Koranic verse]</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Auditors receive writ over Clowes SPICER &amp; PEGLER, the accountancy firm that is now part of Touche Ross, has been issued with a writ concerning its audit of Barlow Clowes, the fund management company closed by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1988. The writ was issued by the Treasury and partners in Cork Gully, liquidators of Barlow Clowes. Touche, with which Spicer merged in 1990, confirmed that a protective writ had been issued but not served. It had not received a statement of claim quantifying the damages sought. The collapse of Barlow Clowes led to compensation payments totalling Pounds 150m by the government to 18,000 investors. Touche said last night: 'An exhaustive and detailed study by the ombudsman showed that the major responsibility lay with the DTI and we agree with the ombudsman's findings.' In February this year Mr Peter Clowes, the company's founder, was jailed for 10 years for theft and fraud. The joint disciplinary scheme operated by the accountancy professional bodies reopened its investigation into the involvement of Spicer &amp; Pegler and Touche Ross - which took over the audit from Spicer &amp; Pegler - with Barlow Clowes shortly after the close of the trial. A DTI inspectors' investigation is also under way.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "responsible source" at the General People's </F> Congress General Committee to SABA'; date not given]    [Excerpt] We were all surprised by the statement by brother  'Ali Salim al-Bid, Presidential Council vice chairman, to the  United Arab Emirates' English-language newspaper, THE GULF NEWS,  on 16 March. These statements were reported by news agencies and  some world radios. Al-Bid said in that interview that if a  plebiscite is held in the southern and eastern provinces, the  majority will prefer returning to conditions that existed before  22 May 1990. This is secession.    We regret this statement by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  secretary general. It casts doubt on the patriotism of citizens  in the southern and eastern provinces and on their adherence to  unity. We express our absolute rejection of this accusation,  which we consider to be directed against all the Yemeni people.  We consider this statement an accusation of the YSP itself  because we firmly believe most YSP members adhere to, and will  continue to adhere to, unity and democracy. The forces of  defection and secession that have influence inside the YSP draw  strength from foreign forces that target unity and democracy in  Yemen. We believe this statement is not only a serious  accusation directed against the the Yemeni people, particularly  the majority of YSP members, but also a statement with very  serious dimensions.

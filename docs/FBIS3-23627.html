			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Oliynyk under the rubric "Topical!": </F> "Ukraine Must Not Step on the `Pan-Slavic Rake'"]    [Text] One need not be a people's deputy to notice  that the development of the military-political situation in  Russia is calling into question the guarantees of President  Yeltsin with regard to the security of Ukraine, which signed the  trilateral declaration. The example of Georgia, which has agreed  to station Russian troops on its territory as a consequence of  its policy of hand-wringing, testifies to the fact that the  Russian Federation has set about in practice the realization of  its great-power intentions, and more precisely the realization  of a plan of peacekeeping activity that has been approved by  neither the UN nor the CSCE.    There would be no grounds for alarm if we were to be guided  by the logic of official Kiev. The more so as Ukraine, with its  quite powerful army, is not the Baltic republics, which are  raising an international hubbub about recent statements by  Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev with regard  to the defense of the Russian-speaking population of the former  USSR. The Baltic republics have not yet recovered from the shock  of this imperialist declaration.    An analysis of the changes in the military-political  situation in Russia that was performed on the eve of the New  Year by specialists at the National Institute of Strategic  Studies [NISD], however, does not instill optimism and is  confirmed by recent events.    Ukraine has come to be in an arc of strong pressure on more  than the common border with Russia, which is 1,270 kilometers,  alone; add to it the uncertain situation in Crimea, and the  activation of the 14th Army of General Lebed in the Dniester  region, who--while in the latest twist calling his former  comrades-in-arms from the leadership of the unrecognized  Dniester Republic criminals--has actually confirmed suspicions  of the transformation of this part of Moldova into an area of  ad hoc Russian military autonomy.    The southern region of Russia is taking on greater  insecurity  for Ukraine after the agreement of Yeltsin and Shevardnadze on  the Russian military bases on Georgian territory. Russia has up  to now had a common border here with Ukraine through the  Krasnodar Kray region, with access to Black Sea ports. If, as  has been announced, Georgia agrees to protect external borders  along with Russia, then Russia will expand considerably its  naval presence on the Black Sea, notwithstanding the joint--and  de facto Russian--control of the Black Sea Fleet. The  elections in the Crimea have energized the Don Cossacks, who  recently openly declared their claims on a portion of the  territory of Ukraine. Analysts at the NISD do not rule out  possible military conflicts in the future with the participation  of the Don Cossacks, who feel themselves to be the defenders of  the national interests of Russia.    The statements by Minister Grachev regarding the conflict in  Yugoslavia, and the army that Russia is creating today, also  arouse no less alarm.    The accelerated creation of Russian operational-strategic  formations (something along the lines of the rapid-deployment  forces), which have already received the name of the Mobile  Forces of Russia, is attracting the particular attention of  analysts.    These formations, at first glance, are being formed up only  for use within Russia. According to the latest reports, however,  the Mobile Forces will be able to carry out assigned tasks "in  any theater of military operations" as early as 1995.    Russian Minister of Defense Grachev has indicated, not  without satisfaction, that Russia has long dreamed of a "mighty  combat fist," which could effectively restrain an enemy until  the deployment of the main forces, in case of an incursion onto  its territory.    Doubts regarding the exclusively domestic employment of the  Mobile Forces, however, are confirmed not only by the military,  but also by Russian diplomats, who are trying to show the world  at every opportunity that Russia is still ready to perform  "specific" tasks in zones of ethnic conflicts under the aegis of  the CIS or as a "peacekeeper" with the authority of the UN.    The structure of the mobile forces testifies to their nature  and long-term aims. Several helicopter regiments of  ground-forces aviation, three battalions of marine infantry, PVO  [air-defense] and communications units and fighter and bomber  squadrons, as well as military-transport aviation, are  subordinate to their command, for a start. All of these  constitute a formation at the highest degree of readiness--the  immediate-response forces. Sixty percent of the composition of  the Mobile Forces is airborne-assault units, and the other forty  is motorized-rifle and special forces, surface-to-air missile  and helicopter units, a mobile communications center and space  communications gear, fighter, bomber and military-transport  aviation units, battalions of marine infantry and  airborne-assault battalions.    As we see, at a time when the Ukrainian people's deputies  consider nuclear weapons, which cannot be physically used  against any aggressor, to be a guarantee of the security of  Ukraine, Russia is purposefully, as any normal nation should,  and actively rebuilding its armed forces in parallel with the  disarmament of Ukraine. Today, therefore, when a knot of  contradictions and mutual offenses has accumulated between  Russia and Ukraine, the activation of military organizational  development in Russia is forcing Ukraine to define a  qualitatively new conceptual framework in relations with its  northern neighbor. A wager on the stability of Yeltsin could  lead to the fact that Ukraine, as in the times of Khmelnytskyy,  could once again step on the "pan-Slavic rake."</p>

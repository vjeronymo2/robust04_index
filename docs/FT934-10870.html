			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Time Warner and Tribune launch television network MEDIA companies Time Warner and Tribune announced yesterday that they were joining forces to launch a fifth US prime time television network - in direct competition with Paramount Communications and Chris-Craft Industries, which also unveiled plans for a network last week. 'There is room for one more broadcast network, but only one,' said Mr Jamie Kellner, who will head the new organisation. 'This is it.' Mr Kellner played an important role in the launch of the fourth US network, Fox, which was set up in 1986 by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Programming for the network will be provided by Time-Warner's Warner Brothers subsidiary, one of the leading suppliers of prime-time television in the US. Tribune, which publishes the Chicago Tribune newspaper, will contribute at least six of its seven television stations, covering some 19 per cent of US households. Time Warner's cable interests would take the coverage to 29 per cent. Paramount and Chris-Craft said stations they owned would give their network access to 27 per cent of US households. Both sides will be battling to affiliate the 280 independent stations in the US which are not already tied into one of the three big longstanding television networks - CBS, ABC and NBC - or Fox. Yesterday, Warner said that it expected the network would initially cover 85 per cent of US households. It already had commitments from station groups representing 40 per cent coverage of the country. Analysts reckon that a network needs to achieve at least 70 per cent coverage to attract the advertising necessary to support a large amount of original programming. They doubt there is room in the US for more than one more network, given the limited pool of unaffiliated stations and increased competition for advertisers' dollars. Warner intends to start its network in the autumn of next year, while Paramount's venture is due to start up in January 1995.</p>

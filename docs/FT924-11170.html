			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Bunds ease as hopes of imminent rate cut dashed GERMAN government bond prices dropped a quarter of a point as senior Bundesbank officials yesterday stressed the central bank's commitment to price stability, dashing the bund market's hopes of an imminent cut in rates. Dealers said the bund market had hoped to see a cut in key interest rates as early as Thursday. However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, his deputy, stressed in separate speeches that the Bundesbank was not about to abandon its tough anti-inflationary policies. Mr Tietmeyer said a departure from monetary policy aimed at stability would be irresponsible. Medium and long-dated bunds fell as the statements were seen as killing any hope of an imminent cut in interest rates. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 91.81 and rose to a high of 91.93 early in the session, but ended the day at around 91.46. SUPPLY pressures and continued uncertainty ahead of next week's presidential election left US Treasury prices unchanged-to-weaker in slow trading yesterday. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 95 11/32 , yielding 7.642 per cent, but well off its lows for the day. The two-year note was unchanged at 99 13/32 , yielding 4.306 per cent. Prices slipped from the start as market players sold off some of their inventories ahead of this week's auctions of new government securities. The Treasury is due to sell Dollars 15bn in two-year notes later today, followed by another Dollars 10.75bn in five-year notes tomorrow. The next quarterly refunding programme also looms, and with so much new supply in the pipeline investors and dealers are nervous about the outlook for the market. The presidential race was also to blame for the subdued nature of trading. The unexpected revival of Mr Ross Perot's standings in the polls only served to heighten investor nervousness about the outcome of next Tuesday's vote. POLITICAL and economic worries combined to push down UK government bond prices, although the gilt market later recovered some of its losses to end only slightly lower or unchanged on the day. Dissent within the Conservative party over the prospects for European economic and monetary union and worries about inflation following the release of the latest quarterly figures from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) depressed the market, dealers said. The CBI data suggested that the decline in pay settlements may have bottomed out. The 9 per cent gilt due 2008 edged up from 101 5/8 to 101 21/32 while shorter-dated issues slipped. Dealers estimate the Bank of England may have sold up to half of its new tap stock yesterday. On Friday, the Bank announced it would offer Pounds 1bn of a newly-created stock - the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998. The new stock is partly-paid and dealers expect most of the proceeds will be used to buy back the Pounds 750m outstanding of 9 per cent stock due 1992/96. 'The Bank is taking advantage of falling yields and replacing a relatively high coupon stock with a lower coupon issue,' said one dealer. JAPANESE government bonds slipped on profit-taking following their rally at the end of last week. The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.78 per cent and ended at 4.795 per cent, corresponding to the low price of the day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mike Robertson and Edyth Bulbring] </F>   [Text] The document Mohammend Valli Moosa carried in his  briefcase is just five pages long. But what it contains -- a  list of changes to government structures that have to be made in  terms of the constitution -- is a task so mammoth that if Mr  Valli Moosa and his fellow ANC members do nothing else in their  first year in office, they will have achieved much.    But, simultaneously, the ANC will want to begin implementing  its reconstruction and development programme. It will also have  to deal with a secessionist KwaZulu government and a rebellious  right wing.    Almost impossible challenges await the new government, but  somebody has to formulate plans to meet them. As the ANC is  the only party that seriously believes it will win the  election, that task has fallen to a small sub-committee of its  senior members headed by president Nelson Mandela.    Others on the task group are ANC chairman Thabo Mbeki,  secretary- general Cyril Ramaphosa and national working  committee members. Mohammed Valli Moosa, Cheryl Carolus and Zola  Skweyiya.    The plans prepared by the group can be divided roughly into  three categories:     -  Changes that have to be made at national level;    -  Changes that have to be made at provincial level; and    -  The appointment of the various statutory bodies provided for  in  the constitution.    The constitution states that President F.W. de Klerk and  his cabinet will continue to run the country after the elections  until the new president is inaugurated. If, as expected, Mr  Mandela wins the election, Mr de Klerk will consult him before  taking any action.    On May 6, the 400 members of the new National Assembly will  meet in Cape Town to elect the president. As the rules that  governed the functioning of Parliament no longer apply, the  Assembly will have to draw up its own set of rules. In the  meantime, a temporary set of rules has had to be drawn up in  conjunction with the Secretary of Parliament.    On May 10, the new president will be inaugurated at the  Union  Buildings in Pretoria. The arrangements are being overseen by a  committee under the chairmanship of Chief Justice Corbett.    The president will appoint his cabinet the following day.    The task group has clearly given much thought to possible  cabinet appointments, but as these appointments are ultimately  the prerogative of the new president, Mr Valli Moosa would not  comment on this matter. However, interviewed in his Shell House  office, he did offer some thoughts on how the ANC believed the  cabinet should be structured.    He said cabinet committees would oversee the reconstruction  and development programme and the promotion of gender equality.    Rather than have a Law and Order Ministry, control of the  police should fall under the Home Affairs Department, he added.    The Department of Environment should be given much stronger  powers than at present, and a Ministry of Science and Technology  should be created. The committee has clearly also given much  thought to candidates who could fill the post of  director-general in each department. However, Mr Valli Moosa  would only say that the matter was being discussed within ANC  departments.    At a lower level, there will have to be seismic changes in  the civil services and these will also have an impact on the new  provincial governments. Under the new dispensation, the number  of civil services in South Africa will be reduced from the  current 15 to 10. The restructuring of the civil services will  be arduous task which could necessitate uprooting many people's  lives.    For example, the area that is now Bophuthatswana will fall  into the Northern Cape, the North West and the Orange Free  State. Civil servants will be transferred to the new provincial  governments.    Some functions, such as foreign affairs and defence, will be  taken over by the central government, and senior military  officers could be required to move to Pretoria.    The constitution stipulates that a range of functions will  have to be transferred from central to provincial government.  Civil servants working for the central government in Pretoria  may accordingly have to be transferred.    Millions of people will be affected by these changes, which  will be dealt with by the president in consultation with the  nine provincial premiers, the Public Service Commission (which  has to be appointed as soon as practically possible after the  election) and the Commission on Provincial Government.    The third broad category of constitution requirements facing  Mr Valli Moosa and the task force -- the appointment of a range  of new statutory bodies -- includes the appointment of a  constitutional court, a public prosecutor, a Judicial Services  Commission and a Human Rights Commission.    Not least of the task force's difficulties will be the  appointment of the right person for the right job. More  complicated than most will be the task of appointing the  constitution court judges. The president will appoint the head  of the constitutional court. The fact that top ANC legal  experts Arthur Chaskalson and Albie Sachs are not standing for  the election suggests they could be in line for this post.    Four serving judges will be appointed by the president in  consultation with the cabinet and the Chief Justice. The  remaining six judges will be chosen from a list of 10 submitted  by the Judicial Services Commission.    But that commission has yet to be set up and there are even  more elaborate procedures for appointing its members. For  example, the constitution states that the attorneys' profession  has to appoint two members. There is no single body  representing attorneys.    The constitutional court has to be established as soon as  possible after the election. It will hear any case involving a  possible violation of a fundamental right entrenched in the  constitution.    Given the complexities of the task awaiting the new  government, it is no wonder Mr Valli Moosa speaks rather  wistfully of the U.S. where a new president is given three  months to prepare to govern and appoint members of his  administration. South Africa's new president will be afforded  no such luxuries.  <H5>  DIARY OF CHANGE </H5>    -  April 26-28: Elections    -  April 29-30: Election results announced    -  May 5: Provincial legislatures meet in nine temporary  capitals  to elect premiers    -  May 6: The National Assembly meets in Cape Town to elect the  new president; provincial premiers announce their cabinets; the  National Assembly elects the speaker and the deputy speaker    -  May 10: Inauguration of the new president at the Union  Buildings in Pretoria    -  May 11: The president announces his Cabinet of National Unity    -  May 15: Prior to this date, provincial legislatures must each  elect 10 senators    -  May 27: Prior to this date, the president will appoint  members  of the Commission on Provincial Government    -  May 28: Prior to this date, the chief justice must convene  the  first sitting of the Senate in Cape Town    -  June: the Budget will be tabled for discussion and approval  early in June    -  June 4: Prior to this date, the president of the Senate must  convene the first meeting of the Constitutional Assembly (the  Senate and National Assembly), which will write the final  constitution.</p>

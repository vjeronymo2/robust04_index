			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RHM's milling side in Tomkins' sights MR GREG Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, yesterday gave the first details of how his Smith &amp; Wesson handgun and bicycle conglomerate is to integrate Ranks Hovis McDougall, bought last year for Pounds 935m. Most analysts believe that for RHM to be a successful acquisition Tomkins would need to turn around the marginally profitable milling and baking division, so it was not surprising most attention has alighted on this cut-throat market. But for observers of the bread wars that periodically hit supermarkets and currently have suppliers in a tight grip, there were only crumbs of reassurance that some of the imbalance will be removed from the market. 'We have a pretty open mind about Tomkins but still need a bit of convincing that the milling and baking industry is going to turn around in the short run,' said Mr David Lang, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite. Nevertheless, Tomkins has made a start and Mr Hutchings says British Bakeries' 'capacity has (been brought) more into line with demand'. Production is now 'concentrated in the efficient bakeries.' British Bakeries has closed bakeries in Croydon and Exeter and a plant at Taffs Well in Wales. Capacity has been cut at Wimbush bakery in Birmingham and distribution depots at Liverpool and Preston have closed with Grimsby depot soon to follow. 'I do not think RHM have done a great job,' Mr Hutchings says. 'There is a huge amount of cost saving which we can do.' He says he is not planning any price benefits - by increasing prices - but will be taking out capacity. In the five months since Tomkins took control, 7 per cent of RHM capacity had already gone. There remains, however, the matter of the RHM challenge to ABF before Tomkins took over. 'There is still a problem of relative market share before we can see any balance returning to the industry,' said Mr Lang. 'They have taken a lot of market share off the market leader (ABF) who is obviously intent on getting it back.' It is a view with which Mr Hutchings does not concur. 'I think it will settle down to those sorts of market-share numbers for ever,' Mr Hutchings said. 'If they lose money, we lose money; if they make money, we make money.' Tomkins has also recognised the value of the brands it has taken over. It said yesterday it would be increasing the brand advertising budget by Pounds 8m over the next 12 months, a move that has reassured some food analysts who suspected Tomkins would be tempted to milk the brands. Elsewhere Tomkins says it has accelerated the search for savings, particularly in labour costs, at Rank Hovis, the flour milling business which has been hard hit the the poor breadmaking wheat harvest.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / The FT Interview: And finally . . . coffee at the Ritz - Trevor McDonald recalls his early days in Trinidad, his dangerous assignments, and his rise to number one newsreader There was little danger of missing Trevor McDonald at our appointed meeting place, the Ritz. For the sole anchor on ITN's News At Ten is surely the best known black man in Britain, with the possible exception of Frank Bruno. And the viewers love him: a recent Gallup Poll showed that the West Indian with the clipped moustache and even more clipped delivery was streets ahead of his nearest newscasting rival. McDonald has just written a book about his previous life as a reporter: a colourful tale in which he presses the flesh with everyone from Burl Ives to Saddam Hussein; talks to Colonel Gadaffi in his tent; and chats over a snack of iguana in the jungle with Daniel Ortega. On one assignment he has a submachinegun thrust in his belly; on another, he wins the toss to be the first journalist to interview Nelson Mandela after his 27 years in prison. In spite of all this, the reason for his fame is his presence in the blue neon ITN 'spaceship' five evenings a week, reading words from an autocue to up to 7m viewers. Does he think so much fame is justified for doing so little? 'It is easy to say 'how silly'. But on the other hand people want to watch someone they feel comfortable with.' To hear him talk about it, the job sounds a piece of cake: 'You have to read well, and construct your sentences clearly.' But if it's that easy, why are some newscasters so much more popular than others? 'I don't understand it, but I'm glad it's me they like,' he says, then adding after a pause for thought: 'It's like reading for the Royal Shakespeare Company - you use all the same tricks.' McDonald refers to the English classics with a frequency that is most un-English. Indeed he speaks an archaic language all his own, sprinkling otherwise plain speech with quotes from Tennyson and words such as 'interlocutor' and 'ineluctable'. He confesses he is beginning to find his own fame a little frightening: 'A lady came up to me in the supermarket the other day and told me that a few days before she had seen me cross the road against the lights. Her little girl said: 'That newsman has broken the law. We must stop watching the news if he behaves like that.'' But far from looking frightened, he seems amused. He appears to be wearing his fame well, liking the attention, yet not letting it turn his head. 'You are built up to be greater than you are,' he says, modestly. One of the things that may explain his popularity as a newscaster is that he comes across as a decent bloke. His book is riddled with examples of his sunny view of the human condition. But despite his optimism, McDonald is not a Good News man. Indeed he regards the campaign by his BBC counterpart, Martyn Lewis for less gloom and doom on the box as puerile. 'It is so far off the agenda of what journalism is about, that I get worried. The function of journalists is to tell what is going on. Not to be social engineers.' He argues that the debate stems from a fallacy. 'It is a mistake that the media abhors good news. Some of the biggest money we have spent at ITN recently has been on the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the transformation in South Africa. When there is good news we go overboard. I would love more apple pie. More lunches at the Ritz, more champagne for everyone. But life isn't like that.' For McDonald himself, life these days is a little like that. As he sits in his perfect business suit politely asking the waiter for fresh orange juice and black coffee you would think he had been born at the Ritz rather than in Trinidad. McDonald presents his Caribbean childhood as poor but happy, with a beloved father who made shoes to pay for his children's education. 'I really adored my father. He was an educator, disciplinarian, friend, counsellor and drinking buddy. He was not formally educated, but he had an extraordinary view of what was necessary to succeed. He always said: whether you are a doctor, a lawyer or a dustman, you have to strive.' The day his father died McDonald was in Moscow. He recalls how strings were pulled by one of Gorbachev's assistants to get him on the next flight home. 'My father would have been so proud that his name was uttered in the corridors of power at the Kremlin,' he says. Although he is proud of his roots, McDonald is low key about being West Indian in Britain. He claims he has never been discriminated against - his colour has neither helped nor hindered his rise: 'Racism is not as prevalent in the media as on the milkround.' Characteristically, he is upbeat about race relations in Britain. 'This is a multi-racial society. Nothing on God's earth will change it. It is ineluctable, irrevocable. People will learn to adjust.' But surely politicians can do something to help the process? McDonald agrees, hinting that the Conservative government is making matters worse. He deplores those politicians 'who stand up at party conferences making speeches for cheap laughs in which they say that they understand the fear of communities being swamped'. He argues that a simple declaration from the government of its intention to improve race relations would in itself do much good. I wonder whether he couldn't do a little more himself to help blacks in this country. He looks a bit uncomfortable. 'I visit schools a lot.' He pauses and corrects himself: 'To be very honest I don't do it a lot, but whenever I can.' The question seems to have hit a sensitive spot: 'I could have done more, but have not had the time. With all the travelling, and trying to keep up the pretence of being a father and a husband, it is not always very easy . . . '</p>

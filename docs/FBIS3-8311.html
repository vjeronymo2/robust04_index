			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Promotion, graduation, and oath-taking  ceremonies for new officers and the start of school activity at  the Defense Academy of the Republic of Albania were held in one  of the halls of the Military Academy this morning. [passage  omitted]    Prime Minister Meksi conveyed the greetings of Sali Berisha,  president of the Republic and commander general, to those  present. He wished them success in their new, sacred task of  defending the country. Among other things, Meksi said:    [Begin Meksi recording] Today is a remarkable day for you  and the Army. Your promotion and graduation, as well the start  of the school process in the Defense Academy, which is  completely reformed and restructured, constitute an important  achievement. All this is being held at a historic moment of  special importance, at a time when real democracy is being  consolidated in our country and when, on the international  level, Albania's position has been improved and recognized  through its numerous education activities in many important  international institutions.    Consequently, even our Army, with its reformation, has  already broken the framework of long isolation by cooperating  with many armies of Western and other democratic countries, thus  aiming to be converted into a qualitative, modern, and  contemporary army. These prospects become more certain due to  the approach to NATO as well as the signing of the Partnership  for Peace initiative, which will naturally integrate Albania  into the bosom of the NATO alliance. However, the road to  membership passes through the difficult but indispensable road  of efficiency, increased military and contemporary knowledge,  high discipline, and a very high state of alertness.

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> REHNQUIST URGES JUDGES PAY HIKE  </P> <P> Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist urged Congress today to give the nation's  federal judges an immediate 30% pay raise.  </P> <P> Calling inadequate salaries "the most serious threat to the future of the  judiciary," Rehnquist sought support for legislation providing the raise and  regular cost-of-living adjustments.  </P> <P> "This is not, in my view, fairly termed a pay raise," Rehnquist said in a  statement to the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee. "This is  instead a partial recapture of the tremendous decline in purchasing power that  has affected judicial salaries over the last 20 years."  </P> <P> He said he recognizes that there was "widespread public opposition" to a  defeated proposal for a much larger 51% pay raise for senior government  officials, including members of Congress and federal judges.  </P></p>

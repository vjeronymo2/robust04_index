			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Kidder Peabody's Cerullo resigns Mr Edward Cerullo, the head of fixed income at Kidder Peabody, yesterday became the latest senior executive to resign from the troubled US securities firm. Kidder was rocked earlier this year by the discovery of what it claims was a scheme to create fictitious profits of Dollars 350m by Mr Joseph Jett, a bond trader in Mr Cerullo's division. Both Kidder and Mr Cerullo depicted yesterday's resignation as a voluntary act, not linked to a failure to supervise Mr Jett properly. In a statement, Mr Cerullo said that he was leaving because, 'given the events of recent months, I believe new management is best served by having its own team in place'. Asked whether it had asked for the resignation, Kidder said: 'This is an independent decision by Ed Cerullo.' The resignation was 'solely due to the reason stated' by Mr Cerullo, the company added. The departure comes just days before the expected publication of an investigation into the Jett allegations which is being carried out for Kidder and its parent, General Electric, by Mr Gary Lynch, a former head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission. GE indicated recently that the report would be completed by early August. The Lynch report, which has already taken longer to produce than initially indicated, is expected to examine the adequacy of Kidder's controls in the light of the allegations surrounding Mr Jett. Given his position as the person directly responsible for supervising Mr Jett, questions had inevitably been raised about Mr Cerullo's future at the firm, along with that of Mr Richard O'Donnell, the company's chief financial officer, who remains in place. Kidder's chairman and chief executive, Mr Michael Carpenter, left the firm at the end of last month, while Mr Michael Keehner, a former head of its broking operations, resigned a week ago.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tasso Jereissati, the president of the </F> Brazilian Social Democracy Party -- PSDB -- by Leticia Lins, in  Fortaleza; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Lins] Do you think Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso is comfortable after launching the  stabilization plan? If the measures are successful he will be  considered a hero; if they are boycotted by Congress, however,  he cannot be held responsible for their failure.    [Jereissati] On the contrary, his position is very  difficult.  He is completely involved and very much imbued in the Economic  Stabilization Plan. He is a man of great historical perception  and understands that he is on the brink of the historic  possibility of solidly solving the inflation problem. He gained  credit before the country as the man capable of crafting the  great commitment that has been needed for years, a commitment  that is known in many ways; the national pact, conciliation,  etc. Thus Cardoso's decision to stay or leave is not easy.    [Lins] Not long ago it was said that you, as president of  the  PSDB, would run as vice presidential candidate to PT [Workers  Party] candidate Lula's [Luis Ignacio da Silva] presidential  bid. Are the negotiations over?    [Jereissati] The PT has a social democratic group, which is  currently one of the most interesting political factions in the  country. This faction is not the majority in its party. This  was demonstrated during the last internal elections for PT  regional executive boards. Lula is hostage of the rest of the  party. Furthermore, the PT and the PSDB have different  platforms. Although we have some points in common with Lula,  unfortunately he is disavowed by his own party.    [Lins] Are there no more negotiations with the PT?    [Jereissati] The talks were hampered. Apart from the  different platforms of our parties, we are unable to agree with  the harsh criticisms by Lula of the Economic Stabilization Plan.  Since our alliances are discussed around programs and  objectives and not around names, our differences prevent a  greater understanding.    [Lins] But Lula has demanded an alliance and accuses your  party of being indecisive. Has the PSDB decided that it will  not share a ticket with the PT?    [Jereissati] We are not indecisive. We are constant. We  agree regarding a Parliamentarian government system, opening the  economy, state reform, and privatization. The points that are  constantly being changed are those upheld by the PT.    [Lins] Does this mean that the PSDB will run its own  candidate?    [Jereissati] The party has already decided that. We are  ready for the race, and it is currently very clear that the best  candidate profile is a PSDB member.    [Lins] With the success of the Economic Stabilization Plan,  will that PSDB candidate be Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso?    [Jereissati] If I said I would pull him out of his ministry  I  did not say so only as party president, but in face of a  political fact. If there is one point on which everyone agrees  in this country it is that the problem of Brazil is not economic  but political. The political problem is the lack of a great  national commitment in Brazil, capable of implementing a change.  Fernando Henrique Cardoso did exactly that: he compromised  several sectors of Brazilian society around a common objective,  which is stabilization. Since the moment he attained that, and  after proving his political competence, he earned the reputation  of being the only man capable of negotiating this highly desired  national commitment without making demagogic promises and  without posing as a savior of the nation. He has his feet  firmly on the ground, he does not pretend to be messianic, and  offers realistic proposals.    [Lins] So the Economic Stabilization Plan has made him a  stronger candidate?    [Jereissati] Society will clearly see the benefits and in 30  days everyone will see that he who negotiated a great national  commitment must not remain stuck in a smaller project on account  of calendar deadlines: Not only can he, but he must, launch  himself on a more important project.    [Lins] Like that, with what parties would you form  alliances?    [Jereissati] We want alliances because we are clearly aware  of the size of our party. There could be an impasse if we win  the elections but we lack majority in Congress. This is why we  must agree upon a government program to guarantee governability  and to finish with the endless exchange of favors and political  patronage to get executive branch initiatives approved in  Congress.    [Lins] Then, with which parties will you talk? With the  PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], the PFL [Liberal  Front Party], or with some PT sectors?    [Jereissati] The coalition we dream of is with the PFL and  the PMDB. It may seem strange but that is happening in the rest  of the world. Without seeming presumptuous, the world is  becoming social democratic. First we will establish the name of  our candidate and then we will begin talks. We began talks with  the PT. But now we must concentrate the best of our party with  the best of the PFL and the PMDB. We can unite our ideas around  a government program, we are open to support.    [Lins] What did you think of the Bahia PSDB note criticizing  an attempt to establish an alliance with the PFL?    [Jereissati] Any alliance suffers regional resistance and  this is exactly what is happening with Bahia. We do not fear  the idea of distorting our convictions because of the  candidates. We have a tradition of opposing when it was  necessary but ours has always been a coherent opposition based  on high principles. One can no longer engage in politics  pressured by ideological commitments. I do not fear the  calling-in of favors because I never occupied  government-designated posts and have participated in the great  movements such as the movement for direct elections.    [Lins] On the subject of an alliance with the PFL, Deputy  Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes is mentioned as a vice presidential  candidate in a ticket headed by the PSDB...    [Jereissati] He is a good candidate, but there has been  nothing definite yet. There has been no talks regarding names.  I can tell you that the PFL is supporting us in Congress  regarding the Economic Stabilization Plan.    [Lins] Do these discussions jeopardize the constitutional  reform process?    [Jereissati] Quite the contrary. The electoral atmosphere  jeopardizes it far more. The plan seeks to speed up the reform,  it pushes the reform forward. [passage omitted]    [Lins] Are you candidate for the Ceara State governorship,  for the Senate, or will you run as the possible replacement for  the finance minister?    [Jereissati] I intend to run for a seat in the Senate. For  the moment I do not plan to return to the Ceara government but I  have not fully ruled out this possibility. As for aspiring to  replace the finance minister, that is mere speculation by the  media. No one has asked me about this subject.    [Lins] Are you in favor of the reelection of governors?    [Jereissati] I have my doubts. It is not good to hold a post  for long because power is nasty and tends to ruin people. On  the other hand, three or four years are not long enough for  someone who has a serious government program to implement.    [Lins] Were you surprised by the Northeastern politicians'  veto on the name of Senator Beni Varas for the Regional  Integration Ministry?    [Jereissati] It is regrettable that we are still influenced  by political patronage, by petty and retrograde politics of  certain Northeastern leaderships interested in maintaining that  region in its current situation. That mentality not only exists  in the Northeastern region, it exists throughout the country.  Brazil needs statists, not men with limited and electoral  objectives. This is why I believe our economic growth can take  a huge and qualitative step forward with Fernando Henrique  Cardoso. Individualism belongs to the past. We will work for  the community and promote the State reform Brazil needs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The motor vessel (Brothers) has arrived in port in  Cuba after a 15-month voyage, during which time its crew bravely  confronted a seige by officials of the International Transport  Workers Federation, ITF, who tried to manipulate our sailors,  making them out to be demanding salaries and other such things.  The incident occurred in the Norwegian port of (Aldratagen),  where the (Brothers) arrived carrying a shipment of aluminum  powder for a factory located there. For several days, they were  beseiged by the gentlemen from the ITF, who tried to make the  Cubans out to be strikers demanding salaries. The staunch unity  of the vessel's 28 crew members and their powerful response was  not long in coming, and by means of placards and statements to  the press and to television -- means that were also used by the  ITF people to coerce them -- the Cubans denied the fib.    The (Brothers) returned victorious, and is now in the port  of  Cienfuegos unloading 22,000 tons of rice from Indonesia. There  we spoke with officers and crew members as well as with the  vessel's captain, Rogelio Rivero, who gave us this information  for the National Radio Newscast.</p>

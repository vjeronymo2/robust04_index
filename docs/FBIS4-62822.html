			<p>BFN     [Text] The CIS Executive Secretariat told Interfax that a  meeting of experts of CIS foreign ministries in Minsk Wednesday  failed to develop criteria for dividing up the Soviet merchant  fleet.    Belarusian representatives supported the resolution of the  issue on the basis of a multilateral agreement. They proposed  that the chairman of the CIS foreign ministers' council look  into the possibility of launching consultations on the issue  with the Baltic states.    Russia insisted on the merchant fleet's division bilaterally  between interested states and the Baltic states. If not  approved, Russian experts said they would remove the proposal  from the agenda.    Finally, the experts' meeting requested that the foreign  ministers' council take adequate measures to divide up the  Soviet merchant fleet.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Business leaders back Mandela as president Most of South Africa's senior businessmen would like to see Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, as president of South Africa, and they are overwhelmingly optimistic about the future. These are the somewhat surprising findings of a survey of top business people conducted last month for the South African Chamber of Business, the Weekly Mail and Guardian newspaper, and the South African Broadcasting Corporation. Professor Mark Orkin of the Community Agency for Social Enquiry, who conducted the research, said it showed top business figures 'have already embraced the political future and are optimistic about the business prospects heralded by an ANC-led government'. The core finding is optimism about the future, with 85 per cent of respondents predicting an optimistic future for their children or grandchildren. In the short term, 87 per cent of respondents felt the outlook for business was improving and 71 per cent felt it would improve further after the election. The main reason offered for short-term optimism was the increased certainty and stability that would follow an election. A surprising finding was that 68 per cent of respondents said they would 'most like' Mr Mandela for president. This compared with 32 per cent for President F W de Klerk and no support for Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Samir Hamtu] </F>   [Text] In the first comment on the "peace initiative"  proposed by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in Amman,  professor Khalid al-Hindi, dean of the Islamic University and a  leader of the Islamic Movement in the Gaza Strip, noted that one  cannot interpret this initiative as a concession by the Islamic  Movement. He said that the Islamic rejection of the Oslo accord  and the peace talks between Israel and the PLO stems from the  fact that this accord does not respond to the Palestinian  people's right to freedom, sovereignty, and independence.    Al-Hindi added: If the Israeli-PLO initiative had included  full Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967,  including Jerusalem, with a commitment to dismantle the  settlements, this initiative would not have faced widespread  opposition in the Palestinian street and from the Islamic  Movement in the current situation.    Al-Hindi pointed out that it can be said that Abu-Marzuq's  remarks contain new references to international legitimacy.  Al-Hindi expressed the belief that this initiative does not  address the issue so clearly as much as it refers to  international resolutions. He added: The important thing is not  the Palestinian side's but Israel's recognition of those  resolutions and its readiness to implement them. The PLO  recognized and accepted the international resolutions, but  Israel refused to implement them and forced the PLO to accept  something less.    Al-Hindi noted that the Islamic Movement will not accept to  undergo the same experience and that everything hinges primarily  on Israeli readiness in this field.    Al-Hindi denied the possibility of the Islamic Movement's  participation in the self-rule bodies. He said: This issue is  not relevant. Perhaps there might almost be a consensus to  refuse participation in any institutions or bodies supervising  the self-rule administration, especially as the Islamic Movement  opposes the self-rule plan.    On the effect of this initiative on the current talks  between  Israel and the PLO, al-Hindi expressed the belief that this  initiative does not represent a blow to the PLO because Israel  does not desire a just peace that gives the Palestinian people  their right to land, freedom, and independence. He added:  Israel will continue its march with the terms that are suitable  for it.    Al-Hindi expressed the belief that this initiative will not  deal a blow to the peace process, nor will it speed up the  realization of the Oslo accord because Israel acts on the basis  of whatever serves its interests and security.    On his expectations from the Israeli side's response to this  initiative, al-Hindi said: I do not expect a significant  response from the Israeli side because Israel is not thinking,  at all, of implementing international resolutions and  withdrawing. Therefore, we do not expect an effective response  from the Israeli side since there is agreement to continue the  talks with the PLO on the terms that Israel imposes from a  position of strength and in which it does not make any  concessions.    Hamas, through Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of its political bureau  in Amman, had proposed a peace initiative with Israel that  contained more flexible and realistic conditions than its  previous proposals.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Poland makes pledge on reforms Poland's new left-of-centre government has told the IMF it intends to continue with free market reforms to achieve financial stability, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. 'I'm encouraged by what I've heard,' Mr Richard Erb, IMF deputy director, said yesterday after two days of talks with senior officials. Mr Erb is the most senior western financial official to visit Poland since the election two months ago won by the former communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL). Mr Erb warned that 'it is important to continue with a strong budget policy and there is a need for further progress on lowering inflation'. So far this year prices have risen by an average of 35 per cent. Mr Erb was speaking after the government had said that the budget deficit next year would reach no more than 5 per cent of GDP, with inflation expected to reach 26 per cent.</p>

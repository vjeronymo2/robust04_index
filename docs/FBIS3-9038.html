			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament  today unanimously passed a constitutional law providing for  calling early elections on September 30-October 1. The law was  approved by all the 149 deputies present. The parliament has  150 seats.    The regular elections were to be held only in 1996. The  early elections are expected by optimists to produce a more  lasting solution to Slovakia's political instability.    The government crisis was solved within five days since the  parliament passed a vote of no confidence in former Prime  Minister Vladimir Meciar, when the former opposition succeeded  in forming a new cabinet under Jozef Moravcik.    Uncertainty has characterized the situation in the country  practically since the June 1992 elections because Meciar's  victorious Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) has failed  to ensure a parliamentary majority. Moreover political  squabbling was absorbing forces necessary to solve the  deteriorating economic and social situation.    The autumn date was also supported by the new opposition led  by ex-Prime Minister Meciar after their proposal to hold  elections at the beginning of summer failed. The drive to  collect a sufficient number of signatures to a petition on  calling a referendum on holding elections without delay, on the  mandates of "errant" parliamentary deputies and on the "purity"  of the money used in privatization has also failed.    The new government and the new coalition will have to face  for more than half a year the deteriorating problems of the  country and the harsh election campaign.    This will be followed by a decision on Slovakia's further  orientation and a verdict on a possible second "resurrection" of  ex- Prime Minister Meciar who undoubtedly played the main role  in the creation of independent Slovakia.    It was the methods and results of his rule that unified the  post- communist left, the right-orientated Christian democrats  and the "dissidents" from Meciar's HZDS who are seeking their  place in the middle of the political spectrum, and enlisted the  former opposition's support of the Hungarian coalition --  Egyutteles and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  (MKDH).    In reaction to today's vote in parliament, Jan Slota,  chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) which had formed the  ruling coalition with the HZDS, said "we had to support the date  (for early elections as proposed by the new government  coalition) because the president (Michal Kovac) marred the  referendum." But he added that he thought that the president  would prevent the referendum "even if we had 6,000 valid  signatures."    Olga Keltosova, former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs,  said that "elections are the only democratic way of bringing  somebody to power." She was apparently hinting to the way of  creation of the new government which the present opposition  deputies call illegitimate.</p>

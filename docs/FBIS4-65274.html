			<p>BFN     [Text] Duesseldorf (DDP/ADN) -- European unification is a  question of war and peace in the 21st century, according to  Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In view of the dramatic changes in  Germany, Europe, and the world in the past few years, the  priority now must be to make the political and economic  unification of Europe irreversible, Kohl said today at the 45th  master craftsmen's meeting of Duesseldorf Chamber of Trades and  Crafts.    Kohl reaffirmed his support for a federal Europe and firmly  rejected a central European bureaucracy. It is now primarily a  question of bringing life to the Maastricht Treaty. A common  asylum policy and the fight against cross-border crime are  important issues.    Europe is also vital for the German economy, the chancellor  said. Over 3.5 million jobs in Europe -- about every 10th job --  now depend on exports to the other countries of the European  Union.    Kohl pointed out that society needs a lively small business  sector which takes risks and is a dynamic force. He called upon  the trades and crafts sector to continue this year to do all it  can to ensure an adequate supply of training places. The state  will provide the necessary supplementary funds -- despite the  budget constraints -- only if they are proved to be insufficient.</p>

Visiting Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen held a formal talk today with Iranian Foreign Minister  'Ali Akbar Velayati.    The two ministers expressed their satisfaction with smooth  development of the bilateral relations and exchanged views on  further development of economic relations and trade between  China and Iran.

The exchange of visits  have advanced the steady development of friendly and cooperative  relations of the two countries.    His Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen echoed that both China  and Iran enjoy traditional friendship. The Chinese Government  pays great attention to developing friendly and cooperative  relations with Iran.    The Chinese foreign minister said that the bilateral  relations have developed in a sustained and stable way in the  past few years. The two countries share same or similar views on  many major international issues.    As a result, he added, the bilateral trade has grown very  fast and economic cooperation has been strengthened.    Speaking about the Afghan issue, Qian said that China is  deeply concerned about the Afghan situation and hopes that all  factions should avoid bloodshed and disputes and make a  permanent cease fire as soon as possible for the sake of state  and national interest.

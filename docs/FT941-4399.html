			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Technology: No frills approach - Andrew Fisher on how Siemens has achieved productivity and cost gains in the medical equipment market Tradition is being overturned at Siemens' new medical equipment plant near Nuremberg in southern Germany. Designers and marketing staff sit next to the production floor, their offices separated from the final assembly line only by a glass partition. Before, they would not even have been in the same building as the production workers, let alone be able to see the manufacturing process. They have been put side-by-side to help speed up the whole chain of operations from design to delivery. The move shows Siemens' determination to maintain the productivity and cost gains it has achieved in the highly competitive medical equipment market since it was confronted in the early 1980s with an onslaught from Japanese rivals and falling prices. At that time, Siemens found that what had previously been regarded as a strength of German industry - engineering perfectionism - was now turning out to be the opposite. It became increasingly, and derogatorily, termed 'over-engineering'. According to Werner Maly, head of Siemens' medical division: 'The entry of the Japanese and slower growth (in the market) meant that our strength was no longer our strength but our weakness.' After two decades of operating in a sellers' market, with medical equipment expensively customised for hospitals and other users, soaring costs were making public health authorities more price-conscious. 'Customers were no longer prepared to pay for special features,' says Maly. Japanese companies, on the other hand - led by Toshiba - offered products that met users' needs without being too sophisticated. Other manufacturers, like General Electric of the US, were also competing aggressively. Initially, says Maly, Siemens, whose medical division has a turnover of DM8bn (Pounds 3.1bn), or 10 per cent of the group total, met these challenges through strong marketing and highly efficient service. But the falls in the dollar and yen exacerbated its problems - 'our profits were under strong pressure'. So five years ago, it embarked on a radical programme to cut costs by streamlining its manufacturing operations, shortening development times and paring away unnecessary frills on its products. This shocked the Siemens engineers. 'German engineers are educated very differently from those in the US and Japan. They are trained to make products which are the best technically, while in the US and Japan 'design-to-cost' is stressed from the start.' A demand for costs to be cut by 40 per cent, and not by the usual 5 per cent or so a year, in computed tomography equipment was met with incredulity. CT machines, which produce slice-by-slice body images from X-rays, faced the strongest Japanese threat and sharpest fall in prices. 'Our engineers laughed. They said they couldn't do it. They went away and said 'we've done 15 per cent' and we said 'go back'. They managed 25 per cent and we kept sending them back.' Eventually, Siemens succeeded in cutting CT manufacturing costs by 50 per cent. Significant cost reductions were also achieved for other products. The division also did some 'reverse engineering' by taking apart a Japanese CT product. 'This was almost unheard of for our engineers,' Maly says. They were astonished to learn that not only was the Japanese equipment cheaper than the German, it was also better built. So Siemens added manufacturing quality to the list of sought-after improvements. Its cost-cutting efforts mainly comprised: cutting the number of extra features and controls on its products; purchasing more components from outside; building to order and not for stock; speeding up the time from design to production from five to three years (with help from McKinsey management consultants); and the cutting of central overheads by 40 per cent, a process which is still under way. As a result, the division cut its inventories by a fifth. It also lowered the time taken from receiving an order to installing the completed product. In the case of angiography equipment (for blood vessel X-rays), the advance was from 36 to 15 weeks, with a further reduction planned. This was at the new DM85m plant for CT and angiography products, still being completed near Nuremberg, not far from its headquarters at Erlangen. But the division has also expanded its operations outside Germany to keep down costs and help insulate it from currency fluctuations. Germany accounts for nearly 60 per cent of production (against 80 per cent in 1980), the US for more than 25 per cent, Sweden and the UK for more than 10 per cent, and China, India, Indonesia and Singapore and Spain for the rest. Five of the 14 medical product sectors, including nuclear medicine, ultrasound diagnostic systems and cardiac pacemakers, run their international activities from the US, which also accounts for nearly a third of turnover. In the UK, Siemens' joint venture with Oxford Instruments, Oxford Magnet Technology, resulted in a recent breakthrough, enabling its latest magnetic resonance imaging system - the Magnetom Open - to carry out body scans without patients having to go into a narrow, claustrophobia-inducing cylinder. The special magnet for the C-shaped scanner is made in Oxford and sent to Siemens plants in Germany and the US. Maly says that the exertions of the Siemens medical division over the past few years - including a rise in R&amp;D spending from DM590m to DM750m since 1990 - are starting to pay off. Cash flow is now above the group average. Its profit return after tax would also exceed the average but for the costs of shedding 2,200 jobs, with more to go this year; in 1992, the return was well below average. 'It was the world market that forced us to improve,' states Maly. As well as the fast-moving Japanese and US companies, including Picker which is owned by Britain's GEC, Siemens also has to contend with Philips of the Netherlands which has revitalised its medical business. 'This is one of the few industries where Europe is a high-tech leader,' he asserts.</p>

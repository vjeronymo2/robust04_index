			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Clinton hopes high as Senate debates bill THE US Senate yesterday began the serious and complicated business of putting its distinctive stamp of approval on President Bill Clinton's economic package, which easily passed the House of Representatives last week. The Senate, unlike the House, has few procedures limiting debate or the number of motions that may be offered. It was expected this week to consider as many as 60 amendments to the budget resolution bill, which is the broad blueprint of the president's proposals. The Democratic leadership, nurturing a 57-43 edge over the Republican party in the Senate, remains guardedly optimistic that Mr Clinton will get most of what he wants. But in Monday's preliminary debate, several conservative Democratic senators laid down markers that they were less than happy with some of the particulars in the bill. Senator Jeff Bingaman from New Mexico, for example, complained that the western states were being asked to bear too much of the burden of sacrifice involved in cutting the federal budget deficit. He objected to the proposals raising 'user fees' for farmers using federal land for grazing and to the impact on his region of the new energy tax. Senators David Boren from Oklahoma and John Breaux of Louisiana expressed sympathy with the position of Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin that the economy needed at best only about half the Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11.2bn) short-term stimulus recommended by Mr Clinton. Mr Kohl would prefer that the stimulus be deferred until after real spending cuts have been agreed. Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the armed services committee, again warned that defence spending should not be irresponsibly reduced. Senator Bennet Johnston of Louisiana may bring up his particular hobby horse, the introduction of a national value added tax. For their part, the Republicans may seek to embarrass Democrats by forcing a vote on Mr Clinton's proposal to increase income taxes on more affluent pensioners. Democrats have usually opposed tinkering with social security, one of the great monuments of President Roosevelt's New Deal. Senator Robert Dole, the minority leader, seems to have his troops in better disciplined order as the Democrats, for 12 years accustomed to a Republican president, adjust to the new reality of losing some of their notional independence in order to support the Democrat in the White House. But some moderate Republican senators, like James Jeffords of Vermont and Mark Hatfield of Oregon, are known to feel that reflexive opposition to everything in the president's package might not suit the party's interests best, especially given the broad public support for Mr Clinton's approach and the apparent national desire to end 'gridlock' in Washington.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Gardening: A passion for magnolias - Patricia Morison finds a great collection up for sale In England last week's hail buffeted magnolias, shredding the goblets of pink, purple and white. Such a cruel April must seem particularly unjust to David Clulow. In his Surrey garden, Clulow grows hundreds of magnolias - more than you might think any sane man could want. But then, Clulow is a collector, and when was a real collector ever entirely sane? Clulow used to spend Pounds 500 a week in winter to heat a collection of orchids. Then, suddenly, the passion left him. Seventeen years ago he bought an Edwardian house, high on a wooded ridge above Redhill, in Surrey. Running into a small valley was seven acres of neglected garden with a pond and an Edwardian rock-garden. With zeal and at considerable cost, Clulow plunged into the rarified world of magnolia-fanciers. This time, fate and not fickleness has ended the magnolia era. A few years ago, Clulow recalls, he was offered Pounds 5m for the optician's business he had built up. He declined to sell. At Christmas 1992, the business went into receivership. So the house, Tilgates, with nursery glasshouses packed with exceptionally rare plants, and more than 5,000 species of trees and shrubs, plus a National Collection of over 400 different kinds of magnolia, is on the market. Clulow knew nothing about gardening when he conceived the plan for an arboretum, and says that he is still not a gardener in the usual sense: 'I've never actually planted a magnolia in my life.' There were gardeners to do that, and Graham Rankin - later ruthlessly head-hunted for another magnolia collection - played an important part in making the collection. His employer was no dilettante, however, but a scientifically-minded amateur who relished hybridising and propagating. Fiddling with little bits of plant material in a glasshouse perhaps comes easily to someone used to fitting contact lenses. As in an optician's business, building a scientific plant collection needs impeccable records. Clulow keeps a computer record of his arboretum and produces his own elaborate labels. The magnolias are tagged in bold letters with details of their pedigrees and who collected, bred, grafted, or gave them to him. Magnolias have reached Tilgates from all over the world - often by the most circuitous routes. They arrived from an island arboretum off Korea owned by a banker, and from a magnolia nursery in Detroit; from Alabama, Oregon, Switzerland, Japan, Cornwall and New Zealand. Sometimes they have come as seeds, sometimes as bundles of twigs for Clulow to graft. Many varieties grown abroad have been sent for grafting by Otto and Gretel Eisenhut, 'propagating geniuses' at Ticino, which is popular with tax-exiles and magnolia-lovers alike. At around Pounds 80 for even a stellata, which is easy to propagate, it is not cheap to have a magnolia handmade in Ticino. Moreover, the real magnolia enthusiast likes to collect his new baby in person, armed with a plant import licence. To secure his Magnolia Atlas, which has the largest flowers of all, Clulow flew to New Zealand and brought back a 2ft scion to graft. Early this century, great collections of magnolias were made by landowners content to know that it would be the next generation which enjoyed the breathtaking glory of these trees in bloom. Today, clever grafting makes it possible to speed things up. This is what Clulow did when he started planting in the boom years of the mid-1980s. His magnolias are not seed-grown but are grafted on to the appropriate rootstock to produce dwarf plants which then flower earlier. The grafted hybrids of Magnolia campbellii, which flowered in February, all bore flowers in their third year. Text-books say they take up to 16 years. Betty Jessel, planted in 1986, might have taken as long as 25 years to flower if she had been raised from seed. So do not hang back thinking life is too short, is Clulow's advice. Identify the magnolia you want and get it grafted from a specialist nurseryman: buying dubious magnolias from a garden centre is a mug's game. Then feed your magnolias well, for enhanced performance. In the palmy days, Tilgates' magnolias enjoyed a foliar feed every two months, and some fanatic collectors feed their plants weekly. It is impressive to see how tall some magnolias can grow in less than a decade. Exquisite white M. denudata, the tree grown for 1,000 years at Chinese temples, was planted in 1988 and stands at a respectable 16ft. Heavily scented, carmine-flowered Magnolia sprengeri diva was planted in 1988, flowered in 1990, and is now 20ft. Of rarities, Tilgates has no end. I have seen the variegated Turkey oak, the Blue-Needled Limber Pine, and a kind of Japanese birch so rare that there are only six left in the wild. But let us keep to the magnolias, some of them extraordinary enough, like a variegated Magnolia grandiflora in the glasshouse. I can now claim to have seen Magnolia zennei in bloom - nothing much to look at, but it is thought to be the first time one has flowered in a European garden. I also saw M cylindrica, a plant far rarer than it should be, white and delectable. Here were stellatas looking far more glamorous than those common in front gardens. Centennial much took my fancy, with strikingly large petals (tepals, to the experts) looking well in spite of very strong winds. Jane Platt was the prettiest pink, Norman Gould is especially large flowered but from a slightly sinister cause, having its seedlings watered with a poison called colchizine. An old prejudice of mine against purple-hued magnolias, based on common-as-muck M. soulangeana Lennei, started to crumble. Admittedly, it was undone less by seeing the bold petals of Star Wars and Mr Packard's striped Smetterling (he has a German wife), than from seeing two Iolanthes either side of a flight of steps. And who would not be won over to purple by the charm of Caerhays Surprise, seen against a backdrop of conifers? Serene, bred from the ubiquitous liliifora, is a vibrant pink but Vulcan is newer and even pinker. The breeder of this particular New Zealander was not disposed to let it go to Clulow but a gardener's wife kindly spirited away a small piece. Not only colour and shape but scent should also come into the choice of magnolias we make. Flushed pink Anne Rosse was perhaps the sweetest I sniffed. But for scent to send one out of one's mind, high summer is the time at Tilgates. It is then that the wieseneris flower, a buff-coloured Japanese magnolia which has been in Britain for a century but is grown only by cognoscenti. If Clulow could take just one of his 400 magnolias to a desert island, he says it would be a wiesener. Summer is also the time to sniff the lemon-ice scent of the grandifloras and to look at some surprising newcomers, Brooklynensis Grex. This is the progeny of yellow-hued acuminata crossed with purple liliifora, some are wonderful like Yellowbird, some are yucky. Although he hopes someone plant-minded will buy Tilgates, Clulow is philosophical about selling up. 'Twenty years of orchids, twenty years of magnolias, now it's time to try something new.' He plans to go to South America and grow passion flowers, a family temptingly short of good hybrids. All the same, there are rooted cuttings of every magnolia over in the glasshouse, ready to move. 'No one has ever tried magnolias in Guatamala.' Tilgates, Little Common Lane, Bletchingley, Surrey, is open daily until 6pm, price Pounds 1. Plants sold at the nursery include magnolias priced from around Pounds 25-Pounds 75; grafting done to order (088374-3219).</p>

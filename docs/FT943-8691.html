			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Arts: Drawn to two dimensions - William Packer reviews two of the Tate Gallery's latest bulk acquisitions Big shows apart, the Tate Gallery is always worth a visit whether for the latest shift in the permanent hang, the return to the light of a long-forgotten treasure, or simply a sight of a recent acquisition. Not that this is a guarantee of pleasurable approval, you understand, but certainly of interest - lip-pursing, breath-sucking interest. Two bulk acquisitions figure prominently at the moment, one of drawings from the last 15 years by British sculptors, the other of comparatively recent British figurative painting. Of the two, the Sculptors' Drawings, a collection put together by the Weltkunst Foundation under the advice of the late Adrian Ward-Jackson and presented to the Tate between 1986 and 1991, is the more contentious. The accompanying pamphlet sets the tone: 'The early 1980s saw the emergence of a new generation of British sculptors . . . who looked beyond the traditions of modern Western sculpture . . .All . . extend the possibilities of drawing in adventurous ways.' Richard Long, with one of his mud dribbles, and a diagram on graph paper of a parquet floor by Rachel Whiteread are also included. The Long 'involved dipping the paper in wet mud and then letting the water run off in rivulets . . . Long often uses mud from the river Avon near his home in Bristol, but has here taken his medium from the Mississippi.' Gosh. So here we have the same old, I mean young, gang pushed at us yet again, and in the familiar breathless, self-justifying curator-speak, as though there were never any true sculptors in England before them, or beside them, or since. It is the jargon that gives the game away, all that posturing stuff about 'looking beyond', 'challenging', 'breadth of creative vision', 'extending possibilities in adventurous ways'. And of course these artists do no such thing. Miss Whiteread's parquet image, tastefully rendered in correcting fluid, may have its 'outer areas (the writer means by this the nearer edges or facets) rendered in elevation', but it is no less conventional an isometric image for that. And what of Long's antecedents - Morris Louis, Max Ernst, Rorschasch tests, Alexander Cozens? Beautifully worked as they are, do Anish Kapoor's lush, abstracted images of orifices and other organs really 'communicate across barriers of history and culture?' They seem pretty straight-forward surreal abstraction to me, shades of Ernst and Miro and early Pollock. Antony Gormley's figure outlines are, well, figure outlines. As for Alison Wilding's 'Angry' drawings, 'suggesting her state of mind when she made the apparently violent and staccato marks across the drawn forms', we can only sympathise with her frustration at an apparent failure. The myth persists that sculptors make good drawings by virtue of their being sculptors. The truth is that they make good drawings if they make good drawings. A working diagram (Richard Deacon) is still a working diagram, a scrawl (Wilding), even a useful scrawl (Shirazeh Houshiary) a scrawl still. Stephen Cox's Etruscan Studies, two blind masks with an ineptly constructed nose and mouth apiece, are hardly studies in any true sense at all. That the Tate should show and indeed collect such things is entirely defensible, for they are the currency of contemporary activity, and a gift is a gift after all. What is questionable is only the vapid belief in their cosmic significance, and to the exclusion of so much else. There is an awful lot of other drawing out there, of such different kinds. What of that? By contrast, the Wilkie Gift is simplicity itself. David Wilkie, who died in 1992 at the age of 71, was a man of modest means who nevertheless built up a significant collection of contemporary British art, with a particular leaning towards the mystical and symbolic. By his will, a part of it was to be offered to public collections, of which the Tate was one. In the event it accepted some 30 drawings by Frank Auerbach, and a further eight paintings by him, which extends the holding in that artist four-fold overall and more than doubles the paintings. Whether there should be such a preponderance is debatable, but while the drawings remain unseen, the paintings are of a very high quality and, with the studies after Titian, the Rimbaud series, and the classical allegorical compositions, certainly broaden his representation at the Tate. Two Winifred Nicholsons, a fine large reclining nude by Craigie Aitchison, a small early Michael Andrews, and three compositions by John Lessore, including an imposing allegory of Diana surprised by Acteon in the life-room at the Byam Shaw, complete the bunch. Current displays at the Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1: Sculptors' Drawings presented by the Weltkunst Foundation, until October 30. The Wilkie Gift, until August 21.</p>

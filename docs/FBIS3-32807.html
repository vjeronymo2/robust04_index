			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi in Brasilia] </F>   [Text] Through a symbolic vote, the Brazilian Senate on 9  February approved the quadripartite agreement on comprehensive  nuclear safeguards signed in December 1991 by Brazil, Argentina,  the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control  (ABACC), and the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA).    The treaty's approval has put an end to rising speculation  in  the international community about Brazil's real commitment to  using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in light of the fact  that the bill was only approved after difficult discussions took  place in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee.    The German Government has conveyed satisfaction over the  Senate's endorsement of the special inspections to be conducted  by the IAEA, which will control the movement of nuclear  materials to and from Brazilian facilities. In remarks to  GAZETA MERCANTIL, a German Embassy source said: "It is a  positive step, but we are still awaiting the approval of the  amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty on nuclear nonproliferation  in Latin America and the Caribbean." The Tlatelolco Treaty will  be discussed after the Carnival celebrations. The source added:  The nuclear issue will no longer be a problem for the visit  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim is scheduled to make to Germany on  23 February.    In recent months, Germany has expressed great interest in  the  approval of the nuclear agreements by the Brazilian Congress  because a German law will only authorize international  cooperation in sensitive technology with countries that are  signatories of comprehensive safeguards agreements with the  IAEA. The deadline for the recipient country to meet this  requirement expires late next year.    Foreign Minister Amorim also expressed satisfaction with the  Senate vote that, in his opinion, clears the way for developed  countries to provide technological cooperation to Brazil.    Amorim also noted that the quadripartite agreement is more  important than the Tlatelolco amendments -- which have yet to be  approved -- for the international community because the  Tlatelolco Treaty, which bans nuclear weapons in Latin America,  is applicable only to the region. Both Amorim and the German  Embassy have expressed confidence that the Tlatelolco amendments  will be approved in the next few weeks.    Argentina, which is Brazil's partner in peaceful nuclear  projects because they both set up ABACC, also has welcomed the  agreement's approval. A Buenos Aires source said: "The image  of the two countries, particularly on the nuclear issue, will  improve." The Argentine Congress already had approved both the  quadripartite agreement and the Tlatelolco amendments some time  ago.</p>

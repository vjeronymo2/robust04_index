			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Thai PM sacks 'plotter' MR CHUAN LEEKPAI, Thai prime minister, has sacked one of the five members of his ruling coalition, the Social Action party, for plotting to merge with four opposition parties. The SAP will be replaced by the small Seritham (Liberal Democrat) party, trimming the coalition's parliamentary majority from 26 to 13 seats. This is considered rather small, given Thai politicians' lack of discipline. The SAP, dubbed one of the 'devil' parties before last year's election for its willingness to support a military junta, has been an irritant during the coalition's first year. Seritham is the creation of Mr Arthit Urairat, a former House of Representatives speaker who earned plaudits last summer for his role in engineering a snap election to break a political impasse which followed the military's killing of 50-odd pro-democracy protesters in Bangkok. Disruption will be limited because the SAP held no important cabinet posts and because the original four 'angel' parties - the Democrat party, Palang Dharma (Buddhist Force) party, New Aspiration party, and Solidarity - can probably lose only by breaking up a modestly successful partnership. The opposition ranks appear bruised by a proposal from Mr Chatichai Choonhavan, the former prime minister, to create a 90-seat super-party.</p>

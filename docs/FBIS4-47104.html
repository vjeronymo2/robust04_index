			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gennadiy Zyuganov, deputy to the State Duma and </F> Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the RF Communist  Party, based on his report at a meeting of the National Council  of the Accord in the Name of Russia movement: "We Are Not Giving  Up the Soviets"; date and place of meeting not given]    [Text] In Russia the rule of a handful of people who are  bound by mutual favoritism and have profited from the robbery of  public property is growing stronger and stronger. And since  robbery and mass theft have become possible with the permission  and encouragement of that governmental authority, it itself is  becoming criminal, turning corruption into an ordinary, everyday  phenomenon. At the same time, the support of international  capital is making the Russian government a thoroughly  comprador-based, antinational force. The September-October coup  d'etat was, in fact, aimed at bringing the form of government  into conformity with its new essence.    The breakup of the system of soviets has turned  representative bodies in the center and at the local level into  powerless appendages of executive structures. The drastic  limitation of the powers of parliament has been accompanied by  the practically complete disappearance from it of the  representatives of the bulk of the population--workers, the  intelligentsia and peasants. Parliament and local representative  bodies are being filled with bureaucrats.    The control of elective representatives over the  administrative system is being totally curtailed. Connections  among the supreme and local representative bodies are being  destroyed. In this way an autocratic regime is being formed that  relies on an immense--twice as large as three years ago--army of  bureaucrats. Even G. Popov admits that the Soviet union has been  replaced by none other than a "bureaucratic system in which  property, by and large, will be distributed among various groups  of bureaucrats (central and local, federal and industrial,  official and mafia-based), and the state form of government will  become a 'bureaucratic democracy' as a mechanism for reconciling  the interests of individual groups of the bureaucratic class."    The inordinate strengthening of a presidential  administration  that is controlled by no one and nothing has, for all practical  purposes, destroyed the governing of the country. The president  and his apparatus rule over all branches of government without  reckoning with parliament, duplicating the efforts of the  government per se, and appointing administrators, judges and  procurators at their own discretion. What we have is an  intensely authoritarian mechanism based on a vertical  bureaucratic hierarchy.    The Second All-Russian Conference of the Russian Federation  Communist Party that was held this April developed a number of  measures aimed at democratizing the political sphere and  peacefully overcoming the existing confrontation. And I believe  that these proposals of ours could be taken as the basis for the  Accord in the Name of Russia movement. Their essence lies in the  need to overcome the crying imbalance among the branches of  government, an imbalance which has already brought the country  to the brink of national disaster more than once in the history  of the Russian state.    Today the executive authority is irresponsible as the result  of the almost total lack of any control over it, and the  legislative authority is irresponsible as the result of its  total lack of rights. It is impossible to enhance and  redistribute responsibility without redistributing powers  between the branches of government and strengthening their  mutual democratic control. To accomplish this, in our view, the  following is necessary:    --overcoming the existing lack of coordination between the  chambers of the Federal Assembly and defining the sphere of  their joint, equal jurisdiction, as well as defining relations  between the Federal Assembly and the executive branch;    --overcoming the dual subordination of the ministries and  departments to the head of state and the head of government.  Their full operational subordination to the prime minister. The  clarification and substantial limitation of the jurisdiction and  functions of the president and his administration;    --a shift to the principle of the accountability of the  government to representative bodies; the legislative  determination by the Federal Assembly of the government's  structure and staffing; and the submission to it for approval of  a government program defining its basic goals and the means and  projected dates for attaining them, as well as approval of the  government's composition in terms of personnel; the possibility  of the government's resignation at the initiative of the Federal  Assembly in the event of its deviation from its program;    --the exclusion of the agencies that manage state television  and radio from the system of the executive branch. The formation  of them, based on the principles of parity, by the parliament,  the government and the judicial branch, taking into account the  opinions of political parties and occupational and public  organizations. The ensuring of equal access to the air by  representatives of all branches of government, political  parties, and occupational and other public organizations;    --the restoration of the full vertical hierarchy of  representative bodies of authority and extension of the  principle of the accountability of executive bodies to  representative bodies to all levels of government, and the  return of local government bodies to the system of state  authority;    --the strict delimitation of spheres of jurisdiction between  higher and lower levels of state authority, and enhancement of  the independence of the latter in exercising their powers;    --agreement that the priority in the policy of strengthening  Russian statehood is the restoration of the union state on a  new, voluntary basis. Denunciation of the Belovezhskaya  Agreement insofar as it pertains to the dissolution of the Union  Treaty.    Of course, in order to attain the goals outlined it is  necessary to revive the constitutional process both within the  framework of the Federal Assembly and in the operation of the  Constitutional Court. In our opinion, the court should consider  the question of the correctness of whether the results of the 12  December 1993 referendum on adoption of the new Constitution  were correctly and lawfully interpreted.    The essence of the proposed changes lies in the fact that  they are aimed at attaining a real, as opposed to a merely  declared, state of civil peace, by which we mean not universal  harmony and not the elimination of every conceivable public  conflict, but an aggregate of social conditions and political  procedures that have been agreed to among various social forces  and in the context of which the conflicts that exist among them  are resolved by exclusively peaceful, nonviolent means. The  struggle among various tendencies is normal and inevitable, and  there will always be winners and losers in it, but it should not  result in the destruction oft he state and its economy, the  social sphere and spiritual life.    It is on this basis that Accord in the Name of Russia should  structure its activities. The basic steps in the development of  our movement's work to organize the popular masses for the  restoration of legality in the country could be as follows:    --the establishment at the local level of movement  committees, including on them the representatives of all parties  and organizations that support Accord in the Name of Russia;    --the establishment, on the basis of the movement, of an  election bloc capable of winning victory in any elections. The  coordination and support of candidates in elections in  districts, the formation of authoritative party slates, and work  on making the necessary adjustments in election legislation;    --the preparation of proposals for creating a government of  popular trust. On the basis of election results, such a  government could turn from a shadow government into an actual  government of popular trust. At the same time, the opposition  could begin right away resolutely arguing for the creation of a  government of the parliamentary majority that from the very  outset would reject the policy of "shock reforms" and  subordination of the country to the interests of foreign capital;    --in preparing for presidential elections, Accord in the  Name  of Russia could orient itself toward the creation of a kind of  "state council" consisting of the most prestigious leaders. One  or two agreed-upon candidates for the office of president could  be nominated from among its members.    In our view, one of the new president's first acts should be  to put through an amendment to the Constitution abolishing the  institution of the presidency and restoring genuine democracy in  the form of a unified system of soviets of people's deputies.</p>

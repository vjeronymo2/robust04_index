			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Observer: Miracle man Des Wilson, the veteran public campaigner now working for Burson-Marsteller, hopes he can work miracles. Hence he was rather upset when no one took any notice of his latest marvel - getting the Church of England to drop its opposition to the National Lottery. Des had also got the church to back his own pet project: helping Richard Branson and Lord Young win a licence for a lottery whose profits would go to charity. David Sheppard, Bishop of Liverpool and chairman of the Church of England Board of Social Responsibility, last week issued a press release explaining why he hoped that the licence would go to 'a company committed to passing on the largest possible proportion of profits to charity'. Quite a PR coup. So how come no one took any notice? Maybe because Sheppard's press release carried a rather stale December 24 dateline. Perhaps the C of E is rather touchy about miracle workers making unjustified claims.</p>

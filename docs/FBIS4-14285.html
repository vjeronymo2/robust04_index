			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres has expressed his belief that it is possible to  reach an agreement this evening with the Palestinian side on  resolving certain pending issues that have not yet been solved.  He noted that there are other issues that will be negotiated  after signing the agreement between the Palestinian and Israeli  parties on implementing self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.    Regarding the Israeli-Syrian track, Peres stressed that  Israel is serious about withdrawal from the Golan, although the  size and limits of this withdrawal have not been determined.  This came in a joint news conference held by Peres and U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher at noon today following  their talks at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.    Discussing the Palestinian track, Peres said that it is  possible to solve all pending issues this evening to open the  way for signing an agreement on implementing Palestinian  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. He noted that the issues that  will be left for negotiations after signing the agreement  pertain to registration of papers, mail, telephones, naming and  defining the powers of authorities, security issues, and two  issues relating to legal jurisdiction.    Regarding the Golan, Peres said that the size and limits of  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan must be part of the  negotiations. He noted that Warren Christopher may help to bring  the Syrian and Israeli views closer.    Christopher pointed out that he met with Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat this morning and that he made sure that  the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations were making progress,  although there are still certain issues that have not yet been  settled. He said: "I want to emphasize that the Israelis and  their Palestinian neighbors have some concerns about the  future." He said that both the Israeli and Palestinian parties  have recently suffered tragedies. This increases the importance  of the role Peres and his colleagues are playing. He expressed  his appreciation for the Israeli foreign minister and the  negotiating team for their ceaseless search for peace. He  voiced his hope that these endeavors will be capped with  success. He stressed that establishing peace is the best thing  to confront terrorism.    Peres praised Christopher's persistent efforts to help  achieve peace in the Middle East. He said: "I believe that  these efforts are extremely important, particularly because we  are coming close to the end of the negotiations with the  Palestinians." He said: "The U.S. secretary of state's  participation is important and is of considerable help to us."  He noted that certain important issues remain to be discussed  in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, noting that the  negotiators need support and backing from the U.S. secretary of  state, Yasir 'Arafat, and our friends in Egypt so that they may  reach results. He said: "We are meeting in Cairo today to  reach solutions to pending issues."    Responding to a question on negotiations with Syria and what  Israel will offer, Peres said: "We said, Prime Minister Rabin  and I, that we are ready to withdraw from the Golan Heights or  withdraw within the area. We did not define the limits or size  of this withdrawal because this must be part of the  negotiations." He added: "We believe that Christopher can  bring both parties closer. "He expressed confidence that  Christopher will bring closer the Israeli and Syrian parties and  will take into account "all issues" and not only territory. He  noted that these issues include security and the nature of  peace. He said that general peace from a comprehensive  perspective must involve all parties including the Palestinians.    Peres said: We are serious regarding Syria. We want to  achieve peace with Syria. Peace will not be comprehensive until  it includes solving the problems with Syria. Peres expressed  the belief that "there is no difference between the U.S. and  Israeli aims toward peace in the region."    Asked about the Palestinian-Israeli talks, Warren  Christopher  said: The basic issue now is helping the sides to reach an  agreement. This is what we are working to achieve today. As  the two sides have stated, they are very close to reaching this  agreement. Once the agreement is ready, there will be a signing  ceremony.    Christopher said that the most important thing is that this  agreement should enter the implementation phase. Commenting on  Christopher's remarks, Peres said: There are some outstanding  issues that we will discuss later today in an attempt to reach  an agreement on them.    Asked about Iran, Christopher expressed his "extreme anger"  about the terrorism that Iran is planning, not only in the  Middle East but also in other areas. He said: I believe this  is one of the reasons the United States does not deal with Iran  the way it cooperates with other states from the standpoint of  giving them special economic privileges.    Christopher added: We will not cooperate with the Iranians  in this domain until they improve their behavior in various  ways. He explained that this includes support for the peace  process in the Middle East, which Iran rejects. He expressed  the belief that "Iran deserves to be isolated."    On Britain's stand on Iran, Christopher said he is not aware  of any British plans toward Iran. However, he noted that he was  in London recently. He believes Britain shares his concern  regarding Iran.    The talks between Christopher and Peres were held at the  U.S.  Embassy in Cairo. They began with a separate meeting between  Christopher and Peres, who were later joined by the members of  the U.S. and Israeli delegations. The talks lasted 90 minutes.</p>

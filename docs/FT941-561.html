			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Inchcape tumbles International trading group Inchcape, which has already had a rough ride on the stock market this year, was the principal casualty in the Footsie, retreating 37 to 515p as it announced disappointing figures. Profits of Pounds 271.4m were up from the previous year's level, but at the lower end of expectations after analysts removed one-off gains from property and stripped out the Toyota franchise which the company lost last year. Inchcape said it was also likely to come under continued pressure from a strong Japanese yen and tough conditions across many of its global markets. As they returned from the meeting with the company, analysts reduced forecasts by as much as 20 per cent in some cases. The previous range of Pounds 280m to Pounds 290m moved back to a floor of Pounds 250m and a consensus of Pounds 260m to Pounds 270m.</p>

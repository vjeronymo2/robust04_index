			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Trading shake-up planned in Portugal PORTUGAL plans to set up a futures market in fixed-rate treasury bonds by the end of 1994, but first the government wants to streamline and simplify cash market trading, said Mr Manuel Pinho, treasury director, Reuter reports from Lisbon. 'It is very probable that by the end of 1994 the national futures market will be ready,' he added. Dealers say that any prolonged delay will encourage banks to go ahead with alternative plans to establish a bond futures contract offshore, probably in London or Frankfurt. Bankers Trust and Banco Portugues do Investimento took a step in this direction last month by launching a nine-month warrant on the Frankfurt stock exchange linked to five-year Portuguese treasury bonds. Mr Pinho said the finance ministry would cut trading costs and boost turnover in the cash market by the end of 1993. 'Basically, the futures market must be supported by a cash market in fixed-rate bonds that has depth and liquidity,' the treasury director said. The cash market would have to adopt tax regulations in line with more developed markets. Mr Pinho hinted in June that the government might exempt non-residents from withholding taxes of 15 to 20 per cent on all bond and share transactions in Portugal. He also said the government might shift the reference date for interest payments on bonds to the transaction date from the settlement date, which is four working days later. Government sources said the treasury was also looking at the establishment of a new inter-bank market for bonds, outside the confines of Portugal's two stock exchanges, where dealing would be simpler and costs lower. Portugal began issuing fixed-rate treasury bonds in 1991, and the market accounts for more than three-quarters of turnover on the Lisbon and Oporto exchanges.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / DTI urges radical reform of newspaper distribution The Department of Trade and Industry has linked with the Office of Fair Trading to seek 'fundamental reforms' in newspaper distribution. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, decided to go further than yesterday's recommendations of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the Pounds 1.2bn newspaper distribution industry. He said he wanted to initiate fundamental reforms in the supply of newspapers which would stop wholesalers refusing to supply retailers on the grounds that an area was already adequately served and to remove restrictions on the point of sale and resale of papers. Mr John Gardner, managing director of VG, the independent grocery group, said: 'Grocers will now be able to sell newspapers in the same way newsagents have been allowed to sell groceries.' The minister said yesterday that if, in the three-month consultation period, the industry made voluntary proposals to increase competition, this could be an alternative to formal orders. 'Clearly the industry will need to consider if a minimum size of order is necessary,' said Mr Hamilton in a hint that he is not seeking total deregulation. The commission concluded after a year's investigation that the publishers' display of cover prices and the setting of common retail and exclusive distribution arrangements amounted to a complex monopoly but it was not one that operated against the public interest. It found, however, that arrangements for considering applications for supplies were sometimes arbitrary and amounted to a restriction against the public interest. The commission proposed that to act as 'a safety valve' retailers should be allowed to pass on copies to other outlets or sub-retail. 'We were concerned that complete removal of the restrictions could lead toa surge of new outlets and thus to a sharp increase in unsold copies and higher costs,' the commission said. It added that the OFT should keep the situation under review to determine any further action. Mr Hamilton, who argued that publishers would anticipate changes and minimise wastage, also emphasised MMC uncertainty over whether its single recommendation would be enough to remedy the abuse. He said that Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, had also recommended more fundamental reform. He had accepted Sir Bryan's advice, Mr Hamilton said.</p>

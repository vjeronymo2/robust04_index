			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting spurs Austrian utility at pre-tax level Energie-Versorgung Niederosterreich (EVN), a leading Austrian energy utility, lifted pre-tax profits by 20.6 per cent to Sch1.08bn (Dollars 100.3m) in the year to August 31 1994, mainly because of cost-cutting, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Revenues of the company, 49 per cent of which has been privatised, advanced only 2.1 per cent to Sch10.5bn, reflecting the negative impact of warmer temperatures on energy sales. Also, gas sales declined because high rainfall enabled local utilities to buy or generate more of their needs from hydro sources. Revenues from electricity sales were up 1.9 per cent to Sch7.1bn, while gas sales eased 0.9 per cent to Sch2.89bn. Heating sales jumped 32.9 per cent to Sch97m, due to the takeover of heating services for the city of Baden and other extraordinary factors. EVN attributed the surge in pre-tax profits to increased volumes, improvements in energy efficiency and strict cost management. The average number of full-time employees in the year dropped 5.7 per cent to 2,884. The company has agreed further contacts with electricity and gas utilities in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, and has declared its interest in acquiring stakes when they are privatised. Assuming that strong economic growth continued in the company's operating territory of Lower Austria, the outlook for next year's earnings was 'promising', the company said.</p>

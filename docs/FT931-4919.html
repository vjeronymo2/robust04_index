			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Letter: Control culture can avert risks of derivatives trading Sir, Sir David Walker's contribution to the debate on the regulation of derivatives ('Derivatives - a delicate balance', March 4) is most welcome. While the control of derivatives trading operations is rightfully a principal concern of the management of financial institutions and their regulators and supervisors, the size of the off-balance sheet commitments involved can easily lead to a distorted view of the real risks. We would suggest one additional principle be added to Sir David's five principles of a viable approach to regulation of derivatives trading: namely, the development in financial institutions of a flexible and dynamic control culture. While the specification of capital requirements for such institutions is important, it is only the exercise of effective control by management over derivatives traders which will ensure that serious problems are avoided. Such controls should include recruitment procedures which ensure that dealers are of the highest integrity; proper incentives for dealers to encourage them to achieve all of the corporate objectives, not just short-term profitability; and regular training. There should also be other forms of corporate communication to make sure that they know what those corporate goals are; competent independent checks on their trading strategies and valuations; and internal controls over the transactions. These must be backed up by a high quality of on-site management in the dealing room. In our experience institutions which have successfully established an effective control culture are far less exposed to many of the potential problems in derivatives trading.

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Letter: Effect of house price changes must be reconsidered Sir, Edward Balls' summary of interest rates and inflation since 1925 (August 20) clearly shows the high real interest rates that have prevailed in the UK economy over the past decade. Nevertheless, for most of the 1980s, for many people, and for a significant segment of the UK economy, the interest differential that mattered was the difference between base rate and the annual change in house prices. On this measure, interest rates throughout much of the 1980s were negative. The change came at the end of that decade, as falls in house prices and increases in base rate led to an exceptional rise in 'real' interest rates according to this measure - possibly the highest 'real' interest rates in history. Such considerations were largely irrelevant before the 1980s because consumer credit was not freely available against the security of houses and property or otherwise. However, should we not now find a way of allowing for the effect of house price changes if we are to arrive at a realistic picture of what is going on?

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UN ultimatum on Yugoslav aid United Nations convoys today depart for two of beseiged Bosnian cities after issuing an ultimatum that further aid to Serb-territory hinges on access to Moslem-held towns in the former Yugoslav republic, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. Convoys of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will deliver food and medicine to Srebrenica and Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, following assurance from Serb leaders. They said the convoys would be allowed to cross Serb lines into the Moslem-controlled towns, swollen with tens of thousands of refugees from fighting in the region along the River Drina, which marks the Bosnian frontier with Serbia.</p>

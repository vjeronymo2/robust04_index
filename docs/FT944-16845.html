			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Market turmoil as rouble falls more than 20% The Russian rouble plummeted 21.5 per cent yesterday, its biggest one-day fall. The currency's collapse shocked Russia's emerging financial markets, caused confusion in the streets, and prompted debate among politicians about the future of the country's reforms. There were unconfirmed reports that prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would break his holiday and return to Moscow. The government appeared surprised by the extent of the fall and said it would raise its three-month refinancing rate from 130 per cent to 170 per cent from today in a desperate attempt to defend the currency. Many Russian banks refused to exchange currency and shut for the day, creating bewilderment and anger among crowds outside. One western economist in Moscow said: 'It is a full-blown panic. The challenge to the government is going to be not to overreact and to recommence its stabilisation programme.' The Central Bank held a crisis meeting yesterday afternoon amid allegations that 10 banks had colluded to dump roubles on the market. The low volumes traded on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (Micex) make it vulnerable to speculation, said currency experts. On Micex, the rouble plunged to 3,926 to the US dollar from 3,081 on Monday, taking this month's decline to 32.9 per cent. The Moscow Commodities Exchange, one of the main dollar futures trading floors, shut down when the Micex rate was announced, member brokers said. Trading in shares was also affected as brokers checked to see if prices had been updated. Government ministers expect a fierce debate on the rouble in the Russian parliament today. Mr Sergei Glazyev, head of the parliament's economic policies committee, said the rouble's large fall would have a destabilising effect over the medium-term. Mr Boris Fyodorov, a former minister of finance and fierce critic of the government said: 'The markets reflect the real situation in the country; that everything is getting worse and we have a government of mediocre and drifting economic policy.' Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the central bank, rejected suggestions that the rouble might fall to 5,000-6,000 to the dollar by the end of the year and dismissed out of hand the prediction by Mr Fyodorov, that it would rise to 12,000.

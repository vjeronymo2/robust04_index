			<p>BFN     [Text] Four container loads of chemicals being shipped from  India to an Egyptian port have been detained in the Colombo  harbor. According to reliable sources the containers each  weighing 18 tonnes and carrying phosphorous penta-sulphide, an  active ingredient in the manufacture of nerve gas outlawed  worldwide, were on trans-shipments via the Colombo port when  detained pending investigation. According to a senior port  official, the shipment was stopped and the containers placed  under security following instructions by both the Ministries of  Defense and Foreign Affairs. Three of the containers had  arrived in Colombo on board a Panamanian vessel (Everbridge) on  April the 10th, while one had arrived earlier on board the ship  (Zim Barcelona). The senior defense officials said that the  containers were detained following information that they  contained cargo being shipped in violation of international  agreements. Assistant secretary of defense, Mr. (Mahinder  Bandasena), said that the ministry has arranged for the cargo to  be examined, but he declined to divulge who would conduct the  examination.</p>

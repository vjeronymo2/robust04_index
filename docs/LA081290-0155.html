			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORANGUTAN TRAINER IS AWARDED $4.2 MILLION;  </P> <P> VERDICT: LAS VEGAS ENTERTAINER WINS BATTLE WITH ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WHO  ACCUSED HIM OF ABUSING ANIMALS.  </P> <P> Entertainer Bobby Berosini was awarded $4.2 million by a jury Saturday in his  bitter yearlong battle with animal rights activists who accused him of beating  orangutans used in his act on the Las Vegas Strip.  </P> <P> "Thank you, America," Berosini, a native of Czechoslovakia, said as he left the  courtroom.  </P> <P> "He'll never see a penny of that money," responded Philip Hirschkop, an  attorney for the Washington-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals  (PETA). Hirschkop said he would appeal the award that a state District Court  jury handed down after three days of deliberations.  </P> <P> The animal rights organization was assessed $2 million in damages on counts of  invasion of privacy and defamation. Jeanne Roush, an investigator for the  group, and Ottavio Gesmundo, a former employee at the Stardust Hotel, where  Berosini performed, were each assessed $1 million in damages on the same  charges.  </P> <P> A California nonprofit organization, Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS),  and its executive director, Pat Derby, were each assessed $100,000.  </P> <P> But the jury found no malice in the actions of the defendants and issued  verdicts precluding Berosini from collecting punitive damages. Hirschkop said  that because the jury found defamation and invasion of privacy but no malice,  the verdict was inconsistent.  </P> <P> Gesmundo videotaped scenes of Berosini striking his orangutans before they went  on stage for performances at the Stardust Hotel in July, 1989.  </P> <P> The videotapes were then circulated to animal rights groups, including PETA and  PAWS. Representatives of those two groups took the tapes to local and national  media, including "Entertainment Tonight."  </P> <P> Berosini claimed the adverse publicity damaged his career and cost him millions  of dollars in bookings. On the witness stand, he portrayed the orangutans,  which he calls "his kids," as powerful animals that must be disciplined if they  are to be kept under control. Berosini also said the primates were spooked by  dancers in the show who made animal noises in an effort to get them to  misbehave.  </P> <P> Animal rights activists descended on Las Vegas, picketing in front of the  Stardust and encouraging the public to pass up the show.  </P> <P> He continues to headline at the Stardust and hurried from the courthouse  Saturday, saying, "I've got to go take care of the kids. We've got to perform  tonight."  </P> <P> "I was used as a pawn to make money," Berosini said of attacks by the animal  rights groups. "They were using this as a means of fund-raising."  </P> <P> In closing arguments Wednesday, an attorney for Berosini urged jurors to send a  message to the animal rights movement. Attorney Tom Pitaro called on jurors to  stop animal activists who oppose everything "from circuses to medical research  to save babies."  </P> <P> But after the verdicts came in, the national director of People for the Ethical  Treatment of Animals said her group will continue its fight. "It is the duty,  and the First Amendment right, of every animal protection organization to speak  out against cruelty," Ingrid Newkirk said.  </P> <P> "Lawsuits designed to stop people from protecting animals -- and for that  matter, children, senior citizens or anyone subject to abuse -- cannot be  allowed to ultimately prevail."  </P></p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Brown steps up attack over company failures LABOUR yesterday stepped up its attack on the government's economic record in London and the south-east, claiming that for the first time in years more companies were going under than were being formed. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, announced figures which he said showed that company deregistrations in Britain were running at a faster rate than last year. He said the figures undermined the government's contention that more companies were being formed than were going out of business. As the fight for crucial marginal seats in the capital heated up, the Conservatives kept up the offensive over Labour's tax plans, saying they would hit Londoners hardest. Labour's policies on high salaries, combined with big mortgages in the capital, would leave Londoners worse off than people elsewhere in the country, Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, said. The figures revealed by Mr Brown showed that more than 20,000 companies had deregistered in the first two months of this year, compared with 105,000 in the whole of 1990 and 110,000 last year. No month-by-month breakdown was provided for the preceding years but Mr Brown said the figures - which he said came from Companies House  - suggested 'an annual rate of at least 120,000'. This made 'the scale of company failures even greater than the figures so far published'. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, described London and the south-east as 'the region of the country where this is happening at the greatest rate'. Conservative Central Office said the latest deregistration figures should be seen in the context of the 'huge numbers' of businesses created in the last 13 years. Labour also set out an agenda for tackling the capital's recession, incorporating a London Development Agency, a technology trust and a regional exports service. Mr Brown said this would be targeted particularly at small businesses. The party would bring together the national export services offered by the Foreign Office, the Overseas Trade Board and the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

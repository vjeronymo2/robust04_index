			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL UPDATE;  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME'S ZORICH MAY SIT OUT THE SEASON  </P> <P> Notre Dame nose tackle Chris Zorich injured his right knee against Pittsburgh  and could miss the rest of the season, an Irish official said today.  </P> <P> "That may sound drastic, but it's not out of the realm of possibilities,"  sports information director John Heisler said.  </P> <P> Zorich, a 1989 All-American, suffered a partial dislocation of the right knee  cap Saturday during the third quarter of No. 2 Notre Dame's 31-22 victory at  Pittsburgh. The kneecap slipped back into place but left the knee sore and  swollen, Heisler said.  </P> <P> "It's something that's going to go away, it's just a question of how long it's  going to take," he said.  </P> <P> Zorich is undergoing daily ice treatments to relieve the swelling. He will not  practice this week or travel with the team for Saturday's game against Navy.  </P> <P> Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said on his weekly syndicated television show that  Zorich might have to sit out the remaining three games as well, including a  Nov. 10 road game against No. 11 Tennessee.  </P> <P> Trainers nevertheless hope that Zorich might be able to play against Tennessee,  Heisler said.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure we'll know much more for the next couple of days," he said.  </P> <P> Zorich, a senior, anchors a Notre Dame defensive line that has been shaky at  times this season but held up well enough for the Irish to have a 6-1 record.  </P></p>

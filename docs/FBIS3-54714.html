			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Borys Tarasyuk, deputy foreign minister and </F> chairman of the National Disarmament Committee, by correspondent  Mykola Marynenko; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Marynenko] [Words indistinct] deactivation of  SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The situation  alerted both people here in Ukraine and experts abroad, people  everywhere. National-minded Ukrainian patriots asserted that  Ukraine is finally stripping in front of Washington and Moscow.  People abroad also reacted by shrugging their shoulders: Why  did Ukraine start with the most modern nuclear missiles, and why  do it when the well-known SS-19 missiles pose a greater  environmental danger than the SS-24's? As you see, people  everywhere, in Ukraine and abroad, are asking why. Would you  try answering these questions?    [Tarasyuk] Thank you. Indeed there are many questions, and  I will try to explain. In my opinion, it is in Ukraine's  interests to convince our partners and friends that nuclear arms  deployed on the Ukrainian territory -- operationally controlled  from outside Ukraine, by the way -- cannot be used against them.    Proceeding from this, and also taking account of the  Ukrainian Supreme Council's instructions on the need to ensure  effective technical control over the nonuse of nuclear arms  deployed on Ukrainian territory, our state's government is  working on the so-called deactivation of strategic missile  systems. Deactivation applies first and foremost to missile  systems or nuclear warhead-carrying systems whose service life  under guarantee is about to expire. The essence of deactivation  is removing warheads, storing them in Ukraine at a significant  distance from missile systems, and also essentially reducing the  combat readiness of these systems.    I should add that it is not only SS-24 missiles -- which are  more sophisticated, as you correctly pointed out -- that are  subject to deactivation, but the SS-19 missile systems as well.  This work is being carried out concurrently. This especially  concerns SS-19 missiles, whose condition will soon pose a  serious threat to Ukraine itself, and which we cannot service  without Russia's help.    These measures are being taken to reduce the nuclear and  environmental danger, and also to show the world community that  Ukraine has no plans whatsoever to resort to nuclear blackmail  in relation to any country, and that it is eager to reduce  nuclear confrontation and increase confidence-building measures.    Finally, I would like to stress that these steps are not  identical with the process of reduction in compliance with the  START-I Treaty. Meanwhile, intensive talks are being held with  a number of states, primarily nuclear states, with the aim of  creating preconditions for the treaty to come into force.    [Marynenko] Thank you. One more thing in connection with  the above problem. Credible sources have disclosed that there  are plans to deactivate three more SS-24 missiles before the end  of the year. Can you please deny or confirm this.    [Tarasyuk] I will neither deny nor confirm this report. I  have provided information which confirms the grounds for this  work to be carried out. As for how many missile systems have  been deactivated to date, and how many will be deactivated  tomorrow, that much I am not prepared to tell you.    [Marynenko] One more thing. You are probably familiar with  the speech by people's deputy Mykola Porovskyy at the Supreme  Council. This deputy linked the deactivation of SS-24 missiles  with the fact that servicemen of the 43d Army failed to swear  loyalty to Ukraine. Does this mean that it is a free-for-all?    [Tarasyuk] I would like to stress once again that the  decision to deactivate missile systems was made in Ukraine,  irrespective of the men servicing missile systems, the  servicemen of the 43d Missile Unit. Therefore, I do not think  there is any ground for concern about this.    [Marynenko] Is the deactivation of SS-24 missiles a direct  result of the ratification of the START-I treaty by Ukraine's  parliament?    [Tarasyuk] It is not a result, but a temporary measure taken  to remove the concern existing in the world, first of all in the  United States, over a threat facing its territory. Naturally,  it is not a one-sided process. By carrying out the deactivation  -- I stress this yet again -- we are not taking any measures  related to the compliance with the START treaty because these  processes are in no way equivalent. However, by so doing we are  reducing nuclear confrontation, the combat readiness of these  nuclear systems is being curtailed, and we are thus making it  clear that we have no aggressive intentions whatsoever and,  moreover, we do not control these missile systems.    Thus, we are sending yet another signal of Ukraine's  peace-loving attitude and, in addition to this, proclaiming  that, by following this path, we are defusing additional tension  caused by keeping these missile systems on alert, since they  consume a very large amount of electric power. I think this is  another point for our state to consider today.    [Marynenko] Mr. Tarasyuk, you know that following Ukraine's  early start in deactivating strategic missiles, there have been  new attempts to put pressure on Ukraine. What has been done is  not enough, it was said, all types of missiles must be  deactivated, and this must be done overnight, immediately, with  complete elimination. You know very well that such insinuations  have been made. And again, for some reason, nobody is taking  account of either our capability or our interests. Your  comments, please.    [Tarasyuk] I will not comment on this. If you mean  official reports, I know of no reports of any state demanding  immediate deactivation. There is nothing like that. This  process cannot be carried out overnight; it requires time, and  it also requires certain material and human input.    As for the compensation for this process, as you know, a  framework agreement was signed recently between the United  States and Ukraine, which will make it possible, as soon as it  takes effect, to start the process of using the first part of  the money allocated for the nuclear arms elimination in  accordance with the Nunn-Lugar provision -- that is, $175  billion.    [Marynenko] Mr. Tarasyuk, I am sure you know about the U.S.  Senate resolution concerning ratification of the START-I Treaty.  As a diplomat you know that the treaty has more depth and  foresight. Although it stresses the mandatory status of Article  5 of the Lisbon Protocol, it allows for the possibility of delay  in eliminating nuclear arms. But once Ukraine ratified START-I,  they start saying the elimination has to be immediate. Your  opinion, please.    [Tarasyuk] I assume you mean the U.S. Senate resolution  concerning the START Treaty. Indeed, it is a sizeable document  containing many provisions, including provisions under which the  United States ratified the treaty and the Lisbon Protocol in  full.    As for the ratification of this treaty by the Ukrainian  Supreme Council, everybody knows that this ratification will  come into force provided certain conditions are met. I will  mention three of the major conditions: financial aid for the  process of nuclear arms elimination; reliable guarantees of  Ukraine's national security on the part of nuclear states; and  third, compensation for not only strategic nuclear warheads but  also nuclear warheads in the tactical nuclear weapons withdrawn  from Ukraine as far back as last year.    The government is now working on this very issue so as to  create conditions which would allow the Supreme Council to  remove its objections concerning the force of this ratification,  and to exchange instruments of ratification; only then will the  treaty take effect. From that time on, Ukraine will assume the  obligations which, of course, it must abide by.    [Marynenko] Esteemed Borys Tarasyuk, after the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, as you well know, Russia  became the new partner for the United States in Eastern Europe.  International observers realize -- of course, as a diplomat you  also realize -- that backing just one partner is no policy; it  constitutes unbalanced tactics in international terms. These  tactics can lead to complicated consequences. Still, one can  understand the old U.S. tradition of backing the strongest  partner. But for some reason, the United States to this day  does not wish to see Ukraine as an important factor of the  European process, as an extremely important international  security zone, owing to Ukraine's special position in Eastern  Europe. Do you think this current foreign policy of the U.S.  Administration with regard to Ukraine is rather blindsighted?    [Tarasyuk] You have touched upon a very serious issue.  Regarding our attitude to relations between the United States  and Russia, we cannot, of course, be either pleased or  displeased. The relationship between the United States and  Russia is their affair. We should not give our appraisal of  these relations. At the same time, you are right to say that we  should not put up with the tendency to view relations with  Ukraine through the prism of relations with Russia, as used to  be the case and sometimes still is. That should indeed concern  us, and we have voiced this concern to our partners more than  once.    I do not think we can now say that the United States does  not  regard Ukraine as a partner. In my opinion, the U.S.  Administration has changed its approach toward relations with  Ukraine. The United States does regard Ukraine as a serious  partner. Moreover, it regards Ukraine as a guarantor of  stability not only in Central and Eastern Europe but in Europe  as a whole. Government officials in the United States are  increasingly speaking of Ukraine is a serious partner.    However, there is a certain gap between talk and action. So  far, we have not bridged this gap. There is still a certain  one-sidedness in relations between Ukraine and the United  States, and this one-sidedness is marked by excessive emphasis  on nuclear policy issues. We are extending efforts to rectify  this one-sided approach to relations between our two states.  This was discussed during several meetings between Foreign  Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of  State Christopher, and this has been the subject of numerous  contacts between Ukraine and the United States at expert level.  I think we will soon hear at least verbal denials that there is  a one-sided emphasis in relations with Ukraine.    A high-ranking delegation is currently preparing to visit  the  United States to discuss bilateral economic relations between  our states. I think that if the negotiations are successful,  this will indeed launch a new stage in relations between Ukraine  and the United States involving more extensive areas of  bilateral relations, and this will prove to all that the United  States indeed sees Ukraine as a partner.    [Marynenko] Thank you. To continue the theme of relations  between Ukraine and the United States, it is common knowledge  that the United States is one of the strongest, or rather, the  strongest world power in terms of its economic and military  potential. At the same time, although Ukraine has been  independent for just two years, it is trying get closer to the  United States, closer in terms of normal cooperation. You have  just said that a Ukrainian delegation is seriously preparing for  meetings in Washington at which a wide range of problems will be  discussed, concerning, I think, not only nuclear arms and not  only those wretched dollars Ukraine is allegedly trying to cadge  from the United States for the elimination of nuclear arms, but  fruitful and mutually beneficial cooperation.    Let us look at the U.S. position. You know U.S. President  Clinton will soon pay an official visit to Moscow. At the same  time he will visit half of Europe and so on. Ukraine is not  included in Mr. Clinton's program. Naturally, we have no right  to dictate the protocol and tell Mr. Clinton that he has to stop  over in Ukraine. On the other hand, those who prepared this  visit should have given the matter some thought, since there is  a certain friction between the United States and Ukraine -- and  I mean between the United States and Ukraine, not between  Ukraine and the United States. Why not use the head of state's  visit to Russia for at least a short meeting with Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk? Here, I think, we see a one-sided  approach on the part of the U.S. Administration; here we see  caution: Clinton is trying to consult with Russian President  Boris Yeltsin before he receives the Ukrainian delegation. One  can go on and on about the problem. What do you think as a  diplomat?    [Tarasyuk] You are quite right about the U.S. President's  forthcoming visit to Europe. He will visit a number of  European, and not only European, states. A total of four states  will be visited, including Russia, Belarus, and the Czech  Republic. I must say that a visit requires the consent of two  parties, and if one of the parties does not deem it possible to  visit, due to schedule complications, naturally you need to look  for reasons.    I can only express my personal ideas about this. You know  that the United States was apprehensive about our Supreme  Council's decision on the START I Treaty ratification and its  attitude to the nuclear arms Non-Proliferation Treaty. However,  I think this issue will soon be history. Top-level meetings  between our presidents will take place, and it is only a  question of time as to when and where. Whether Clinton will  consult with Yeltsin on how to deal with Ukraine is hard to  predict. I think there will be an exchange of views on the  issue, but it is not for them to decide Ukraine's fate.  Ukraine's fate is decided here, in Ukraine.    [Marynenko] Esteemed Mr. Tarasyuk, according to a  declassified CIA report, no country, except for China and  Russia, possesses land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles  capable of reaching U.S. territory. Tell us please why  Washington raised such a fuss around nuclear arms deployed in  Ukraine?    [Tarasyuk] I know nothing about this secret [as heard] CIA  report, but as far as I know from expert reports, there are  intercontinental ballistic missiles in Ukraine capable of  reaching U.S. territory, and this is a matter of special concern  for the U.S. Government. It is actually SS-24 missiles that are  capable of delivering warheads over such a distance.    [Marynenko] I am sorry, again, here is something trivial but  true. The button, that is, control over these nuclear arms and  these SS-24 missiles, is in Moscow. Ukraine has no control over  these arms and has no right to launch them. Excuse me, but why  not put these claims to Russia as one of the nuclear states?  Why put these claims to Ukraine? Moscow papers are publishing  charts that show Ukraine's current nuclear potential allegedly  several times larger than that of England, France, and China put  together, etc., etc., etc. They emphasize how many nuclear  facilities we have, how many warheads, etc., etc. For some  reason one thing is ignored: It was not Ukraine as an  independent state that built and maintained this huge nuclear  potential, but that it is a part of the nuclear potential of the  monster the former Soviet Union used to be.    [Tarasyuk] It is absolutely true, Ukraine had and still has  no operational control of the nuclear arms deployed on its  territory. Ukraine cannot operate the launch of these missiles,  and Ukraine does not seek such control, therefore, there are no  grounds whatsoever to blame Ukraine for an allegedly posed  threat. The so-called objectivity of the Moscow press,  especially with relation to Ukraine, is all too familiar to us  all. In this connection the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry press  center issued a statement yesterday that emphasized the  inadmissibility of the media of the Russian Ostankino television  studios and Russian president's adviser (Migranyan) making such  overtly provocative anti-Ukrainian remarks. Naturally, this is  not conducive to the improvement of the atmosphere in the  relations between our states; naturally, this does not improve  the atmosphere for the settlement of these issues. But we must  pay attention to the realities, and, whenever possible, expose  false anti-Ukrainian campaigns in the media, especially  concerning the fact that, as you said, Ukraine has no control  over nuclear arms that, by a twist of fate, are based on its  territory and in which the Ukrainian people invested a lot of  labor, sweat, and money. They are based on our territory, and  in order to make it clear that Ukraine does not threaten anyone,  Ukraine has embarked on the process of deactivating,  dismantling, and reducing the combat readiness of these missile  systems. By this we shall prove our really peace-loving nature  and show the entire world that it is not Ukraine that poses a  threat.    [Marynenko] Thank you, Mr. Tarasyuk, for your sincere  opinion  on the above problem. But let us come down to earth and, as  they say, dot the i's. I mean the nuclear arms problem. It is  simple. Russia now wants to become the sole owner of nuclear  arms in our region. They took away, and some say stole, our  tactical weapons -- for which Ukraine has received not a kopeck  so far -- they took away arms from Belarus, Kazakhstan, etc.  And now, using all possible and impossible, official and  unofficial, means of influence over the United States, Russia  seeks to take away nuclear arms from Ukraine. Or is that only an  assumption? What do you think?    [Tarasyuk] Well, I cannot comment on what Russia seeks. But  I would like to say that we must not repeat the same mistake  made when tactical weapons were transferred to Russia for  dismantling and destruction.    [Marynenko] Excuse me, let us talk about Ukraine's stance.  Ukraine trusted Russia and handed over tactical nuclear weapons  so as to receive compensation. Confidence, as international  observers say, worked, but it worked only on Ukraine's part.  [filing to be resumed after 1000 GMT 3 Jan]    [Marynenko] Borys Tarasyuk, you said that some countries  have already agreed to help us financially. Could you name  these countries which are ready to help Ukraine in the reduction  of its nuclear potential?    [Tarasyuk] Everybody knows now that the United States has  made a decision, and not just in principle, but has already  decided to grant the first part of this aid in the amount of  $175 million. Financial and technical aid has also been offered  by the governments of Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and a few  other countries, but negotiations on this are continuing.    [Marynenko] Thank you, and with your permission I will allow  myself to quote an interview by mathematician Muhammed Siddik  Afghan, president of the Science and Research Center for World  Philosophy and Mathematics. He is talking about Ukraine and its  nuclear arms. I quote: Ukraine needs to keep nuclear arms, the  scientist says, so as not to wind up defenseless before the West  which, talking of security, is not eager to disarm itself. A  weak state will not receive proper aid, either, the scientist  believes. In any case, arms can be sold, and this is huge money  which can be used to help the country's economy. What do you  think?    [Tarasyuk] I must say that this scientist's conclusions  happen to coincide with the stance of the Ukrainian parliament,  the president and the government of Ukraine which insist that  the cost of nuclear warheads which Ukraine will be handing over  for their dismantling and destruction must be compensated.  There are no differences on this. As for aid to weak states,  experience proves that it is weak states which receive such aid.  It would be difficult to imagine a strong, not only in  military, but first of all in economic terms, state which  receives aid from somebody. Aid is give to a weak state, of  course, or to a state which has found itself in economic  difficulties, which is the case with Ukraine. That is why, I  think, having no working economy, an economy without clear  outlines on the one hand, and at the same time seeking to keep  nuclear arms, without either funds or specialists or capability  to maintain them, would be illogical, and in this respect one  may not agree with the scientist.    [Marynenko] Allow me to quote one more fragment of the same  interview on Ukraine by Muhammed Siddik Afghan. He is convinced  that in 1995-96 Ukraine will see the beginning of economic  stabilization, and by the year 2000 Ukraine will become one of  the prosperous countries of the world community. The only way  out of the crisis, according to the mathematician's  calculations, lies in close mutual relations among the countries  of the former Soviet Union. Let me remind you that Mukhammed  Afghan was the one who predicted a speedy end to the political  carreer of Yegor Ligachev, in particular; he foretold that  Gorbachev would be the last president of the Soviet Union and  calculated Ukraine's independence back in 1990. Such are the  predictions of the well-known scientist and mathematician. But  the problem under discussion, the topic of our conversation with  Borys Tarasyuk, chairman of the national disarmament committee  and deputy foreign minister of Ukraine, deals with nuclear  weapons -- so, nuclear weapons and one of the last questions,  if you don't mind.    Mr. Tarasyuk, quite often they maintain here that Ukraine is  striving for a nuclear-free status and this is being asserted at  different levels. In your opinion, what formula of this status  now meets Ukraine's national interests best of all? A difficult  question, isn't it?    [Tarasyuk] May I clarify this question, if you don't mind?  Ukraine is striving for a nuclear-free status and what form of  this status is the best today for Ukraine?    [Marynenko] Yes, yes. What formula of this status can be the  best and the most beneficial for us today? After all, we are an  independent, sovereign state.    [Tarasyuk] Well, the decision on achieving a nuclear-free  status in the future was taken in 1990. We know the political  conditions under which this decision was taken. Taking this  decision the Supreme Council of Ukraine reflected the opinion of  the people of Ukraine which at that time still remained a part  of the former Soviet Union. At that time this decision was  perceived with great enthusiasm, and not only in our country but  far beyond its borders. Eventually, Ukraine obtained genuine  independence and at present it is building its independent  domestic and foreign policies. The issue on the nuclear-free  status arises from time to time during the discussion of the  main issues of the domestic and foreign policies in Ukraine's  parliament. I cannot recall even a single decision by the  Ukrainian parliament dealing with this issue which would not  confirm and would not contain a confirmation of Ukraine's  intention to achieve a nuclear-free status. The question is  when to achieve this status, during which period of time and by  which way. Strictly speaking, it is on this issue that all  experts now work on. Precisely this is the biggest problem now  facing our state.    I would like to say that the achievement of a nuclear-free  status, in my opinion, is a lasting process which will require  great effort, and not only economic or financial effort, but it  will also require a balanced approach which would take into  account all technical, ecological problems and Ukraine's  possibilities and, in my opinion, the term stipulated by the  START-1 treaty, namely seven years, is, in our opinion, a  realistic term for achieving such a status.    [Marynenko] Thank you. We have a rather difficult  conversation today and the topic under discussion is very  serious: the issue of nuclear armaments. And the last question,  if you don't mind.    When the Supreme Council of Ukraine ratified START-1 experts  in the West paid their attention not to this ratification, first  and foremost, but to those reservations which were made by the  Supreme Council during the ratification. So, they said that  these reservations completely destroyed the ratification and  Ukraine would never fulfil the START-1 treaty. What is your  opinion?    [Tarasyuk] If one pretends he is deaf and turns his deaf ear  to what had been said by the Supreme Council of Ukraine, then,  of course, one can abandon hopes for any positive result and  hence for the validation of the treaty and hence for the  implementation of this treaty not only by Ukraine but by all the  states, would-be participants in this treaty, in the provisions  of this treaty. This is why I believe that the logic and  reasons behind the reservations made by the Supreme Council of  Ukraine now receive ever growing understanding throughout the  world. Many scientists and representatives of governments and  political figures point to the validity of the reservations made  by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. This validity, the logical  nature of these reservations made our partners arrive at the  idea that it is necessary to work jointly so as to reach  agreement concerning the search for mutually acceptable  decisions which would help to remove these reservations. This  is exactly what our government and representatives of Russia and  the USA now work on. I think there are all grounds to believe  that we shall be able [to reach mutually acceptable agreements]  under condition that there is a search for compromises, the  compromises which would be made not at the expense of Ukraine  but with regard to Ukraine's national interests, only under such  conditions is it possible to reach mutually acceptable  agreements which will help us in the cause of persuading the  Supreme Council of Ukraine that the reservations are being  fulfilled.</p>

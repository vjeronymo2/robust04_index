			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Shaky foundations Beware consensus in the UK housing market. That would seem a sensible rule for investors given the events of recent years. Building societies, estate agents and even many independent City commentators, after all, were anticipating a rise in house prices at the start of both 1991 and 1992 which never materialised. Judging by the latest forecasts from Charterhouse and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew (which to be fair predicted that prices would continue to slide this year) expectations are now somewhat more muted. If they are right, however, there will be a bounce in the volume of house purchases in 1993 from their current 20-year low. Prices will finally turn up, perhaps by 5-6 per cent, in calender 1994. As P &amp; D points out recent interest rate developments have made houses in the UK more affordable than at any time since the early 1970s. There are also demographic factors - including, intriguingly, an unprecedented number of women of average child bearing age - likely to fuel demand. The troubles, of course, include that old enemy unemployment which seemed to be accelerating in the third quarter and is unlikely to stabilise until next year. Prospective purchasers are also put off by the prospect of further house price falls and tougher lending criteria on the part of the building societies. The risk is that many of the ingredients for revival - better price/income ratios, pent up demand and the like - also seemed to be in place 12 months ago. Volume housebuilders such as Persimmon and Wilson Bowden have rightly been pinpointed as the best targets for those determined to play the sector. But prospective earnings multiples of 17 leave no scope for further disappointment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Latvian Government has now decided to accept the  Russian proposal that the Russian soldiers in Latvia withdraw at  the latest by the end of August this year. Today, Prime  Minister Bildt was informed about the situation in the  negotiations by the Latvian deputy foreign Minister. There is  now hope that the last Russian soldier will have left the Baltic  countries by 31 August, says Carl Bildt, who has talks with both  the Russian and U.S. Governments about the situation in the  Baltic countries prior to the summit in Moscow next week.    [Begin recording] [Bildt] I assess that it is fairly likely,  it is possible to reach such an agreement. Then there are  certain remaining problems which will take slightly longer to  solve. One such big problem is the major strategic radar  station at Skrunda in Latvia. Another problem can be those  plants connected to the former Soviet warship base in Paldiski  in Estonia, where it might take a longer time to dismantle the  nuclear reactors -- there are training reactors for nuclear  submarine crews there -- and it is not certain that they can  manage that by 31 August.    [Reporter Boerje Remdahl] Have these talks a connection with  President Clinton's upcoming visit to Moscow?    [Bildt] Yes, they have.    [Remdahl] In what sense?    [Bildt] In the sense that the Americans are also interested  in an agreement being reached. And the fact that President  Clinton comes on an official visit to Moscow to meet President  Yeltsin means that there is an opportunity to take up high-level  discussions in a different way than what is normally possible.  We have had closer cooperation with the Americans on these  questions since I was in United States and met President Clinton  in the White House a few months ago.    [Remdahl] But is the situation in the talks now such that  Clinton's visit to Moscow can be carried through without the  Baltic question being an irritation?    [Bildt] It is clear that it would be much better if the  problem had been solved beforehand, but despite this the visit  in Moscow serves as a possibility to clarify the Baltic  questions also in the agenda of U.S.-Russian relations, and I  know that President Clinton was personally interested in this  and that is significant.

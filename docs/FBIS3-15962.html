On 9 March Bosnian Prime  Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate  Granic visited Moscow, where they met with Andrey Kozyrev. On  Thursday the head of the Italian diplomatic department began a  visit, and on Friday his Greek counterpart is arriving. The  main theme of all the talks is the situation in the Balkans.    After the Muslims and Croats reached agreement on the  creation of a confederation in Washington last week, the  impression was created that the United States is seizing the  initiative from Russia in a Bosnia settlement. The outburst of  Russian diplomatic activity is evidence of the fact that Moscow  does not want to be pushed into the background. It has emerged  from reliable sources that Vitaliy Churkin, President Yeltsin's  special representative, will be setting off on another tour of  the Balkans in the next few days, during which he plans to visit  Zagreb, Sarajevo, and Belgrade.    Moscow is remaining silent over the Croat-Muslim agreement.  When meeting with journalists at the end of the talks with  Silajdzic and Granic, Kozyrev strenuously avoided any  evaluations and expressed his thoughts as blandly as possible.  Vitaliy Churkin did not offer any clarification either but  stated that Russia "is continuing to study" the Washington  accords and their possible legal consequences.    These "legal consequences" seem to have become a stumbling  block not just for Russian diplomats. Both among the Croats and  the Muslims the attitude to the Washington agreement, which was  concluded under clear pressure from the United States, is mixed.  "An historic precedent is being set. If part of a sovereign  state (the Croatian and Muslim parts of Bosnia) enter into  confederative relations with another state (Croatia) today, the  Bosnian Serbs may cite that precedent tomorrow to demand a  confederation with Yugoslavia and likewise the Kosovo Albanians  with Albania. This will hardly be conducive to the  normalization of the situation in the Balkans," a journalist  from a major Croatian newspaper believes.    On Smolensk Square they have adopted a wait-and-see stance  while they ponder the vast flood of conflicting information  arriving these days. By all accounts, Kozyrev is waiting for  the meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  scheduled for Vladivostok on 14 March, to hear the U.S.  argument, coordinate approaches, and only then formulate the  Russian position.    What the West expects from Moscow is that it will again put  pressure on its Serb allies to make them accept the Washington  plan. Silajdzic and Granic tried to persuade Kozyrev that the  Croatian-Muslim agreement is not aimed against the Serbs and  that they can join the future confederation if they want. The  Russian minister expressed satisfaction at the assurances that  he received.    Meanwhile it must be presumed that both Kozyrev and his  interlocutors are well aware that there is virtually no chance  of winning the Serbs over and their leaders have already  rejected the Washington treaty. Russia is hardly going to  persist in its efforts to make them change their mind. Unless,  of course, Christopher has some extraordinarily convincing  arguments ready for the Vladivostok meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, 16 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak  has affirmed that using force to preserve the unity of Yemen  will not succeed.    In an interview with Romanian television last night,  President Mubarak expressed regret over what is happening in  Yemen.    Answering a question on his attempt to mediate in the  current  conflict in Yemen, President Mubarak said: I tried to mediate  and exchange viewpoints with the Yemeni president, but he told  me one thing and did another.    In his interview with the Romanian television, President  Mubarak added: I feel sorry about what is happening in Yemen.  I discussed this subject with the Yemeni president many times.  He insists on keeping his country united. But unity cannot be  realized through force. The use of force to preserve unity will  not succeed.    He said they are currently trying to impose unity on the  south, but they will not succeed because there will be a great  deal of bloodshed and many victims, which is a terrible thing.  He noted that this does not guarantee any kind of unity; unity  is based on the agreement and blessings of the two peoples. The  will of the people must triumph, not the will of bombs, weapons,  and bloodshed. Such situations do absolutely nothing to create  unity.    On peace in the Middle East between Israel--an economically  strong country--and the fledgling Palestinian state--which is  practically starting from scratch--President Mubarak said that  despite the fact that there are two countries with different  growth rates, they are cooperating without any problems. In  addition, the region is bursting with potential.    He added that there are many possibilities, but it is too  soon to discuss these issues. We are currently concentrating on  the peace process and the Palestinian, Syrian, Jordanian, and  Lebanese issues.    He pointed out that when agreement with these countries is  reached and applied, we will then think about and study ways and  means of cooperation in the region. It is only natural for us  to expect difficulties in the beginning; however, we cannot sit  back and say that Israel is a strong country and the others are  not. It is not right to succumb to this factor.    Answering a question about his view of the other aspects of  the peace process, President Mubarak said in his interview that,  on the whole, Jordan is not the one causing complications in the  process. He said: I believe that Jordan is currently  negotiating with Israel. I hope they will reach some agreement  in the near future.    He added that with respect to Syria: I have repeatedly said  that without the return of the Golan Heights to the Syrians, it  is very difficult to think of the possibility of concluding a  bilateral agreement. I have heard statements by Israeli  officials to the effect that they will not budge an inch on the  Golan Heights. True, such statements have not been made by  Yitzhaq Rabin himself, but there are other officials who are  making such statements.    Mubarak clarified that the problem between the Syrians and  Israelis lies in the absence of mutual trust. I hope these  obstacles will be overcome this year, he said. I also hope that  some understanding can be reached over the Golan Heights.    In response to a question regarding his optimism about  Syrian-Israeli negotiations, President Mubarak said: I am  optimistic because there is no other alternative. We will help  the Syrians any time they ask for help; we will spare no efforts  in this respect.    Asked whether instability in the Middle East basically  results from extremist Islamic movements, President Mubarak said  that there is no problem in Egypt because it has deep roots and  several religions have survived in Egypt for thousands of years.  We are capable of overcoming any crisis. We have encountered  crises before; this one poses no problems for Egypt. He said:  There are several problems in certain Middle Eastern countries;  but I do not believe that the extremists are successful, because  most people are against the extremists. We will overcome this  problem, although it may take some time.    When asked about his views on the real danger to world peace  at present, President Mubarak said that the Americans and French  may have more specific views regarding the international  situation. As for Europe, he said that the situation in  Yugoslavia and Bosnia poses an extremely serious problem, noting  that a solution to the Bosnian problem is imminent. He said  that at one time there was a plan to isolate the Muslims of  Bosnia, which would be an extremely serious matter. He stated  that it is very serious to isolate the Muslims even though they  have long been allowed to coexist with other peoples of  different religions. He noted that if the Muslims find  themselves isolated, it may plant a time bomb in the heart of  Europe. He noted that the French and British share this view,  adding: I think they have avoided this danger and efforts are  under way to find a solution. I hope they will find one.    On the situation in Rwanda, President Mubarak said that two  tribes are fighting each other there and one of them has accused  Egypt of supplying arms to the other one. He stressed that  Egypt is not supplying arms to either side. He noted that we  had a contract last year and it was fulfilled before the crisis  erupted. Another contract was signed before the crisis, but  Egypt froze it when the fighting broke out.    On the long-standing Romanian-Egyptian relations,  particularly in the wake of the political developments in  Romania during the past four years, President Mubarak said: We  were concerned at first about the situation in Romania. He  said: We have always maintained good ties with Romania and we  were concerned that the situation there might deteriorate  seriously, but it transpired that the situation has changed for  the better, which is very important. He said: We have  traditionally had good relations with the Romanian people. I am  very happy that the Romanians are proceeding along the right  path. He stressed that Egyptian-Romanian ties are currently  extremely good, as they have always been, and he noted that the  recent slowdown in relations was not prompted by Egypt but by  the changes that occurred in Romania. He said he wished to  visit Bucharest soon, noting that his last visit to Romania was  a long time ago.</p>

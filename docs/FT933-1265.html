			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Roche places Dollars 1.4bn of Lyons notes in the US ROCHE Holdings, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, yesterday completed the largest Lyons (liquid yield option notes) issue by a European company. The deal was structured as a private placement in the US market, under the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144a, which allows non-registered companies to place paper with approved institutional investors. The nominal amount of the offering is Dollars 1.42bn, which will raise proceeds of Dollars 702m for Roche. The funds will be used to refinance debt from Roche's acquisition of Genentech, the US biotechnology group. The deal was arranged by Merrill Lynch, which developed the market in Lyons  -which are zero-coupon convertible bonds - in the US. The notes have a maturity of 15 years, with put options after five and 10 years at a yield to put of 4.75 per cent. The notes are convertible into American depositary shares at an initial premium of 33 per cent, but this premium increases during the life of the issue, since accrued interest is forfeited upon conversion. Dealers said the offering was viewed by investors as a fixed-interest investment with an equity kicker. Roche's share price has performed well at a difficult time for pharmaceutical stocks, and is well liked by analysts because of its broad range of products and low operating margins. However, the 33 per cent initial conversion premium was considered aggressive by some traders. Roche has made pioneering use of equity-linked instruments. In 1991, the company launched an innovative Dollars 1bn 'bull spread' bond issue, while earlier this year the company issued Dollars 1bn of seven-year Eurobonds with 'knock-out' warrants. The Lyons deal is designed to increase the company's investor base in the US, and follows a a Dollars 275m issue of American depositary receipts arranged by Merrill last year.</p>

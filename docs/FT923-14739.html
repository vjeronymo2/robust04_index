			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Observer: Enough Frost - Ed Hello, good morning and welcome back. It was rather surprising to read two long and flattering centre page features about the same media star, David Frost, the day after each other in The Independent on Saturday and The Independent on Sunday. The kind interpretation is that the clash demonstrates the robust editorial independence of the supposedly integrated stable-mates. Even so, it tends to make some investors nervous when one side of the business is not telling the other what it is doing.</p>

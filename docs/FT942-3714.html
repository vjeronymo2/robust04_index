			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / US acts to boost anti-trust efforts The US Justice Department yesterday proposed legislation to strengthen its ability to crack international price-fixing rings. The proposed International Anti-trust Enforcement Act would let the department obtain evidence under reciprocal agreements with foreign anti-trust agencies. The bill, which has bi-partisan Congressional support, is modelled on a law allowing international collaboration by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 'The need for evidence located abroad is almost always the rule, not the exception,' Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, said. She cited the announcement last week that a joint US-Canadian effort had broken up a multi-million dollar conspiracy to rig plastic dinnerware prices. Canada is the only country with which US trust-busters have an agreement to share evidence, but it is restricted to criminal cases, Ms Reno said. Agreements under the proposed bill could be used in criminal and civil anti-trust prosecutions. The US administration is trying to increase its anti-trust activities. Ms Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney-general for anti-trust, said she knew of at least 10 international investigations pending. She said that the justice department would be announcing the break-up of another big cartel within the month. The new law would let the US call on foreign administrations to track down witnesses and issue subpoenas, and to hand over documents. Foreign anti-trust agencies could make similar requests of the US. However, Ms Bingaman cautioned, her division would assist only when that would be in the US interest and when the foreign agencies could provide the level of confidentiality provided under US law.</p>

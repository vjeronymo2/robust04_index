			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow (DDP/ADN) -- German Economics Minister  Guenter Rexrodt urged Russia to make full use of the Hermes  guarantees for trade with Germany. The survival of many German  firms, especially in the former East Germany, depends on this,  Rexrodt told journalists after a talk with his Russian  counterpart Aleksandr Shokhin in Moscow today.    Hermes credits total 2.5 billion marks [DM] this year.  Shokhin pointed out that Russia "is subject both to internal  restrictions and IMF conditions with regard to debts."    Rexrodt called on German industry to invest in Russia  despite  all the difficulties there. It must not miss the right  opportunity to "gain a foothold on the Russian market and its  great potential." He conveyed to Shokhin the wish felt by many  German businessmen "for greater clarity and predictability in  Russia, among other things in the tax system and in granting  export licenses," Rexrodt said. He added that Russian President  Boris Yeltsin's upcoming visit to Germany in mid-May and  preparations for the next session of the German-Russian  Cooperation Council in St. Petersburg were also discussed.    Rexrodt arrived in Moscow last night for a one-day visit. He  is to hold talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  this afternoon.</p>

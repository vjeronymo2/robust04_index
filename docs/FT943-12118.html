			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Financial advisers 'fail to meet need' A stark mismatch between the type of financial advice consumers want and what is provided by the financial services industry is set out today in a report from the National Consumers Council. A survey by MORI, which forms the basis of the report, found that almost nine out of 10 consumers thought it was important that financial advice should be independent, while more than half thought it was difficult to find that sort of advice. Only about one in five people thought the information provided about financial services was clear and easy to understand, and more than half thought such information was hard to understand. Such a perceived lack of clarity could be behind the anomaly between those saying independent advice is important and those who seek such advice. While 88 per cent of those questioned thought it important, if not essential, that advice was genuinely independent, more than 40 per cent would go direct to an insurance company, rather than an independent financial adviser, for information about general insurance or life insurance. Only when investing a big sum or choosing a personal pension were IFAs the category of adviser most likely to be approached. Both are aspects of financial services where more than a quarter of those questioned did not feel very confident about making the right choice, in contrast with other products, such as current accounts or motor insurance, where consumers felt more confident about their decisions. Lady Wilcox, who chairs the NCC, criticised the 'meaningless marketing material' and 'high-pressure sales tactics' to which consumers could be subjected, particularly as decisions made about life insurance or personal pensions could have serious consequences later if choices were based on misleading or incomplete information. Lady Wilcox said it was vital for consumers to have access to full and impartial information, and welcomed the establishment of the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private investor. She added, however, that there should be an early review of how effective the PIA was, and warned that consumer interests had to be strongly represented. The survey highlighted how consumers tended to approach banks and building societies for different products, even though similar services might be available from both. Seventy seven per cent would be most likely to go to a bank for advice about a bank current account, for example, while only 11 per cent would go to a society. On mortgages, however, 42 per cent would go to a society, while only 17 per cent would go to a bank. Consumer Concerns 1994: A Consumer View of Personal Financial Services.

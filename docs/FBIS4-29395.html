			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Masataka Kosaka, professor at Kyoto University: </F> "`Skill in Setting Priorities' Is Demanded: Begin With Electoral  Redistricting; Rushing on Taxes, Etc. Would Be Detrimental"]    [Text] 1) The complicated moves that occurred up to  the birth of the Hata government were unavoidable in the process  toward realignment of political circles. There is also a view  which takes it in a cynical manner, but the benefit of such  things as the point that it forced change upon the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is also great.    2) Concern has also emerged as to whether, with  politics in tumult, it will be possible to overcome difficulties  at home and abroad, but there are some problems which it is  better not to rush in a clumsy manner. It is important to choose  which are really urgent problems.    3) Apart from deciding on the budget and electoral  redistricting on the domestic front, and Japan-U.S. relations in  foreign affairs, rushing things could be detrimental. What is  required of politicians is "skill in setting priorities."  <H5>  Realignment of Political Circles Brings Change for the SDPJ </H5>   On the 25th Tsutomu Hata was designated prime minister, but  there were considerable complications. Even in just what was  reported by the media, there were the complicated moves of  Masayoshi Takemura, leader of Sakigake [Harbinger], and the  uproar over LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] strongman Michio  Watanabe leaving his party. Even beyond that, there appeared to  be all sorts of maneuvering beneath the surface. There were both  criticism and encouragement depending on the standpoint of the  writer, but, overall, there was a strong cynicism that "politics  is murky" any way. Last year's atmosphere, which welcomed talk  of reform in a somewhat uncritical manner, no longer exists.    However, these kinds of moves surrounding the reins of  government are essential to politics, and it is unavoidable that  they become complicated, particularly when, as now, it changes  to multiparty government. That cannot be avoided for the  present, nor is there anything wrong with it. If one views it  over a slightly longer term, it is the process by which the  forces which split into multiple parties will be brought  together. That became certain because the electoral system was  reformed, and a single-seat constituency system was introduced.    Because, insofar as only one Diet member will be elected, it  will be impossible to win if forces are scattered. That  necessity for uniting was also an important factor in the  process of political reform and became virtually dominant after  the various political reform bills passed. The moves toward a  new-new party, a united parliamentary group, as well as  Sakigake's reaction against them, were things which involved the  question of the form in which political circles would be  realigned and reflect the necessity, in terms of political  dynamics, that all must unite.    Second, the building of an alliance by small parties in  order  to form a government is, then, also the process by which their  policies are adjusted to reached agreement. Each force has a  different view, but they must compromise because of the  necessity of forming a government, and for that reason, it also  works out that they can find points in common.    The effect of that is particularly great in the case of  Japan  because it forces change upon the SDPJ. The SDPJ has, itself,  rejected forming a government by advocating policies which are  utterly impossible to put into practice such as in security  treaty, fiscal, and economic policies. But in that case, there  is no future for Japanese politics. We must have the SDPJ  change, and in fact, since last summer the SDPJ has changed, bit  by bit.    Of course this process will not go easily and will probably  take considerable time. Even when there existed the unifying  force of political reform, it was very difficult for the  coalition government to operate. In the Uruguay Round, the SDPJ  was unable to clearly change its former policy concerning what  to do about liberalization of rice imports. It opposed partial  importing of rice, but it temporized in such a way that the  coalition government did not split.    But that can also be called a real change, and it turned out  that way in good measure because of concern that if the  coalition government broke up, a combination of different forces  could form, which also included the LDP.    On the whole, the wall between governing and opposition  parties has ceased to be as clear as it was a decade ago. What  showed this vividly is that in the course of passing the  political reform bills; some SDPJ members of the upper house  carried through with dogmatic opposition and aborted the bills.  But the political reform bills did not die because of that. The  coalition governing parties compromised greatly with the LDP  bills and by that means passed political reform. This shows that  it became possible to cooperate across the governing  party-opposition party wall on individual problems, even if a  party does not go so far as to join the government.    Thus, the nature of the Japanese political game changed in a  number of senses. Of course, the political situation will change  in a bewildering manner because of that, and scheming will also  become more intense. Persons who read only articles which report  political moves in a cynical manner may dislike that. But there  can be no realignment of political circles or such without that  process.  <H5>  There Are Very Few Urgent Problems </H5>   A more direct concern is the question of whether, with  politics in great tumult, Japan will be able to overcome present  difficulties at home and abroad. This view was also heard  between the time of Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation and  agreement on Prime Minister Hata.    But there is no use discussing like that, but the existence  of pressing problems can turn out to be a unifying force. There  are many things which are called pressing problems but are  actually not that urgent. There are also things which are better  not to rush in a clumsy way. Therefore, in considering politics  in the future, the central problem is to select which are truly  urgent problems and to consider the response to them.    First, as a problem which must not be dealt with hastily,  there is the question of cooperation in elections because  hurrying the creation of that system for next few months would  result only in a reverse effect.    Next, as problems which should be dealt with speedily, there  is the budget, of course, and one can probably list deciding on  electoral redistricting. Without electoral redistricting amounts  to the basic rules of the political game not being determined,  as it were, so it would be impossible to have an election even  if one were necessary. For the next election to be held using  the system of medium-size districts because preparations for the  new system were not made in time, even though the political  reform bills passed, would be a big problem from the aspect of  fairness.    But aside from these two problems, there are no tasks of  domestic politics which are truly pressing. Certainly the  prolonged recession is a problem, but there are no effective  policies by the kind of measures that can be adopted right away.    It is not my intention to advocate a lack of policy, but I  think that after the injections of stimulant which have already  been administered, there is nothing to do but leave it to the  natural course of the economy. Reform of the tax system and  relaxation of regulations are certainly necessary, but are they  really urgent necessities? It appears that, in order to carry  those out, one would have to present the future image of Japan's  economy in its entirety, and that, conversely, the harm would be  greater in the case of rushing.    Then, what about tasks in foreign relations? Suspicion of  North Korean development of nuclear weapons is doubtless a grave  problem, and for its part Japan must make clear a firm resolve  to not overlook illegal action by North Korea's and must  indicate a posture of participating in international efforts to  solve it. If such things as not carrying out the duties  accompanying membership in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  (accepting inspections) while participating in the treaty, and  secretly developing nuclear weapons are given tacit permission,  the nuclear nonproliferation system will become shaky.    But, when it comes to exactly what kind of measures for that  purpose are possible and desirable, the situation is unclear.  One wonders that it might be a hasty conclusion to think that a  crisis will develop on and around the Korean Peninsula.  Furthermore, as to the response to a crisis, nothing can be  done but to decide, with wisdom and resolve, after the crisis  has become real.    Regardless of who holds responsibility at that time, the  fate  of the nation depends on whether he will make the correct  judgement, and whether public opinion will approve it. Debate  and mental preparation are necessary, but it is not too wise to  plan the response to a crisis beforehand.  <H5>  The Urgent Diplomatic Task Is To Improve Japan-U.S. Relations </H5>   Of the things that should be addressed, Japan-U.S. relations  are more serious. And in regard to that point, I, too, am uneasy  over whether things will go well with the current political  setup. But that is not to say that we should hurry with a  solution for economic friction because it was impossible to  agree on at the February [1994] summit. That would be possible,  but it would be the wrong way to solve it. The Japan-U.S.  negotiations broke down because Japan rejected the "numerical  targets" which the United States advocated, but even if we had  them call it "objective criteria of progress" instead, it would  be every bit as difficult for Japan to accept. Generally  speaking, the view of "emphasizing results" determines the rules  of trade as something among multiple countries and regulates  them by that, but it violates the basic General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) principle of not regulating by quantity.    But, for various reasons, the United States will probably  repeat the same kind of demand, and it will be difficult for  Japan to accept it. In general, international opinion also  opposes it, and even within the United States there are  different views which cannot be ignored. Therefore, to  compromise easily would affect Japan's reputation. The current  situation is that, overall, the United States is in the midst of  groping for a post-Cold War policy, and in the course of that it  sometimes makes erroneous statements. Its human-rights diplomacy  toward China and being a stickler on trade problems in  Japan-U.S. relations are examples of that.    Thus, the solution in Japan-U.S. relations must include  "no."  But neither a world order nor an Asia-Pacific bloc is  conceivable without the United States. This is particularly true  for Japan, which is very fragile. Therefore, when Japan says  "no," many more times than it says that, it must propose "let's  do it this way."    Before that, there are many things which Japan must do in  order to resolve the imbalance in Japan-U.S. economic relations.  Relaxation of regulations is the most important of these, and  that can be done by Japan's judgement. This kind of combination  of "no," and "yes," and "proposals" is really difficult. But it  must be done.    Politics is said to be "the art of the possible" because  there are any number of things which one should do, and which it  would be better to do, but few of them are possible. Politicians  must choose things which must by all means be done at a certain  point in time. At that time it is vital to not simply hurry, but  to watch for a good chance to act.    That is particularly true in situations where many parties  stand side by side. It was good that they worked out a  compromise on policy though they spent time, but the situation  is not so simple that agreement can be gained by that.  Therefore, skill in setting priorities is required.</p>

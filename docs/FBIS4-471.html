			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring and Ray Hartley] </F>   [Excerpts] A desperate bid by ANC leader Nelson Mandela to  persuade Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to support peaceful  elections in Natal was torpedoed at this week's summit by  Inkatha president Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Mr Mandela played what  he hoped would be his ace. He offered King Goodwill powers as a  constitutional monarch with sway over the whole Natal province.  But Chief Buthelezi scuppered the proposal by insisting that  the offer could not be considered unless all Inkatha's other  concerns were handled at the same time. [passage omitted]    The 13-hour meeting at Skukuza began badly for the ANC,  which  had hoped Mr Mandela and King Goodwill could meet in private.  However, despite two attempts by Mr Mandela to meet the king  privately, the king's advisers, Frank Armstrong and Mario  Ambrosini, insisted that the king should be accompanied by his  full delegation.    Sources at the meeting said that the king then read out in  Zulu a hard-line, 12-page document which referred to perceived  past insults from the ANC and attacks on his supporters.    Only when he had finished was Mr Mandela able to table for  discussion his proposals for a Zulu monarch. [passage omitted]    King Goodwill, sources at the meeting say, responded by  asking 30 minutes to consult his advisers. Royal household  member Prince Vincent Zulu returned to the meeting with the  blunt message: "The king has examined your proposals and finds  them unacceptable."</p>

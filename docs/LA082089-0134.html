			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARTY TURNS VIOLENT; YOUTH IS SLAIN;  </P> <P> PRE-COLLEGE REVELRY RESULTS IN ARREST OF TEEN-AGE HOST  </P> <P> Matthew Horeczko threw himself a party at his parents' home in San Pedro on  Thursday, the night before he was to leave for his first year in college. Wade  Hashimoto of Torrance was one of at least 150 teen-agers who came from all  around the South Bay to enjoy the end-of-summer bash.  </P> <P> But by the end of the gathering in a normally placid middle-class section of  the community overlooking Los Angeles Harbor, Hashimoto was dead, Horeczko was  in jail on suspicion of his murder and two other youths were recovering from  stab wounds.  </P> <P> Police, relatives and friends said Saturday they were still trying to  understand how two seemingly nonviolent, wholesome boys would become involved  in such a bloody confrontation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parents Out of Town  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Homicide Detective James Vena said Horeczko's parents were  out of town the night of the party in the 1800 block of Chandeleur Drive.  </P> <P> Vena said accounts vary as to whether the party was supposed to be by  invitation only but, regardless, young people arrived from all over.  </P> <P> "Everyone said the party was real fun and there were no problems until the very  end," Vena said.  </P> <P> At a little after 10 p.m., someone turned off the blaring music and announced  on a disc-jockey's microphone that everyone should go home, neighbors said.  </P> <P> But some guests who arrived late did not want to leave and congregated in front  of the house, said William Steel, who lives across the street.  </P> <P> A series of fights broke out and then a few teen-agers began throwing bottles  and debris at the house, Vena said.  </P> <P> "It looked like a war zone to me," Steel said. "There was pandemonium in the  streets . . . fist fights and kids running in all directions."  </P> <P> Detective Vena declined to provide details about the attack on Hashimoto, 19,  saying only that he was standing in front of the house when he was stabbed in  the chest by Horeczko, 18. Hashimoto died at the scene.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Are Wounded  </P> <P> Two other 19-year-olds, Derek Gray of Hawthorne and Jose Romero of Carson, also  were stabbed and taken to San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, Vena said. The  detective declined to say whether Horeczko is suspected of those attacks. Gray  was treated and released and Romero was in good condition at the hospital  Saturday.  </P> <P> Vena said that Horeczko told investigators that he stabbed Hashimoto in self  defense. The case will be presented to the district attorney's office Monday or  Tuesday, Vena said.  </P> <P> Horeczko and Hashimoto, who apparently did not know each other, were both  described as amiable, athletic young men.  </P> <P> Horeczko was an all-league fullback and defensive back last fall at Mary Star  of the Sea High School in San Pedro, according to his coach, Jerry Aguilar.  </P> <P> The 5-foot, 11-inch, 185-pound Horeczko was due to report today for his first  football practice at the University of San Diego.  </P> <P> Hashimoto also played football before graduating from Torrance High School in  1988. His parents said Saturday that he had been working part-time as a pizza  deliveryman and preparing next month to begin his second year at El Camino  College in Torrance, where he studied business.  </P> <P> Hashimoto, 5 feet, 8 inches and 160 pounds, liked to go out with his friends  but never got into trouble, his mother said Saturday.  </P> <P> "He loved to go out to parties. We always cautioned him to be careful," said  Carol Hashimoto, a school teacher. But she said Wade told her not to worry,  saying: "Everybody likes to go out and see their friends. It's fun."  </P></p>

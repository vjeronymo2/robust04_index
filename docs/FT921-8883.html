			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Nervousness north of the border: Scotland's business community is worried about possible political upheaval The possibility of constitutional change after the British general election  -whether devolution or outright independence - is sending shivers through Scotland's business community. The unmistakeably urgent tones in which the possibility of political reform is being discussed suggest that proposals from the Scottish Nationalist party and the Labour party are being taken seriously for the first time by businessmen. Both parties have put it firmly on their agenda. The former endorses outright independence, the latter a devolved parliament with the power to raise some taxes. Even the Conservative party, faced with opinion polls that indicate most Scottish people favour independence, may have to consider some form of devolution if it is returned to power. 'Independence would be a disaster and a tax-raising assembly almost as bad, as it would take us well down the road to independence,' says Lord Weir, chairman of the Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company. He fears the political uncertainty which would arise from a period of transition to a new system of government, and higher taxes. He believes Scottish-based companies which do not depend on the Scottish market might move their headquarters, probably to England, if they were taxed more heavily in a separate Scotland. Lord Weir's reaction is typical of the anxiety of businessmen about the consequences they fear for Scotland and for their companies if constitutional changes are enacted. Such radical political upheaval has crucial implications for how Scotland would be financed. Mr Ian Begg, an economist at Cambridge University and an expert on the Scottish economy, estimates that Scotland receives between 10.5 per cent and 11 per cent of all UK public spending but only provides between 8 and 8.25 per cent of UK tax revenues and duties. The resulting gap is estimated by most economists to be just under Pounds 4bn. Labour and the SNP have different proposals for filling this shortfall. Under Labour's plan, a Scottish parliament would receive all income tax and value-added tax raised in Scotland, and the gap would be made up with a grant from Westminster. In addition, Labour intends that a Scottish parliament would be able, as the party puts it in policy statements to 'vary' the rate of income tax in Scotland by up to 3p in the pound. Labour politicians believe that Scots would agree to pay higher taxes for greater services - such as better health, education and housing provision. A recent Mori poll gave support to this claim, showing that 49 per cent of respondents were willing to pay higher taxes compared with 43 per cent who opposed an increase. Under the SNP's independence proposal, the gap would be filled by oil revenues. The SNP argues that Scotland is entitled to 90 per cent of the oil and gas reserves in the North Sea. It says that although the tax revenues from the North Sea this year are likely to be only Pounds 1.2bn, increased production arising from new oil fields and higher oil prices could raise revenues to about Pounds 5bn in the last half of the 1990s. Opponents of independence say this strategy begs many questions. Much depends on where England and Scotland would agree to locate the line between their sectors of the North Sea. If the line of the land border between the two countries, which runs in a northeasterly direction up to Berwick-upon-Tweed, were projected into the North Sea, a big part of the oil and gas fields would end up in the English sector, and Scotland might have less than 70 per cent of the revenues. Oil revenues seem, however, to be an uncertain basis for filling Scotland's revenue gap, and are volatile, varying greatly from year to year depending on the oil price, production levels and tax write-offs by the oil companies. Mr Begg believes that even if Scotland obtained all North Sea oil, it would still have a substantial borrowing requirement because of the gap between tax revenues and expenditure. 'It would be laughed out of the financial markets,' he says, and higher taxes might be necessary. Nevertheless, an independent Scotland would have a reasonably well-balanced economy, not only with considerable oil and gas production but a relatively large, export-oriented manufacturing base and a big financial services industry. It might have a gross domestic product of about Pounds 55bn, putting it below Denmark and Norway in western Europe but above Greece, Portugal and Ireland. For businessmen bewildered by the speed with which the issue of independence has come to the fore, the main problem is making business decisions in an uncertain political climate. A senior executive of a Scottish company explains: 'We don't know what's going to happen in the election, the economic issues don't get discussed enough and the whole debate is conducted in a vacuum so that hard facts are never established.' The finance director of a quoted Scottish manufacturing company says he knows of two Scottish companies which have established subsidiaries in England through which to pay their Scottish workforce, as a precaution against the higher income tax which an Edinburgh parliament might impose on them. Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the drinks and leisure group which operates in both England and Scotland, fears that independence or devolution may reduce the access of Scottish companies to the English market. The planned single European market is not regarded as an adequate solution either, because it will for many years be much less integrated than the UK market. That concern is shared by Mr Malcolm Murray, chief executive of Scottish Life, the life assurer. He says that even if there were no tax differential between an independent Scotland and England, there might be consumer resistance or even discrimination in England against buying life policies from a Scottish company. England is the biggest market for most of Scotland's life companies and banks. "My personal preference is for the status quo, but that's not an option any more,' he says. For the companies that do support constitutional change, devolution is preferred to independence. One businessman running an engineering concern in Glasgow argues that Scottish business would receive a better hearing in a Scottish assembly than it does at Westminster, and that a Scottish assembly would be more likely to tackle the problems of the region's transport infrastructure. Other supporters of devolution argue that higher taxes would be an acceptable price to pay for improved services such as health and education. This is the view of Tom McGregor, an engineering consultant, who will soon launch an organisation of businesspeople called Scotland Says Yes] (to devolution). While the idea of devolution gathers some support, few senior members of the Scottish business community approve of outright independence. But there are some singular voices of support. Mr Robin Angus, an investment analyst with County Natwest Woodmac in Edinburgh, believes an independent Scotland could give its financial services industry favourable tax treatment, particularly for one of its specialities, investment trusts. Sir Iain Noble, who chairs the Edinburgh issuing house Noble &amp; Co, and is a pillar of the Scottish establishment, says he would be content with either a Scottish parliament inside Britain but dealing direct with Brussels, or an independent Scotland within the EC. 'It is axiomatic,' Sir Iain says, 'that taxes in Scotland would be lower than those in England, otherwise there would be a brain drain and a flight of capital. We would establish the simplest company law in the EC, attract corporate head offices and thrive on our financial and legal services. Whether independence was a success would depend entirely on our ability to be entrepreneurial and innovative.'  ------------------------------------------------------------------ SCOTLAND'S SHARE OF THE UNION  ------------------------------------------------------------------ General government expenditure Pounds per head        1988-1989      1989-1990      1990-1991  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Scotland                2,748          2,957          3,196 England                 2,119          2,338          2,586 Wales                   2,847          2,680          2,964 Northern Ireland        3,540          3,714          3,842  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Total                   2,232          2,448          2,694  ------------------------------------------------------------------ GDP Pounds million          1989    (%)      1990    (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Scotland              35,740   (8.3)   38,738   (8.2) England              368,035  (85.4)  402,207  (85.4) Wales                 18,306   (4.2)   20,053   (4.3) Northern Ireland       9,116   (2.1)    9,821   (2.1)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ UK                   438,774 (100.0)  477,747 (100.0)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Population Million              1989    (%)      1990    (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Scotland              5.1   (8.9)      5.1   (8.9) England              47.7  (83.3)     47.8  (83.3) Wales                 2.9   (5.0)      2.9   (5.0) Northern Ireland      1.6   (2.8)      1.6   (2.8)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ UK                   57.2 (100.0)     57.4 (100.0)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: CSO, Treasury  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Electrabel steady ELECTRABEL, the Belgian electricity and gas utility, increased net non-consolidated profits by less than 1 per cent in 1992, to BFr22.5bn (Dollars 680m) from BFr22.3bn, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The group, Belgium's largest company by market capitalisation, lived up to its reputation as a generous payer of dividends by proposing a net dividend of BFr302 per share, up 4 per cent on last year's BFr290. The group invested some BFr29.7bn in 1992, against BFr26.2bn the previous year.</p>

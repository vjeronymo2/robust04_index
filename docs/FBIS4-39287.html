			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok, 7 Jun--Completing an official visit to  Russia, Republic of Korea President Kim Yong-sam arrived in  Vladivostok today in transit.    Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head of the Maritime Territory  administration, held a ceremonial reception on the occasion. "Of  all the regions of Russia, the Far East has one very important  advantage: Geographically, it is part of the Asian Pacific  region," the governor stressed in his speech at the ceremonial  reception. "The enormous natural wealth of the territory,  combined with the lengthy experience of development in market  economy conditions accumulated by South Korea, create a  favorable medium for the implementation of mutually beneficial  projects."    In a reply speech, the Korean president noted that, "on the  threshold of `the Pacific era', the Maritime Territory is  becoming a genuine center of Korean-Russian cooperation.  Effective joint activity is already under way--first and  foremost in the field of fishing. Cooperation is being  developed in other spheres as well. In particular, the Nakhodka  industrial and technical park is being set up for Korean  enterprises. A sea route linking Pusan and the Maritime  Territory has been opened. Regular flights will start between  Vladivostok and Seoul this year."    "Thus," Kim Yong-sam also noted, "it will be possible to fly  from the Republic of Korea to Russia in just two hours, and this  means that we will become closer neighbors."    In the afternoon, the president of South Korea and the  officials accompanying him will visit the headquarters and one  of the ships of the Pacific Fleet.</p>

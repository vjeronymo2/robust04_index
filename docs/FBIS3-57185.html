The Russian delegation was headed by Russian Foreign  Minister  Andrey Kozyrev and the Uzbek delegation, led by Uzbek Parliament  Acting Chairman Erkin Khalilov, included Kozyrev's counterpart  Saidmukhtar Said Asymov.    Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the upper chamber of the  Russian Parliament, took part in the talks, which were held in a  friendly and constructive atmosphere. "We met as real friends,  partners and close neighbours. Our relations are notable for a  full mutual understanding and close interaction", Kozyrev said.    Khalilov seconded this view by saying the two delegations  should not sit on two opposing sides of the table but at a round  table with no division between them.    In the course of the talks, a decision was reached to  establish a mixed group of Russian and Uzbek experts to draft  legislative proposals on citizenship.    Kozyrev's political advisor Galina Sidorova told ITAR-TASS  the negotiations were business-like and its results will lead to  a practical settlement of problems and mutually acceptable  decisions.</p>

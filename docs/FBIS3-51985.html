			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A PRENSA LATINA news report says Ambassador Fernando  Remirez Estenoz, Cuba's permanent representative to the United  Nations, was today elected vice chairman of the special  committee for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the  Palestinian people. The Cuban diplomat, chosen by acclamation,  was proposed by the Tunisian delegation and supported by Mali.    Upon addressing this UN committee, Remirez Estenoz  highlighted the efforts to be made at a moment when the  committee is entering a qualitatively different phase of its  work following endorsement of the declaration of principles  between Israel and Palestine. Remirez highlighted the duties to  be assumed in order to contribute to monitoring the agreed-upon  measures and to determine what assistance the United Nations  must provide so the process can continue until restitution of  the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people -- including  that of the creation of their own state -- has been achieved.</p>

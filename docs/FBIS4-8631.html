			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--Ambassador Branko  Brankovic summoned Italian Charge d'Affaires Laura Mirachian to  the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs today and lodged the  Yugoslav Government's note of sharp protest over the use of  Italian airports for NATO military actions against the Serb  people in the Srpska republic.    According to the ministry's statement, Ambassador Brankovic  stressed that Italy had thereby taken on itself responsibility  for the risk of escalation of the war with unforeseeable  consequences. NATO military operations on the very border of the  FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] are a provocation against  the FRY, a threat against its security, and pose a serious  threat to peace and stability in the region. Taking part in a  NATO military action, even under UN auspices, is contrary to the  CSCE principles on the peaceful resolution of disputes, the  observance of which--as the CSCE chair country--Italy should  particularly advocate.    Such actions by Italy are contrary to the efforts to achieve  a just and lasting solution to the civil war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and contradict principles of  good-neighborliness and traditional cooperation between friendly  countries and peoples.    The FRY Government--interested in preservation of peace and  security in the region, in the fate of the Serbs, and in finding  a peaceful and just solution for the civil war in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina--expects the Italian Government to prevent  any further use of its territory for armed actions against the  Serbs in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

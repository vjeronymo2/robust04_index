			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Nationwide up 47% but mortgage demand flat Nationwide Building Society, the UK's third largest, yesterday announced a 47 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 252.7m for the year ended April 4 despite flat mortgage demand. The society benefited particularly from a reduction in loan loss provisions, cuts in administrative expenses and strong commission growth from sales of life and general insurance products. Net mortgage balances for the year were stable at Pounds 28.1bn, and Nationwide said it had taken steps to improve the quality of its mortgage business. Provisions for losses on mortgage loans fell to Pounds 256.2m (Pounds 285m), while other loan provisions fell from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 26.1m. Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at stockbrokers UBS Philips and Drew, said that while the latest results showed a strong improvement at Nationwide, 'they are not out of the river yet'. The society's ratio of provisions to loans, at 1 per cent, is still well above the industry average of 0.7 per cent. While Nationwide has made great strides in paring its costs-to-income ratio to 49.44 per cent against 53.45 per cent a year ago, the ratio remains well above the average of 43 per cent for the top 20 building societies. Retail deposits remained unchanged at Pounds 25.4bn despite tough competition for individual customers' funds, Nationwide said. Wholesale funds also were little changed at Pounds 7.02bn, compared with Pounds 7.33bn. The society's gross capital ratio rose to 7.5 per cent from 6.6 per cent at the end of the previous fiscal year, while its free capital ratio rose from 4.9 per cent to 6 per cent. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive, said that in an effort to develop stronger relationships with its retail customers, it planned a further targeted individual mailing to all its discontinued account customers. In retail financial services, Nationwide earned Pounds 115m from commissions on the sale of life and general insurance products, up from Pounds 107.7m. Nationwide, which currently has an exclusive agreement to sell the products of Guardian Insurance, plans its own insurance subsidiary, Nationwide Life, from 1995.</p>

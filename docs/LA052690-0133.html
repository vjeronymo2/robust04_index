			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET HOCKEY: A HOT NEW GAME IN PLAYGROUNDS, PARKING LOTS;  </P> <P> RECREATION: THE CONTESTS ARE HARD-FOUGHT AND SOMETIMES BLOODY, AND ALL YOU NEED  ARE ROLLER SKATES, A STICK, BALL AND A LEVEL, BLACKTOP AREA.  </P> <P> Spring has sprung and northern lakes are thawing. Wayne Gretzky has hung up his  skates for the year. With the Stanley Cup playoffs over, hockey will hibernate  until fall.  </P> <P> But on Los Angeles playgrounds and parking lots, the season is only beginning  to heat up. Young men are lacing on roller skates, grabbing hockey sticks and  chasing a plastic ball across the blacktop.  </P> <P> Street hockey, the Canadian version of sandlot baseball, was once as rare to  Southern California as glacial ice. Now, weekly games have sprung up in  sun-drenched locales such as Venice Beach and Santa Monica.  </P> <P> And in the San Fernando Valley, the sport has spread like a brush fire.  </P> <P> On weekdays after school, teen-agers play in Porter Ranch Park and at Lockhurst  Drive School in Woodland Hills. They go to Balboa Park on Wednesdays.  </P> <P> Older players -- men in their 20s -- start evening games in the parking lot at  Humana Hospital West Hills, where they skate beneath lights until the security  guard kicks them out. Each Sunday morning, as many as 30 players show up at  Lindero Canyon Middle School or Agoura High School.  </P> <P> "All of a sudden, you go by any school and you see people playing," said Greg  James, 21, of Woodland Hills. "Everybody grows up playing softball or football.  This is something different."  </P> <P> Hockey on the streets of Los Angeles shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.  The sport grew instantly popular in this city when Gretzky, hockey's best-known  player, was traded to the Kings in 1988. Street hockey has also benefited from  the development of roller skates that look and work like hockey skates.  </P> <P> There are no city leagues or organized games, so no one knows how many people  are playing street hockey on local blacktops. Perhaps the best gauge comes from  sporting goods stores.  </P> <P> "It started about six months ago. I started getting phone call after phone call  asking for street hockey equipment," said Ric Collins, owner of Encore Sports  in Woodland Hills. "I'm mainly a surf shop but I don't sell surf stuff any  more; I just sell street hockey stuff. The sport has turned into a madhouse."  </P> <P> Players require only skates, sticks and a paved area. Lockhurst Drive School  has a small, walled parking lot that is well-suited. Last week, 25 of the usual  gang arrived: Sean Milder, an especially fast skater; Chris Mahoney, whose  parents sometimes come out to watch; Greg James, wearing cut-off army pants and  his hair sprayed so it stood straight up. A car stereo blared a John Lennon  song as players chose sides.  </P> <P> But before the game could start, the police arrived.  </P> <P> "The principal does not want you to be here," an officer told the group. A  month or so earlier, school officials said, a teacher was struck by a flying  street hockey ball. "Leave the playground right now," the officer said.  </P> <P> "A wholesome activity interrupted," one player grumbled. "Let's go smoke some  crack."  </P> <P> Half an hour later, the group had reassembled in a Builders Emporium parking  lot. Play started quickly and moved at a furious pace, punctuated by clattering  skates and the occasional thud of bodies. Cries of "Center!" and "Point!" --  the hockey equivalent of "I'm open! Pass me the ball!" -- sounded like a  foreign language on this warm evening.  </P> <P> Street, or roller, hockey is similar to its colder sibling. Teams move  continually back and forth on a makeshift rink, shooting at goalies who guard  nets at either end. A bright orange ball, roughly the size of a tennis ball, is  often used in place of a puck because it rolls smoothly over pavement.  </P> <P> Players don't call any penalties. They wear scant padding because there is  little checking -- the body-slamming common to ice hockey. Occasional  collisions are unavoidable.  </P> <P> "About the only difference between street and ice hockey is that it's harder  when you fall in street hockey," said Dan Winters, 27, who played locally on  ice as a youth. "You fall on ice and you can slide. You fall on pavement and  you can tear an elbow up."  </P> <P> The game at Builders Emporium was perhaps less savvy than one would find on a  Toronto or New York City playground. While several players skated and  stick-handled gracefully, others lurched about, leaning on their sticks for  balance. Defensemen occasionally got caught out of position, scrambling to get  back as the other team rushed their goal.  </P> <P> The game was hard-fought but friendly, as are most. Arguments were infrequent.  Players often joked as they skated back and forth. When a player fell hard, his  opponent paused to make sure he was all right.  </P> <P> Shoppers stopped to watch.  </P> <P> "What is this?" an older man asked.  </P> <P> Despite the rag-tag trappings -- parking lots and schoolyards -- street hockey  can be expensive. Special sticks, with plastic blades to withstand pavement,  cost $20. Knee and elbow pads run $50. Gloves are $35, and some players make  due with gardening gloves. A goalie can spend up to $250 on a helmet, stick and  body padding.  </P> <P> Skates are even more expensive. The footwear of choice is Rollerblades, a  high-tech skate designed in 1980 by two Minnesota brothers who wanted to  practice hockey during the summer. Because the four wheels are set in a line,  Rollerblades stop and start more quickly than conventional skates. They also  cost from $89 to $215, depending on the model. (Officials at Rollerblade Inc.  estimate that during 1990 their sales in Southern California will double to  60,000 pairs, more than in any other part of the country.)  </P> <P> But no discussion of street hockey expenditures is complete without mention of  the Damji family, who recently moved from Canada to Woodland Hills. They chose  one house over another because, among other things, it had a level driveway.  </P> <P> "The other house they were considering had a sloped driveway," said Stuart  Tain, their real estate agent. "The kids wouldn't have been able to play hockey  on it."  </P> <P> Many players said their parents are supportive, both financially and  emotionally, of their street hockey habit. "It gets rough," said Mary Mahoney,  as she watched her sons Chris and Paul play. "But I don't mind it. I know where  they are and it keeps them out of trouble."  </P> <P> Bloodied knees and elbows are common to the games; serious injuries are not.  One Valley player recently broke a wrist, another broke some ribs. Both are  playing again. Doctors at half a dozen local hospitals and sports injury  clinics said they couldn't recall treating any street-hockey injuries.  </P> <P> None of that impresses Ilene Meyers, the principal who is seeking to banish  street hockey from Lockhurst Drive School.  </P> <P> "It brings the older people out, smoking and drinking and that sort of thing,"  Meyers said. "That little hockey ball could certainly break a window. I just  don't think that's what our elementary school campuses are meant for."  </P> <P> For now, the players travel from one schoolyard or parking lot to the next,  going wherever there's a game. They are a mish-mash breed: whites play with  blacks, Latinos and Asians. A long-haired college student skates beside a body  shop manager. Ice hockey veterans -- the only people who played street hockey  in Los Angeles 10 years ago -- are joined by players who have never touched a  stick and players reliving the game they grew up on.  </P></p>

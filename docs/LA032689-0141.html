			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Munich-based newspaper reported that a member of the West German Parliament  from the ecological Greens party has links to a Libyan-financed foundation.  Party leaders said they will investigate the allegations. Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said Alfred Mechtersheimer is involved with the M.A.G. Foundation for Peace and  Solidarity based in Vaduz, Liechstenstein. It said the foundation was financed  by a $10-million account set up in Switzerland by Libyan leader Col. Moammar  Kadafi. Mechtersheimer was quoted by the newspaper as saying he acted "as a  kind of adviser" to the foundation, which was set up to promote the "new  thinking" in Libya.  </P></p>

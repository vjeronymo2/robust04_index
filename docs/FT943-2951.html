			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television Those who thought that John Betjeman was a rather ducky little poet chiefly concerned with exulting in the glories of trolley buses and Bourne and Hollingsworth, will have realised their mistake if they have been watching The Lost Betjemans on C4. He was, no doubt, fascinated by middle-class gentility and old-worldliness. But the streak of misanthropy and depression (about as wide as Balham High Street) which was so close below the surface of his work has been unmistakable here. Tonight's programme records his visits to Weston-super- Mare and Bath in 1962 (8.00). My candidate for the murderer in 'Master Of The Moor', ITV's Ruth Rendell Mystery, is Stephen's old Dadda. So how do I explain the sinister figure in the cloak? Probably the detective, Manciple, acting out some mad obsession. Or, since it is always referred to as 'he' but is hooded, a woman. Do I really care? Not much, but enough to watch this final episode (9.00). The commentary in the first part of The Longest Walk was so set upon emphasising the faults of round-the-world walker Ffyona Campbell that everyone must be rooting for her. Perhaps that was the idea (9.30 BBC2).</p>

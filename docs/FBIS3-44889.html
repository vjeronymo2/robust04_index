Speaking before the press following his morning meeting with  Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Hata dispelled concerns over  Japanese-Taiwan relations, while reiterating both a common  Chinese and Japanese will to resolve the nuclear question on the  Korean peninsula.    The foreign minister said he told Chinese leaders that Japan  would continue to abide by a one-China policy based on  nongovernmental and economic relations and that Japan would  continue to abide by the Japan-China joint communique.    "For development of China and the development of Asia, we  cannot deny the development of Taiwan," he said, while welcoming  the participation of both Taiwan and Hong Kong in the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.    "As far as I know, no member of the (Hosokawa) cabinet will  visit Taiwan, " Hata said    Hata asked the Chinese leadership to make use of its  historical and geographical position to "convey the suspicions  of the international community concerning nuclear development"  to North Korean leaders.    The Chinese side reiterated its opposition to pressuring or  placing sanctions on North Korea, he said, but the Chinese  assured him that they would play a positive role in seeking a  solution to the nuclear question on the Korean peninsula.    Hata felt it was important for China to enter the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade because of its growing economy  and influence over international trade.    Working-level talks between Japan and China for China's  membership in the world trade body "would begin soon," he said.    Hata referred to Japanese-Chinese relations as entering a  new  phase after the 20th anniversary of the normalization of  diplomatic relations in 1992 and the 15th anniversary of the  signing of the Sino-Japan peace treaty.    After his arrival in Beijing Saturday, Hata met with Chinese  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier Li Peng.    In a meeting with Jiang, Hata called on China to make  efforts for disarmament, saying Japan and other neighboring  countries are concerned about China's increasing military  spending, Japanese officials said.    The Chinese president said China's military forces are  designed to only defend China's land and economy, adding that an  increase in commodity prices was behind the rise in military  expenditures, according to the officials.    Jiang was also quoted as saying that China does not have any  ambition and will never seek hegemony.    The most important issue for the Chinese Government is how  to  feed its 1.2 billion people, Jiang added.    The two leaders shared the view that Japan and China have  been playing a pivotal role in the peace and stability of Asia,  the officials said.</p>

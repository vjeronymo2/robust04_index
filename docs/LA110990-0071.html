			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'C'EST LA VIE' PLEASANT BUT FORGETTABLE FARE FROM KURYS  </P> <P> French writer-director Diane Kurys has an enviable precision to her memory, and  in "C'est la Vie" (AMC Century 14, Cineplex Beverly Center) she recalls the  summer of 1958 when she was 13, down to the corks that decorated a beach  vendor's hat and the lies her mother told her.  </P> <P> It's extremely clear and sensual recall, covering this autobiographical young  girl's first, clumsy kiss and her realization that her mother has a lover, but  unlike Kurys' superb "Entre Nous," which was this same shattering summer from  another point of view, it's nowhere nearly as affecting.  </P> <P> As "C'est la Vie" opens, the mother, Lena Korski, this time played by Nathalie  Baye, is busy with motherly, petit-bourgeois lies. Buying a half-price train  ticket from Lyons to their customary Brittany beach resort, La Baule Les Pins,  she says that her younger daughter, Sophie, (Candice Lefranc) is 6, not 8.  </P> <P> She deceives both Sophie and 13-year-old Frederique, (Julie Bataille) by  pretending she is going with them, then at the last minute sending them on  their family vacation with their extremely put-out young maid, Odette.  Over-brightly, she promises she'll be along "very soon." Freedom for mamas  sometimes comes at a price; Kurys exacts hers now by the anger she can still  resurrect toward her deceptions, minor and otherwise.  </P> <P> She seemed more forgiving in "Entre Nous," when Lena was played by Isabelle  Huppert and the story dealt with her deepening friendship with another woman.  Here, Lena, her young artist-lover (Vincent London), even her angry husband  Michel (Richard Berry) are in the background; it's the seismographic reactions  of Frederique to the changes in herself and her family that are the film's  minute concerns.  </P> <P> There's a comfortable charm to these kids' pranks; to their excitable uncle,  Leon (Jean-Pierre Bacri), and their indulgent, lovely aunt, Bella (Zabou),  pregnant for a fifth time, and to the complicity among the young cousins,  especially the one Frederique has a crush on.  </P> <P> The French seem to have perfected this Colette-like sense of recall: the smell  of a certain suntan oil, the Bobby Darin record everyone loved; whispered  conversations between adults, secrets between terribly knowing children.  Mostly, the French have the absolute conviction that such memories are of  fascination to the rest of the world too.  </P> <P> Sometimes they are. Truffaut walked that line all the time. The marvelous "36  Fillette" combined truth with total recall to create adolescent sexuality as it  really is. "Murmur of the Heart's" precise observation of one specific summer  gave Louis Malle the background for a classic film. In "Le Grand Chemin,"  another bucolic, explosive summer -- this time from the point of view of a  young city boy -- cathartic emotions emerged between warring parents.  </P> <P> Far less goes on here, certainly less that's fresh or arresting; enough to keep  one awake but not really held. Kurys' first in this trio, "Peppermint Soda,"  had its own young fizz; "Entre Nous" was perfume, with haunting under-notes;  "C'est la Vie" is cologne, pleasant but ephemeral.  </P> <P> 'C'EST LA VIE'  </P> <P> A Samuel Goldwyn Co. release. Producer Alexandre Arcady. Director Diane Kurys.  Screenplay Kurys, Alain Le Henry. Camera Giuseppe Lanci. Editor Raymonde Guyot.  Music Philippe Sarde. With Nathalie Baye, Julie Bataille, Richard Berry, Zabou,  Vincent London, Jean-Pierre Bacri, Candice Lefranc, Alexis Derlon.  </P> <P> Running time: 1 hour, 37 minutes.  </P> <P> Times-rated: Mature (one scene of domestic violence).  </P></p>

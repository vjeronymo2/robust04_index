In the year to January 31, pre-tax profits of Pounds 111,000 compared with losses of Pounds 2.53m. However, as forewarned last year, no dividend is recommended. The group's shares, which had risen recently on rumours that Mr Philip Green, former chairman of Amber Day, planned to buy a 15.8 per cent stake, added 4p to 30p. Turnover fell 15 per cent to Pounds 21.6m, although within that the sales through the Foothold chain rose 5 per cent. Operating profits were Pounds 617,000 (Pounds 886,000 losses) but this included one-off gains such as a Pounds 235,000 write back of provisions no longer needed, the receipt of an insurance claim worth Pounds 394,000 and a Pounds 258,000 refund from a pension scheme. Interest charges fell from Pounds 920,000 to Pounds 367,000 after last summer's reconstruction and share placing. Earnings per share were 0.48p (7.6p losses).</p>

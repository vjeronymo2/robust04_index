			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): Low discounts spur launches - Investment trusts / With the sector, like Hollywood, starting to develop a taste for sequels, the dying year saw investors spoilt for choice The investment trust enthusiast was spoilt for choice in the last quarter of 1993. Fund managers rushed to offer almost every conceivable kind of trust, as low discounts across the sector made it easy to launch new issues. Among the most notable launches were: The largest ever investment trust issue, Mercury's World Mining Trust, which raised a staggering Pounds 425.8m. Here, the attraction proved to be manager Julian Baring, whose reputation in the gold market pulled in money from institutional investors. The trust will buy stocks with interests in gold and other metals. The first ethical investment trust from Friends Provident. This had a split-capital structure, with ordinary income shares and zeros each designed to yield around 8.1 per cent. A panel of luminaries, including actress Joanna Lumley, is on hand to help the managers sort out the ethically correct wheat from the chaff. A new property investment trusts managed by Baring Investment Management. The Wigmore Property Investment Trust will aim to outperform the FT-A Property index. The Throgmorton Preferred Income Trust, from the Framlington stable, will invest in preference shares issued by small companies, to help plug a perceived 'financing gap'. The first investment trust launch from the merged Henderson Touche Remnant group. Its Japanese smaller companies trust raised Pounds 100m. An indexed European smaller companies trust from Providence Capitol and James Capel. Like Hollywood, the sector is starting to develop 'sequelitis'. Instead of Rocky II and Rambo III, the fourth quarter saw the launch of Kleinwort's Second Endowment Policy Trust and Johnson Fry's Second Utilities Trust. Lloyd's trusts: all you can lose is your capital The new-issue activity described above is remarkable enough. What made the fourth quarter even more extraordinary was the creation of a large new sector in the industry - the Lloyd's investment trusts. These have emerged from the insurance market's need to attract new corporate capital in the wake of the disasters which have hit Names - the private investors who have traditionally backed the market. Unlike Names, the new trusts will have limited liability. This means that the maximum loss which shareholders can suffer is the amount of capital they invest. By investing across a range of syndicates, the trusts should eliminate some risk. Nevertheless, there is 'gearing' built into the trusts. Syndicates can underwrite Pounds 2 in premium income for every Pounds 1 of capital. That means that an underwriting return of 10 per cent will turn into a 20 per cent profit, but it also means that underwriting losses will be magnified. Much will depend on whether Lloyd's has turned the corner on the disasters of the late 1980s, or whether there is more bad news to come. As investment trusts, these funds will be rather odd vehicles. The bulk of the money raised will go into portfolios of equities, which is straightforward enough. But, of course, what investors will really be interested in is the progress of the underwriting business. Under the three-year system of accounting used by Lloyd's, such figures will not emerge until 1997, making investment a bit of a leap in the dark. Telling one trust from another will be difficult in the meantime. Although Johnson Fry failed to drum up enough support for its fund of funds, broker Gerard Vivian Gray has a managed portfolio service of Lloyd's trusts, with a minimum investment of Pounds 20,000. C shares: a way round the problems of a rights issue Existing trusts have also been taking advantage of the current enthusiasm for the sector. The fourth quarter saw a number of trusts raise new money - with most choosing the route of a C share issue. The use of C shares is designed to get round some old problems which have dogged trusts trying to raise new money. A traditional rights issue normally requires shares to be offered at a discount to their trading price; but this would normally mean that rights investors are getting assets on the cheap, diluting the holdings of existing investors. Furthermore, the trust faces the risk, during the rights period, that a sudden stock market fall could push the share price below the rights price, turning the issue into a flop. With a C share issue, the price is set at a nominal level, normally 100p. Eventually, C shares will be converted into ordinary shares, but only when all (or nearly all) of the money raised is invested in the stock market. When conversion does occur, it reflects the asset value of the two classes of share. Thus, if the asset value of a C share was 100p and that of an ordinary share 200p, investors would receive one ordinary share for every two C shares. This system has a number of advantages. First, it avoids the dilutive effect of offering shares at a discount. Second, it avoids the risk that a sudden fall in the stock market might damage the prospects of the issue. Third, it means the two pools of assets are not mixed until the new money is invested; accordingly existing shareholders are fully exposed to the market, rather than having a large part of their portfolios in cash.</p>

Zrazhevskiy; UDC </F> 621.371.029.65]    [Abstract] The importance of understanding the radiothermal  radiation characteristics of the earth's covers in the  millimeter wavelength band (EHF) in a number of applied tasks of  natural resource management and remote sensing by radiophysical  methods prompted a study of the quantitative effect of the  surface irregularities, dielectric constant, and atmospheric  conditions on the polarization characteristics of radiothermal  radiation of the earth's covers without vegetation. To this end,  an analytical procedure is developed, and the effective  temperatures of exposed soils are calculated for horizontal and  vertical polarization as a function of the wavelength, relative  bulk moisture content, and averaged geometrical parameters of  these underlying surface irregularities for the pure atmosphere  and planostratus clouds. The effect of bulk scattering in the  EHF band is ignored, and uniform, generally flat, horizontal  surface segments covered by chaotic irregularities whose  dielectric constant does not depend on the coordinates are  considered assuming that the size of the segment forming the  emitted field greatly exceeds the correlation radius of the  irregularity height while the radiating atmosphere is a uniform  horizontal formation. The dependence of the effective soil  temperature on the zenith angle and relative bulk moisture  content and the dependence of the sandy soil's polarization  invariant on the zenith angle are plotted. The findings make it  possible to determine the relative effect of various factors on  each cover's effective temperature for orthogonal polarization  and measure the soils' range of radiance temperatures at various  external conditions at 1.4-1.8 mm wavelengths. It is noted that  in determining the thermodynamic surface temperature from the  measured effective temperature by the above method for  orthogonal polarization, the surface roughness parameters and  atmospheric conditions must be taken into account; otherwise, an  error on the order of 10% may be expected within a  2.2-8.6 mm  band which corresponds to a 30K error.

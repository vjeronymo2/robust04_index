			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Feb 8 (AFP) -- While the West moves closer  towards airstrikes against Bosnia's Serbs, questions remain as  to the objective of such attacks, their efficacy and whether  countries are ready to face the consequences.    NATO ambassadors were to meet here Wednesday [9 February]  and, barring a veto by pro-Serb Greece, were likely to authorise  use of the alliance's warplanes in a punitive action following  Saturday's bloody mortar attack in Sarajevo.    NATO officials said intense consultations on the issue  continued Tuesday after an informal meeting on Monday.    The meeting is in response to a request by UN  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for NATO backing to deter  any repetition of the massacre in Sarajevo's central market that  left 68 people dead and some 200 wounded.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called the carnage a  "turning point" in Western atitudes towards military action in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. But the prospect of airstrikes was still  clouded by uncertainty over several points.    UN officials who must give the green light for the air raids  insist they first have to clearly determine who was responsible  for Saturday's carnage, a judgement experts said was virtually  impossible.    But the bloodiest incident of the 22-month-old war appears  to  have stung Western nations into moving ahead with a broader  purpose: to finally end the siege of the predominantly Moslem  Bosnian capital.    European Community foreign ministers on Monday called for  the  immediate lifting of the siege "using all the means necessary,  including the use of air power." The United States seemed to be  of the same mind.    "We will respond to the specific, rather narrow request of  Butrus-Ghali but we will not be limited by that," U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher said Monday.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has already offered  its warplanes to end the strangulation of Moslem communities,  provide "close air support" to endangered UN troops and reopen  Tuzla airport in northeastern Bosnia.    But Butrus-Ghali has so far refused to give clearance for  such operations amid fears they could provoke reprisals against  the 10,000-strong UN force on the ground and bring the  humanitarian effort to a halt.    Beyond such considerations is the question of how effective  bombing the Serbs would be. Military experts say that close air  support for ground troops is feasible, offensive bombing raids  is another matter.    They say air power could take out stationary artillery  positions but would be unable to eliminate the big guns or the  highly mobile mortars if the Serbs moved them around in the  hills surrounding Sarajevo.    A NATO military source said ground troops and weapons would  be needed to secure the hills but the 16-member alliance has  done no planning for such an eventuality.    He saw little likelihood of adding more troops to the 2,900  currently in the capital, most of them French. France has been  the only nation willing to up its contribution significantly to  protect the UN-designated "safe area."    No country has shown the stomach for a full-scale military  action to bring peace which German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said  would require hundreds of thousands of troops with no guarantee  of success.    NATO leaders, seeking to restore their battered credibility,  renewed their airstrike threats last month and U.S. President  Bill Clinton and French President Francois Mitterrand said that  this time they better be ready for action.    France proposed this week giving the Serbs an ultimatum to  distance their big guns from Sarajevo. Britain, the other major  contributor to UN troops in Bosnia, appeared to shed some its  earlier reluctance to call in air raids.    But differences remained among the allies, with little  enthusiasm apparent at the EC meeting for setting a deadline for  the Serbs. Countries such as Spain and Denmark stressed the need  to keep peace negotiations on track.    Greece, the current president of the 12-member community,  warned that airstrikes could unleash a wider war throughout the  Balkans and threatened to veto the move at the NATO meeting,  which works on consensus.    Under the new threat of airstrikes, the Serbs are now  willing  to discuss demilitarisation of Sarajevo even before a global  settlement. But analysts said the Serbs have appeared to give  ground before, only to harden once the danger has receded.</p>

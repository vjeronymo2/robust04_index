			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 1 May -- Representatives of trade unions who  held a festive rally in Manezh Square in the capital today on  the occasion of the International Day of Solidarity of the  Working People stated their readiness to defend the economic and  social interests of the working people.    We are for accord and civic peace but not at the expense of  the working people and not at the expense of depriving common  people of their rights, Mikhail Nagaytsev, chairman of the  Moscow Federation of Trade Unions [MFTU] said opening the rally.  According to him, on the eve of May Day about 2.5 million  people signed demands circulated by the MFTU, which will be  passed to the government. Among them are demands to introduce  articles to the legislation of the Russian Federation on the  accountability of those guilty of delaying salary payments, to  adopt a state employment program for the population, and to step  up the work of law-enforcement bodies in the fight against crime  and corruption.    A resolution adopted by the rally -- in which about 25,000  people took part according to Nagaytsev -- notes that a solution  to the present crisis, which is leading to the country's  impoverishment, is possible only if the level of unemployment is  halted, there is state support for Russia's producers, and  tariff agreements are fulfilled.    War and labor veterans and members of the Russian Communist  Party took part in the rally in Manezh Square together with  representatives of 42 trade union organizations from Moscow city  and oblast, St. Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Voronezh,  Smolensk, Kostroma, Tula, Kaluga, and other towns.</p>

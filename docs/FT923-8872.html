			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase, Q&amp;A): AVCs and tax relief I AM 47, and for the last ten years have been paying 4 per cent of my salary into my company pension scheme. This year I am inheriting some money and will be able to afford higher payments. I am therefore making Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) up to the limit of 15 per cent. I understand that with a personal pension plan it is possible to backdate tax relief for up to six years, but because I am part of a company pension scheme I am not allowed to take out a personal pension as well. Is it possible to backdate the tax relief for AVCs? Our pension administrator says no, but it may well be that this is a new request. Are there any procedures that need to be followed if it is possible? AVCs cannot be backdated. However, if you are paying 4 per cent as basic contributions you can pay up to 11 per cent of earnings as AVCs. Furthermore, if your basic pension contributions of 4 per cent are not based on your total PAYE earnings (including taxable P11D expenses) your AVCs can be calculated as 15 per cent of your gross taxable earnings from your employment, less the amount paid to your scheme - which in many typical company situations would mean that the permitted AVC limit could be 12 per cent (assuming a 4 per cent scheme contribution) or more. As your current scheme membership is providing for current service AVCs at this level over the next 18 years (assuming your retirement age is 65) this should enable you to fill up a substantial back service gap. You should ask your pensions manager for estimates (assuming you are in a final pay plan) of the likely percentage of final pay that such AVCs could reasonably be expected to produce, asking him to make allowance for topping up your spouse's pension to two-thirds of yours and for indexation on both pensions. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

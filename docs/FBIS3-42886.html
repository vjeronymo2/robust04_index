Revanche"] </F> <H5>  [No 4, Jan pp 10-13] </H5>   [Text] Politics has returned to business as usual.  Again it is dictated by the military-industrial complex.    The retirement of Yegor Gaydar and Ella Pamfilova and then  the announcement of Boris Fedorov's retirement brought an end to  the alignment of forces in the country and in the power  structures that had lasted approximately since May 1992. The  period of doubt was in the past: Before that it had still seemed  to me, as, probably, to many others as well, that even after the  December elections the harmful Gaydar reforms would be continued  in Russia. Harmful because they were inadequate, half-measures;  although they were needed they were merely monetaristic,  anti-inflationary, and not structural and not economic reforms.  Now it is clear--we will not even have the harmful ones.    Under the guise of social policy, in the name of the  well-being of all the people, a planned economy with  apportionment will be restored. Its rulers will be Viktor  Chernomyrdin, Oleg Soskovets, Aleksandr Zaveryukha and....Yuriy  Skokov. And the president? He has now become a figurehead. Does  he have an understanding attitude toward the first deputy prime  minister's decision to resign? That is, an understanding that  there will be no radical economic reforms. But, after all, the  president's job is to guarantee structural transformations. And  if it turns out that you cannot, well, be belle of the ball,  there will be others, and your lot is to become a decoration.    And Gaydar will not be able to console us by saying that he  does not intend to join the president's opposition, that Kozyrev  will learn to outsing Zhirinovskiy, or that the West will repeat  that Yeltsin still means democracy, and with all this Russia,  instead of moving along the axis of time, will again revolve in  the Chaadayev circle, in which there will be more Augusts and  more Octobers.    Why is all this so? I am trying to find an answer to this  question.  <H5>  Grachev's Times </H5>   In light of recent events, it is becoming increasingly  apparent that in October 1993 the military actually took the  upper hand. In this case I mean by military not only generals  and colonels and not even the Army as such, but the entire  military-industrial complex in alliance with the bureaucracy,  although this includes the Army too, of course.    Of course this has been interpreted differently--as a  victory  for democracy, as the elimination of obstacles on the path to  reform.    Recent actions of Yeltsin and the government confirm that  the  military, having lost a certain amount of power during  Gorbachev's times, have not only regained it but have acquired  even more influence over our lives than they had before.    Let us begin with a symbolic episode--in Russia's history it  has frequently been the case that in order to understand what  was going on, the symbol almost carries more weight than that  which it designates.    A couple of days before the October events, Yeltsin called  all the powerful ministers to a meeting. When Grachev came in  late, Yeltsin pointed at his watch (many people saw this scene  on television) and in response Grachev pointed at his, as if to  say: "No, my watch is more accurate than yours." That seemed to  be the end of the incident. What is important, however, is not  whose watch was more accurate but the very fact that the  military minister showed up at a meeting after the president  had, and he did it intentionally: He knew that all the  television channels of Russia and the world would broadcast this  event.    This occurred two days before 3 October, and the country's  leaders, journalists, and even military units already knew  something about the imminent events. Suffice it to recall  Yeltsin's route: the Taman Division, then the division imeni  Dzerzhinskiy. Rutskoy had probably done something too. There had  been conferences and negotiations. In the situation that had  developed the meeting acquired truly symbolic importance--at  that very moment Grachev placed himself in a special position.    But why was it that Yeltsin met with Grachev at 0400 hours  on  4 October and that this meeting took place in the Ministry of  Defense and not in the president's residence?    And, finally: Why was it that on 3 October the authorities  did not stop the thug-demonstrators from moving toward October  Square, the building of the Supreme Soviet, and the television  center?    As cochairmen of the Democratic Russia movement, I  participated directly in the organization of the movement  through Moscow of demonstrations involving approximately 400,000  people. On the eve of one of them, in March 1990, Luzhkov,  Murashev, and I were called in by Yanayev, Pugo, and Kryuchkov.  There was a discussion about the possible consequences of  gathering together such an immense mass of people and moving  them through the streets of Moscow. At first they tried to  persuade us to call off the procession and rally, threatening  that we would be held personally responsible for the  consequences. We said that we were prepared to take full  responsibility, but under the condition that the events would  develop according to our scenario, that is, according to the  procedure for holding demonstrations approved in Moscow. If it  were not violated, there would be no excesses. The route for the  demonstration was agreed upon, and Ministry of Internal Affairs  forces were provided for it: All side streets adjoining Sadovoye  Circle were blocked by trucks loaded with sand and vehicles with  water cannons, and there were cordons of soldiers. All the  streets leading to the center were cut off. Under these  conditions, the slightest deviation from the earmarked route was  quite an impossible task. Nothing of the kind was envisioned on  those October days in Moscow, although the technical  capabilities for this, of course, existed.    Even after Rutskoy and then Makashov as well called for  storming the television center, no measures were taken, and this  enabled the commandos not only to reach their goal but also to  begin the attack.    Why? It is possible to formulate two hypotheses.    The first: Those who wanted to but could not block the  movement of the commandos did not have realistic forces. They  did not have the subdivisions necessary to prevent this, and all  appeals on the part of the authorities to the power structures  were futile. Television and radio inflamed the situation: The  troops are advancing on Moscow, they have already entered  Moscow, they are moving toward the center, when in fact there  were no troops at all. And they did not arrive until the morning  of 4 October. Could it be that the military were twisting  Yeltsin's arm and forcing him to accept certain of their  conditions?    The second version is that the authorities themselves  provoked this particular development of events and no other:  They let the commandos through to the Supreme Soviet and gave  them the opportunity to storm the mayor's office and Ostankino  (the more so since the seizure of Ostankino did not make any  difference anyway: It was possible to cut off broadcasting in a  moment). Therefore, let everything develop according the "their"  scenario: Rutskoy and Khasbulatov would show their putschist  nature, the public would see that there was nowhere to turn, and  everyone would breathe a sigh of relief and say: "Thank you,  God, for putting an end to this parliament."    Both of these versions are quite possible. But, judging from  subsequent events, the former seems more probable.    Literally the next day after the October events, Yeltsin  convened the Security Council of Russia, where he raised only  one question: about the new military doctrine. And this was done  immediately after the events, before the fires had been put out,  before the dead had been buried, as if throughout all of Russia,  throughout the whole world, there were no problems that were  more important.    In the new military doctrine it is necessary to single out  two basic provisions: recognition of the extension of Russia's  interests to the entire territory of the former USSR (with  exceptions regarding the Baltic republics) and Russia's right to  make the first nuclear strike.    How will these new provisions turn out for Russia and the  rest of the world, and will they not damage the arms restriction  and the international stability that have been observed recently?    Yeltsin's statements about the reduction of arms by  two-thirds, made during the first days of his presidency, have  not been repeated recently. Instead there are photographs of the  commander-in-chief with a machine gun in his hands and his  assurances: No more concessions to the West. And the military  order for this year will be at last year's level. This order is  being filled today by more than 2,000 enterprises and 660  scientific institutes. Not a single new conversion program will  be financed in 1994.    To this one might add Russia's blocking of attempts by  countries of Eastern and Central Europe to join NATO. I shall  give one more symbolic example. During Yeltsin's official visit  to Warsaw, he had a conversation with the president of Poland.  To Lech Walesca's question as to whether or not Poland is a  sovereign state and is, accordingly, eligible to join NATO,  Yeltsin gave a positive response. Grachev, who was standing  nearby, tried to intervene and correct the president, to which  Yeltsin quite fairly remarked to him: "Who is president of  Russia, you or I?" But after returning to Moscow, Yeltsin  apparently received certain clarifications and took a negative  position regarding this question, which had a harsh resonance  during his visit to Brussels.    Thus, the Army is already exerting an influence on foreign  policy as well.    The scale of military control has reached alarming  dimensions. On 19 January there was a session of the Security  Council of the Russian Federation at which they considered  military-technical (and, consequently, also financial?) problems  of the new doctrine. Boris Fedorov was not allowed to attend  this meeting. The country has no budget, the Government of  Russia has not been formed, but the demands of the military are  already being discussed.  <H5>  Trench Thinking </H5>   Through the efforts of the powerful party-state machine,  which mobilized all means of influencing the minds and feelings  of the people--the schools, literature, the press, art, science,  institutions, institutes, organizations, punitive organs, the  Army--three or four generations of Soviet people were duped  every day, one and all. And this was not without results. How  many people believed that they had achieved happiness on this  earth, how many of them prayed for Stalin while sitting in  prison camps? Some people even today believe that Hitler  attacked the Soviet Union suddenly.    As a result, a large part of the society today is still  psychologically in a condition if not of war, then in any case  of defense from the surrounding world. Many Russians, even those  who have never fought, are still sitting in the trenches  ideologically. A kind of "trench" thinking, which pervades our  society from bottom to top, is exerting an immense influence on  the country's life today.    I am convinced that we must get over this condition. Until  in  Russia there are monuments, for example, to the German, Italian,  French, and Romanian soldiers who died here during the war, and  flowers are placed on them, we will not get well as a nation.    The victory of the military is closely interwoven with the  foreign political course of the authorities. The provisions of  the military doctrine to the effect that Russia's interests  extend to all the territory of the former USSR and the attempts  to impose a particular foreign policy on all countries of the  former European "socialist camp" again place millions of people  in a difficult position--after all, they believed that they had  escaped Moscow's control forever.    Many have openly advanced the great-power ideology as one of  the constituent parts of the official state policy.    The present foreign political strategy of the authorities  can  lead (and already is leading) to severe consequences. Up until  quite recently, Russia has been waging or is waging an  undeclared war at many points of the former USSR which might be  called imperialist.    The largest problems lie in the nearby foreign countries, in  the attitude of Russian authorities to the former Soviet  republics. Externally, events are developing differently  everywhere, but at the bottom of the problem there always lies  something specific and, as a rule, concealed--Russia's interest  in retaining the Black Sea coast, the large uranium mine in  Tajikistan, enterprises of the military-industrial complex that  are scattered everywhere, such, for example, as the aircraft  plant in Tbilisi or defense enterprises of the Dniester region.  But if it were only that.  <H5>  By Hook or By Crook </H5>   There is a more and more overt desire to subordinate the  former Soviet republics, to assign to them the role that was  previously played by countries of the "socialist camp": to be a  buffer zone between Russia and distant foreign countries.    The civilized divorce did not take place: Disputes arose out  of the Black Sea fleet and the Crimea, out of nuclear weapons  and space objects. There was the desire, even at gigantic costs,  to use economic measures to force the former republics to enter  the CIS. But, as distinct from the USSR, we did not want to take  any responsibility for what was going on there: neither for the  carnage in Georgia nor the famine in Armenia.    In order to understand the fundamentals of the "new" policy,  it is necessary to answer this question: According to which  indicators does the Russian Federation today determine which  former Soviet republics to support and which not to?    In places where attempts are made to show independence and  get out of control, Russia supports "national liberation"  movements under the pretext of protecting the Russian-speaking  population. Sometimes the direct participation of Russian forces  is camouflaged and presented to the whole world as a  peace-making mission in interethnic conflicts. One can see a  clear unwillingness to take the remaining divisions back to  Russia. The nearby foreign countries are the source of the main  threat to Russia's vital interests, as Minister of Foreign  Affairs of the Russian Federation A. Kozyrev said at a  conference of Russian ambassadors in the CIS and Baltic  countries. In the minister's opinion, Russia should continue her  military presence in the countries of the Commonwealth.    Imperialist intentions are being manifested in many ways. We  supported the structures of the Dniester Republic created  through the efforts of Lukyanov as well as allied power  structures in order to take the Moldovans in hand. In September  1993 there was a military parade of the armed forces of the  Dniester region, which was shown on television. Who was  financing the Dniester region during the military events, and  who is financing it today? We know only that it was not Moldova,  of which the Dniester region is a part: The Dniester authorities  rejected Moldova's "services" during the conflict. Does this  mean that Russia was financing them secretly? Directly, out of  the budget or with "credits" of the Central Bank of Russia?  Under what items are the payments made? Or are the authorities  especially financing certain Russian enterprises, which then  send money to Tiraspol? Is the Central Bank of Russia taking  part in this? Does Gerashchenko know about this, and is he not  the one who transferred the CPSU money abroad at one time? I do  not think I am the only one interested in the answers to these  questions.    There is a similar situation in the Caucasus as well. Russia  has actually been engaged in a war against Georgia, but the  authorities have denied this or tried to speak with society in  some kind of strange language. If one compares tiny Abkhazia,  which is a part of Georgia, for example, with Tambov Oblast, the  question arises: Where could the Tambov governor have gotten  Su-27's, MiG-29's, modern tanks, and thousands of automatic  Kalashnikovs? Where did Abkhazia get such a quantity of  aircraft, tanks, and artillery? With the help of which forces  did Abkhazia conduct large-scale military operations? Who  financed the deliveries and the maintenance of the Abkhazian  army and hundreds of volunteers from Russia?    I do not want to accuse the authorities of Russia of first  being on Abkhazia's side and then on the other side. We know how  this war began. Shevardnadze is to blame, Ardzinba is to blame,  and it is difficult to say right now which of them is more to  blame. But clarifying for the society the question of Russia's  role in this war is not the main thing. Should they have  supported the Abkhaz against the "entrenched" Georgia in their  desire for independence and self-sufficiency? They did support  them. And the Abkhaz "liberated" their entire territory, but  with the help of Russian troops and technical equipment. Have  things gone too far? Wrath was replaced with kindness,  Shevardnadze was supported and forced to enter the CIS. Why?    The Azerbaijan-Armenian conflict, of course, had plenty of  causes of its own, but Russia's role there was not beyond  reproach either.    There are many vague words about strategic objectives, but  there are no official, exhaustive statements from the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs, the government, or the president regarding  this. Strategy must be comprehensible so that the society can at  least determine its attitude toward it. If we say that democracy  means an open society, Russia's interests must be known. They  must not be concealed as they were before.    But the most alarming situation today is developing in  Central Asia. Here, as before, Russia is in a state of  undeclared war, a war with unstated objectives. Russia is making  war in Tajikistan on the side of the puppet pro-Uzbek regime, a  reactionary regime that is mercilessly suppressing the very  principles of free thought and democracy in Tajikistan. People  calling for democratic transformations are now being forced to  live outside Tajikistan, actually in emigration, in Russia,  India, and other countries. And now, along with this puppet  regime, the Russian authorities are taking advantage of the  residuals of the Tajik opposition, the residuals of the  democratic forces. Kozyrev is going to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan  in order to persuade the Kyrgyz and Kazakhs to enter this  conflict on Russia's side so that Russia will not be fighting  alone here but to take cover under the flags of several  countries, as during the time of the invasion of Czechoslovakia  in 1968.    There is probably a hope of restoring the empire lying here  too. It is one thing when communists at rallies demand the  restoration of the USSR, and something altogether different when  it is the official position and actual policy of the authorities.    Our present leaders have apparently not learned anything  from  the experience of 10 years of war in Afghanistan. The Soviet  empire collapsed because it was impossible to maintain such a  large number of territories at its own expense, and attempts to  reinvigorate this policy are doomed in advance to failure.  <H5>  [No 5, Feb pp 18-20] </H5>   [Text] At moments of crisis, Russia has always chosen  the road of traditionalism, abandoning attempts to become a  modern society.    Economy in the Western sense of this word, namely a system  based on natural and harmonious development of various elements  (agriculture and industry, the state and private sectors,  civilian and military production) never existed even in  prerevolutionary Russia. One can discuss the Russian economy  more as an extremely premodern system in which the requirements  of social control prevailed over strictly economic  considerations (one need recall only the ups and downs of  liberating the serfs), which created obstacles to the  establishment of a new structure for the society. From the very  beginning of the changes (the age of Peter the Great) an  artificial construct, one that was not capable of  self-advancement, was created.    All of these structural peculiarities were not surmounted in  1917 but, on the contrary, they became stronger. The lack of  balance among various constituent parts of the economy  increased. Relations among subjects of the national economic  complex, instead of being natural, were imposed by political  will, which gave little consideration to the elementary norms of  the functioning of the economic system.  <H5>  The Socialist Fish </H5>   Unfortunately, today the gigantic supermonopoly of the state  actually determines the picture of gross national production as  much as ever. The central planning and distribution organs have  changed their names but not their functions. The ministries and  departments have changed their stripes and become branch holding  companies and concerns, squashing almost all attempts at  competition. The Central Bank has taken over many distribution  functions. It engages in the distribution of finances at the  federal level, and this is practically the same thing as  distribution of resources and planning of physical volumes of  production. At the regional level, distribution functions are  performed by the local nomenklatura. And that is the main work  of the administration as a whole in the krays, oblasts,  republics, and in Moscow, including the most lucrative trade in  the bureaucratic business--quotas on export deliveries.    The extremely severe pressure from the "Soviet" economic  leaders has nullified the economic changes made at the beginning  of 1992 by the Gaydar government. They are returning to the  so-called planned, cost-oriented economy.    I will give an absurd but typical example from which it is  possible to draw certain conclusions. E. Chernyy, chairman of  the presidium of the Union of Independent Fish Industry Workers,  wrote in IZVESTIYA about the fact that the former Ministry of  the Fish Industry (now the Committee on Fishing of the Russian  Federation) submitted to the government a regular "plan of the  century." Instead of demonopolizing the branch and placing fish  processing enterprises and ships in private hands (which,  incidentally, requires no subsidies) and creating a multitude of  competing fishing and fish processing enterprises, the committee  suggests giving itself a monopoly on everything related to  fishing in Russia. Moreover, it requests from the state 4  trillion rubles [R] (three-fourths of which are to be in  dollars), material resources worth R700 billion and exemption  from taxes, and customs fees and duties. The production cost of  fish would be 10 times higher than the world price. The  "effectiveness" of the branch, of course, would be socialist as  before: While catching as many fish as Japan does, we maintained  a fleet that was 6 (six!) times larger than Japan's in terms of  tonnage.    If one takes into account the fact that in addition to the  Committee on Fishing we have about 400 branch  department-monopolies and there is not a single one of them that  does not require subsidies, and the total revenue side of  Russia's budget is only R22 trillion, one can understand that to  preserve the branch ministries and meet their demands will lead  Russia to hyperinflation and the collapse of the national  economy.    On the initiative of the branch monopolists, the authorities  will introduce new duties on foodstuffs and industrial goods.  These measures will help neither Russian industry nor  agriculture nor the consumer. They will merely eliminate  competitors, expand the field for raising prices, and create  cozy conditions for the talentless leaders of the monopolies:  They will not have to be concerned about reducing production  costs, modernizing production, changing over to new models, and  so forth.    Predominant in banking are pseudo-commercial banks that  almost do not depend on deposits from the population or  enterprises: They are still redistributing the same state  finances. Among them there are still branch banks which  monopolize each branch even more. The fear of competition has  led to banning the activity of foreign banks.    The example of the sale of gas is very typical: Ukraine is  curtailing deliveries under the pretext that it is because of  delayed payments, but at the same time they offer gas to Serbia,  even though it would be quite unrealistic to expect payments  from it--inflation there runs into the hundreds of thousands of  percentage points. Again the economy is under the influence of  politics.    One can always hear complaints about inflation and excessive  taxes, but literally all critics--from communists to "radical"  democrats--remain completely silent about the causes:  expenditures on the Army, the military-industrial complex, the  kolkhozes, and factories that are operated at a loss which are  on the shoulders of the Russian taxpayer. If every fifth  able-bodied person in the country is sitting in a tank or  working on manufacturing one, what kind of economic upturn can  there be? They remain silent, probably, because now it is  dangerous to mention the military-industrial complex and the  Army. This is another effect of the psychological victory of the  military.    Privatization, initiative to create different nonstate forms  of ownership, competition and the free market, convertibility of  the ruble, open foreign economic activity (including openness  for Western investments), the establishment of real commercial  banks, reduction of state costs, the beginning of a new tax  policy, social protection--this is a selection of measures that  must be implemented in order to escape from the old type of  economy and reach a new one.    We need not to reduce ministry staffs, but to achieve  complete elimination of all branch monopolies, beginning with  Agroprom [Agro-industrial Complex] and the Ministry of Trade.  During the transition period, the ministers must appoint only  those who are capable of conducting legally intelligent  self-elimination of the ministry and creating a competitive  environment in their branch. But, as we see, events are  developing in exactly the opposite direction.  <H5>  The Countryside--Eternal Pain and Hindrance </H5>   The stumbling block of previous and current Russian  reformers  has been agrarian relations.    The most impoverished situation exists in agriculture today.  But not because of the shortage of technical equipment, fuel, or  money, but because of new relations among the producer,  consumer, and intermediary (state) that have developed recently.    An ugly symbiosis has developed between the peasant and the  kolkhoz, or, rather, the kolkhoz worker and the kolkhoz. They  are all sucking off one another like parasites. The kolkhoz  workers for better or worse have finally received large  farmstead plots where they raise the things that are most  necessary for their families (this is also partially commercial  production as well). And one can only rejoice at that.    But the peasant has been placed in conditions whereby he  needs the kolkhoz like the air he breathes since there (and only  there) is the possibility of stealing grain to feed his cattle,  and for a bottle of vodka he can use the equipment to cultivate  his plot. Additionally, the kolkhoz is for the peasant a kind of  guarantee against unforeseen circumstances.    The kolkhoz cannot get along without the peasant either: The  fields must be planted, at least some of the crops must be  harvested, and it is necessary to render an accounting for  ruined credit, subsidies, and technical equipment.    This parasitic symbiosis created by that gigantic monopoly,  Agroprom, is also the main social impediment to the development  of agrarian production in Russia, the introduction of the  institution of private ownership of the land, and the formation  of farmer-run or voluntary collective farms. Up to this point in  Russia's agriculture, there have been practically no  commodity-monetary relations: Instead of buying and selling  products, the kolkhoz workers "turn them over," and in exchange  they "receive" something.    The powerful agrarian lobby in the new Duma and government  will continue to demand incredible subsidies from the state. The  agrarian nomenklatura has always referred to Western practice,  where in fact many states grant subsidies to agriculture. But,  as before, the experts on the kolkhoz system say nothing about  the immense differences in political, economic, and even  technological conditions between Russia and the Western  countries: The Western countries subsidize each farmer  individually, providing additional payment for the crop that has  been raised or for reducing the planted areas. We have  everything upside down: The subsidies are received not by the  kolkhoz worker and not by the farmer, but by Agroprom--a  structure that has no analogues in any developed country.    A truly democratic power must think about how to get out of  the economy, leaving the state only indirect instruments of  regulation--tax, credit-financial, excise, and customs.    Unfortunately, all this tells us that the powerful economic  structures are still active, and they are the ones that  determine the political and economic life of modern Russia.  <H5>  Zhirinovskiy--A Mirror of Russian Society </H5>   I do not see anything surprising or unexpected in  Zhirinovskiy's victory in the elections. The simplest thing to  say is that communists and fascists voted for him, but the real  causes of this result go much deeper.    For centuries the absence of a social space outside the  limits of "state interests" was compensated for in Russia by  other realities--boorishness and tyranny. On the one hand there  was arbitrariness, complete lawlessness, and violence, and on  the other--obsequiousness, tractability, servility, and  powerlessness.    The main things that made it impossible for the people of  Russia to break out of the totalitarian system--whether it be  before or after 1917--was the unformed nature of the civilian  society in Russia, the state monopoly over any action that had  been established here, and the absence of any kind of socium at  all beyond the all-pervasive state. The vicious circle outlined  even by Chernyshevskiy, the "almighty state--subjects deprived  of initiative," guaranteed the system's constant  self-perpetuation. Even the reforms did not break the circle but  merely modernized the system in order to preserve and strengthen  the regime.    With respect to the spiritual sphere, socialist  experimentation led to a redoubling of the lack of freedom. The  social consciousness of prerevolutionary Russia was mainly  traditionalist and mythological. Irrational (heathen and  orthodox) ideas, symbols, and ideals prevailed in it. It is also  possible to discuss the lack of freedom here in the sense that  the people lived and acted guided mainly not by reason but by  prejudices. Their freedom was fettered by a system of all kinds  of mental restrictions and habits.    After 1917 it was as though an additional lack of freedom  was  superimposed on top of this lack of freedom--also in the form of  a framework or system of restrictive principles, but this time  Marxist-Leninist ones that were supposed to be rationalistic.  The redoubled lack of freedom is the most appreciable result of  totalitarianism in the spiritual life of modern Russia. It is  the main reason for the distorted perception of the world as  well as for the fact that Russia has not yet found an identity.    Zhirinovskiy's victory is mainly the non-success of  Yeltsin's  reforms and, on the other hand, a quality of Russian society, a  condition of its mentality. The results of the elections were  only a mirror in which Russians had to look in order to see  themselves.    I am not inclined to dramatize Zhirinovskiy's success and  see  it almost as the onset of the brown plague. It is dangerous, of  course, but not so much as to make a tragedy of it. And for the  authorities it is a kind of lottery win. When something did not  go right in Gorbachev's age, it took Ligachev to present it as  the embodiment of reaction and the cause of failure. If Ligachev  had not done it, Gorbachev would have played this role himself.  If Gorbachev had not done it, then the Supreme Soviet of Russia  would have appeared immediately: It turns out that all the  difficulties lie in conservatism and the reactionary nature of  the communist deputies and Khasbulatov-Rutskoy. If they had not  been there, it would have been necessary to replace them, and  perhaps Zhirinovskiy can do this: For the near future he will do  as someone else to blame for the failures of reform.    When they say that Stalin destroyed the people, one must  remember that the Stalinist regime was also made up of the same  people who were parties to the crimes of this regime. It is  impossible to draw a line, to say these are the victims and  these are the hangmen. There is both a hangman and a victim in  each of us. When an understanding of this reaches people, when  we stop pointing at Gaydar or Zhirinovskiy, when we want to  really see the difficulties of our life, only then will we enter  on a normal path. But for now, give us the next person to blame.  <H5>  The Essence and Form of the New Regime </H5>   The process of renewal is taking place extremely slowly, and  Russia's current condition can be characterized by a proverb: "I  would like to go to heaven, but my sins keep me out." That which  until recently kept us in a premodern condition continues to be  a reality even today. At crisis moments in history, Russia has  always chosen the path of traditionalism, abandoning attempts to  become a modern society. Today we are again faced with a choice:  And again we are trying to overcome traditionalism, archaism,  and collectivism, which were excellently preserved during the  Soviet period.    In the summer of 1992, one can pinpoint the beginning of the  departure from the course toward liberal reforms, toward  resolute and specific advancement. At that time, Gaydar began to  pursue an anti-Gaydar course. At the same time Yeltsin and the  government were experiencing stronger and stronger pressure from  the military-industrial complex, the Army, the Russian  bureaucracy, and the agro-industrial nomenklatura, including  kolkhoz chairmen and sovkhoz directors.    Today there is practically nothing left of reformism except  rhetoric. Politics has become duplicitous, hidden, and  frequently dishonest. Last year was a year of decline of the  reformist course which Gaydar brought with him. The result of  this policy is an increase in the distance between the  authorities and society, the loss of social reference points,  predatory, unconcealed enrichment of the nomenklatura through  "converting" power and connections into wealth, and ultimately  loss for Zhirinovskiy.    The essence of what will take place in Russia in the near  future will be the strengthening of the dominance of the  military-industrial complex in alliance with the neo-Soviet  nomenklatura and deceived democratic forces.    The form in which it will begin to be realized will be an  authoritarian regime: Today headed by Yeltsin, tomorrow,  possibly, by someone else. This is not the first time that  reforms are being constrained not only by the will of those  gathered in the government, but by those social forces that  dominate in Russia.    Among them one can single out three main ones.    First, those employed in the military-industrial complex.  Most of them have nothing to gain from a market economy. The  second force is our kolkhoz peasantry, most of whom are  depraved, having become accustomed to a parasitic way of life,  theft, and poor work, supported by the agricultural  nomenklatura. Third, the bureaucracy: 20 million bureaucrats,  almost all of them corrupt, who have seen an additional  possibility of taking bribes and are the basis of the shadow  economy.    All three forces are against the market, against democracy,  against getting rid of the poverty we are experiencing.    It has been said that parliament has become the embodiment  of  forces of reaction, communist forces, an impediment to further  reforms of which it was necessary to rid ourselves in order to  reform Russia. And Yeltsin supposedly meant democracy, and  victory over parliament was a triumph of democracy. One cannot  say that these judgments were completely wrong. In the Supreme  Soviet there was indeed much more conservatism with respect to  reforms than in the structures of executive power, but the  essence lies elsewhere. By Yeltsin's time a new class of  neo-Soviet nomenklatura had formed in Russia. This class was  represented by both branches of power: both the executive and  the legislative.    In and of itself the name "authoritarian regime" tells us  little: It could be reformist, enlightened, and aimed at  progress. The present authoritarian regime has no justification  for calling itself either reformist or progressive or  democratic. This is an authoritarian regime which expresses the  interests of the monopolistic and militarized economy of Russia,  reinforced by imperialist ambitions.    Regarding what occurred in Russia during those October days  of 1917, Osip Mandelshtam found a capacious expression--"noise  of the times." He defined everything that was going on in Russia  at the time as noise, not yet very clearly expressed and still  difficult to distinguish, but powerful, disturbing, and  frightening.    And here again is the "noise of the times" which is reaching  the entire world. What will it evoke this time? Need we have  fear about the future? How will the Eastern winds affect the  entire world this time?</p>

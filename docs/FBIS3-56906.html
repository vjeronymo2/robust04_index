"The president  should not be placed above everyone, just beyond the executive  branch of power. He should control, but not interfere,"  Kravchuk said.    He described as the chief stabilizing factor "a balance of  the powers between branches of government and their democratic  transformation." Kravchuk promised that presidential structures  would do their utmost to hold parliamentary elections in Ukraine  and bring "qualified and loyal deputies" to the new parliament.  However, in his opinion the elections are not the last step in  reforming the system of government. Ukraine needs an integral  system with a clear separation of powers.    The president also spoke for holding a referendum on key  provisions of the constitution simultaneously with the  parliamentary elections on March 27. He confirmed his proposal  to drop from the fundamental law provisions concerning the  official language, state symbol, and flag, the state order and  other matters that might cause political confrontation.    On the latest developments in Crimea, Kravchuk said he  believes the new constitution should declare that the executive  branch of power in the autonomous republic be formed and act on  the basis of the constitution and legislation of Ukraine as well  as the Crimean constitution that should conform with the  Ukrainian fundamental law.    Kravchuk suggested amending the constitution offering  president powers to cancel the decisions of the Crimean  parliament, if they contradict acting Ukrainian legislation.    The speaker of parliament Ivan Plyushch promised that such  an  amendment would be made and the conference voted for including  the matter in the final document.    The president agreed with the proposals of participants to  cut down the staffs of executive bodies of all levels by  25%.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["On Successfully Fulfilling Tasks of Socialist Economic </F> Construction in Adjustment Period"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Deputy Kang Song-san,  premier of the Administration Council, made a report on the  first agenda item "On Successfully Fulfilling the Tasks of  Socialist Economic Construction in the Period of Adjustment Set  Forth by the Workers' Party of Korea" on the first day of the  7th session of the ninth Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK  which has opened here.    The reporter recalled that the 21st plenary meeting of the  sixth Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in  December last year reviewed the fulfilment of the Third  Seven-Year Plan and put forward an economic strategy, setting a  three-year period of adjustment, on the basis of a scientific  analysis of the present situation and the state of socialist  economic construction in the country.    He quoted the great leader President Kim Il-song as saying:    "At the twenty-first plenary meeting of the sixth party  Central Committee, the next three years were set as a period for  adjustment in socialist economic construction and during this  period we must implement the agriculture-first, light  industry-first and foreign trade-first policies. Along with  this, we must give precedence to the coal industry, power  industry and rail transport, which must advance ahead of the  other sectors of the national economy, while continuing to  develop the metal industry."    The task of socialist economic construction in the period  for  adjustment is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first,  light industry-first and foreign trade-first policies and give  precedence to the coal industry, power industry and rail  transport, which must advance ahead of the other sectors of the  national economy, while continuing to develop the metal industry.    The revolutionary economic strategy for the period of  adjustment in socialist economic construction represents the  steadfast determination and will of the Workers' Party of Korea  to radically improve the people's living standard in the next  few years and develop the national economy into an economy  strong in independence which can walk on its own feet, remaining  unshaken under any circumstances.    When we, by implementing the party's revolutionary economic  strategy, bring about a new turn in the development of  agriculture, light industry and foreign trade and keep the  preferential sectors of the national economy definitely ahead of  the others while continuing to develop the metal industry, the  departmental structure of the economy will be further improved  and its independence and potential will grow immensely.    Our party's economic strategy is a just policy which makes  it  possible to more successfully implement the basic line of  economic construction in conformity with the demand of the  prevailing situation and the developing realities.    The agriculture-first policy is the primary task to be  carried out in the adjustment period.    By implementing this policy to the letter, we must make an  advance in all domains of agricultural production such as grain,  meat, egg, fruit and vegetable production, thus satisfactorily  solving the food problem for the people.    We must, above all, consolidate the achievements in  irrigation and electrification to give full scope to their  potential and raise the level of comprehensive mechanization and  application of chemicals to a higher stage.    We must raise the utilization rate of the existing farm  machines to the maximum and, at the same time, produce above  30,000 tractors and 10,000 or more lorries and other farm  machines of various kinds needed for mechanizing  labour-consuming work in the adjustment period.    And the supply of nitrogenous, phosphatic and potassic  fertilizers must be increased for the rural communities.    The green revolution must be pushed ahead to obtain  high-grade strains of seed, which are high-yielding, suitable to  the climatic and soil conditimns of our country, early-ripening  and resisting storms, cold and moisture, blight and harmful  insects, including the first filial generations of rice and  maize which can yield 12 to 15 tons per hectare.    The per hectare yield in paddy and non-paddy fields must be  raised to above 8 tons on an average and gradually to more than  10 tons to produce 15 million tons of grain in the near future.    During the period of adjustment fruit and meat output must  be  raised 30 percent respectively.    A big effort must be directed to the implementation of the  light industry-first policy.    Textile output must be boosted above 20 percent and the  output of shoes more than 10 percent in the period.    Food processing industry must be further developed to supply  more abundant and diverse food to the people and the quantity  and variety of consumer goods must be continuously increased.    The chemical factories and industrial establishments  producing raw materials for the light industry must lift the  output of vinalon and other chemical fibres and synthetic resin  more than 10 percent and produce enough raw materials for the  light industry including paper, dyestuffs and basic chemical  goods.    A new turnabout must be made in foreign trade to cope with  the changed circumstances.    A brisk drive must be launched in all sectors of the  national  economy to expand the production bases of export goods and  improve the quality of products for a radical increase of  exports.    Efforts must be directed to the building of the  Najin-Sonbong  free economic and trade zone to fully ensure conditions for  investment by foreign businesses.    We must expand and strengthen economic ties with countries  which are on good terms with our country and further develop  trade and economic dealings with Southeast Asian countries which  are within easy reach geographically and favourable for  transactions.    Coal and power output and railway freight turnover which  should advance ahead of other sectors must be increased 30  percent respectively during the period of adjustment. And  investment in oil prospecting must be increased to discover more  oil deposits.    The metal industry must be developed to satisfactorily meet  the growing demand for irons and steels.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, April 27 (CNA) -- The German Foreign Affairs  Ministry said Wednesday [27 April] that the German Government  has no plans to sell 10 submarines to Taiwan, as had been  reported in Germany.    The economic daily HANDELSBLATT reported Wednesday that the  Grman firms HDW, Vulkan, Thyssen Nordseewerke, and Blohm Und  Voss contacted US arms contractors last year about assembling  submarine parts made in Germany and then shipping the finished  submarines to Taiwan. The German Government said it never gave  permission to the companies to enter into such a deal, and that  it was adhering to a ban on sales of weaponry to countries it  considers to be in "high tension" areas.    Delivery of the submarines to Taiwan, the paper said, would  secure for Germany another contract for high speed ice rains [as  received] worth 30 million marks (US$17.6 billion).    Taiwan's efforts to purchase submarines and other weaponry  from Germany have been stalled as Bonn does not want to damage  its ties with Beijing. Communist China has repeatedly insisted  that no country should sell weapons to Taiwan because it is  under Beijing sovereignty.    In Taipei, German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt told  the  press on Tuesday that his government is reviewing the present  list of high tension areas, but did not say whether the list  would be amended to exclude Taiwan.    Rexrodt, the second highest ranking official from Germany to  visit Taiwan, is visiting Taiwan to lobby on behalf of German  firms bidding for construction contracts related to the building  of the proposed high speed railway.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / InterCity aims to woo lost travellers InterCity is to offer 25,000 free tickets to rail travellers on November 8 and 9 in a competition aimed at winning back customers lost during the 16-week signal workers' strike. Seats will be offered on the six long-distance InterCity routes covering 140 destinations from Penzance to Inverness and about 2,000 miles of railway travel. The InterCity companies - Great Western, East Coast, Cross Country, Midland Main Line, West Coast and Anglia - lost Pounds 53m in revenues, a quarter of the total loss suffered by the entire rail network. Other parts of the British Rail network are also considering special promotions involving free or discounted tickets to attract people back to the railway. South West Trains said it was looking at a similar promotion while South Eastern said it was planning a campaign to boost travel. Mr Andrew Harvey, InterCity marketing manager, said the Pounds 1m promotion was 'a way to encourage customers who were forced into seeking other means of transport to come back to the railway, and our way of saying thank you to customers for putting up with the disruption throughout the dispute'. Up to 250,000 people are expected to take part in the competition, which will be advertised in the press. They will be asked to answer a question and fill in a coupon giving their choice of destination and day and time of travel. InterCity denied that seats would be offered only on trains which nobody wanted to travel on and said all InterCity services would be on offer, including every Pullman service. There will, however, be quotas on the most popular trains. The free seats are being offered on a Tuesday and Wednesday because InterCity offers its fullest service in the week. This may exclude many commuters because they will be at work.</p>

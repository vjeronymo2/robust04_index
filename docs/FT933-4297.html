			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sema shows 38% improvement to Pounds 10.6m SEMA GROUP, the Anglo-French computing services company, yesterday reported a 38 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits excluding profits on disposals. Pre-tax profits before the profit on disposals increased from Pounds 7.73 to Pounds 10.6m in the six months to June 30 on turnover which grew by 19 per cent to Pounds 232.9m (Pounds 195.4m). However, profits were further boosted by a Pounds 4.63m profit on disposals in the latest period and Pounds 20.8m profits on the disposal of discontinued operations in the year-ago period. As a result pre-tax profits under the new FRS 3 accounting rules fell to Pounds 15.2m from Pounds 28.5m and earnings per share dropped from 22.27p to 10.26p. Operating profits from continuing operations increased by 21.6 per cent to Pounds 9.73m (Pounds 8m). The company said that the strategy of focusing on systems integration and facilities management while maintaining a leadership position in key market sectors such as banking, energy, defence 'has proved to be correct.' In addition, the group had entered the second half with a strong order book and looked forward to achieving continued progress in its core businesses. During the first half Sema spent Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 6.3m) on research and development and its book-to-bill ratio improved to 1.14 compared with 1.06 a year earlier. The advance in turnover was led by the group's UK operations which lifted sales by 21.4 per cent to Pounds 103.9m. The group's German, Spanish and Benelux operations all showed declines in turnover at constant exchange rates. The balance sheet was strengthened during the period and the group ended June with net cash of Pounds 17.8m (Pounds 12.3m). The group recorded net interest receipts of Pounds 847,000 compared with net interest payments of Pounds 273,000 in the 1992 period.</p>

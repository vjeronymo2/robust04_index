			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Philips falls into Fl 900m loss PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, swung into heavy losses last year as the deep malaise in consumer electronics forced it to make large provisions for a new round of restructuring. The company is to omit its dividend for the third consecutive year. The 1992 net loss of Fl 900m (Pounds 337m) reflects restructuring provisions of Fl 1.2bn and represents a reversal from the previous year's net profit of Fl 1.1bn. Citing 'unprecedented' conditions on the recession-ridden market for consumer electronics, Philips said it planned to cut 10,000 to 15,000 jobs at its consumer electronics business, its components division and Grundig, its loss-making, 31.6 per cent-owned German affiliate. The latest round of heavy restructuring provisions is the second since Mr Jan Timmer assumed the presidency in mid-1990 and launched his 'Centurion' programme of streamlining the company. Mr Timmer said yesterday that the operation was already proving successful in spite of the return to the red. 'We believe that changes are taking place swiftly and that Centurion is working,' he said. Mr Timmer noted that price declines and currency movements trimmed Fl 1.95bn from turnover, yet operating profit excluding Grundig fell by just Fl 463m. The group made no predictions for 1993, as much depended on prices of consumer electronics and the speed of carrying out restructuring. However, sales were expected to be flat. In 1992, turnover on a comparable basis rose 2 per cent to Fl 58.5bn in spite of a 3 per cent decline in sales prices in local currencies. Consumer electronics, which faced an average price decline of 6 per cent, posted an operating loss of Fl 553m before provisions, compared with an operating profit of Fl 277m the year before. Grundig accounted for Fl 193m of the loss. Overall, Grundig, which until now had been managed at arms length from its Dutch parent, cost Philips Fl 484m in 1992, including Fl 200m in restructuring charges and Fl 63m in fixed dividend payments to the Grundig Foundation in Germany. Lighting was the only one of Philips' four businesses to see an overall improvement last year, with operating profit rising to Fl 972m from Fl 783.</p>

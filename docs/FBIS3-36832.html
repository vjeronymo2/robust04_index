A total of 274 lawmakers voted for creating such a body, 46  voted against, and 20 abstained from voting. The motion was put  forward by Sergey Baburin, the leader of the "Russian Way" Duma  faction and chairman of the All-Russia National Union. In  backing up his proposal, Baburin stressed that the Duma had  neglected "its moral duties to those who died," and until the  circumstances of the events in Moscow last October are properly  investigated, "the blood will be not only on the government but  on the State Duma as well."    Russia's Choice member Gleb Yakunin argued that since a  formal investigation was under way, the motion on a  parliamentary commission should be postponed until the end of  the inquiry.    Stanislav Govorukhin (the Democratic Party) noted that since  the events were being investigated as a crime, it is hardly  possible to assess "the scale of the tragedy, and the political  motives and circumstances that led to the dissolution of  parliament in October 1993."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The first Belgian paratroops have landed at Kigali  airport in Rwanda. Our editorial department has learned this  from an informal but very reliable source. Thus the go-ahead  has been given for the evacuation of our fellow countrymen from  Rwanda. All afternoon the airport remained closed to Belgian  planes. The Rwandan soldiers were blocking the runway with  armored vehicles. The Belgian Embassy had started negotiations  with the Rwandan authorities to have the airport opened,  apparently with success.</p>

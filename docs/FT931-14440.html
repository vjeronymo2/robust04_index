			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Conflict With Iraq: Raids designed to give clear message - Allies leave themselves a wide range of target options for future attacks FOR ALL the signs of rapid military escalation, the three waves of attacks against Iraq by the US and its British and French allies, in the space of less than five days, were all characterised by their limited scale. By not attacking some obvious targets, such as key military installations in central Iraq, the coalition has reserved its options for further action against a recalcitrant President Saddam Hussein. The US has appeared anxious to demonstrate, particularly after the dubious results of the first attack last Wednesday, that it can hit Iraq when and where it chooses. The weapons and targets have been the same as or similar to those of the Gulf war air campaign two years ago. But operations that were combined during the six weeks of attacks in early 1991 have been carried out separately. The allies want their action to be clearly seen as a specific response to Iraqi acts of defiance: movement of missiles in patrolled regions, stalling over UN inspections and unauthorised forays into Kuwaiti territory to retrieve material. A further echo of the 1991 war is the combination of war-like rhetoric from Baghdad and unwillingness in practice to engage the US-led allies in combat. This is frustrating to attackers seeking to destroy air defences since their tactics are geared to homing-in on targeting radars and to air-to-air combat. The main action yesterday morning was against two Iraqi air defence sites where Wednesday's attack was incomplete: al-Najaf, on the 32nd parallel, which forms the border of the southern no-fly zone, and al-Samawa, just inside that line and further to the east. The allies have clearly been at pains to try to measure their action to make it commensurate with Iraqi challenges to UN authority and have also sought to minimise the risk to their own personnel. According to UK officials, 43 allied aircraft took part in yesterday's action in southern Iraq, including 29 US and British attack aircraft and US and French fighters. This was considerably fewer than took part in last Wednesday's night attack against eight sites. In neither action did the allies attack air bases further to the north from which Iraqi aircraft have infringed the no-fly zone in recent weeks, The cruise missile attack on Sunday against an engineering complex outside Baghdad, alleged to have produced nuclear-related equipment, is seen as having more political than military significance, as a demonstration of US fire-power. It involved more than 30 Tomahawk missiles fired from warships in the Gulf and the Red Sea and was the only time these weapons have been used, except in the Gulf war. The decision to return to sites in southern Iraq can be seen partly as a bid to restore US military pride after criticism over the failure to destroy some of the targets last week. The targets did not include the al-Amarah facility assigned to the RAF last Wednesday. The RAF said yesterday that a headquarters building at Al-Amarah had been completely destroyed by laser-guided bombs dropped by British Tornados, and an intercept control facility was probably put out of operation. It remained to be seen if Iraq still possessed operational facilities of this kind for co-ordinating its air defences in the south. Officials warned that Iraqi forces would still be able to operate some anti-aircraft systems independently of the centralised control systems. Further attacks in the northern no-fly zone focused on surface-to-air missile radars and anti-aircraft guns. This followed incidents in which radars locked on to allied aircraft, including two UK Jaguars flying yesterday on a reconnaissance mission from their base in south-eastern Turkey, which also came under fire from anti-aircraft artillery. An Iraqi MiG-23, shot down by a US F-16 in northern Iraq on Sunday, was the second such incident, a MiG-21 having been downed on December 27. Allied officials said they had no indication that Iraq had fired any missile towards the Arabian peninsula. This followed one report yesterday morning suggesting that a Scud missile might have been fired at the Saudi base of Dhahran and been shot down. Use of a Scud missile would constitute the most serious of any provocation by the Iraqis in the recent confrontation. Under the terms of its 1991 ceasefire Iraq had to declare all its missiles able to reach targets more than 90 miles away, and these were scheduled for destruction. However, Baghdad is believed to be harbouring an unknown number of Scud missiles from its previous Soviet-supplied stockpile.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Brussels ban on shipping lines 'cartel' The European Commission yesterday blocked the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (TAA), a shipping 'conference' which set cargo rates and capacity levels across the north Atlantic, because it infringed European Union competition rules. The decision represents a victory for exporters who complained the agreement had led to excessive charges for shipping container cargoes and a defeat for the 15 large shipping lines which set up the agreement in 1992. The ruling is, however, only the first stage in resolving this dispute because the shipowners established a modified arrangement, known as the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement (TACA), in July. Earlier this month they made a further concession by offering to remove capacity constraints from the TACA. But shippers, companies which export goods across the Atlantic, said this was simply a delaying tactic and threatened legal action against the European Commission if it did not speedily issue a ruling on both agreements. A second objection to the TAA/TACA - that they set rates for containers on their land journey to the port, thereby increasing costs - is still rejected by the shipowners. A decision on the TACA is expected within the next few weeks. The British Shippers' Council, representing exporters, said the commission's ruling established an important principle which would have implications for similar conference agreements covering trade with the Far East and Africa. 'This underlines the fact that European industry has been unnecessarily damaged over the past two years,' said Mr Chris Welsh, head of the council. Shipping rates rose by an average 50 per cent in 1993 and between 10 and 15 per cent this year, he added. Shipowners involved in the TAA had been expecting the commission ruling but hope that the TACA ruling will be in their favour. They were last night still awaiting full details of the commission decision. If the TACA is also rejected, however, there could be a return to lower transatlantic shipping rates and a resumption of the losses which plagued this route in the late 1980s. The TAA/TACA groups 15 large shipping lines which account for 85 per cent of sailings across the north Atlantic. It was introduced to stem considerable losses by the shipping lines and its members include Nedlloyd, Maersk, P&amp;O, AP Moeller and Hapag-Lloyd. Exporters say these losses were exaggerated and the conference has been used to push through excessive rate increases.</p>

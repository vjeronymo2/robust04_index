			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / The Local Government Commission: Cost of Pounds 8m council study angers critics / A look at whether spending on the review paid off Sir John Banham said yesterday that the Local Government Commission's Pounds 8m budget for this year was 'money well spent'. Many disagree with him. Labour yesterday described the commission's review of local authority structure as 'a waste of time and money', while Professor Michael Clarke of Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government Studies said the 'entire remit the commission was given was flawed'. Sir John argued that by consulting widely and expensively - with questionnaires sent to every household in the areas for which proposals were announced yesterday - the commission had avoided what could have been 'unpopular expensive mistakes' in six counties. 'If we had pressed ahead with our recommendations without listening to local people we would be recommending transitional costs of the order of Pounds 135m,' he said. Sir John added that the commission's Pounds 8m budget was spread over 32 counties, so reviewing each had cost only about Pounds 250,000. This was 'minuscule' compared with the overall annual English local government budget of about Pounds 40bn. Prof Clarke described this argument as 'incredible' and said it would have been better not to spend any money at all. Critics of the review also pointed out that Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, last year proposed to abandon the review except in counties where a sizeable proportion of local residents signed petitions asking for change. This could have averted all expenditure by the commission in counties such as Oxfordshire, where substantial opposition to change was found. The costs of the review go beyond the commission's own budget. According to Prof Clarke, long-term planning in the shire counties and districts had been virtually shelved for the last two years as local authorities devoted all their energies to the review. The financial cost in terms of lost opportunities was 'if not incalculable, then certainly enormous', he said. Councils had been attempting to introduce the council tax and prepare for compulsory competitive tendering of white-collar services. Officials of the national local authority associations say the review has taken up 'at least 95 per cent' of their time, while work on other topics has been abandoned. Further, both districts and counties have launched expensive publicity campaigns of their own. Districts claim that county councils such as Essex and Nottinghamshire spent as much as Pounds 150,000 on publicity campaigns about the review, and have made official complaints to the Audit Commission, the watchdog for local government expenditure. Sir John's commission has also complained about districts' expenditure. For example, in Derbyshire, one of the first counties to be reviewed, all the districts hired consultants to advise on their public relations strategy in dealing with the review, while all the district councils in Surrey hired CSL, the managed services division of Touche Ross, to help prepare their submission on the review. Several counties recommended for abolition earlier in the process have sought judicial review of the decisions, at a cost of around Pounds 100,000 each. The High Court has rejected every attempt so far to overturn the commission's recommendations, but the attempts continue. Humberside said yesterday that it would seek judicial review of Mr Gummer's announcement that it should be abolished. In those areas where Sir John recommended change yesterday, he believes there will be a big bill, which must eventually be paid by local council-tax payers. In total, he estimates the cost of reorganising Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire at between Pounds 27m and Pounds 35m. Also, reorganisation will create additional annual costs of between Pounds 2m and Pounds 12m. Sir John said: 'Any reorganisation costs more and delivers less than its proponents suggest.' Prof Clarke agreed, saying the 'overwhelming' evidence from previous reorganisations was that setting up new authorities would cause high transitional costs which could not be recovered by later annual savings. Business leaders share these concerns. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, described the reorganisation as an 'expensive' hobby for the government. But the cross-party Association of District Councils refuses to slacken its own lobbying effort, and has asked for an 'urgent' meeting with the prime minister. The association wants the government to reject the commission's proposals. That would mean requiring the commission to start its review again from scratch. Yesterday, there was little or no sign of political support for such a move.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Travel: A new light on France The people of Ailly-Sur-Noye, 16km south of the French town of Amiens, are presenting a history lesson with a difference, writes Marian Edmunds. On five weekends every year, the history of the region spanning 15 epochs is relived through a son et lumiere, one of 54 such productions across France. The action takes place on a meadow by a lake but spills over to an island and beyond to a windmill and the forest fringe. So atmospheric and entrancing are the music and the lights that a limited grasp of French is not an impairment. In seven years, Ailly-Sur-Noye's slickly-produced spectacle has come to be regarded as one of France's best, second only to that of Le Puy-du-Fou in the Vendee region in eastern France. Ten years ago the Ailly show was just a dream for Dominique Martens, a young bank clerk, who was not discouraged by those who said it was impossible to have a son et lumiere without a cathedral or castle. More than 650 local people participate, each making several costume changes during the night. Twenty horses also appear. It is possible to attend the Ailly show as part of a weekend break from London, for the village is only 100 miles south of Calais. It is staged on Fridays and Saturdays from August 27. Amiens Cathedral also runs sound and light performances, some in English. Nearer to Paris is the Meaux Seine-et-Marne spectacle - June, late August and early September - while also worth catching are the spectacles of Flagnac and Saint-Fargeau. Most shows utilise a castle or cathedral. Tickets for Ailly-Sur-Noye cost FFr70 for adults, FFr40 for children under 12 and FFr60 when part of a group 30 or more strong. They can be reserved at Terre de Picardie, 80250 Ailly-Sur-Noye, tel: (33) 22 41 06 90. Information on dates and locations of spectacles can be had from the Federation National Des Fetes et Spectacles Historique, Hotel-de-Ville de Beauvais 60000, tel: (33) 44 79 40 09.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour party 'must grasp initiative' LABOUR MUST champion a new relationship between society and the individual which embraces public intervention but safeguards individual freedoms, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said last night. Mr Blair, in a lecture intended to help shape a clear identity and new agenda for Labour, said the party had the opportunity to grasp the ideological initiative and provide a lead for a country which had lost its sense of purpose and direction. Giving the tenth Arnold Goodman charity lecture in London, Mr Blair set out 'new principles' by which British society should be governed and the ways in which Labour should embody them. In calling for the adoption of 'enduring, lasting principles applied for a new generation', he rejected the public versus private sector battle, claiming the left had undervalued individual responsibility while the right had ignored the influence of social conditions. Mr Blair said he wanted to see 'a new concept of citizenship in which rights and responsibilities go together and where we cease to posit an entirely false choice between social and personal responsibility'. The purpose of economic and social policy, he said, should be to extend opportunity, remove the underlying causes of social alienation and also take tough measures to ensure that the chances extended to people were taken up. Outlining new principles of public intervention and action, he called for the creation of 'a genuine partnership between public and private sector', the purpose of which would be to intervene to enhance individual economic opportunity and rebuild the country's economic base.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] As we informed you earlier in the bulletin, Mr.  Hashemi-Rafsanjani today inspected three exhibitions in  connection with the electricity, mining, construction, and  gemstone industries, and also the projects of the Science  Academy of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The exhibitions were  set up on Tehran's permanent exhibition site for international  trade fairs.    At the end of his inspection tour, the president was  interviewed by our correspondent and expressed his views on  these exhibitions.    [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] The outstanding  features  of the electricity industry exhibition were too many to be  mentioned in this interview. However, one of the features which  interested me greatly was to witness the result of a move which  started two years ago with the aim of enabling us to manage all  aspects of the electricity industry on our own -- such as  production, transfer, and distribution. With regard to the  distribution of electricity, we are almost fully self-sufficient  in that everything to do with all 20 posts [as heard] is being  done inside the country.    As far as the transfer of electricity is concerned, we are  also largely self-sufficient. In production too, there has been  a major move during the last two years, and now we are able to  build everything which is feasible and cost-efficient inside the  country and meet the needs of our hydroelectric, steam, gas, and  compound cycle power stations. [passage omitted] [end recording]    The president stressed: With the plans we have, during the  next five or six years Iran will become one of the main centers  for the construction of various types of power stations. Such  an achievement deserves praise, and one must really pay tribute  to the efforts of the experts in the field. He added:  Experience shows that our choice, that is the construction of  dams and hydroelectric power stations, was a right choice which  has proved beneficial to us. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US super-salesmanship discounts human rights When the dust settled on last week's whirlwind business mission to China led by Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, it was clear that a fractious Sino-US relationship had been jolted in new directions far removed from the human rights preoccupations of the early days of the Clinton administration. While critics looked askance on Mr Brown's old-fashioned cheer-leading on behalf of American companies, the US official was proclaiming a 'new era' in Sino-US relations. 'Commercial diplomacy' would now be paramount in guiding a difficult relationship. After fiddling over China policy for its first year, the administration appears to have decided that, in spite of its misgivings about human rights abuses, it would have to compete more aggressively with its competitors in Europe and Asia for a share of the world's fastest growing market. How far Washington's emphasis on super-salesmanship will prove compatible with other objectives in its relations with Beijing remains to be seen. At one point in a speech organised by the US-China Business Council, Mr Brown sounded more like a football coach than a government official. 'We intend to compete in this market, and we intend to win,' he said to applause from hundreds of American businessmen, including the chief executive officers of 25 large corporations. Some of these corporation heads had signed deals with the Chinese contributing to a Dollars 6bn package of contracts and memoranda of understanding concluded during the Brown visit. It is hard to imagine a Republican administration embracing with greater enthusiasm commercial possibilities in China. Mr Clinton, who had accused Mr George Bush of 'coddling dictators' in Beijing, has clearly undergone something of a change of heart since heady days on the presidential campaign trail. In Hong Kong, Mr Robin Munro of Human Rights Watch/Asia said the Brown mission 'vividly symbolises the drastic downplaying of human rights issues in US foreign policy. Basically, China has won hands down on human rights.' But defenders of the Clinton administration's new approach to China say that critics have misconstrued the purpose of the Brown mission, and misrepresented American policy. They note that during the presidential campaign, Mr Clinton undertook to place commercial issues at the centre of foreign policy concerns. This approach had yielded the successful completion of negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), and the Uruguay Round which had cleared the way for the establishment of the World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Clinton administration had been edging away from the crude weapon of Most Favoured Nation privileged trade access to the American market ever since a review of China policy in the second half of last year resolved to 'halt the downward spiral' of Sino-US relations. The disastrous visit to China in March of Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state - China marked the occasion by harassing dissidents  - added further impetus to moves within the administration to 'de-link' human rights from annual MFN renewal. Mr Clinton's announcement on May 27 that he was renewing MFN more or less unconditionally - token sanctions were retained - was the culmination of the policy review begun in the middle of last year. But administration officials insist that in spite of charges that the administration has 'flip-flopped' in its China policy, there remains ample scope for a tough and principled stand on trade and other issues, including human rights. These officials note that China and the US, whose trade reached Dollars 39.3bn last year, are locked in difficult discussions on a range of questions. These include intellectual property rights (IPR) infringements; arguments over such issues as the transfer of missile technology; textile quotas; imports of agricultural products; access to China for service organisations such as banks; and Gatt. Washington announced in June that China had been placed on 'priority watch' for six months under special 301 congressional legislation over continuing IPR abuses. US officials in Beijing say that while China has armed itself with the necessary rules and regulations to deal with infringements, enforcement is lax. But in the end the real test of US resolve in its dealings with China will come in negotiations on Beijing's application to re-join the Gatt. The US has been the harbinger of a tough stance on conditions for China's Gatt entry, arguing that a fast-growing economic power should be obliged to pay a substantial price for admission. US negotiators insist that China be obliged to accord the same market access privileges to its fellow Gatt members as those it will receive itself. Beijing is arguing, however, that because China is a developing country it should be granted special privileges for a lengthy transition phase.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Brown's Booty: the main deals with China  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company              Venture                          Amount (Dollars) Wing Group           LNG-fuelled power                2,200m                      plant: joint venture AES Corp             Power generation:                1,500m                      joint venture Entergy Corp/        Power plant extension:           1,000m Lippo Group          memorandum of understanding AT&amp;T                 Telecommunications: contract       500m Westinghouse         Power turbines and                 450m                      other equipment: contract General Electric     Power plant extension:             220m                      joint venture TRW Inc              Television de-scramblers:          100m                      contract TRW Inc              Engine valves:                      n/a                      memorandum of understanding IBM Inc              Data network: joint venture         20m Pitney Bowes         Postal equipment: contract          20m Sprint               Information systems: contract        2m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

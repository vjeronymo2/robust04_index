			<p>BFN     [Article by Tong Zhiguang (0157 1807 1639): "My Opinion of  Strategy for Foreign Trade Development in 1990's"]    [Text] Conglomeraton is one of the major characteristics in  the present international situation of economic relations and  trade. The process of "integration" of the world economy will be  a long-term one, but we can clearly see that competition in  international commodity market is increasingly fierce, and that  the situation for superior commodities to win out and inferior  ones to be eliminated through competition is extremely clear.  This is one of the important characteristics after the Cold  War. High-quality and inexpensive commodities carry all before  them, and low quality, high cost, low technological content, and  low added-value commodities gradually retreat from the market.  This is an inevitable outcome of the function of objective  economic laws that admit of no sentiment. Any people or country  that wants to occupy a place in the market full of fierce  competition, especially those who want to occupy a larger share,  must realize, understand, and control such a law. From an  economic point of view, such a law is objective and impartial.  This is the genuine force behind international market  competition--comparative advantage.    Out of consideration of "being prepared for danger in times  of peace", theoretical and academic circles are now discussing  the strategy for foreign trade development in the 1990's. No  doubt this is extremely far-sighted. The author believes that  only by studying this question at several levels can we draw a  correct conclusion.  <H5>  I. Study Practical Problems by Integrating Theory With </H5> Practice    We must first see clearly that foreign trade has entered a  new stage either in the world or in China. The characteristics  of the new stage are: Machinery and electronics products are  highly technological, and consumer goods are high-grade.  Intellectual property, visible, invisible, and service trades  are all included in the large context of foreign trade. Foreign  trade in its original sense can no longer cover the current  foreign trade activities. The sphere of study of foreign trade  has obviously been enlarged, and relations between various forms  of foreign trade have become one of the focal points of study.    Second is the integration of foreign economic relations with  foreign trade. It is very difficult to separate so-called pure  foreign economic relations from pure foreign trade. Under many  circumstances, foreign trade export is no longer the material  export of commodities. It may possibly be invisible export of  funds, technology, and labor, that is to say, production centers  have been moved to sales markets. China's attraction to foreign  investments lies in the huge sales market.    China's foreign economic and technological assistance is of  such a nature, but it is a pity that it has never been  consciously linked with foreign trade, or they have even been  seriously separated. The state encourages, through policies,  close integration of the two, which is a big step forward under  reform. We can already feel the economic performance brought  about by such integration.    Third is foreign trade legislation and policy guidance. When  we have the above basic understanding, it does not mean that  foreign trade work will certainly succeed. We must have a whole  set of legislation for standardization and a whole set of  policies for guidance, encouragement, or restraint. Here in the  first place is the basic legislation adopted by the National  People's Congress--the "Foreign Trade Law" and related laws  enacted on anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The second  line is industrial policies, and country and regional policies.    The most important goal of foreign trade legislation, of  course, is to standardize the operational behavior of foreign  trade operators, so that foreign trade will develop healthily  according to legal regulations. Foreign trade legislation is  also an important means for ensuring and safeguarding China's  interests after resumption of GATT status.    Primary level [zu fu ji 4371 3637 4787] basic legislation is  all the more a powerful weapon in trade negotiations. A task of  top priority is to speed up legislation, so that there are laws  to abide by for the cause of vigorously developing foreign trade.    Industrial policy is the basis of foreign trade policy and  the latter is an extension of the former. It is not difficult  for western countries to understand such a logic. This is  because their economies have always been export-oriented, their  domestic markets and foreign markets have been linked together  since World War II, and their industrial policies have taken  into account the needs of both domestic and foreign markets. In  China, the system of planned economy had been carried out for  years, domestic and foreign markets were seriously separated,  and even the international market was artificially divided into  so-called "two parallel world markets." This made China's  industrial policies mainly emphasize domestic needs, with a  small amount of exports to the Soviet Union and East European  countries, without being able to go beyond the big circle. This  has resulted in the fact that the technological level of China's  products has lagged behind that of the world's advanced level  for a long time, that China's export products are not up to  grade, and that China can neither make full use of two markets  nor two kinds of resources, leading to the situation of relying  for years on a small number of products for foreign exchange  earnings. China has taken a big step forward, we should say,  toward a unified international market in recent years, but there  is still quite a long way to go. It seems that it is necessary  to join tracks finally with the international market and take  part in a unified international market by "resumption of GATT  status."    Fourth, big powers have become increasingly dependent on  foreign economic relations and trade. For years in the past,  there existed a view in international economic circles that  foreign trade was not so important for big powers, but very  important for small and island countries deficient of resources.  Therefore, for them there is no question of the validity of the  slogan "to build the country by trade," rather it is a tenet  they must try to pursue. This has been confirmed by the  fantastic achievements of Japan, the Asian "four small dragons",  and even Switzerland, among other places.    Modern developments have shown that this point of view has  the defect of being biased. The extent of big power dependence  on foreign trade is ever intensified, which is even linked to  social stability and employment. The establishment of GATT and  many rounds of trade negotiations have indicated the importance  attached by various countries to foreign trade. The proportion  of foreign trade in the GNP of various countries is gradually  going up. Such a trend becomes more obvious in the process of  integration of the world economy. Moreover, trade between big  powers (including blocs) is in fact playing the role of a  locomotive in bringing along the development of the world  economy. This is dominated by a fundamental economic  law--developed economies, in particular, rapidly developing  economies, need big markets, and they want to break through  national boundaries and enter broader areas of activities;  conversely, opportunities provided by the international market  in turn promote the development of their own economy. The  reality of China's economy is an example.    Fifth, commodity production is the crux. The front part of  foreign trade is production, and the back is consumption.  Foreign trade is circulation. Foreign economic and  technological cooperation integrates the production process  directly with foreign trade. What we emphasize is commodities,  and not production under the circumstances of self-sufficient  natural economy. Such production formation exists in regions  where a commodity economy is undeveloped, and it can only be  regarded as reproduction. The commodity economy we are talking  about is large production under the circumstances of a market  economy. The products turned out are not for our own  consumption, but for meeting the market needs. Such production  is precisely the basis of foreign trade. Now the problem we must  solve is that China's production enterprises are not simply to  meet the needs of domestic markets, but of both domestic and  foreign markets, which is the goal of our work. This puts forth  high requirements on the quality of commodities. I have always  maintained the carrying out at home and abroad of a unified  quality standard, and we cannot support foreign trade  development by a "special faovrs" [xiao zao 1420 3501] method.  There is no developed foreign trade without highly developed  commodity production.    Sixth, the level of merchandizing is an important factor of  foreign trade. A conceptual error to which ordinary people are  easily subject is that general production is regarded as  commodity production, and commodity production is mistaken for  highly merchandized production. So-called merchandizing refers  to intrinsic quality, production technology, mode of production,  exterior design, packaging, stable quality, and unified  specifications. Without quality, there is no commodity  production, and without quantitative scale, there can't be  commodity production either.    Seventh, trades which render services to foreign trade  require major development. After the founding of new China, we  have built on a preliminary basis trades that render services to  foreign trade. After forty years of development, they have  attained an initial scale, but there is still a gap in what is  required. The building of wharves and ports, the capacity of  land and sea transportation, and the means to promote exports,  such as banking and insurance, are still far from meeting the  objective needs of foreign trade development. Among them  banking support in particular still lags behind need and is a  bottleneck that restrains foreign trade exports, directly  hampering the growth of export trade.  <H5>  II. Discover, Safeguard, and Create Comparative Advantages </H5>   If we review the history of international trade,  particularly  the history of various countries in "building the country by  trade," we discover some common characteristics. These include:  A long-term development strategy, necessary legislation by the  state, a whole set of supportive policies, correct industrial  guidance, and high quality commodity production that meets the  needs of both domestic and foreign markets. These are the keys  to realizing the strategy for foreign trade development, and  other means are factors that ensure the realization of strategic  principles.    Now the problem is how to organize and put into effect high  quality and high grade commodity production. The author  believes that to discover and create comparative advantages is  the key to solving such a problem.    There are always some advantages for a country or a region  in  commodity production. The responsibility of operators is to be  good at discovering and catching hold of these advantages and  making full use of them. These advantages may be expressed in  relatively cheap labor, inexpensive raw materials, or highly  efficient production. Overall performance requires low  production costs and strong market competitive power. We have  repeatedly seen in practice that comparative advantages change  and move. If we cannot consciously safeguard advantages, they  slip away unconsciously. This is a problem to which  policymakers and operators should pay attention at all times.  Therefore, to safeguard comparative advantage is also a  continuous process of improvement and enhancement.    China is a country with a large population, vast  territory, and rich resources, which objectively provide  advantages for China to develop commodity production, and China  has ample conditions to give play to these comparative  advantages. The key is to understand and distinguish where the  advantages are after all and to set correct policies.    China has a clear labor advantage, and this advantage has  been and is being brought into play. Since reform and opening  up, the reason investors from outside China have kept pouring in  is that they set store by China's cheap labor and the huge  potential market. Labor intensive commodities with a ready  market have developed at high speed within a short period of  time. There has been a certain degree of blindness, and there  have appeared chaotic phenomena of repeated importation, but it  is an indisputable fact that the export of toys, TV sets,  clothing, home electrical appliances, tape-recorders,  audio-visual equipment which has been growing by leaps and  bounds for years soon presents a scene of prosperity. Moreover,  inaccessibility of market information in China and the  phenomenon of production divorced from marketing instantly  become things of the past. The general slogan of market economy  "basing production on sales prospects" soon became a reality.  China has become a big power in export trade in the sphere of  these commodities. Though not the only country attaining  excellence, China has become a decisive market force.  China-made toys occupy one-third, and shoes, socks, and  stockings one-fourth of the U.S. market. We have to admit that  these are fantastic achievements. There is a fact which is  often neglected here: The introduction of labor intensive  commodities has promoted rapid development of industry as a  whole at home, and organization, management, and sales channels  have entered a new stage. It is difficult to overestimate the  significance of this example which is more significant to a  certain extent.    The comparative advantage of labor has indeed brought the  greatest benefit to economic performance in China. China's  textile export, especially of clothing, occupies an important  place in export trade, taking up almost over one-fourth of total  export volume. This is the direct outcome of China's making  full use of the comparative advantage of cheap labor. We should  not only continue giving play to this advantage, but should also  raise it to a higher level--a new stage of high technological  content, high added-value, and high efficiency.    However, we must face up to the problem that with the  building of a market economy, the raising of the standard of the  people, and prices rise, the cost of labor will also go up. In  recent years the export of yarn and cloth as raw materials has  met with difficulties. Beside other reasons, increases in the  cost of labor and delays in the heightening of labor  productivity are important reasons. Therefore, to continue  giving play to comparative advantage, we must raise the grade of  products, and speedily heighten labor productivity. If we still  cannot achieve the goal after making efforts, then there is only  one choice: Let this comparative advantage slip away, turn over  a new leaf, and explore other advantages. This is an objective  economic law which cannot be controlled subjectively.    Traditionally, another of china's comparative advantages is  abundant raw materials and low prices. But from the point of  view of market, this advantage is quite fragile. Due to  climate, supply and demand, and cost, prices may rise or fall.  China's present situation is that after an end to pricing  policies which have been manipulated for years, prices of raw  materials generally have gone up, thus gradually reducing the  role of this advantage.    The cruel reality with which we are faced at present is how  to safeguard the original comparative advantages and how to  create new comparative advantages. Advantages can be created,  and such creations are involve fierce competition. This is a  road developed countries have down already. Only through  concerted efforts on the part of the government (through  policies), production departments, and foreign trade management  departments can the creation of new advantages be completed.  Now the situation is that the government has worked out a  number of policies for encouraging exports and foreign trade  management departments have take great initiatives. The most  important thing is that production departments must understand  that the survival of an enterprise rest in its rising head and  shoulders above others in competition in both domestic and  foreign markets and that the core of competition is human  resources and technology. Only when this problem is overcome  can production be upgraded, commodities of high technological  content and best quality produced, and comparative advantages  created. Therefore, the present policy should mainly be to pay  attention to the production of commodities which are of high  quality and high technological content. I believe that  machinery and electronics products in a broad sense and complete  sets of equipment have potential. Agriculture that earns  foreign exchange, audio-visual equipment, high-grade clothing,  high-grade shoes, socks, and stockings, and even low cost  consumer goods subject to wear and tear are still areas that  China should strive to develop continuously.  <H5>  III. Financial Support Is the Motive Force for Major Foreign </H5> Trade Development    If we make a comprehensive survey of the history of the  world's foreign trade development, we can discover that foreign  trade is the natural outcome of economic development and  progress, and that it in turn also promotes the development of  the economy. The history of World War I and World War II all  the more explains that when the economy of some countries  develops to a certain degree, their need for world market can  get to such an extent as to unleash war at all costs to redivide  the world market. The history of the world's foreign trade  development has also proved another fact: To promote export,  the state always introduces a number of policies to "encourage  export and restrict import" to support foreign trade, of which  most commonly seen are tax policy and financial policy,  complemented by non-trade administrative means.    For decades when the planned economy was carried out,  China exercised a system of control over foreign trade and plans  were centers. With plans, everything is set, and foreign trade  was supported by various fields. Under the environment of the  time when the economy was not quite developed, plans did play  their proper role. Today, we are carrying out the system of a  socialist market economy, and markets becomes the subject of  economic life. Obviously, the original foreign trade system must  change with changes in the economic system. The characteristics  of such changes are abandoning the original management method of  mandatory plans, using necessary administrative means to promote  the building of market mechanisms, and standardizing foreign  trade activities according to law on the basis of a number of  legal regulations. So- called economic law consists, in the  first place, of the law of supply and demand, the law of  competition, and the law of superior things winning out and  inferior ones being eliminated through competition.    It requires investment to take the road of stepping up the  strength of competition, carrying out technological  transformation, and turning out upgraded products. With foreign  trade developed to the present stage, the sharpest problem which  arises is the integration of foreign trade with financial  capital; in a certain sense, this is also the natural extension  of integration of industry with financial capital.  Unfortunately we have been a little late to understand this a  law, which has affected the growth rate of China's exports and  delays the renovation of China's export product mix.  Agricultural, sideline, native, and special products that  contend in the domestic market for sources of goods have long  been China's major export commodities. Conversely, products of  low production cost and high technological content hardly  developed their strength for a long time. If we compare  ourselves with South Korea, one of the "four small dragons", it  forms a striking contrast. It took a very short time for it to  change from the primary export stage to a high-level export  stage, and the export of its technological products, especially  automobiles, gave it an advantage within a short period of time,  making it a major export force. Even such competitive opponents  as Japan also cry out in alarm: "Terrific!"    One may well say that a Chinese import-export bank should be  set up and emerge as the times require. Although some people  describe it as "it comes out at long last after thousands of  calls," but it is born after all! It would undoubtedly increase  the potential for the developing cause of China's foreign trade.  <H5>  IV. Make Full Use of the Opportunity Brought by the </H5> "Resumption of GATT" Status, and Build Up the Concept of a Big  Unified Market    In modern world economic development, Karl Marx's thesis  that  markets have no national boundaries has been repeatedly proved  to be absolutely correct, and contemporary developments have  further testified to the existence of this law. People have  been compelled to take consciously or unconsciously various  measures to promote the realization of a big unified market.  The European Economic Community, the North America Free Trade  Zone, and various proposed regional trade blocs do not just make  no distinction between national boundaries, but also want to  achieve a high degree of unification. As an outcome of the  Uruguay Round talks, the world trade organization is a new  attempt at these efforts.    China's point of view of building up a big unified market is  related to traditional domestic and foreign markets. In fact,  with China's resumption of GATT status, we must write a full  stop, or put an end to our traditional concepts. By then, we  must take the world as the stage in commodity production and  sales markets. If we work efficiently, it will pave the way for  China to move toward world markets; if we are not  self-conscious, and our measures are not efficient, it may lead  to practice being in position and concepts not being in position  with a resulting lack of vitality in the face of a vast big  world market. We may be open in the domestic market, but cannot  make full use of world market. We are only put to much trouble  by world market, but cannot enjoy its benefits. This raises the  question of how to make full use of the opportunity brought by  the "resumption of GATT" status. The "resumption of GATT"  status will bring China, I believe, the following opportunities:  A vast world market, a favorable and equal trade environment,  MFN treatment in general and on a multilateral basis, full  enjoyment of a generalized preferential system (so long as per  capita national income is low, and the developing country status  remains unchanged, China is entitled to such treatment), the  right to participate in working out trade regulations, the right  to protect young industries, the right to obtain the latest  information on economic relations and trade, the right to  protect intellectual property, and other rights.    China's rapid economic development inevitably puts forward  new requirements on foreign market, and the "resumption of GATT"  status precisely fits in with this need. It is a law that a  powerful economy inevitably leads to powerful foreign trade. We  must comply with and understand this law, and use it to serve  our purposes.    It goes without saying that the "resumption of GATT" status  will bring China opportunities and also require China to carry  out commitments, which are no more than appropriately opening up  the market and getting prepared for competitions. But one thing  that makes people feel comfortable is that various countries  benefit rather than are harmed to a varying degree after joining  GATT. I think this has something to do with the age in which we  live. Various countries are making efforts to develop their own  economies, and join GATT after having made certain achievements.  In other words, they join GATT when they have the conditions to  make full use of GATT's favored treatments. This is even more  so China's situation.    As for competition, we should look at it from the positive  side, and see that competition yields achievement. China's over  90 billion dollars in exports last year has proved that China  has the ability to compete and succeed. As to the impact on some  of China's industries, I think as long as we are fully prepared,  take the world as the stage, improve quality and efficiency, and  give play to comparative advantages, it is fully possible for  China to win out in competition. If some of our products are in  fact "counterfeit and inferior," they should be eliminated,  shouldn't they? It is fully possible for Chinese enterprises,  after 15 years of tempering through reform and opening up, to  participate and win out in international market competition,  pushing China's economic level to a higher stage.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Clinging to the wreckage ERNEST BEVIN, when foreign secretary, once memorably remarked of the Council of Europe: 'If you open that Pandora's Box you never know what Trojan 'orses will jump out.' Similar, if less earthy, advice is now on offer from the European political and financial establishment, after a turbulent week on the exchanges, about the risks of reopening the debate on monetary union or prising apart the existing alignment of currencies in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). As Community finance ministers prepare for a damage limitation session next weekend in Bath, they would do well to remember that Pandora was a headstrong girl (and that the hot spring water that they will be invited to imbibe at this otherwise charming west country spa is thoroughly sulphurous). Many in the markets are already convinced that it is too late to prevent the Trojan horses taking a joyful jump. Much of the turmoil last week came after opinion polls suggested that the French might vote no to Maastricht in the forthcoming referendum. Yet the damage has arguably been done already. Given that an overwhelming yes vote is now almost inconceivable in the country that spearheaded the move to Emu, the proponents of Maastricht appear to lack an adequate mandate. That, certainly, appears to be the verdict of the Ecu bond market, which has always been regarded as a bellwether for Maastricht's ratification prospects. After the treaty was signed, Ecu bonds stood at a premium to their underlying currency components. As the prospect for monetary union waned, Ecu bonds went to a discount. Since July the market has gone into spasm and banks have desperately looked for ways of reviving it. But to no avail. The Ecu bond debacle is less than reassuring for Euro-visionaries. But nor does it follow that the countries whose currencies are under pressure will be immediately be taken off the hook. Emu is one thing; the ERM another. And it would be unwise to underestimate the depth of the commitment of Mr John Major's government to this semi-fixed exchange rate system. The game for Europe's finance ministers for the next three weeks will be to keep the ERM show on the road. The only question is whether their contingency plans will be obliged to incorporate a realignment. Their problem is that if the prospect of monetary union has retreated, it will be hard to restore investors' interest in convergence, the bond market equivalent of Gresham's law whereby the most inflation-prone currencies become strong, while the historically strong turn weak. Sir Thomas Gresham was, incidentally, a notorious deflationist who wanted a strong currency to reduce the cost to Elizabeth I of paying off foreign loans, regardless of the consequences for unemployment. How apposite. Without the prospect of Emu the inherent strains of the ERM also become less tolerable. The dealers may have come back in from the window ledges after last week's squall. But being shackled to the world's strongest currency can be relied on to bring more squalls in the absence of policy change - and bigger squalls on any change of US president. Within the ERM itself there is no escape from the fact that the the link to a post-unification D-Mark delivers inappropriate monetary policies to some members, not least Britain, where debt deflation is being addressed, bizarrely, by rising real interest rates. Yet realignment within or devaluation without the ERM would present huge credibility problems for sterling. Their manageability, if it came to that, would depend on what accompanying fiscal and monetary steps the government chose to adopt. The government is hoping that something will turn up - or rather, that the D-Mark will turn down. But if post-war history is any guide the likely outcome is months of turbulence, followed by capitulation to political and market pressure. The outcome for Mr Major, who took Britain into the ERM, and his chancellor Norman Lamont, might be terminal. But the verdict of historians on the prime minister could prove kinder than that of his party. After all, when Sir Isaac Newton, master of the mint, took Britain on to the gold standard in 1717 he hadn't the remotest conception of what he was doing either.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / S Korea ruling party clings to power SOUTH Korea's Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) yesterday regained a shaky grip on power by persuading two independents to join the party, giving it a bare majority following Tuesday's National Assembly election. The DLP originally won 149 seats out of 299 in the poll. However, there are signs that the party could be heading for a split. Rival factions within the party blame each other for the loss of 50 assembly seats. Mr Kim Young Sam, the DLP executive chairman who headed the election campaign, refused to accept responsibility for the party's poor performance. Mr Kim defended his record in a bid to save his chances of becoming the party's nominee in December's presidential election. His opponents within the DLP are demanding his resignation. In an attack on the supporters of President Roh Tae Woo, Mr Kim blamed the government's unsuccessful economic policy, rather than the DLP's election strategy. There has been friction between the Kim and Roh factions within the DLP since Mr Kim's opposition group joined the ruling party in 1990. President Roh and Mr Kim are to meet today to discuss the post-election situation. Mr Kim and his supporters might leave the DLP if he is forced to resign as party co-chairman and be denied the presidential nomination.</p>

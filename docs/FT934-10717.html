			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Bank governor tells businesses to hold margins MR EDDIE GEORGE, the governor of the Bank of England, last night called on businesses to play their part in curbing inflation by generating higher profits through increased output and capacity use, rather than higher prices. In a speech to finance directors in London, he said more than half the recent rise in manufacturing output prices had come from higher margins, measured as the difference between input and output prices. He said that Britain had a realistic prospect, 'if we are wise', of achieving non-inflationary growth 'that can be sustained through the rest of the decade'. But businesses had to play a part in this. 'If we can persuade you that we will deliver sustained, non-inflationary growth, I would hope we might then see businesses seeking to generate profits more through higher volumes and increased utilisation of capital, and less through higher margins,' he said. Mr George pointed out that UK businesses had come through the recent recession in a far better state than that of the early 1980s. He said the pre-tax real rate of return on capital for non-North Sea companies was well above the average level of the past 20 years. It never fell below 6 per cent in the latest recession and had already recovered to above 8 per cent. By contrast, the same pre-tax return fell to nearly 2 per cent in 1981 and only recovered to 8 per cent by 1986. The governor said he welcomed the large gains in productivity and cost reduction that had contributed to higher profits. However, Mr George warned that businesses might still be looking for returns more suited to a high-inflation environment than a non-inflationary world. He indicated that without greater restraint on margins the Bank would find it less easy to prolong the economic upswing by holding nominal interest rates down. The Treasury reported yesterday that recent economic indicators pointed to rising domestic demand with low inflationary pressures. However, a drop in the Central Statistical Office's longer leading index of economic activity, also announced yesterday, could signal a downturn in output about a year from now. A favourable short-term outlook for the UK was confirmed by the CSO's shorter leading index, which is supposed to indicate economic turning points in activity around five months in advance. This sustained an advance which began last autumn, rising 0.8 per cent to 109.1 last month. The longer leading index, which is designed to highlight turning points in the economy 13 months in advance, has declined from a recent high in March, reflecting negative contributions from most of its components since the spring. However, the CSO warned that the data used to compile the latest index was not complete.</p>

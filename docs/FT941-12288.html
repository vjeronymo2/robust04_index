			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: IMI share issue priced at top end of expectations The Italian Treasury has responded to the growing confidence in its privatisation drive by pricing shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI), the latest sell-off, at the top end of expectations. Shares in IMI, the big financial services group which goes on sale today, will be priced at L10,900 each, close to the top of the L9,800 to L11,000 range indicated by the Treasury, and will raise L2,180bn (Dollars 1.29bn). The pricing came alongside new rules from the cabinet limiting the role of shareholder pacts in privatisation issues. Such pacts, which are commonplace in big Italian companies, allow small groups of shareholders to aggregate their holdings and exercise control without necessarily owning more than 50 per cent of a company. The IMI pricing represents a discount of 6.07 per cent on the company's net worth, much tighter than the discount of about 10 per cent offered on Credito Italiano last month. The smaller discount on IMI reflects the Treasury's growing confidence in the issue, in spite of its being the biggest initial public equity offering in Italy. The optimism stems from strong demand from foreign institutions, which will be allocated half the 200m shares on offer. Soundings by S G Warburg, the UK merchant bank co-ordinating the global tranche, have indicated foreign buyers were willing to take at least three times the stock allocated. Analysts expect the Treasury to allocate an additional tranche of almost 19m shares, normally reserved for market stabilisation purposes. If these shares are also sold, the state's stake in IMI will drop to about 27 per cent from over 60 per cent at present. The Treasury has also overcome its initial doubts about IMI's appeal to Italian retail investors, who have been allocated 75m shares. The lavish advertising campaign and the bandwagon effect of the Credito Italiano deal have triggered considerable interest among small investors, as has the generally upbeat sentiment on the bourse. The privatisation campaign will gather pace next month with the sale of the remaining public sector shares in Banca Commerciale Italiana. It was partly with the BCI deal in mind that the cabinet issued its new rules on shareholder pacts. Although the details remain unclear, the regulations call for greater information about the membership and intentions of such pacts in privatisation issues. Members could also be obliged to launch full takeover bids for outstanding shares if they acted in concert in acquiring additional stock after a privatisation.</p>

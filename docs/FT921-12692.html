			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Li Ka-shing buys into Riady family arm MR LI Ka-shing, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, has continued his buying spree in Hong Kong with the acquisition of a large interest in Lippo, a local financial services company controlled by Indonesia's wealthy Riady family. The acquisition, although relatively modest by Mr Li's standards, is seen as significant for future business developments between himself and the Riady family which has extensive interests in Indonesia and Hong Kong and aims to be a force in south-east Asian business. Mr Li's Cheung Kong Holdings has paid HKDollars 100m (USDollars 13m) for a convertible note, exchangeable for 18.9 per cent of Lippo's share capital on or before December 31 1993. In Hong Kong, the Riady family owns a controlling interest in the Hongkong Chinese Bank, and some high profile properties. Lippo has also been in negotiations with the receiver appointed to deal with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International's business in Hong Kong. The Lippo acquisition is Mr Li's ninth in 13 months and the seventh where he has taken an interest in a company via a convertible note. Collectively these deals have been worth more than HKDollars 2bn. In October, Mr Li took 11 per cent of Guoco, a listed financial services group which owns the colony's fourth largest bank.</p>

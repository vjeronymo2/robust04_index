			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Leading Article: To buy or not to buy MILLIONS of individual decisions will be taken today, and over the coming months, in shopping malls and estate agents across Britain. The aggregate effect of these will determine both the timing of economic recovery in the UK, and the electoral chances of the Conservative party. Will consumers buy now or save for a little longer? Worryingly for the government, and for the economic forecasters, the answer is anyone's guess. The uncharacteristically erratic behaviour of British consumers over the past few years accounts in large part for the poor track-record of recent economic forecasts. Back in 1985, economists failed to foresee the sharp fall in saving and rise in borrowing and consumption that followed financial deregulation. Economists were caught out again last summer. Despite buoyant growth in real personal income, an unexpectedly sharp and unforeseen rise in the portion devoted to savings turned a mild downturn into what will be the second-worst recession since the Second World War. The combination of high interest rates, rising inflation and accelerating unemployment provoked consumers to increase their savings as a percentage of disposable income to 10.8 per cent by the end of last year, from a low of 4.5 per cent in 1988. Undeterred, the Treasury has forecast a recovery beginning in the second half of this year. It expects this to be driven by a recovery in consumer spending, which is forecast to rise by 2 1/4 per cent in the first half of next year. Will the Treasury's optimism prove misplaced? There are signs that a recovery in consumer confidence and business confidence has followed the end of the Gulf war, though spring's arrival usually does boost confidence. The rise in the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly confidence indicator suggests recovery will arrive some time in the next six months. Depressing picture Mr Norman Lamont insists that people should focus on these forward-looking confidence indicators. But his advice may reflect less on their reliability than on the depressing picture painted by indicators of the economy's current performance. Such indicators provide scanty support for the chancellor's claim that an economic recovery is 'just round the corner'. Such a recovery will not come from a rise in business investment, as answers to the CBI's question on investment intentions shows. Nor is an export-led recovery in prospect. Companies have been unable to switch production away from the depressed home market, with non-oil export volumes (excluding erratic items) up by only 0.1 per cent in the six months to March 1991, compared with the previous six. Only the personal sector can add something significant to the modest rise in government spending expected this year. Recent signs are not encouraging. New car registrations in April were 24.2 per cent down from last year, while growth in the monetary aggregates remains very low. The rise in retail sales in March was distorted by a rush of durable goods purchases before the budget's increase in VAT took effect, but sales in the previous three months were depressed. Little impact Recent falls in interest rates and in headline inflation will undoubtedly spark some rise in consumer spending. Yet the lags are long. Four rate cuts this year have had little impact so far on the housing market. Nor is next week's fall in headline inflation likely to prompt further interest rate cuts. This is at least what Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, was saying this week when he warned against perceiving 'false dawns' in the fight against inflation. This warning is presumably addressed as much to Downing Street as to the public. Mr Leigh-Pemberton is right to warn. Any significant further cut in interest rates would be unwise until there is clear evidence that average wage settlements and the annual rate of underlying inflation are on a downward path. With UK rates of increase in unit labour costs more than twice as high as in most of continental Europe, further increases in unemployment are also inevitable. A sustained rise in consumer spending is unlikely while unemployment is still rising, especially if it continues to rise particularly rapidly in the south. The borrowing classes are likely to be too frightened. Despite the chancellor's optimism, the UK economy remains in a deep recession, while the prospects for anything better than a limp recovery this year remain poor. The Conservative party may take heart from the fact that its popular support has held up remarkably well. Perhaps the electorate believes Mr Lamont's predictions. He must hope so. For by persuading a nervous public that recovery is, indeed, around the corner, he may turn out to be right after all.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 6 CHARGED IN $70,000 WELFARE FRAUD CASE  </P> <P> Six family members who arrived in San Diego about two years ago from Louisiana  were charged Friday by the district attorney's office with defrauding the  county Department of Social Services of more than $70,000 in welfare benefits  over 13 months.  </P> <P> Investigators say the case represents the largest single ring of suspects ever  charged in such a fraud case.  </P> <P> Two of the defendants were arraigned on a variety of felony charges before San  Diego Municipal Judge Lillian Lim Quon and held in custody on $10,000 bail  each. The two, Daniel Lee, 46, and his wife, Virginia Lee, 41, each pleaded not  guilty.  </P> <P> Two other suspects, Glenda Lee, said to be Daniel and Virginia Lee's daughter,  and William White, described as Glenda Lee's common-law husband, were in  custody in County Jail and expected to be arraigned Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Suspects  </P> <P> Two other suspects were at large Friday and believed to be out of state. Arrest  warrants were ordered for the two, Cora Lee and Theresa Remble. Their exact  relationships to the Lee family were unclear.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Laura Tanney said five other members or associates of the  family are part of the continuing investigation but have not been charged. She  declined to comment on their roles in the alleged fraud, or whether they have  assisted investigators.  </P> <P> Rohn Dillow, chief of the Department of Social Services' special investigations  section, characterized the ring's operation as one of the most sophisticated  ever encountered by the department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variety of Aliases  </P> <P> Members of the group went to five of the department's eight welfare offices in  the county from June, 1987, to July, 1988, and used a variety of aliases in  requesting aid from MediCal, general county welfare relief, food stamps, Aid to  Families with Dependent Children and AFDC for the homeless -- even though the  family owns property in Louisiana, according to investigators.  </P> <P> Among the schemes to receive welfare payments, investigators said, were  declaring dependents when they had none by "swapping children" among one  another and declaring them their own, claiming they were homeless when in fact  they were living in the Golden Hill area of San Diego and applying for welfare  several times by using aliases.  </P> <P> "They were quite sophisticated in terms of their ability, their knowledge of  the system, their knowledge of the verification requirements for eligibility  determination and in the information and documents they provided," Dillow said.  </P> <P> "They knew what they were doing."  </P> <P> But alert eligibility technicians first snagged individuals in the ring last  June -- about a year after the fraud allegedly started -- because of some  inconsistencies in their statements and documents. Fraud investigators within  the department were notified, and they in turn notified eligibility workers  throughout the system who began reviewing their cases, Dillow said.  </P> <P> "They came up with a number of people who seemed to be working the same way,  who found commonality among names -- even the aliases -- and common birth  dates," Dillow said.  </P> <P> He said one or more members of the family could be expected to show up at any  office on any day to make a request for welfare benefits, so fraud  investigators were sent to all eight offices and put on standby until a suspect  showed up.  </P> <P> Indeed, "the people would come in, and our fraud investigators were immediately  called in to the interview and talked to these people," Dillow said.  </P> <P> By December, he said, enough information was gathered to turn the case over to  the district attorney's office for prosecution.  </P> <P> Despite the investigation, members of the group still applied fraudulently for  even more welfare benefits, Dillow said.  </P> <P> "They continued to apply for aid, even though they knew they were being  investigated," Dillow said.  </P> <P> Virginia Lee was believed to be personally responsible for receiving more than  $20,000 in aid, Dillow said.  </P></p>

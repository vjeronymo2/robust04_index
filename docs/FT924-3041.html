			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Czechs win more investment FOREIGN investment in Czechoslovakia has more than doubled from 1991, the central State Bank said yesterday, agencies report. 'By the year's end, we count on direct foreign investments reaching some Dollars 1.2bn,' Czechoslovak State Bank's spokesman Mr Martin Svehla said. Direct investments during the first three quarters of this year amounted to Dollars 975.6m, a 61 per cent rise over 1991. 'Some 53 per cent of that sum came in only between July and September,' Mr Svehla said. But he explained this was the result of contracts concluded earlier in the year. Since 1991, when a reform designed by Premier Vaclav Klaus to achieve a speedy transition to a market economy came into effect, foreign investment in Czechoslovakia has totalled Dollars 1.725bn. This year, most investments were made in construction, food processing and banking. Leading investor countries included the US and France with last year's biggest investor, Germany, ranking third. Among the companies waiting to move in next year were Renault, Bosch, Porsche and Westinghouse. Government experts calculate next year's direct investments in the Czech republic could amount to Dollars 1.3bn. This year, Czechoslovakia also received some Dollars 759m in loans from the world's leading financial institutions - the largest part, Dollars 284m from the IMF.</p>

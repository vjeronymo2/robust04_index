			<p>BFN     [Text] The international observer contingent will deploy  in Hebron within a week to 10 days, Jerusalem political circles  said. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz has learned that  Israel has received a draft of the observers' presence mandate,  which defines their activities and addresses the questions of  their immunity, freedom of movement, and reporting procedures.  Israel finds the draft acceptable, and the sides are now  awaiting the response of the PLO.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW LIFE FOR LA PLAZA;  </P> <P> LANDSCAPING, STREET WIDENING GIVE NEW VITALITY TO DANA POINT STREET  </P> <P> Edie Ryan paused at her car on Thursday afternoon and surveyed the  almost-completed new park in downtown Dana Point.  </P> <P> "I've lived here in Dana Point for 23 years," she said. "La Plaza didn't look  so good in the past. Now it has more personality."  </P> <P> A $500,000 renovation of La Plaza in Dana Point has transformed the one-block  street from a clogged eyesore to a restful, scenic-walking and shopping area,  city officials say. The new landscaped park, street and shops around it now  form a core area for the city's downtown.  </P> <P> "What we'll have when this is completed is as close to an old-fashioned town  square as you're going to be able to find," Councilman Mike Eggers said.  </P> <P> Mayor Elaine Krause added: "There used to be an ugly old parking median running  down the street. It was just a regular street, and a confusing one, because  two-way traffic ran down both sides. Now it's becoming like a little park, and  the traffic will be safer."  </P> <P> The block, north of Coast Highway near its intersection with Street of the  Golden Lantern, is scheduled to be dedicated on Sept. 21.  </P> <P> Workmen are putting finishing touches on the transformation of La Plaza. The  once-narrow concrete street median has been expanded into a wide, graceful  greensward. An arbor and recessed seating area flank one end of the mini-park.  Curved benches and palm trees anchor the other end. Trees, grass and flowers  surround a curving walkway down the center.  </P> <P> On both sides of the street, old and new buildings reflect the diverse  character of the old seacoast community. New buildings, including the  distinctive Clock Tower Building at the north end of La Plaza, are built in the  traditional Cape Code architecture of Dana Point.  </P> <P> The center park, or commons, has an array of newly planted trees and flowers.  </P> <P> "People tell me they're really elated at how this is turning out," said Champ  Vukoty, superintendent for the construction project. He noted that in contrast  to the expanse of green now dominating the center of La Plaza, only a few  bushes formerly grew on the once-narrow street median.  </P> <P> Antique metallic lanterns, once used as street markers in the old community of  Dana Point, are being refurbished and will hang in the commons area. The old  lanterns, many of which had colored glass to reflect various hues, led to the  names of many Dana Point streets, such as Street of the Blue Lantern.  </P> <P> According to community archives, Dana Point always hoped that La Plaza would  one day be "the commercial and social core of the community -- a gathering  place as well as a retail center for the day-to-day needs of residents and  visitors."  </P> <P> With a federal community development grant and some private donations, the new  city of Dana Point was able to bring the long dream of a "town square" into  reality, Eggers said.  </P> <P> "I think what we're doing here is totally different from the ultra-modern,  impersonal, sleek malls," he said. "This is a place for people to come  together. We may never have the old pot-bellied-stove-in-the-barbershop type of  square, but this is pretty close."  </P> <P> City officials said La Plaza Commons will be used for some civic ceremonies,  band concerts and celebrations.  </P> <P> Said Mayor Krause: "It's a great improvement for the city, and I think people  are going to enjoy using it and seeing it."  </P></p>

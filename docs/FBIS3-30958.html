			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Adler] </F>   [Text] Geneva, Feb 12 (AFP) -- The latest round of Geneva  peace talks on Bosnia ended Saturday [12 February] without any  progress and will resume at the end of February or early March,  UN mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg said.    He said the Yugoslav conference was adjourning longer than  usual to give time for changes in light of a February 21 NATO  deadline for air strikes in Sarajevo if Serb heavy weapons are  not withdrawn and diplomatic pushes by both Washington and  Moscow.    Serbs, Moslems and Croats have waged a three-way war in  Bosnia since April 1992. The EC-UN Geneva peace conference  began in September 1992.    The three days of talks here failed to advance the plan of  EC  mediator Lord Owen and Stoltenberg for a loose union of three  ethnic mini-states in Bosnia, Stoltenberg told reporters. The  talks were marked by the United States putting its weight behind  the diplomatic process and saying they would defend the  Bosnian's right to a fair settlement.    U.S. special envoy Charles Redman said Friday his aim was  "to  do what (Clinton) has said we're going to try to do which is to  try to help the Bosnian Government in these negotiations to come  to an acceptable solution."    The key issue of whether Serbs and Croats will give up land  the Moslems demand for their state, which is to be made up of  one-third of Bosnia, was the main sticking point here,  Stoltenberg said. "We did not suceed to resolve the issue of  the disputed territories," Stoltenberg told reporters.    He explained the long adjournement by saying that "both the  United States and Russia will in the days to come have a high  activity with the parties to see if they can influence the  negotiating process."    Owen had earlier Saturday said the Moslems did not want to  talk about Sarajevo "until they see what happens. Probably the  NATO deadline has to pass."    Owen said the increased U.S. role here, matching the  military  one signalled by NATO's gearing up for possible air strikes if  the artillery is not withdrawn, would require re-calculations by  all the factions.    Washington will "consult very widely and that will take a  little time and certainly the Bosnian Government is not going to  shift its position until they get that and also probably until  they see what is happening in Sarajevo and whether or not there  are air strikes.    "So I think there's an inevitable pause," he said.    Owen said the focus was now on talks under the UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) in Sarajevo. "There's a tremendous amount of  negotiating load being put on (UNPROFOR Bosnian commmander)  General (Michael) Rose and his commanders down in Sarajevo."    Asked about the possibility of the Moslems using an eventual  NATO intervention as a cover for an infantry advance of their  own, Owen said: "There is an imbalance of forces in Sarajevo  with the Bosnian Serb forces having a overwhelming preponderance  of heavy weapons and the Bosnian Moslem army having a massed  preponderance of infantry in Sarajevo.    "This is potentially destabilizing unless it is met by  confidence-building measures and deloyment of UN forces on the  ground," Owen said. He pointed out that Sarajevo would not be  totally demilitarized if the artillery withdrawal succeeds since  soldiers would remain "and what is going to be done, is the UN  is interposing itself between the forces, which is brave and  necessary decision to take."</p>

Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BHUTTO'S BABY GETS LUCKY NAME  </P> <P> Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has named her week-old daughter Bakhtawar, which  means "one who brings luck" in Persian, it was announced today.  </P> <P> The second child of Bhutto and her husband, Azif Zardari, was born Jan. 25 in  the southern port city of Karachi.  </P> <P> Bhutto was the first elected leader of a modern government to give birth while  in office.  </P> <P> The 36-year-old prime minister's first child, a son named Bilawal, was born  Sept. 21, 1988, two months before the first free elections in 11 years that  installed Bhutto as prime minister.

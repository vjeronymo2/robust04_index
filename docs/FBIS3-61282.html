And what increases in value  literally by the day are the boundless expanses of Yakutia. Its  territory constitutes one-fifth of the territory of Russia. And  the president of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Mikhail  Yefimovich Nikolayev, has undertaken to transform this part of  Russia. He has not appeared at rallies, on television, or on the  pages of newspapers. He has not been in the public eye and has  wanted only one thing: that nobody stand in his way.    And now it is becoming clear: He has fulfilled and, as they  used to say in Red old days, overfulfilled his presidential  campaign program. In our day not everyone does this.    Resolute, seizing the moment, persistently finishing what he  has started, Mikhail Nikolayev has renewed his republic without  a lot of advertising. On 27 December he will have been president  for two years, which means two years of work for whose results  he need not apologize either to his people or to Russia or to  the Lord God Himself.    Mikhail Nikolayev makes it possible to judge him not only  from his words, but also from his deeds. Yakutia is now the  sovereign Republic of Sakha, which is a part of the Russian  Federation.    First the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the  Yakut-Sakha  SSR was declared. Then presidential rule was introduced. The  Federation Treaty was signed. On 27 April 1992 the new  Constitution (basic law) of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) went  into force. It had its own seal and flag. The republic became a  full-fledged member in the large Russian home, arranging its  relations with the outside world as a sovereign state.    Skeptics must be warned that this is not a continuation of  the so-called parade of sovereignties. The republic's political  status has been documented on more than just paper. Mikhail  Nikolayev cannot be silenced with titles and ranks and all the  other attributes. As early as March 1992 he achieved the signing  of an economic agreement with the Russian Federation whereby the  Republic of Sakha gained the right to keep part of the natural  resources it extracted. After the signing of the Federation  Treaty the levels, spheres, and even objects and subjects of  competition between the Center and the republic were determined.  Last November the presidents of Russia and Yakutia signed an  agreement on dividing up state property between the Russian  Federation and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The edict of  President B.N. Yeltsin "On Immediate Measures for Implementation  of the Federation Treaty in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)"  took effect in August of this year. It envisions joint solutions  to key economic problems within the framework of a special  program.    In Moscow Mikhail Nikolayev achieved the conclusion of a  separate agreement between the Russian Federation and the  Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) on questions of federal taxation  which makes it possible for the Northern republic to dispose of  its financial means independently. In this regard Yakutia is  ahead of everyone else in Russia--no other component of the  Federation has this right.    Even this brief survey of Mikhail Nikolayev's political and  economic activities during the two years of his presidency shows  that this politician knows what he wants and is able to achieve  the goals he sets. He completely denies accusations of  separatism, patiently explaining: "Our sovereignty does not  cross the line at which the disintegration of Russia begins. We  have achieved a certain amount of economic independence so that  we can earn our daily bread by the sweat of our brow and not  wait for handouts from others."    And today Yakutia is a region with a stable economic and  sociopolitical situation.    The republic is moving along the path of reforms and  President B.N. Yeltsin's policy, constantly oriented toward  all-Russian interests. Boris Nikolayevich himself, in response  to the question of what he thinks about the president of  Yakutia, said: "It has always been pleasant for me to see that  in our new time with its paths of development which are so  difficult for Russia new people are appearing so widely and  freely--talented, active, capable of independently solving what  would appear to be impossible problems. Their appearance  gratifies me most of all and gives me the strength and  confidence in the correctness of the work that has been started.  For these people are to be found not only near the president and  not only in Moscow. They are throughout our immense Russia and  in its remote parts.    "Just take Yakutia-Republic of Sakha. Its president is  Mikhail Yefimovich Nikolayev. A native northerner, Sakha by  nationality, he has the right to take his place among the  leading politicians and state figures. His talent has been  revealed literally during the past two or three years. President  Nikolayev seems to be on a creative upsurge and has far from  exhausted his potential.    "Mikhail Yefimovich impresses me because he is a man of few  words, he is thorough, and he has integrity. I know that he has  been criticized a great deal because of his desire for  independent actions and the elevation of the status of the  Republic of Sakha.    "But President Nikolayev is a sober-minded politician, an  energetic organizer who is not inclined toward adventurism and  populism. He is very cautious, but he has fairly resolutely and  courageously passed through the stage of being totally taken up  by sovereignization. In a short period of time he has managed to  bring the status of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) into line  with the new requirements of life, which has made it possible to  turn the immense territory into a high-income region with a  stable economic situation. Nikolayev does not wait for  instructions from above. He independently searches for ways out  of difficult situations and always finds them in the area of  all-Russian interests. He likes the possibility of working  independently, being responsible for the results of his  activity, keeping up with the times, not falling behind, and  even getting ahead of them in some areas. At the same time he is  guided not only by the interests of the republic he heads but  also Russia's. I think that this is one of the strongest aspects  characterizing him as a mature politician."</p>

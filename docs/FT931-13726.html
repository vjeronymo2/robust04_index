			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Australian railways deal agreed AUSTRALIA'S railway unions are on the verge of signing a productivity agreement which will release about ADollars 680m (Pounds 307m) in government funding for modernising rail services. Mr Martin Ferguson, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said the central elements of the deal were agreed with the National Railways Corporation (NRC) yesterday. The deal requires ratification by the Industrial Relations Commission, the national labour court, but it is expected to pave the way for the creation of an integrated national rail freight system. Mr Vince Graham, NRC managing director, said he hoped the agreement would be completed by the end of this month. The deal will allow the NRC to take control of five separate rail freight systems run by state governments. Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister, earmarked ADollars 680m for railway modernisation in his One Nation economic statement in February last year, which provided ADollars 2.3bn to stimulate the sluggish economy. The funding was contingent on productivity and operating agreements between the unions, the NRC and the state governments which have resisted integration of the systems. About 7,000 jobs are expected to be created.</p>

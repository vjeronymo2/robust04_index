			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS AVERT ARBITRATION BY SIGNING MINTON  </P> <P> The Angels canceled their opening round of arbitration hearings, scheduled for  Wednesday with Greg Minton, by signing the 37-year-old relief pitcher to a  1-year contract worth about $650,000 Saturday.  </P> <P> Of the club's four remaining arbitration cases, Minton's figured to be the most  likely to produce an early agreement, as only $90,000 separated the two sides.  Minton filed for a $690,000 salary in 1989, and the Angels offered $600,000.  </P> <P> In 1988, Minton appeared in 44 games for the Angels, finishing 4-5 with 7  saves. His 2.85 earned-run average was second only to Bryan Harvey's 2.13 on  the Angel pitching staff.  </P> <P> Minton's signing leaves first baseman Wally Joyner, outfielder Chili Davis and  shortstop Dick Schofield on the club's arbitration ledger. Joyner, who is  asking for $965,000, turned down a reported $2.24-million, 2-year proposal,  plus incentives, from the Angels on Friday. The Angels' original arbitration  offer was $750,000.  </P> <P> Davis and Schofield remain separated from the Angels by $300,000 and $255,000,  respectively. Davis filed at $1.3 million, the Angels at $1 million. Schofield,  who filed at $910,000, was offered $655,000. MIKE PENNER  </P></p>

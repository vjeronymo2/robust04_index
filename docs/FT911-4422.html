			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Adverse exchange rates check advance at Whatman PRE-TAX profits growth at Whatman, the specialist paper and filtration equipment maker, slowed to 7 per cent during 1990. Profits came to Pounds 11.02m (Pounds 10.28m), achieved on reduced turnover of Pounds 44.58m (Pounds 47.86m). The company said the slowdown was partly attributable to adverse exchange rate movements and a reduction in turnover attributable to the disposal of the Whatman Air Filtration business. In spite of recession in the group's main markets, sales increased in all regions, except the UK, by an average of 9 per cent. Profits were particularly affected by a 20 per cent increase in marketing and product development. Capital expenditure exceeded Pounds 10m and acquisitions Pounds 500,000. The company said this benefited the Laboratory division's mail-order business, while improvements to plant and new product development capabilities in the US strengthened the Filter Systems side, which extended its range of air purification units and achieved notable sales growth in Japan and France. A significant increase in sales of advanced papers buoyed the Speciality Products division, where costs were temporarily increased by the design of a new paper machine, which should lift future capacity by a third. On earnings per share up from 30.74p to 33.1p, the final dividend is 5.25p for a total of 7.75p (6.25p). The shares rose 3p on the day, closing at 453p.</p>

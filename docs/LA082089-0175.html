			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Michigan-based Enstrom Helicopter Corp. has privately sold training helicopters  to the Chilean army, but the deal does not violate an embargo on arms sales to  Chile's military government, officials at the U.S. Embassy in Santiago said.  Chile's opposition daily La Epoca reported that Enstrom, of Menominee, Mich.,  had sold about 15 three-seat trainers to the Chileans. A U.S. Embassy official  said the sale did not violate a 1976 U.S. law, which requires that arms sales  be authorized by the President only after the government of President Augusto  Pinochet has shown significant progress in respecting human rights.  </P></p>

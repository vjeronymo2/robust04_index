			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vitaliy Kononov, Head of the PZU [Green Party of </F> Ukraine]: "The Political Situation in Our Country and the Tasks  of the PZU (From His Report to the Fourth PZU Congress)"]    [Text] What stance do the "Greens" take on the  economy?    We are inspired by Lanovoy's economic program. But we also  have our own view of Ukraine's development. The "Greens"  advocate market-type reforms, the formation of private property,  and the most rapid possible privatization. Moreover, our  deputies in the parliament will speak out in favor of radical  economic changes in Ukraine--this is our second task at the  stage of building state sovereignty. We consider that economic  advantage can be brought about only with ecological safety,  and--therefore--our programmatic tasks comprise a solution of  ecological problems by political methods.    We have a special "fondness" for nuclear problems.  The decree passed by the Supreme Council on 21 October with  regard to continuing the operation of the Chernobyl AES [Nuclear  Power Plant] and repealing the moratorium on putting new  nuclear-power generating facilities into operation attests to  the fact that not a single step toward restructuring the economy  has been taken. The government presently in power has chosen the  most dangerous method for satisfying the hypertrophied needs and  desires of an ineffective economic system.    We declare that the responsiblity for adopting decisions  lies  on all deputies, regardless of their party affiliations and  declared views. The tragic experience of 1986 has taught  Ukrainian leaders nothing. The Ukrainian state will be built,  experience development, and then disappear from the face of the  Earth, while the radioactive blot of plutonium will remain as a  testimony to other places and states--a monument to the  ignorance of a nation whose representatives we are. And so are  the "Greens" not right to take such a stance with regard to  nuclear problems?    Our attitude toward nuclear weapons is as follows.    We consider that nuclear weapons constitute a morally  obsolete mode of settling world relations by violent methods.  They simply must not be employed. And yet--at the same time--it  is hard for the nuclear countries to give up their possession,  whereas it is prestigious for non-nuclear countries to possess  them. That is to say, to deprive them of having this type of  weaponry in the very near future is quite problematical,  regardless of any declarations to that effect. At the same time,  however, the process of nuclear disarmament has been moved off  dead center, and Ukraine's signing of the START Treaty bears  witness to that. It is, undoubtedly, a serious step in the  direction of our state's nuclear-free status. While advocating  such a nuclear-free status, the "Greens" at the same time are  fully aware of those problems which have arisen around this  yearning. For dozens of years the Ukrainian people--just like  all the peoples of the former USSR--worked for the  military-industrial complex. As a result of the disintegration  of the above-mentioned super-state, Ukraine did not inherit any  of this. Having declared itself to be the rightful and legal  successor of the USSR, Russia became the de facto heir to all  the national wealth. And it is making an attempt to resolve its  international obligations by means of the nuclear installations  which have remained in Ukraine. It is exerting mad political  pressure and distorting Ukraine's official position with regard  to the problems of nuclear disarmament in the world community.  Under such conditions the "greens" share in the idea that  Ukraine must receive compensation for nuclear disarmament as  well as guarantees from the nuclear countries. A failure to  understand Ukraine's position on this matter, as well as  attempts to exert political pressure from the Western countries  for the purpose of solving their own security problems at the  expense of a country which is beginning to build its own economy  do not find support among Ukrainian "Greens." We have come out  with an initiative to our foreign-relations departments  regarding the discussion of the question of granting Ukraine the  status of a permament member of the UN Security Council, as a  status which is voluntarily renouncing nuclear weapons. This, to  our way of thinking--together with granting the requests by the  non-nuclear Germany and Japan to become members of the Security  Council--could radically change the situation concerning the  dominant concept of nuclear restraint, and it could begin a new  phase in developing the world order. But, unfortunately, nobody  has listened to us so far.    Our party has negatively assessed the changes introduced by  the Supreme Council with regard to universal military  obligation and military service.    The program for gradually professionalizing the Armed  Services must provide as soon as possible for the introduction  of an alternative type of military service, with guarantees of  appropriate rights to all citizens of draftable age--a  contractual system for those who have vocational or even  professional training and are prepared to perform a term type of  service.    Spirituality has assumed a particular importance  during the present-day period. The rearing and education of  whole generations of persons as conscious atheists has  facilitated today's manifestations of cynical cruelty, a  debauchery of evil-doing, and a criminalization of society. A  lack of spirituality is the basic reason for the decline of  cultural standards, for the lowered self-esteem of citizens, and  for the degradation of the masses. Having set itself the task of  humanizing society, the PZU will cooperate with all  organizations--whether religious or secular--taking advantage of  our own potentials because, of course, we have a significant  persentage of teachers and doctors. That is to say, we have a  genuine people's intelligentsia, which can be used to form a new  consciousness, a consciousness of ecology and of harmonizing the  relations between human beings and nature.    Our relations with other parties are as follows.  Nowadays almost all parties declare their devotion to the ideas  of centrism. Under such conditions all that we can do is to  repeat the old "Green" slogan: "We are neither on the right or  on the left; we are ahead of everybody." That is to say, under  the Ukrainian conditions we are ahead of the center. During the  period under review we have cooperated--sometimes quite  constructively--with almost all the parties. We have not made  enemies, but have rather won many friends. These include the  Justice Party, with which we have conducted roundtables on  topical questions and worked on an economic program for  extricating ourselves from the present crisis. These friends  also include the Ukrainian Republican Party, with which we have  tried to assist Georgian refugees and with which we intend to  conduct a Congress of the Political Parties of the Baltic and  Black Sea Regions. These likewise include the PDVU [Party of  Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine] and the Social Democrats. with  which we have cooperated in the movement entiled "New Ukraine."  These also include the Constitutional Democrats and the  Liberals, with which we have worked on the draft of the  Constitutional Assembly.</p>

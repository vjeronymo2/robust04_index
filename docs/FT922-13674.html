			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Observer: Rebel band Australian ballet-goers wishing to see the Sydney Opera House's performance of Giselle right through, had better know Adolphe Adam's score note-for-note. They look likely to have to sing along to keep the dancers going; the orchestra is threatening to stage a strike mid-way. The musicians complain that their pit is too small and too noisy even though it was renovated earlier this year. While it has room for only 65, they say, the management often requires 70 or more of them to squeeze in. They are also afraid that their hearing will be damaged by excessive noise levels, says Carla Thackrah, a flautist with the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra. So far, the opera house's governing trust seems to have done little to avert the unscheduled interval. General manager Lloyd Martin has confined himself to reminding the orchestra of the dangers of causing discord with patrons. The best hope perhaps lies in compromise. After all, if the musicians would agree to delay their stoppage until within five minutes from the end of Giselle, the management could pretend they had switched to playing the American composer John Cage's 'Four minutes, 33 seconds' in which the performer makes no sound at all.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD;  </P> <P> JUDGE REVAK HAD NO CONNECTION WITH CASE  </P> <P> A Friday story about a meeting of crime victims incorrectly identified Superior  Court Judge Bernard Revak as being chastised for releasing a 17-year-old  convicted of second-degree murder so the teen-ager could attend the birth of  his child and be with his family. Actually, Revak had no connection with the  case. The judge who released the youth was Juvenile Court Judge Sheridan Reed.  </P></p>

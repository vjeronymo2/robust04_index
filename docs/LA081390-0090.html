			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Military strength -- Due to a typographical error in a commentary Friday by  Barry Posen on Iraqi and U.S. military strength, the number of tanks in the  U.S. arsenal was understated. The number is 15,000. And a sentence on  assistance by our European allies should have referred to large numbers of  European merchant ships rather than large numbers of merchant marines.  </P></p>

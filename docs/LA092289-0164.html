			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: BULLY NOVEL COMES FROM REAL-LIFE EXPLOITS OF TEDDY  ROOSEVELT  </P> <P> It's the stuff that rip-roaring Westerns are made of:  </P> <P> The dude from the East, his health fragile and his life in ruins after his  mother and beloved bride die the same day, comes West to seek solitude.  </P> <P> He becomes a rancher in the North Dakota Badlands, the untamed wilderness ruled  by the handsome and notorious Marquis De Mores, principal landowner and  pretender to the throne of France whose beautiful young wife is from the dude's  New York social set.  </P> <P> When the Badlands are invaded by a mob of night-riding vigilantes, "whispered  rumors hold that the Marquis himself leads them." Dozens of men are lynched in  an effort to rid the area of its small ranchers -- including the dude from New  York, who "must use his burgeoning outdoorsman's talents in combination with  his Easterner's knack for organization and politicking to bring down the  Marquis."  </P> <P> It is, as the publisher says, "a sprawling epic of the American West of the  1880s."  </P> <P> But what reads like fiction is based on reality.  </P> <P> The dude from the East is 24-year-old Theodore Roosevelt, the main character in  "Manifest Destiny" (Penzler Books), Brian Garfield's biographical novel that  dramatizes "the true story of the coming of age" of the 26th President of the  United States.  </P> <P> "It's surprising how little fiction there is in that book, although I did write  it as a novel," said Garfield, who recently appeared at book signings at Book  Carnival in Orange and the Bookstore in Irvine.  </P> <P> The Studio City author's next Orange County book signing will be from 2 to 5  p.m. Sunday at Waldenbooks, 665 N. Tustin Ave., Orange. (Also scheduled to sign  are Melodie Johnson Howe, author of "The Mother Shadow," and the  wife-and-husband writing team known as A.E. Maxwell, authors of "The Art of  Survival.")  </P> <P> Garfield, who is best known for his novel "Death Wish," said he had the idea  for a biographical novel about Theodore Roosevelt's Western exploits for at  least 25 years, "and I was always convinced somebody else must already be  working on it. It's such a good story and nobody has done it in fictional  form."  </P> <P> The author first visited Roosevelt's log ranch house in the Badlands five years  ago. In doing his research for the book, he also dug through the Theodore  Roosevelt archives at Harvard and at Roosevelt's home in Sagamore Hills, Long  Island. Most of the material for the book, however, came from libraries and  historical societies in North Dakota.  </P> <P> "It's real nice that 100 years ago everybody wrote," said Garfield. "They wrote  incessant letters and kept diaries and memoirs. Everybody who knew Theodore  Roosevelt in those days naturally sat down and wrote a book about him when he  became famous."  </P> <P> When 24-year-old Theodore Roosevelt arrived in the Badlands, Garfield said, he  was not the big, robust character that usually comes to mind. He was  underweight, sickly, extremely nearsighted, suffered from asthma and spoke with  a squeaky voice.  </P> <P> "He had everything going against him," said Garfield. "Despite all those  drawbacks and shortcomings, he was just a natural leader. He had this most  incredibly charismatic personality. People . . . were eager to follow him."  </P> <P> When Roosevelt first arrived in the Badlands, Garfield said, he was "ridiculed  as a stumble-bum dude. Within a year he was elected chairman of the Stockman's  Assn. You couldn't keep him down."  </P> <P> Although "Manifest Destiny" is fictional to the extent that Garfield couldn't  know what the characters said to each other or what they were thinking and  feeling at the time, he said all the characters and events are real.  </P> <P> "The plot of the story, oddly enough, is a very strongly structured, almost  traditional Western," he said. "Roosevelt's life became essentially the basis  for what we grew up with as the Western formula. His experiences in Dakota were  pretty parallel to that: a small rancher menaced by land grabber. . . . He  finally went up against the big bad guy. The bad guy challenged him to a duel.  . . . It's your classic Western formula. That's why I was just flabbergasted  nobody else did it."  </P> <P> Garfield, who has written "somewhere between 60 and 70" fiction and nonfiction  books, in addition to screenplays, alternates between writing contemporary  novels and historical novels such as "Wild Times," which was based on Buffalo  Bill's Wild West shows.  </P> <P> "It drives my publishers and agent absolutely up the wall," he said, "because  they can't typecast me."  </P> <P> Poetry chosen: The American Poetry Assn. has selected six poems by Arthur  Winslow of Westminster to appear in "American Poetry Anthology," a treasury of  current poetry. Poets interested in publication may send up to six poems on any  subject to the American Poetry Assn., Dept. CT-67, P.O. Box 1803, Santa Cruz,  Calif. 95061. Each poem must be no more than 20 lines, and the poet's name and  address must be included on each page.  </P></p>

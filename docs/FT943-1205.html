			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (12): Belated switch of emphasis - John Kavanagh examines developments in right-sizing Computer right-sizing used to be simple. You looked at the central mainframe computer costing possibly millions of pounds, the end-users' display terminals with their fixed-format inquiry screens in black and white, and the army of expensive specialists taking months to write the simplest programs, and compared it with cheap, friendly, colour PCs apparently allowing business people to do anything they wanted, whenever they wanted. No contest. Indeed, a survey by computer supplier Sequent shows that almost two-thirds of completed right-sizing projects were carried out to cut costs. The second main reason, mentioned by 30 per cent of companies, was the related issue of replacing an obsolete computer, typically a central mainframe. But since the early 1990s this 'simplistic downsizing', as Computer Technology Research Group calls it, has been severely questioned by analyses of costs and by a perhaps surprisingly belated switch of emphasis to business issues. Several studies by independent research groups now question whether cost savings are possible from moving to PC networks or client-server systems, which typically combine PCs and more powerful local computers. One survey by Xephon has found that mainframe systems are the cheapest, per end-user, with minicomputer systems 50 per cent more expensive and PC networks more than twice the cost. These studies highlight the fact that mainframe costs are quite well defined: equipment, software, maintenance and central staff. But PC networks and distributed minicomputers have hidden costs of duplicated work, security, maintenance, hardware and software failures and, most of all, support  - not only by central specialists but also by local office staff who spend their time running PCs instead of doing their proper jobs. In addition, there are shortages of the skills needed to move from mainframes to PC or Unix minicomputer systems. The Sequent survey found this to be a problem among three-quarters of companies questioned  - including system suppliers themselves. 'Cost reductions must not be the key incentive for moving to client-server,' says Mr Per Andersen, a director of research firm IDC. 'The cost structure of using information technology changes dramatically. Instead of hardware and software making up most of the costs, staffing and support constitute more than half the costs in most cases.' Cost savings are possible, but only if companies look beyond 'simplistic downsizing' and match their computing to business needs. Indeed, our case study shows a company moving back towards a central set-up as the need for certain corporate systems and databases emerged. This is not uncommon. Research firm Gartner Group says: 'We believe the central function will have a resurgence as end-users realise the true costs and complexity of mission-critical computing.' So the starting point for right-sizing must be business needs, not computing costs. Computers and networks can now match company structures, and reviews of computing set-ups should be led by reviews of business organisation. Steve Wanless, product manager at Sequent, says: 'Right-sizing is all about selecting hardware which will provide the computing infrastructure and systems flexibility to match the business,' he says. 'This does not necessarily mean ditching all existing systems and proprietary hardware.'</p>

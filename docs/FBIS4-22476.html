			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Tatarchenkov under the "Election Passions" </F> rubric: "Circular Track Races"]    [Text] In Yaroslav Oblast, the "successful seizure of  representative power by the executive has taken place." Such was  the characterization given the elections to the oblast Duma and  the city municipal committees by V. Varukhin, representative of  the president of the Russian Federation in the oblast. And in  fact, of the 17 elected deputies in the oblast, six are heads of  city administration, and another three are bureaucrats. However,  this victory can be counted a Pyrrhic one. Only 33 percent of  the oblast residents who had the right to vote participated in  the elections. In most of the districts, the elections were  declared invalid by the oblast electoral commission. That is to  the oblast Duma. Things are not any better with the municipal  committees: In two of the oblast's large cities--in Rybinsk and  Rostov--elections did not take place at all, and in Yaroslavl,  only partially.    The main reason for this "victory" is the absolute  apoliticism of the voters. And the people of Yaroslavl, in turn,  reserve the right to mock the points of the candidates' election  platforms and the means of their presentation. Thus, one of the  directors of a Yaroslavl enterprise permitted vodka to be sold  on the territory of the plant during the election campaign. The  vodka was wrapped in a sheet with the director's election  program on it. Another candidate, when presenting his program on  local television, was asked how he planned to implement it; he  replied: "I know some sly tricks that will help me out." The  contender preferred not to go into the details of what these  "tricks" might be. A third, in order to get the youth vote,  promised to organize "sex buses," where young men and women  could meet without the danger of being caught by their parents.  Against the background of these "sly tricks" and "sex buses,"  bureaucrats and directors of major enterprises looked quite a  bit more attractive: They really could do something more  serious. True, most of them did not believe that this "something  more serious" would make their life easier, and they "voted with  their feet," virtually ignoring the elections.    In the districts where all of the contenders were rejected,  runoff elections will be held on 24 April. And the oblast  electoral commission set a condition: All candidates, the new  and the previous ones, must again collect the necessary number  of signatures. So this is the second track, which is in danger  of turning into an exclusive one.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RONALD REAGAN  </P> <P> A letter writer discusses our trade policies and talks about the total mess  left us by Ronnie and his Wall Street buddies (letter, April 16). Hardly a week  goes by that The Times doesn't print some letter that still takes a swipe at  Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican, liberal or conservative, one  thing is a fact: By every unit used to measure government, be it inflation,  gross national product, employment, whatever, Reagan gave us the best eight  years we have ever had. That's not my opinion, the facts are there. Now the  political analysts are giving him credit for eliminating Soviet Unionas a  threat to the world. If that's true, the accomplishments of Washington and  Lincoln pale by comparison.  </P> <P> JOHN WAUGEN  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

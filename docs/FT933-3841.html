			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Showdown at the French corral: David Buchan on threats to veto the US-EC farm trade deal French ministers dress up their case for a better Gatt deal for French and European agriculture in the high-minded motto of the French revolution and republic. First, liberte for France to maintain its 'vocation' as the world's second-biggest agricultural exporter. Second, egalite of sacrifice between the farmers of Europe and France and those of the US. Finally, fraternite in the form of a 'peace clause' which would extend the protection for the EC's reformed Common Agricultural Policy from American legal attack well into the next century. But behind this rhetoric and demands lies a deadly political game. A French veto of the US-EC draft farm trade agreement, perhaps as early as the September 20 meeting of the EC ministers in Brussels, would have serious consequences for France's relations with its European partners, for what remains of Community solidarity, and for the fate of the seven-year-old Uruguay Round of the Gatt negotiations. For the odds are still that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will be driven to carry out his threat to 'go to the end of our determination, our firmness' in getting major revisions in the draft farm accord which the European Commission negotiated with the US last November. This so-called Blair House agreement would, France insists, go far beyond the production curbs in the last year's EC reform of Common Agricultural Policy. Instead of having to take 15 per cent of land out of production - as agreed in the EC's own reform - French farm unions say that implementing Blair House would lead to an idling of more than 30 per cent of land, and halve France's pork production and reduce its cereals output by 25 per cent. For France, the most objectionable aspect of Blair House is the requirement that the EC should reduce the volume of its subsidised exports by 21 per cent over six years. By contrast, French ministers say their farmers can live with Blair House's proposed 36 per cent cut in the value of exports subsidies. It has made this gesture partly to show that it is not totally closed to change and partly to frighten its partners by reminding them that, after all, the big cereal farmers in the plains around Paris are Europe's most competitive. The possibility of a last-minute compromise has increased as French diplomacy has gone into overdrive, bombarding EC partners and the Commission with a series of proposed modifications and clarifications to Blair House. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is also, by his own account, trying to broker some compromise. The German leader told Mr Balladur that President Clinton informed him in a telephone conversation that the US 'understood' France's reservations, even if it did not agree to with them. Mr Balladur's threat of a veto may be a bluff. But it would be dangerous to count on this. France has no pro-Gatt lobby and industrialists are chary of speaking up against farm interests. The reluctance of a prime minister with a record high standing in opinion polls to face down farmers, which comprise six per cent of workforce, may seem odd. But last year the then Socialist government escaped defeat on a parliamentary censure motion by four votes after having accepted the May 1992 CAP reform. This time, on the even more emotive issue of a Gatt deal, Mr Balladur might not be so lucky. If his ministers are unable to return to Paris with some key concessions he might find his poll ratings pulverised. Within his own party there are those who have been sharpening swords for Mr Balladur to fall on. Mr Philippe Seguin, the RPR president of the National Assembly, has championed 'an alternative policy' on Europe, Gatt and the economy, as a presidential platform for Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR candidate to run on. The latter, whose populism goes down better with the farmers than Mr Balladur's patrician style, would not lightly ditch Mr Balladur. But he is unlikely to let his long friendship with Mr Balladur stand in the way of his 20 year quest to win the Elysee Palace. Fully aware of his appalling dilemma, Mr Balladur, has not been drifting passively towards the rocks of Blair House over his six months in office. He quietly approved in June formal EC acceptance of the ceiling on European oilseed production that had been negotiated as a side-element to Blair House. He concluded that by accepting what was basically a good deal for EC and French oilseed producers, France could both give concrete proof of its new-found reasonableness and win concessions on other, more distasteful aspects of Blair House. For a time, France's two main farm unions, the FNSEA and CNJA which represent more than half the country's 1m full-time farmers, took their tune from Mr Balladur. What trouble there was during the summer was largely directed against imports of fish, fruit and vegetables, largely outside the EC price support regime and therefore the scope of Gatt. France also acquiesced in the industrial tariff cuts agreed by the Group of Seven countries at the Tokyo summit in early July, without getting a whisper of a promise to reopen Blair House. But just as Mr Balladur began to feel completely caught between his farmers' continued intransigence against the basic provisions of Blair House and his foreign partners' insistence that Blair House was a fixed deal, and that the Gatt talks must move on to fresh ground, a ray of hope emerged  - from of all things the August crisis in the European monetary system. That momentous cloud had a silver lining, because it suddenly disposed Mr Kohl to listen to French complaints. Since early August, farmers in countries like France, whose currencies depreciate, get a better return for their crops, once the common Ecu price is translated into national money. Exactly the opposite is happening in Germany, whose farmers now face lower D-mark prices for their products everytime the D-mark rises. With election looming, the prospect of having discontented farmers on his hands disturbs Mr Kohl. 'France wants Germany to help remove Blair House's provision for a 21 per cent reduction in the volume of subsidised exports,' says a French minister, explaining the basis of recent discussions between the two countries. 'In return Germany wants France's help in preventing a fall in German farm prices.' As a fall-back - in the event that it cannot get EC partners to agree to demands from the US for a scrapping of the 21 per cent cut - France is proposing that the reduction should apply to a smaller category of goods. It suggests food aid, processed products and existing silo stocks could be subtracted from list to which the cut would apply. Whether this would be negotiable in Washington is something which Mr Kohl has been trying to establish. Certainly, anything seems worth trying to avoid the dreadful dilemma between France losing the most pro-European prime minister it is likely to have for the foreseeable future, and Mr Balladur keeping himself in power by using the French veto, which would damage an already enfeebled Community.</p>

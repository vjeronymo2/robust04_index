			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Exxon unveils 25% increase in fourth term EXXON, the world's biggest integrated oil company, yesterday unveiled an unexpected 25 per cent improvement in fourth - quarter earnings, helped by lower operating costs and strong US natural gas prices. Net income for the last three months of 1992 was Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 1.12 a share, against Dollars 1.12bn, or 89 cents, on revenues of Dollars 30.16bn, down from Dollars 31.02bn. Analysts had expected Exxon to earn about 96 cents a share in the quarter. On Wall Street, shares in Exxon rose Dollars 2 1/2 to close at Dollars 60 5/8 . The price was bolstered by news that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries was close to agreeing to cut production by up to 1m barrels a day. Mr Lawrence Rawl, chairman, said three-quarters of Exxon's earnings in 1992 came from sources outside the US. In the fourth quarter, foreign upstream earnings rose 20 per cent to Dollars 845m, including one-time credits of Dollars 56m. US upstream earnings stood at Dollars 187m, up Dollars 30m, including one-time charges of Dollars 91m. Exploration and production earnings climbed 19 per cent to Dollars 1.03bn from Dollars 863m. Lower operating expenses and higher petroleum product volumes lifted earnings from refining and marketing operations by 61 per cent to Dollars 420m from Dollars 260m. Earnings from chemical operations fell to Dollars 56m, including Dollars 15m on non-recurring charges, from Dollars 94m last year. During the quarter, Exxon slashed capital and exploration spending to Dollars 2.57bn from Dollars 2.73bn a year earlier. For all 1992, Exxon's net income fell 15 per cent to Dollars 4.77bn, or Dollars 3.79, from Dollars 5.6bn or Dollars 4.45. Exxon adopted new accounting standards in 1992 which reduced earnings by Dollars 40m after tax, or 3 cents a share. Operating results for the first nine months were restated to reflect the new standards.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Lubbers leaves heirs and rivals a hard act to follow: Dutch national elections expose the vulnerability of political aspirants Mr Ruud Lubbers is a hard act to follow, as his rivals and political heirs in the Netherlands are ruefully discovering in the run-up to national elections on May 3. Mr Lubbers, 54, the longest-serving prime minister in Dutch history, is leaving national politics after three consecutive terms in office. His departure is a serious blow to his Christian Democrat party (CDA), which traditionally dominates Dutch politics but which is now struggling in the polls. When the Lubbers era began in 1982, the country's crippling public debt, its rigid labour market and its dual problems of inflation and unemployment had spawned the pejorative term 'Hollanditis.' But as he prepares to leave office, possibly to fight for the presidency of the European Commission in Brussels, Mr Lubbers leaves behind a surprisingly muscular economy. In the early 1980s, his 'no-nonsense' approach and radical (by Dutch standards) cuts in social benefits earned him the nickname 'Ruud Shock' abroad, making him one of the few Dutch prime ministers whose name is known to foreigners. Mr Lubbers exploited the recession of the early 1980s to cut the pay of civil servants and scale back unemployment and disability benefits. In his 12 years in office, he also cut the budget deficit from 10.1 per cent of net national income to 3.8 per cent, although the absolute level of public debt has continued to rise. In normal times, Mr Lubbers' anointment of Mr Elco Brinkman as his successor as party leader would have been enough to ensure that Mr Brinkman would also succeed him as prime minister. The CDA has had a place in every government coalition since the second world war, and it usually provides the prime minister. This year, however, the Dutch electoral race is wide open, and the CDA's support is crumbling. Part of the problem is the transition from a popular, well-tried politician in Mr Lubbers to Mr Brinkman, who has led the CDA in the lower house of parliament for the past four years. Mr Lubbers has clearly become an institution. In a recent newspaper interview he admitted: 'There are whole generations of people who think only of Ruud Lubbers when they hear the word prime minister. Younger voters have experienced only me. From a democratic perspective, it's good to turn this page.' But the handover to Mr Brinkman has been messy, culminating in signs of disagreement and friction between the two men. Mr Lubbers first signalled his preference for Mr Brinkman after the CDA's last electoral victory in 1989, putting his successor in the uncomfortable and visible role of 'heir apparent' for nearly five years. Matters were not helped by the presentation of the CDA platform in January, when plans to freeze old age pension payments sparked a storm of protest. The chairman of the CDA, Mr Wim van Velzen, resigned to take the blame but much of the fault was apportioned to Mr Brinkman. Then, in early April, it emerged that Mr Brinkman held a non-executive directorship at a company linked to his wife's uncle who was known to have had run-ins with the tax authorities. The episode has dominated news reporting in the crucial weeks before the elections. Mr Brinkman can draw some comfort from the fact that Mr Lubbers, too, began his tenure as premier facing low popularity and high scepticism, both inside and outside the party. The two men share other similarities. . Although Mr Lubbers is a Jesuit-educated Catholic while Mr Brinkman grew up in a conservative Calvinist area east of Rotterdam, both men were high-fliers who attained national office early. Mr Lubbers, scion of a rich Rotterdam industrialist, was minister of economic affairs when he was just 34 and became prime minister at 43, the youngest in Dutch history. Mr Brinkman, son of a small-town mayor, became minister of culture and health at the age of 34. Now aged 46, he has a stiff and forbidding image that belies his youth. Both men launched their bids for the prime minister's job from their positions as leader of the CDA in parliament. But the truth now is that the outlook for the CDA is so grim that the unthinkable may happen: the Netherlands' 'party of government' could be transformed into a party of opposition.</p>

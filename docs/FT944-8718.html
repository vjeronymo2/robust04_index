			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / AT&amp;T seeks Groupe Bull stake AT&amp;T, the US telecoms company, is seeking to participate in the privatisation of Groupe Bull, the loss-making French computer group. The US group is proposing to ally with Quadral, the holding company which controls CSEE, the French electronics equipment concern, to take a joint stake of up to 40 per cent in Bull, according to sources in Paris. Quadral is expected to be the majority partner in a joint offer. Unlike previous French privatisations, the sale of Bull will be conducted through the formation of industry partnerships rather than a public offer. The French government, which is seeking to reduce its holding in Bull from 76 per cent to below 50 per cent before next spring's presidential elections, is due to launch a formal tender for stakes in Bull by the end of the month. The planned privatisation has already drawn interest from NEC, the Japanese computer company which holds 4.4 per cent. NEC said last week that it was planning to increase its participation and is thought to be seeking a 10 per cent holding. Industry observers said that the proposal from AT&amp;T and Quadral would be compatible with the offer from NEC. The US group and its French partner would seek to expand Bull's activities in systems integration and information services and to capitalise on the convergence between the telecoms and computing industries. It is thought that AT&amp;T, which refused to comment directly on the deal, will not want to involve itself directly in Bull's computer operations. It said: 'AT&amp;T is very much interested in advancing the openness of telecommunications markets in general, and in particular in countries such as France where markets are closed.' French government officials are pressing the need for industrial partners to secure the company's position. Bull has incurred losses of more than FFr15bn (Pounds 1.78bn) over the past three years and has required subsidies of FFr11bn since the start of 1993.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Polytechnics warned on pay rises POLYTECHNIC directors were warned by the government yesterday to keep this year's pay settlement within tight bounds. Mr Nigel Forman, higher education minister, stressed the government's 'commitment to constraining public spending over the next three years in order to reduce the public sector deficit'. He was addressing the annual conference of polytechnic directors, 'Employers are recruiting in a buyer's market. Accordingly they need to challenge the expectation that there will be annual increases in pay simply for delivering a given level of service. 'The only prudent basis for a real increase in pay is improvement in productivity and performance.' His warning, set against the backdrop of this year's university pay settlement of 7 per cent which was overturned by the government as too generous, will be taken seriously by the directors. The conference, meeting in Edinburgh, is the last of its kind. Most polytechnics have now been granted university status under the government's policy of creating a unified higher-education sec-tor. Two of the few remaining polytechnics, at Leeds and Manchester, were yesterday granted the titles Leeds Metropolitan University and Manchester Metropolitan University by the Privy Council. The conference agreed to a merger with the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which is likely to take effect within a few months. A new Higher Education Funding Council, embracing both 'old' and 'new' universities, comes into operation next April. Head teachers yesterday submitted a claim for a 9 per cent salary increase to the Teachers' Pay Review Body. The National Association of Head Teachers argued that 'substantial' increases in responsibilities, as well as job evaluations with comparable positions, justified the claim. If met, the association's claim would take the salary of a typical primary school head to Pounds 27,746, and that of a typical secondary head to Pounds 42,677.</p>

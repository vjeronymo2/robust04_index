			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Technology: Contest for an industry's future - Technically Speaking THE spectacle of the French Minister of Industry, Gerard Longuet, hawking round the chairmanship of Groupe Bull, with few takers, as he wrestles with the restructuring of the computer concern is highly diverting - in more senses than one. For while the EC Commission concentrates on the aid being offered, the real contest for the future of the computing industry is being fought elsewhere. Europe is not even in the game. The US, however, plays to win. Faltering giants such as IBM, Unisys, Digital and Wang are left to find their own salvation. In the country that sets the agenda for information technology - for users and providers - action is centred on establishing leadership in new techniques for computing. In the vanguard of such action was the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, set up in the Sputnik era of the 1950s. DARPA instigated a strategic computing programme in the early 1980s that helped supply users with new parallel processing systems, including 68 from two vendors, Intel and Thinking Machines, in a programme now running at Dollars 120m (Pounds 82m) a year. Such single-minded concentration of this largesse on just two suppliers irked the powerful House of Representatives Committee on Armed Services, which instigated a General Accounting Office enquiry. Its May 1993 report criticised the way the programme had been run, especially its hardware procurement, but not its goals. The director of the programme was removed, the largesse spread and the programme continued. Congress had also joined the action and passed a High-Performance Computing Act in 1991, raising the budget (including software and computer networking) by 68 per cent to Dollars 3bn over five years. The act co-ordinates 10 agencies, including DARPA - now renamed ARPA to emphasise its refocus on a dual-use technology role - in a programme that disbursed Dollars 796m in fiscal 1993 on R&amp;D in high-performance computing. By the summer of 1993 it had funded 30 significant systems, this time including each of the leading companies in the industry. No foreign-owned suppliers were included, hardly surprising since any contract that does not comply with the Buy America Act must be reported to Congress. Where high-performance computing goes today, so commercial computing goes tomorrow. In July, a Congressional committee lifted the sum by a further Dollars 200m a year and widened the scope to include commercial applica-tions. Policymakers in Brussels are well aware that the issue matters. One Commission official has estimated that Brussels allocates Dollars 15m a year on activities comparable to those on which the US spends Dollars 796m. In 1991, Brussels produced a discussion document on IT. This stressed the 'enabling' nature of these IT industries, now involved in virtually all economic activities, and their external impact on the EC economies as a whole, already representing 5 per cent of GDP directly and set to approach 10 per cent by 2000. The role of parallel processing in computing was recognised as an opportunity to improve Europe's status quo. But the EC also noted that European purchasers of advanced computer systems tend to turn to US suppliers which, thanks to their government's intervention, are larger and have more users than their European counterparts. The latest example was announced last Friday, when it was revealed the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts was acquiring the Cray Research T3D parallel system - without even going out to tender. As Paris and Brussels wrestle with Groupe Bull, therefore, the sound and fury will signify little unless some thought is spared for the consequences of the next generation of computing being abandoned to the US.

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / UN may back force in Bosnia: Western governments strive to resolve differences over scale of military involvement WESTERN governments were struggling yesterday to agree on the scope of military involvement in Bosnia-Hercegovina as the United Nations Security Council prepared to sanction some form of armed intervention. Despite mounting pressure from public opinion and opposition political parties for the UN and Nato to stop the fighting in the former Yugoslav republic, the UK and US remain determined not to become bogged down in what President George Bush called a 'quagmire'. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US deputy secretary of state, said the situation in Bosnia was 'a civil war based on 500 to 1,000 years of history. . . These ethnic groups are intermixed in ways you cannot separate.' But he was confident the Security Council would reach agreement early this week on a resolution to use 'all necessary means' to ensure safe passage for humanitarian relief. He added, however, that the US was not prepared to go beyond the provision of aid. To do so could require use of force. Mr Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, claimed that the US was 'leading the way' and differences with the UK and France over the role and command structure of forces protecting aid convoys would be resolved. There are differences over which countries should commit ground forces if they are used. The US has ruled out such a course - although it would provide air cover for convoys - while European governments still have to agree on levels of commitment. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said he hoped there would be an agreement on a UN resolution 'which will put the emphasis on the escorting, the protection of humanitarian help so that it can be stepped up.' In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he would endorse the use of force under a UN mandate to protect convoys. He also demanded more concerted European Community action to stop the ethnic fighting. The European parliament will today hear from Mr Paul Grossrieder, deputy director of the International Committee of the Red Cross, about the fate of refugees, and the existence of detention camps in Bosnia. The soul-searching by western governments over how to respond to public pressure was reflected in President Bush's press conference on Saturday. He insisted that not one US soldier would be committed without the administration being confident that he would get out again. The president's aides have warned of the US getting into a quagmire of Vietnam proportions. 'We're not going to get bogged down in some guerrilla warfare,' Mr Bush said at his Kennebunkport holiday home. He rejected accusations, particularly from Governor Bill Clinton, his Democrat presidential opponent, that he was reacting too cautiously in the face of a human tragedy. 'If informing the American people step-by-step is not good enough, well, I'm guilty,' said Mr Bush. 'I'm getting sniped at politically, but I will not make one decision based on American politics.' However, with the television networks constantly replaying film of the emaciated prisoners in Serbian detention camps - evocations of the Holocaust in the second world war - and the weight of opinion in newspapers coming down in favour of US action, Mr Bush is in increasing danger of looking as inept internationally as his opponents claim that he is domestically. Further pressure came in the form of a public opinion poll published by Newsweek showing that 53 per cent of Americans would favour a US lead in seeking UN-backed air strikes against Serbian positions. Lady Thatcher, the former British prime minister and erstwhile ally of Mr Bush, added to the pressure in a televised appeal for direct military intervention against the 'Serbian aggressors'.

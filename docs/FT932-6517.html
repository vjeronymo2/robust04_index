			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Suchocka fights for survival MS Hanna Suchocka, Poland's prime minister, yesterday warned that the country's economic reforms would be delayed if her government is toppled in a vote of no confidence this morning. She was speaking in parliament on a Solidarity proposed no confidence motion which, if passed, could lead to new elections. Ms Suchocka said: 'It is a paradox that this debate comes as our economic recovery is becoming ever more apparent.' Industrial output rose 7.6 per cent in the first four months of this year. Solidarity, which normally supports the coalition, called the no-confidence vote in protest at the government's refusal to award pay rises to striking health workers and teachers. Mr Aloyzy Pietrzyk, a Solidarity official, said: 'This coalition government has for the past 11 months implemented policies which represent capitalism with an inhuman face.' Today's vote could see the six-party coalition scrape by with a thin majority after the small PL farmer's group, which recently left the government in protest at its agricultural policies, decided yesterday to abstain. Parliament's voting rules mean that abstentions in the 460-seat chamber amount to a vote in favour of the government. No party appears to have enough seats or allies in parliament to form a stronger coalition than Ms Suchocka's. Yesterday President Lech Walesa described Ms Suchocka as 'the best prime minister we have had until now'. This implied that were the government to fall he would ask her to try to form a new cabinet. He also hinted that he would not dissolve parliament if the no-confidence motion succeeded. A recent opinion survey showed 41 per cent wanted a cabinet reshuffle while retaining Ms Suchocka as the head of government. Another 31 per cent wanted new elections while 5 per cent wanted the present government unchanged. Just 6 per cent want to see a government headed by President Walesa.</p>

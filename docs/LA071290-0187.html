			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR BLASTS NEA, AWARDS $3 MILLION IN CITY FUNDS;  </P> <P> ARTS CONTROVERSY: BRADLEY JOINS THE GROWING NATIONAL PROTEST AGAINST GRANT  DENIALS. SOME OF THOSE IN THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT DRAMA ARE AWARDED CITY FUNDS.  </P> <P> Saying rejection of National Endowment for the Arts grants to four performance  artists "amounts to an obscenity," Mayor Tom Bradley joined a national protest  Wednesday demanding that those grants be awarded.  </P> <P> Bradley took the position at a press conference where he also announced winners  of more than $3 million in city cultural grants, a list that included several  artists and arts organizations caught up in the endowment's controversy.  </P> <P> The mayor's meeting occurred as press conferences were held in Seattle and New  York at which local city officials and artists attempted to turn up the heat on  endowment Chairman John E. Frohnmayer and political opponents of the endowment.  </P> <P> At the endowment in Washington, a spokeswoman said there would be no statement  on the situation from Frohnmayer, who has been unavailable since he announced  rejection of the four grants.  </P> <P> The endowment has given no reason for the fellowship rejections, insisting that  internal endowment policies preclude such public explanations. However, many  observers say Frohnmayer denied the grants to quell a political furor created  by conservatives angered over the sometimes explicit and politically charged  content of the work of the four artists involved. Frohnmayer denied the grants  after polling an unknown number of the endowment's 24-member advisory board.  </P> <P> Bradley said the City Hall press conference was intended to emphasize "our  outrage at the actions of the NEA." The mayor demanded reversal of the actions  by Frohnmayer, saying the chairman's fitness to remain in office may be open to  question. "I want (Frohnmayer) to take an action to show me that he deserves to  stay there," Bradley said.  </P> <P> Appearing with Bradley and City Councilman Joel Wachs were performance artists  Tim Miller and John Fleck, two of the four grantees rejected nearly two weeks  ago. Fleck and Miller, along with New York performers Karen Finley and Holly  Hughes, jointly announced the filing of appeals.  </P> <P> Appeals of grant denials are so rare that endowment officials have said  established procedures may be so vague that the new situation could overwhelm  the appeal mechanism. Potential grantees denied funding normally have 30 days  to appeal such rulings.  </P> <P> The press conference also included a statement by performance artist Rachel  Rosenthal, who received -- then turned down -- an $11,250 endowment fellowship  in the category in which the four other artists were rejected.  </P> <P> Bradley and Adolfo Nodal, director of the Cultural Affairs Department, said  that Miller, Fleck and Rosenthal were already receiving city arts funding, and  were thus ineligible for this round. Bradley and Nodal emphasized that the city  grant program was intended to encourage art in all media that addresses  politically and socially sensitive issues.  </P> <P> Also in attendance was choreographer Bella Lewitzky, who recently turned down  $72,000 in endowment funding because she refused to sign an anti-obscenity  certification required of all endowment grantees this year. The city grant  announcement issued by Bradley showed that Lewitzky received $27,000.  </P> <P> The city's grants also include a $2,555 award to artist Cheri Gaulke, who was  recently targeted in an investigation by the U.S. General Accounting Office  demanded by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the endowment's most visible political  opponent. Helms demanded that the GAO obtain the dates when Gaulke and several  other artists showed work or performed at two New York City arts spaces over a  six-year period.  </P> <P> The city also awarded money for a variety of activist arts organizations that  have been visible players in the endowment controversy, including PEN Center  USA West ($14,000), Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions ($35,000) and the  Otis/Parsons Art Institute ($23,200), whose institutional parent, the New  School for Social Research in New York City, rejected a $45,000 grant and is  suing the endowment to try to invalidate the anti-obscenity certification.  </P> <P> Elsewhere:  </P> <P> * More than 70 arts organizations released a joint statement in New York  calling on Frohnmayer to reverse his decision on the four disputed grants, all  of which involve performance artists who deal directly with gay or sexual  political issues and most of whom occasionally appear partially unclothed  during their performances. The statement was signed by such mainstream groups  as the American Arts Alliance, American Symphony Orchestra League, Artists'  Equity, American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, Lincoln Center,  Dance USA and Chamber Music America.  </P> <P> * Fourteen of the 18 performance artists originally recommended for fellowships  -- including the four rejected grantees -- released a statement saying "we are  appalled, dismayed and angered by the cynical and clearly political decision."  The rejections, the statement charged, were issued "to appease the homophobic,  misogynist and racist agenda of the far right minority who, in demanding  blacklisting, are not only destroying the integrity of the NEA but are,  reminiscent of the demagogues of the 1950s, eroding the First Amendment rights  of all Americans."  </P> <P> * The seven-member endowment review panel that recommended the grants in the  first place issued a new protest statement saying its members stand by all of  their recommendations, including the four rejected by Frohnmayer, and saying  the panel members deplore the action "and the political manipulations which  prompted it." The panel said the episode has "done great damage to the artists  involved . . . and to the National Endowment for the Arts itself." The panel  members said they, too, would support the artists' appeals.  </P> <P> * In separate press statements, New York Mayor David Dinkins and Seattle Mayor  Norman B. Rice said they joined with Bradley in demanding that Frohnmayer act  to reverse the grant denials. Rice said he was pleased that Miller and Hughes  had just performed at his city's Goodwill Arts Festival and he charged that the  rejected grantees "have been singled out for political reasons, not aesthetic  ones." Dinkins said: "We must fight restrictions on creative endeavor, or the  concept of artistic freedom will wither under the dark cloud of censorship."  </P> <P> "We are joining with (the New York and Seattle mayors) to express our  opposition to Mr. Frohnmayer's action and to ask that these applicants be  reconsidered," Bradley said. Wachs, an arts supporter on the City Council,  declared that "the arts have to be free in order to survive" and warned of "a  dark and ominous cloud that threatens . . . artistic freedom."  </P> <P> In announcing the city arts grants, Nodal -- himself a former endowment  official -- said the Los Angeles winners represent "the best in American art  today." He said that the selections had been made by a series of peer review  panels with uncompromising ethics, charged with selecting the best art in the  region, regardless of politics, sexual orientation or potential for  controversy.  </P> <P> "This is what the endowment used to do," Nodal said. "We've lost that with the  endowment."  </P> <P> Rosenthal said that she and her parents had escaped from her native France in  the late 1930s as the Nazi threat developed. "It's a really difficult period. I  would not want to live anywhere else," she said of the United States. But, she  said, "I find that suddenly, I am being called upon to sign my name to a  statement . . . that I may in the future be found to have created and produced  obscenities.  </P> <P> "That, itself, is an obscenity."  </P></p>

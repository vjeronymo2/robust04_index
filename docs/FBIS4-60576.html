			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] After Syria reiterated that the Israeli position  has continued to shift further away from the requirements of the  peace process that was launched in Madrid, and noted that a  gaping gulf separated the Syrian and Israeli postures, Rabin  govenment officials hastend to spread a false sense of optimism,  claiming that the talks have not been deadlocked and the  differences are bridgeable. They also raised the possibility of  yet another Middle East shuttle by U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher next month.    Although Syria has consistently expressed its appreciation  for the American efforts and showed its deep concern for the  peace process to continue in order to promote a just and  comprehensive Middle East peace based on UN resolutions and the  land-for-peace formula, Syria is equally anxious to bring  Israel's unyielding stubborness to the attention of the world  community.    There has been a lapse of more than two and one half years  since the Washington talks; Mr. Christopher has made numerous  tours of the region; Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clintion  held a summit in Geneva; and Syria has declared its readiness to  set up firm and honorable peace in the region and to be  obligated by all its requirements. Israel, however, still  refuses to commit itself to a total pullout from the Golan  Heights, thus thwarting all efforts and dashing all hopes that  the peace process on the Syrian-israeli track may be propelled  forward. Ever since the Madrid conference, Syria has let no  occasion pass without reiterating that the Golan Heights are not  subject to bargaining and that Israel will have to pull out from  the entire territory. Indeed, many Israeli officials have said  that peace with Syria seems to be an impossibility short of a  total pullout from the Golan Heights.    When the Rabin govenment turns down the principle of total  withdrawal, Syria takes this to mean that Israel rejects peace.  Syria adheres to every grain of sand on the occupied Golan  Heights. The territory's soil has a special sacredness to Syria  and to the Golan's displaced population, who are waiting to  return to their homes and reclaim their property and  rehabilitate what was destroyed by invading Israeli forces.    The UN Security Council resolutions are clear and  unambiguous. These resolutions state the inadmissibility of the  acquisition of territory by force, bar change to its character  or any tampering with its identity and history. They further  call for Israel's publlback to the 1967 lines. The American  initiative that led to the convening of the Madrid conference  was based on the UN Security Council resolutions and the  land-for-peace formula and a just and comprehensive peace on all  front of the dispute.    If Israel goes out of its way to maneuver and blackmail by  refusing to commit itself to a total pullout from the Golan  Heights, it is now universally acknowledged that Syria will not  bow to any form of blackmail or be dragged behind any  maneuvering or budge an inch from its adherence to its land and  rights. Peace is contigent on the entire Golan Heights being  handed back to Syria and an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967  lines. Syria will not renounce an iota of its land or rights.  Israel alone must take the responsibility for the failed peace  efforts and for sabotaging the American initiative on account of  its procrastination and prevarication. Israel is taking a stand  against the substance of the peace process, this being its  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.    The American secretary of state's return to the Middle East  in a new effort will not yield any results unless it is coupled  with a substantive shift in the Israeli position. In other  words, Israel must commit itself to the principle of a total  withdrawal from the occupied territories and the strict  implementation of Security Council resolutions and international  law rather than the law of the jungle -- the law of occupation  and expansion.    The question is not one of bridging the Israeli and Syrian  positions as the Rabin government would have us believe. More  to the point is to convince the Tel Aviv rulers to submit to UN  resolutions and international law and the values of right and  justice. Syria has always obligated itself to UN resolutions.  Israel alone defies these resolutions and devalues international  conventions. The world community never sanctioned the  occupation of other nations' territory by force. Nor does it  sanction any change to the character of any occupied land.  Israel has no choice by to effect a complete withdrawal from  the occupied territories if it really wants to see a just and  firm peace prevail in the Middle East, as its rulers keep  claiming.</p>

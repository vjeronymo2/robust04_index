			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] has come up with a procedure for controlling textile  imports. MITI will set up an investigation committee within the  ministry, and at the request of the domestic textile industry,  the committee will investigate textile trade to judge whether  the domestic textile industry is seriously damaged and hold  bilateral negotiations with a trade partner. After the  negotiations, it will decide on whether it will restrict textile  imports. European nations and the United States have safeguard  measures under which they can unilaterally restrict imports of  textile products if it exceeds certain volume. In contrast,  MITI's procedure places more emphasis on bilateral negotiations  rather than automatically and unilaterally taking safeguard  measures. Underlying this policy is that Japan hopes to  maintain good political relations with Asian nations, which are  major textile exporters to Japan.    The committee, which will be jointly led by chiefs of MITI's  International Trade Policy Bureau and Consumer Goods Industries  Bureau, will conduct investigations to determine if it is  necessary to invoke its import control procedures. The  committee will release its investigation results after hearing  opinions from the Export-Import Transaction Council as well as  from consumers and the distribution industry. After the  investigation report's release, the committee will launch  negotiations with a trade partner.    Such a procedure will be Japan's own safeguard based on the  GATT Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA). Although Japan's procedure  meets international rules, it is unprecedented for Japan, who  has become the world's second-largest economic superpower owing  to the free trade system, to establish a protectionist procedure.    However, since the import restriction does not suit Japan's  principle of maintaining the free trade system, MITI plans to  give priority to taking other measures such as antidumping  measures if applicable.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: NONFICTION  </P> <P> SAM WALTON: The Inside Story of America's Richest Man by Vance H. Trimble (E.P.  Dutton: $19.95; 319 pp.). Sam Walton, billionaire head of the Arkansas-based  Wal-Mart retailing chain, readily admits to being aided by good luck -- a luck  that extends, it turns out, to his first biographer, who has written a virtual  hagiography.  </P> <P> "Sam Walton," by fellow Arkansan Vance Trimble, is unauthorized in name only:  The real-life Walton no doubt resembles the inspiring, hard-working, just-folks  executive depicted here, but the author's rose-colored perspective is a bit  hard to take. Trimble, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, often places  problematic details in a positive light. He is little troubled, for example, by  the tendency of new Wal-Marts to drive existing mom-and-pop stores out of  business. It should be noted, too, that Walton never was America's richest man,  Forbes magazine having failed for years to separate Sam's fortune from that of  his family -- a fact this book's publisher conveniently glosses over.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr--"Accords on the division of the  Russian and Ukrainian Navies based on the shores of the Black  Sea coast will be reached within 10 days." Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk said this after the conclusion of talks held  today between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations at the  President Hotel in Moscow.    According to Kravchuk, the two sides "have instructed the  Foreign Ministries to begin preparing a full-scale treaty  between Russia and Ukraine." He said that "a protocol stating  the intention of the two countries to cooperate in the  military-technological sphere was signed by them for the first  time".    Kravchuk also said that the question of the resignation of  Black Sea Fleet Commander [Eduard] Baltin had not been discussed  but that "the Ukrainian side did not insist, as a matter of  principle, on his resignation at the talks that took place."  Kravchuk said that accords had been reached with regard to the  location of the two countries' naval forces and that their  parameters had been established in percentage terms.    Summing up today's talks, he added: "There are no issues  between Ukraine and Russia that we are unable to resolve. We  have fully resolved all problems that existed in our bilateral  relations."</p>

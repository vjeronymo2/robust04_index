A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that the DPRK had  fully accepted nuclear inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) within the time limits set under an accord  between the two sides.    He noted that the inspections were implemented on the basis  of full discussions between IAEA inspectors and DPRK  administrative personnel at the country's nuclear facilities.    He also said all the problems emerging during the  inspections  have been solved satisfactorily under the IAEA's requirements,  which has been recognized by the authority.    The spokesman added that during inter-Korean working-level  contacts aimed at realizing an exchange of special envoys, the  DPRK unilaterally took a resolute and magnanimous attitude so as  to pave the way for that procedure.    However, he said, the United States had failed to carry out  its own commitments. "The U.S. introduced two additional  prerequisites when announcing the suspension of joint military  exercises" added the spokesman.    They were that the nuclear inspections by IAEA must be  implemented satisfactorily and exchanges of North-South Korean  envoys be realized.    "The United States still insists on these two prerequisites  and it is by no means justifiable" the spokesman said.    He reiterated that if the United States did not carry out  its  own agreed commitments, the DPRK would regard it as a break-down  of communications and would take appropriate measures, including  suspending inter-Korean working-level contacts and refusing to  attend the third-round of U.S.-DPRK meetings scheduled for  Geneva.</p>

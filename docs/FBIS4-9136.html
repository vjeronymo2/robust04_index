			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oana Stanciulescu: "Iliescu-Milosevic Agreement </F> -- As Soon as Sanctions Are Lifted, Bega Canal Will Become Free  Trade Zone"]    [Text) "One of the quickest ways of reviving the Yugoslav  economy is to use the infrastructure of Romanian industries,  which are largely complementary with the Yugoslav industries,"  said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at the recent meeting  with Premier Vacaroiu. The Yugoslav economists, the Foreign  Ministry's note reads, believe that for the complete revival of  economic productive departments one needs a minimum of 18 years,  something that from a social viewpoint is inconceivable.    In these conditions, one hopes for Serbian-Romanian  cooperation, mainly in the areas of metallurgy, machine  building, electrical engineering, electronics, chemicals, and  the pharmaceuticals industry. By starting with these actions as  soon as sanctions are lifted, the exchange might reach a volume  of 1 billion dollars by 1995. In this way, the revival of the  Yugoslav economy could be completed by the year 2000 and the  Romanian economy could make up for the losses suffered as a  result of the dismantling of the CEMA market and loosening of  relations with the CIS.    The aforementioned note also mentions that the Romanian side  expressed agreement with the cooperation projects presented by  the Serbian guests. However, it insisted that they should take  place only when sanctions are lifted, because currently the UN  Committee 724 sometimes shows a totally unjustified rigidity  toward any commercial operation with Yugoslavia.    At the meeting of the two countries' presidents, when the  sides examined the results of the talks, the Serbian side  launched the idea of building a free trade zone along the Bega  Canal [which crosses Timisoara], as soon as international  political conditions permit it. Considering that the idea of  creating certain free economic zones is a long-standing wish of  President Iliescu's, it was regarded with great interest and  will be implemented as soon as possible.</p>

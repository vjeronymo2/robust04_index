			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown campaigns for the positive vote MR PADDY Ashdown last night attacked head-on the charge that a Liberal Democrat vote was a wasted vote and predicted that neither Labour nor the Tories would govern Britain alone if their vote fell as low as 38 per cent. At a rally in Rochdale, Lancashire, Mr Ashdown sought to build on the advance in his party's poll standing, saying: 'It is the Liberal Democrats who can make the difference in this election.' Pre-empting the counter-attack he expects from the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrat leader said it was 'nonsense' to say a vote for his party would let Labour in - he cited Rochdale as an example, where the retiring Liberal Democrat MP, Sir Cyril Smith, had kept Labour out. 'A vote for the Liberal Democrats will stop a repetition of the poll tax and stop Labour's renationalisation plans. A Liberal Democrat vote is a positive vote.' Earlier Mr Ashdown came the closest yet to forecasting a coalition government. He said: 'It seems to me practically inconceivable that someone would seek to govern the country on 37 per cent or 38 per cent of the vote.' Liberal Democrat strategists are privately jubilant at the apparent dip in Labour and Tory support and their own upswing. But they were forced to counter reports of divisions in the party over the timetable it would insist on for electoral reform - the absolute pre-condition for their support. They said a promise of legislation in the Queen's Speech for a system based on proportionality remained essential. Mr Charles Kennedy, party president, and Mr David Steel, former Liberal leader, had appeared to indicate at the weekend they might accept a slower process. Mr Ashdown - who is determined to avoid Liberal Democrat policies becoming overshadowed by detailed, but so far hypothetical, arguments about PR - is publicly indifferent about whether a pact is more likely with Labour than with the Tories. Yesterday he hinted he may find it easier to work with Conservatives on a pro-European policy. 'John Major would have no difficulty in ditching the (Maastricht) opt-out and make it clear that he is going for monetary union,' he said.</p>

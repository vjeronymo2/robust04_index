Regional secretary Lerumo Kalako said on Saturday  Dr Boesak was one of the front-runners for the regional  premiership by virtue of his position as regional chairman of  the ANC, a post to which he was recently unanimously re-elected.    He dismissed as "mischievous" reports that Dr Boesak had  suffered a setback in his bid to head the western Cape regional  government and said the order of appearance on the list did not  influence a candidate's chances for the premiership. Mr Kalako  said the ANC's western Cape region had invited nominations for  the premiership from all its structures and affiliates and would  elect a candidate before the movement's national election list  conference on January 15.    The region's lists of nominees to the National Assembly and  the provincial legislature were released at a press conference  at the University of the Western Cape [UWC] on Saturday.    Dr Boesak's name is 12th on the provincial list and fourth  on  the list of candidates for the National Assembly.    The regional list is headed by Executive Committee member Ms  Zou Kota, followed by REC [regional executive committee]  colleagues Cameron Dugmore, Vincent Diba, Lerumo Kalako, Johnny  Issel, Hilda Ndude, Chris Nissen, Ebrahim Rasool and National  Executive Committee member Reggie September.    Others nominated for the regional parliament are Dr Boesak's  former wife, Dorothy; former ANC western Cape secretary Tony  Yengeni; NEC members Dullah Omar, Trevor Manuel and Albie Sachs;  ANC-aligned MPs Jan van Eck and Jannie Momberg; Mrs Adelaide  Tambo, widow of late ANC Chairman Oliver Tambo; Peninsula  Technikon Rector Franklin Sonn and academics Rob Davies and  Colin Bundy.    Topping the list of nominees for the national assembly is  civil rights lawyer and ANC regional spokesman on constitutional  affairs Johnny de Lange. His name is followed by that of South  African Municipal Workers' Union leader Salie Manie; ANC  constitutional negotiator Dullah Omar; Dr Boesak; Mr Yengeni;  trade unionist Daniel Oliphant; regional office-bearers Vincent  Diba, Lerumo Kalako and Zou Kota and UWC Professor Rob Davies.    Other names on the national list are NEC [National Executive  Committee] members Kader Asmal, Thozamile Botha and Trevor  Manuel; SA Democratic Teachers' Union general secretary Randall  van den Heever; ANC MP David Dalling; Mrs Dorothy Boesak and  Labour Party MPs Ken Lategan and James Swiegelaar.    ANC regional head of information and publicity Bulelani  Ngcuka said the ANC had "made every attempt" to inform those  nominated. "We have tried our best to contact everyone, but it  could be that there are one or two names on the list who have  not yet been consulted. There is, however, still an opportunity  for people to withdraw their names if they do not wish to be  nominees."    Mr Kalako said both lists were still subject to adjustment,  particularly with regard to the "affirmative action principle"  that women should make up one-third of the candidates. The  region would also try to ensure that all communities and social  sectors, such rural people, were fairly represented in its lists  of nominees.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Fisons shares hit by news of halted development FISONS, the troubled pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments group, yesterday revealed that development on its most promising compound had been halted in a move casting fresh doubt on the company's long-term independence. Fisons' shares fell 13 per cent from 194p to 169p in heavy trading. 'We are bloody but unbowed,' said Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive. 'This is a disappointment, but it would be utterly premature to write Fisons off as a small but useful company in pharmaceuticals. Engineering of a full-scale merger with another company is not on the board's agenda.' The company was stopping development on tipredane, a steroid treatment for asthma, because the drug had failed to show sufficient efficacy in trials. Possibilities of a hostile bid following the announcement were dismissed by analysts. 'This is hugely bad news for the company. It blows a hole in its development pipeline,' said Mr Nigel Barnes, pharmaceuticals analyst at Hoare Govett. Last year the company stressed only two products in its development pipeline, one of which was tipredane. Mr Scroggs would fill the gap left by tipredane by licensing in an asthma drug from another company. 'We have had lots of offers of other drugs in recent months that we have turned away. We will go back to those groups.' Fisons does not have a specialist salesforce to market its next most promising compound, an anti-epileptic product called remacemide which is not expected to be launched until 1998. Lex, Page 20</p>

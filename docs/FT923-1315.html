			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Lenders plan 3/4 -point cut in mortgages BUILDING societies yester-day prepared to trim their mortgage interest rates by about  3/4 of a percentage point in the wake of the latest cut in base rates. National Savings responded by cutting the returns on its variable products by 1 per cent and withdrawing its fixed-rate products from sale. Northern Rock, the 11th-largest building society, and Leeds Permanent, the fifth-biggest, broke ranks with the rest of the industry by reducing their rates yesterday. Leeds Permanent's mortgage interest rate went down from 10.70 per cent to 9.95 per cent with immediate effect for new borrowers and from next month for existing borrowers. Northern Rock cut its rates from 10.75 per cent to 9.99 per cent. The reduction will save a customer with a Pounds 50,000 mortgage about Pounds 55 a month. The other large mortgage lenders indicated that they were contemplating similar cuts in mortgage interest rates - but said they would wait to see how the money markets settled before making a move. Abbey National and Halifax, the two largest UK lenders, both indicated that they would be making reductions, but declined to say when. Halifax said it would 'wait to see how the money markets settle' before deciding what cut it would make in its mortgage rates. Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Leeds Permanent, said: 'The antics of the last few days must have left people pretty angry and bewildered, so a rate cut will go some way towards making them feel better.' Some lenders said that they hoped there might be a second cut in base rates before long, enabling them to lower rates even further in the near future. Mr Peter White, chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest society, said: 'We will almost certainly be making a cut of about  3/4 of a percentage point. We hope that it will cause a revival in the market, but we are also hoping that there may be a further 1 per cent cut which will bring rates down to 8 per cent and enable mortgage rates to drop further.' Mr David Roebuck, chief executive of Barnsley Building Society, said: 'At last we have some good news for the beleaguered housing market. We can expect lower mortgage rates to stimulate activity.' A cut of  3/4 of a percentage point in mortgage rates will mean that mortgage lenders have slightly widened the margin between their rates to borrowers and those to investors, restoring them to a full 1 percentage point above base rate. That brings the margin on their lending back to where it was in February when Abbey National trimmed its margins to  3/4 of a percentage point, forcing other lenders to follow suit. The latest round of cuts may not be equally good news for all types of mortgage lenders. Societies now show signs of moving towards a new set of interest charge bands for mortgages. The losers are likely to be first-time borrowers and customers with very large mortgages who may find that the discounts they have been offered up until now are largely eroded. The rate on the National Savings investment account will fall from 8.25 per cent to 7.25 per cent, as from October 6, and the return on income bonds will drop from 9 per cent to 8 per cent, as from November 5. The products withdrawn from sale from 5.30pm yesterday were: 38th issue of fixed interest certificates; Series E Capital bonds; First Option bonds; Issue C Children's Bonus Bonds; and the Yearly Plan. New rates will be announced shortly. There will not necessarily be cuts of 1 percentage point across the board because of the tax-free nature of many of the products. The 5th index-linked savings certificates, which pay a tax-free 4.5 per cent plus inflation if held for five years, remain on sale. The attractive rates offered by National Savings products aroused controversy during the summer when building societies claimed they were suffering outflows of capital because of 'unfair' competition. National Savings promptly reduced the return on the First Option Bond and made across-the-board cuts in August. During the current financial year, National Savings has raised about Pounds 2.4bn, helping the government to fund the public-sector borrowing requirement.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           MORTGAGE REPAYMENTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Rate at 10.70%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MORTGAGE SIZE                    ENDOWMENT          REPAYMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds  50,000              Pounds  378.96     Pounds  417.08 Pounds  60,000              Pounds  468.13     Pounds  513.87 Pounds  70,000              Pounds  557.30     Pounds  610.66 Pounds  80,000              Pounds  646.46     Pounds  707.45 Pounds  90,000              Pounds  735.63     Pounds  804.24 Pounds 100,000              Pounds  824.80     Pounds  901.03 Pounds 120,000              Pounds 1003.13     Pounds 1094.61 Pounds 150,000              Pounds 1270.63     Pounds 1384.98 Pounds 200,000              Pounds 1716.46     Pounds 1868.93  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Rate at 9.95%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds  50,000              Pounds  352.41     Pounds  395.10 Pounds  60,000              Pounds  435.33     Pounds  486.55 Pounds  70,000              Pounds  518.25     Pounds  578.01 Pounds  80,000              Pounds  601.16     Pounds  669.46 Pounds  90,000              Pounds  684.08     Pounds  760.91 Pounds 100,000              Pounds  767.00     Pounds  852.37 Pounds 120,000              Pounds  932.83     Pounds 1035.28 Pounds 150,000              Pounds 1181.58     Pounds 1309.64 Pounds 200,000              Pounds 1596.16     Pounds 1766.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: a top 10 building society  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

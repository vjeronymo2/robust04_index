			<p>BFN     [Text] President Yeltsin has signed a decree "On Measures  to Protect the Interests of Citizens During the Transition From  Voucher to Cash Privatization," setting the rules to privatize  state enterprises until a new state program for post-voucher  privatization is adopted.    The decree says that after July 1 the shares of enterprises  which have been registered before that deadline shall be sold at  auctions and stock exchanges.    The decree says that the labor collectives of enterprises  corporatized before July 1 retain all the benefits established  by the privatization program.    The post-voucher privatization program setting the rules of  privatization as of July 1, 1994 is to be put into effect by a  presidential decree before June 31. However, according to the  Deputy Chairman of the State Property Committee Dmitry Vasiliev  the program had not yet been submitted to President Yeltsin for  signature late Monday night.</p>

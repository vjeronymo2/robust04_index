			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Letters the Editor: Curious and curiouser Sir, Thank you for featuring Sir Peter Hall as 'Minister for a Day' (November 13/14). To imagine - however briefly - a situation where the arts were administered effectively, rather than just cheaply, was a delight, even though under the present regime it must seem a curious fantasy. Less curious, though, than the brand of economics favoured by Ian Hargreaves in his 'Why the BBC should be privatised'. 'Although at Pounds 83 a year the licence fee does not look expensive today,' he writes, 'it will come to seem so when up-rated steadily in line with inflation.' Really. Noting that he is your deputy, Sir, I do wonder whether this thinking will determine your future pricing policy? Alexander John, 5 Birchmead, Watford, Herts WD1 3RU</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Germans await lottery news About 40m lottery addicts in Germany - and thousands in neighbouring Austria, Switzerland and France - were anxiously waiting to find out today whether any of them had won the country's lottery, whose jackpot has risen to DM42m (Pounds 17.5m). The numbers were drawn on television on Saturday night, but the country won't know until today whether one or more winners will claim the prize - or whether the jackpot will grow yet again. The jackpot has already risen to its highest level in the 40-year history of the lottery; it has kept rising for 11 weeks because no-one marked all the winning numbers on their cards. The 'lotto' frenzy has reached such proportions that the finance ministry in Bonn had to issue a statement last week following a TV satire that suggested Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, was all set to bend the rules of the game and use the jackpot to plug gaping holes in the budget.</p>

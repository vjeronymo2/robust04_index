			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Vocational courses move back into the classroom - Qualifications The educational task set out is among the most revolutionary attempted in the past 50 years - to put vocational courses back into secondary schools and to give every pupil experience of the workplace before they are 16. The aim is to develop a coherent 'vocational path' for children beyond the age of 14, reversing the trend against school-based vocational education dating back to before the second world war. 'By the year 2000 the 16-year-old school-leaver will be as dead as the dodo,' said Mr John Patten, education secretary. However, few of the measures are new. They broadly confirm or reinforce existing policies, notably those set out in the Dearing report on the school curriculum published in January and since accepted by the government. Two new policies concern work experience and careers guidance for pupils in England and Wales - broadly similar policies will be introduced in Scotland, allowing for the differences in structures: In the year before GCSEs all pupils are to receive a week of work experience, and all pupils aged 16 to 18 in full-time education will receive another week. The government has given the 128 local Education and Business Partnerships the job of meeting the objective, in conjunction with schools. Over three years to 1997/98, Pounds 23m will be provided to help fulfil this goal. Pupils will be guaranteed independent careers guidance between the ages of 11 and 18, and in particular at three points: at 13 on GCSE options; at 15 on post-16 choices; and at 17 on post-18 options. Until now the Careers Service has concentrated on advising and placing 16-year-old school-leavers, with advice on educational options left to schools and colleges. The move is likely to be welcomed by pupils and parents unsure of the maze of qualifications and institutions offering education or training. The guarantee is to be phased in over the three years to 1997/98, at a cost of Pounds 87m to the government, as part of its restructuring of the careers service. Although the decision to create post-14 'vocational paths' in schools is not new, the paper spells out in more detail than previously the form they will take. A new 'general diploma' will be introduced from next year in England and Wales, awarded to 16-year-olds gaining GCSEs at grades A to C in English, maths, science and two other subjects, or vocational equivalents. The new vocational options are intended particularly for the 60 per cent of 16-year-olds who fail to gain five GCSE passes at grades A to C. The vocational component of the 'general diploma' is likely to take the form of 'part one general national vocational qualifications' (GNVQs). Pupils will chose from a range of subjects, from manufacturing to leisure and tourism, and each GNVQ will count as two GCSEs. The first courses will be piloted next year. The 'part one GNVQs' are intended to lead on to 'intermediate' or 'advanced' level GNVQs, the latter with A-level status. The reform will take GNVQs into schools to a degree not envisaged before the Dearing report, when they were seen primarily as post-16 qualifications geared largely to those with low achievement levels at GCSE. Although post-16 GNVQs were launched only two years ago and have become widely available only this year, there are 88,000 pupils on such courses - about one in seven of all post-16 students. A Pounds 5m-a-year voucher scheme is to be introduced to provide new head teachers with management skills. An estimated 2,000 teachers a year will receive vouchers to a value of Pounds 2,500 over two years. Employers' organisations and teachers' associations generally welcomed the moves. However, concern was voiced at funding implications and the danger that GNVQs would be seen as 'second best'.</p>

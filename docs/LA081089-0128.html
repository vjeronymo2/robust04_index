			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> TRAVIS, OSLIN'S SMOOTH AND EASY OUTING  </P> <P> Randy Travis might look a little like James Dean, but when he delivers a song  he's like Spencer Tracy at work: no apparent effort, no visible technique, just  utter devotion to and absorption in the role.  </P> <P> On stage Tuesday at the Universal Amphitheatre, Travis didn't monkey with his  strength. He toyed with some melodies a little more than he does on record, but  he kept it clean and simple. He flashed no eccentricities, he didn't employ any  mannerisms or quirks as an easy signature. Travis doesn't have the flourishes  of a Willie Nelson, but like Nelson he goes straight to the song's truth.  </P> <P> That by itself doesn't explain why Travis has dominated country music for the  past few years, but it's the cornerstone of his reign. Adherence to country's  original musical values and an ear for good songs are other parts of it. Good  looks don't hurt.  </P> <P> But the country field is full of hunks with good voices and traditional sounds.  Travis' deep connection with his audience can probably be attributed to an  anti-macho stance that makes him the answer to a woman's prayers.  </P> <P> After a 1986 debut album drowning in remorse and self-laceration, Travis hit  his keynote vein in his second LP, whose title could be his thematic banner:  "Always &amp; Forever." He's the guy who's learned his lesson and wants back  in, the man who will make that permanent commitment.  </P> <P> He might be too good to be true, but at the Amphitheatre, where he was opening  a three-night stand with new country queen K. T. Oslin as the opening act,  Travis made it all seem real and easy.  </P> <P> The risers and the music stands, with their wood paneling and the RT logo,  enhanced the traditional, tasteful tone and gave Travis and his six musicians  the look of a band at a lakeside lodge in the '50s. The singer's long, corny  jokes (remember the one about the lady in the tight dress getting on the bus?)  made him seem like one of those amiable entertainers at the early Grand Ole  Opry.  </P> <P> In image, Travis is a country anomaly: fine-featured and delicate-looking, with  a slanting smile and liquid eyes, he looks like a grown-up Huck Finn, or a  Saturday matinee cowboy hero, or maybe even a backwoods sprite.  </P> <P> You definitely don't picture him loading logs onto the pickup or brawling in  the roadhouse parking lot. But the grainy voice that comes out sounds as if it  belongs to someone altogether older, huskier and more battered by life.  </P> <P> The prevailing mood was upbeat as No. 1 hit followed No. 1 hit, with the  pledges of permanence and devotion overshadowing the accounts of regret and  revenge. Fiddles and pedal steel set the twangy tone, and Travis tempered his  country orthodoxy with a little swing, a little jump blues and a touch of Tin  Pan Alley. His one notable departure was a version of Brook Benton's 1959  R&amp;B ballad hit "It's Just a Matter of Time."  </P> <P> His one misstep was a final encore trilogy of "Dixie," "Battle Hymn of the  Republic" and "All My Trials," offered before an Old Glory backdrop. It was  like a bad dream mashing Merle Haggard together with Neil Diamond, and it  represented a leap from the genuine and intimate to the facile and grandiose  that even someone as gifted as Travis couldn't make.  </P> <P> If Travis evokes a Spencer Tracy comparison, K. T. Oslin came on like a brassy  Rosalind Russell, a big-voiced pop belter whose music often touches down far  from any country motifs. Like Travis, Oslin -- whose primary strength is her  songwriting -- goes against country stereotypes: She's not young, she's not  petite, and she's certainly not pliant.  </P> <P> In fact, Oslin represents an almost frighteningly aggressive new country woman,  ogling younger men and requesting "round the clock lovin'." Her stage persona  was appropriately determined and defiant, and like Travis she clearly  establishes special bonds with her audience.  </P></p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Arts: Caro triumphs in Rome - William Packer admires the girders adorning the Markets of Trajan SIR ANTHONY Caro now occupies a unique position in British art. Conspicuous in a generation of sculptors itself conspicuously talented - it includes such luminaries as Paolozzi, Dalwood, Turnbull, Butler, Armitage, Meadows, Chadwick, Kneale - that emerged in the immediate post-war years, he stands alone, secure in a critical reputation that has continued virtually without question these past 30 years. Abroad, the powerful critical voices Michael Fried and Clement Greenberg were loud in his praise, accepting him as the peer of David Smith and setting him into the wider context of current American art, most especially the colour-field and post-painterly minimalism of such as Kenneth Noland and Frank Stella. At home, he turned the sculpture school of the old St Martin's School of Art into a forcing house of younger talent, from King and Tucker to Flanagan and Long. In short, since the late 1960s and the retrospective that was the Hayward Gallery's inaugural show, his has been a truly international reputation and more general influence of a kind that his sometime mentor, Henry Moore, came to command only in later middle age. Henry Moore was 74 when, almost 20 years ago, the city of Florence honoured him with a magnificent retrospective exhibition, set out in the open air in the Belvedere, high above the city. And now, at 68, it is Caro's turn, and in no less spectacular a setting, though this time in Rome. The Markets of Trajan, built by Apollodorus for the Emperor a little after 100 AD, survive as an extraordinary sequence of galleries, streets and terraces set into the Quirinal Hill high above Trajan's own forum and looking out across the heart of the ancient city to the Forum and the Palatine beyond. The entrance is from the back, by way of the Via IV Novembre, into a large hall beneath a massive vaulted canopy, with the ancient shops and stalls at two levels on either side. A broader stair goes down to the Via Biberatica, corruption of pipera, the street of pepper and no doubt sundry spices, of which the wonderfully worn flagstones lead up past yet more shops onto what is now more or less an open terrace. And it is into this heavily atmospheric and imaginatively potent place, full of ghosts, that the Italian critic, Giovanni Carandente - who was the curator of that Moore exhibition at the Belvedere - was invited by the British Council and the Comune di Roma to put his selection of the work of Anthony Caro, to cover the years from 1960 to the present day. It is evident at once that this must have been the trickiest of undertakings, for any show in this setting must be quite as much a celebration of the place itself as of the work as such. There is little in the way of collective display, and even where a group of works way be seen together, as on the terrace outside, the surviving rectilinear plan imposes its own conceptual isolation. A glimpse here, caught through a door or window, of another piece, and that is all there is of ensemble. The tops or brightly painted flanks of the works from the 1960s, set out on that terrace, may be seen from the road to the Colosseum far below, but there is no question of looking in upon any whole battalion, set out in groups or rows for judicious and comparative review. These works come very much as single spies which, since Caro's shift, around 1960, away from modelling to the formal disposition of given elements, welded or bolted, have been their essential character. We look in upon the work, and into the very space that its component bars and girders, or latterly the bent and folded sheets of metal or slabs of clay, articulate. The experience of the work is thus so focussed that to come upon each piece, set up alone in its little shop, is a positive advantage. The huge and recent 'After Olympia', a free variation upon the temple frieze, that was shown last year at the Tate, now commands the great entrance hall. It is neither dominating nor dominated, yet oddly quiet, for the light is flat and low, drained of colour, and the warm, dark masonry is close to the sombre brown patination of the metal. High above, perched on the upper balcony in the sunlight, sits 'Early One Morning' of 1962, bright scarlet, light, open and emblematic, one of the first pieces by which Caro remade his name. All around to be discovered are the works of these past 30 years, the one imaginatively connected to the other. Here are the variations, the developments, the contradictions, the return to a kind of modelling, albeit in sheet metal, the figurative references both within the imagery and by association in the titles, and then again the denials of such associations. Such are the inevitable complications of the creative life. But here, at the heart of Trajan's Markets in the proximity of the very early and the most recent, the creative thread is implicitly laid out with a touching clarity.

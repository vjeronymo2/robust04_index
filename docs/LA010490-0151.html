			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DELAYS DECISION ON CITYHOOD FOR MALIBU  </P> <P> A judge on Wednesday decided to hear additional arguments Jan. 16 in a lawsuit  filed by Malibu cityhood supporters, who want to force the Los Angeles County  Board of Supervisors to set an incorporation election in Malibu.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs had indicated earlier that she might rule  in the case this week.  </P> <P> However, she decided to continue the matter after a lawyer for cityhood backers  submitted additional briefs in the case.  </P> <P> Incorporation advocates have accused the supervisors of violating a state law  that allows them 60 days from when they began hearing the cityhood matter to  conclude the hearing as a final step before setting an election.  </P> <P> The supervisors began the hearing Oct. 19, but later voted to indefinitely  postpone a decision on incorporation until construction permits are issued for  a sewer system the county wants to build in Malibu.  </P> <P> The lawsuit asks the judge to force the supervisors to finish the hearing,  which would clear the way for them to set an election in April or June.  </P></p>

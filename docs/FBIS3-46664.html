			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- Officials of seven  political parties and organisations including the president of  the Pakistan Socialist Party and the president of the Pakistan  Federation of Trade Unions, released a joint statement on  December 22 in denunciation of the U.S. nuclear threat to Korea.    The statement stresses that the provocative menace and  blackmail posed by the United States against the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea under the pretext of its "nuclear  issue" are a violation of and threat to national sovereignty and  security, which is an act quite contrary to the United Nations  Charter.    It expresses full support to the DPRK's stand on the  negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue and calls upon the  people of the United States and the world to show a positive  response to it.    The Ugandan National Executive Committee of the Seventh  Pan-African Congress in a statement issued on the same day  charges that paying no head to the nuclear arms deployed in  Europe and Israel and other places, the United States is taking  issue with North Korea which is using nuclear facilities for a  peaceful purpose, and maneuvering to remove them.    The statement calls upon the world progressive people to  decisively check such brigandish and aggressive act of the  United States.</p>

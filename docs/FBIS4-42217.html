			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["epd"-signed report: "Bonn Providing DM252 Million for </F> China"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government will provide the  People's Republic of China with 252 million German marks [DM] in  development aid this year. Development cooperation will  continue to concentrate on the fight against poverty, protection  of the environment and resources, and political education, the  Ministry for Economic Cooperation said. Furthermore, as a  result of this year's government talks in Beijing the Federal  Government will subsidize China's economic reforms, as well as  rural telecommunications and energy supply, which have been  impairing economic development. It has been reported that in  these talks the German delegation also pointed out the  importance of individual human rights. Of the DM252 million,  DM168 million will come in the form of low-interest loans, and  DM84 million as an outright grant.</p>

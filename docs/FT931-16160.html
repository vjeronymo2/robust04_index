			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Observer: On the warpath Alfred Kahn, 75-year-old vieillard terrible of the aviation industry, was hunting for scalps again yesterday. Best known for initiating US airline deregulation when boss of the Civil Aeronautics Board under Jimmy Carter, he was speaking at a Brussels bash organised by British Airways to promote its views on air liberalisation. Economist Kahn delivered two public punches, denouncing BA's bid for a stake in USAir which failed just before Christmas as 'anti-competitive'. He then likened the reasoning of Air France chairman Bernard Attali to that of Fidel Castro. Observer gathers that Kahn is also leading the charge to ensure Bill Clinton's administration stays liberal on the aviation front. A lifetime Democrat, Kahn is exercised that one Paul Dempsey, professor of law at Denver University, may be in line for a key assistant secretary's job in the transportation department. Dempsey, snarls Kahn, has written much about the need to re-regulate and would be 'a complete catastrophe. His work is biased and is based on irresponsible use of statistics. He deserves no professional respect'. Kahn's preferred candidate for the job is Dan Kaspar, a faculty member at Harvard who, like Dempsey, has done a period at the CAB. Students of the battle for Clinton's economic soul should watch this space.</p>

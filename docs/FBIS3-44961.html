			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chan Po-chung and Michael Chugani in Washington] </F>   [Text] Financial Secretary Hamish Macleod says the new  trade row between the United States and China will hurt Hong  Kong--but local analysts say the impact will be limited.    Macleod was reacting to yesterday's threat by the U.S. to  slash quotas on imports of Chinese textiles.    Meanwhile China yesterday threatened to retaliate against  the  "irresponsible" U.S. decision and called for a return to the  negotiating table.    In the U.S., however, the head of the Textile Manufacturers  Institute called China "an international outlaw" and said  China's illegal textiles transshipments had cost the U.S. 50,000  jobs.    The U.S. has given China until 17 January before it actually  imposes the quota cuts, which are expected to be between 25 and  35 percent of China's total textile quota to the U.S.    Macleod said Hong Kong would suffer, but he said the  territory should keep out of the row.    "As a matter of fact, we have our own quota arrangements  with  the U.S. government so Hong Kong's direct trade will not be  affected," he said.    However, he admitted that Hong Kong's economy would be  affected, both directly and indirectly, if the cuts went ahead.    "Quite a large number of local textile manufacturers have  moved their production bases to the mainland, therefore a direct  impact would be apparent on them.    "It would affect Hong Kong entrepreneurs' investments in  China very directly."    Macleod said Hong Kong would also suffer indirectly as a  result of the drop in textile shipments to the U.S. from China,  because the re-export trade would be hit.    But local analysts said the quota cuts would not have a  major  impact on Hong Kong garment makers in the short term despite the  heavy shift of Hong Kong production facilities into southern  China.    "Hong Kong right now is not using much of China's quotas so  I  wouldn't say that in the medium term it would have much impact,"  Barings Securities analyst Chris Li said.    Beijing condemned the U.S. for its unilateral move to slash  China's quotas in a strongly worded protest by a Foreign Trade  Ministry spokesman carried by the official XINHUA News Agency.    "The irresponsible action taken by the U.S. has caused both  strong reaction in China and extensive dissatisfaction in the  U.S.," he said.    A Hong Kong Trade Department spokesman said yesterday that  the territory's role as a port for China's world trade would  suffer if Beijing and Washington failed to settle the dispute  soon.    He said there would be no immediate impact, but added: "If a  resolution is not reached in due course, re-exports of  Chinese-made textiles and clothing to the U.S. will be affected."    China's textiles re-exports through Hong Kong to the U.S.  was  estimated to be about $26 billion in 1993.    Raymond Chien, chairman of the board of directors of the  Hong  Kong Industrial Technology Centre Corporation, described the  U.S. move as "shocking".    He hit out at Washington for mixing issues and blaming China  as a whole for the work of a few corrupt traders.</p>

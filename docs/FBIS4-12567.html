			<p>BFN     [Text] As part of their plan to deter the regime from  committing crimes and oppressive acts against the inhabitants of  the southern marshlands, the Islamic resistance forces on 19  March dealt a destructive blow to the al-Nasiriyah Governorate's  air base, known as the Imam 'Ali Air Base, attacking it with  120-mm and 82-mm mortars.    Our sources in al-Nasiriyah confirm that the base's vital  installations were set afire. The sound of explosions continued  to be heard for a long time after the operation.</p>

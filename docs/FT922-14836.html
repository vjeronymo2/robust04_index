			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Brazilian president fails to recruit allies BRAZILIAN President Fernando Collor's attempts to persuade the Social Democratic party to join his government have failed, leaving him desperately seeking allies to fill the holes in his administration left by the resignation of more than 30 government members. Initial positive reaction to the reshuffle - the largest in Brazilian history - has turned to incredulity as Mr Collor proves unable to attract people or parties to his team. The government's reform programme has been stalled, along with the investigations into corruption in the administration which led to its dismissal. Important ministries such as Infrastructure and Agriculture are paralysed while Mr Collor dangles the posts in front of potential allies. 'It's becoming an auction,' commented one congressman yesterday. With municipal elections due in October, politicians do not want to be associated with the government's unpopular economic policy, which has provoked two years of recession. Stephen Fidler adds from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic: Hopes that both Brazil and Argentina could reach agreement in principle with leading commercial bank creditors in the next week have been dashed as Brazil suspended further talks with banks for nearly three weeks. However, Argentina and its bank advisory group are expected to meet in Santo Domingo at the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank in the next few days. This leaves open the possibility that Argentina may secure an outline debt accord under the Brady Plan. There had been hopes that the IADB meeting would symbolise an end to the decade-long debt crisis for both countries. But the Brazilian government baulked at completing a complex deal ahead of what it saw as a false deadline.</p>

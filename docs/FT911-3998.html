			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / DTI probe to help boost post office competition THE GOVERNMENT is conducting an audit of the Post Office to help it decide how to increase competition in postal services. The Department of Trade and Industry, in the first independent investigation of its kind, is looking into the cost of all Post Office functions and hopes to finalise its report by July. After the audit a DTI committee, chaired by Lord Hesketh, industry minister responsible for the Post Office, will draw up its favoured option for introducing competition into the business. The Hesketh committee may fall short of advocating outright privatisation but will almost certainly propose opening the Post Office to some form of competition in its letters business by encouraging competitive tendering for particular services. The audit reflects the priority Mr John Major, the prime minister, has given to privatisation as an ingredient in the Conservatives' general election manifesto. Ministers are frustrated by the lack of financial information provided by Post Office management. They hope the report will show the extent of any cross-subsidy between the different geographical and business divisions within the Post Office. The Post Office, which has a monopoly on letters costing less than Pounds 1, is divided into three divisions - parcels, counters and letters. Labour costs account for more than 80 per cent of total costs. The DTI wants to know why Post Office profits fell last year from Pounds 170.1m to Pounds 116.4m on turnover up from Pounds 3.9bn to Pounds 4.4bn. Ministers are also concerned that the consumer is not getting value for money. While the DTI has not committed itself to any option, a proposal to introduce competitive tendering, which falls short of straightforward privatisation, is gaining support within the department. Under competitive tendering collecting and sorting the mail would be contracted out to private bidders. The bidders could include the in-house Post Office organisation, private couriers or management buy- outs organised by Post Office staff. Ministers are sceptical of the ability of private couriers, such as TNT, the Australian-based delivery company, to run a full letters service in competition with the Post Office. Government officials believe that sub-postmasters, who run the corporation's Post Office Counters division selling stamps and stationery, could be encouraged to bid for the franchise to collect and sort the mail in their district. DTI officials believe there could be scope for competitive tendering at a regional level for collection, sorting and delivery.</p>

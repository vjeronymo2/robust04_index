			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (6): Plastic takes over as a common currency - Europe CONTROVERSY may still be raging over the future of the Maastricht Treaty but Europeans are already turning to plastic as their common currency. And with trade barriers and restrictions falling away, they may soon be shopping around from country to country for the best deal. Certainly, the European Commission is pushing hard for a cheap, quick and reliable payment system to be set up across the borders of Europe. Derek Pearmund, Visa International's executive vice-president for member relations, believes that plastic cards have already established an efficient network enabling cardholders to access money internationally. Cultural distinctions between national retail financial markets within the EC, however, may prove to be a stumbling block to the advances of the more ambitious card issuers. High telecommunications costs may also be an inhibiting factor, although Barclays' recent deal with BT in the UK to halve the cost of calls may help to set the ball rolling across Europe. In the longer term, the creation of a single European currency could wipe out the profits generated by foreign exchange transactions. Mark Sievewright, head of communications at Eurocard International, MasterCard's partner in Europe, warns that the banks may have to rethink some of their income streams. But card users can only make a profit on incoming transactions, asserts Robin Stainer, head of Andersen Consulting's financial services division. 'A single common currency will enable companies to consolidate their operations as well as reduce their costs.' It cannot be denied that plastic provides one of the easiest ways to cross frontiers and break into new markets. 'It is relatively easy for a bank to do business in another country,' says Eurocard's Sievewright. 'In the cards business all you have to do is to set up a local language service bureau to sort out queries from cardholders and merchants.' Indeed, Barclays Bank and Banco de Santander, one of Spain's leading issuers, have both ventured into Germany's nascent card market with Banco de Santander now the biggest credit card issuer in Germany. Germany, along with France, Italy and Spain, has contributed greatly to the explosive growth of cards in Europe. Both Visa and MasterCard-Eurocard expect that European card sales volume will overtake that of the US over the next two years. With nearly 62m cardholders and a card volume of Dollars 146bn Visa boasts that it has twice the number of cards and twice the volume of its closest European competitor. But it will face a formidable opponent later this year when Eurocard finally completes its merger with Eurocheque International to form Europay. With a combined total of 75m cards in circulation Mark Sievewright is confident that Europay's range of products cannot be matched. 'We may have entered the market later than Visa but we have the right products,' he said. Both Visa and MasterCard-Eurocard have spotted the growth potential offered by Europe's travel and entertainment market. It is estimated that Europeans spent around Dollars 200bn on travel and entertaining last year. In spite of its recent troubles, American Express still firmly dominates this sector, but it may soon be faced with even more competition if the Japanese giant JCB goes ahead with its plans to start issuing cards in continental Europe. Jim Jamison, American Express's vice-president of Travel Management Services, predicts that co-branding relationships will grow. 'In general the European market will be made up of fewer, larger players as more and more companies decide to work with partners across Europe.' American Express has recently teamed up with Banco de Santander in Spain and has already established a strong partnership with Lloyds Bank in the UK. The race is also on to unlock the 120m debit cards issued by domestic schemes in national markets which are unaffiliated to either Visa or MasterCard-Eurocard. Italian card issuers CartaSi and Bank of Americard are the first in Europe to sign up with Visa to issue cards with the redesigned Electron electronic debit brand. MasterCard-Eurocard expects eastern Europe to play a crucial role in the development of its forthcoming Maestro/edc electronic debit programme. Earlier this year Komercni Banka in Czechoslovakia rolled out the first Cirrus on-line ATM network in Eastern Europe which may help kickstart the spread of on-line programmes across Hungary, Poland, the Baltic States and the CIS. 'Eastern Europe has the advantage of seeing what went wrong in the West and learning from our mistakes,' said Eurocard's Mr Sievewright. But there are many obstacles to the integration of plastic into societies that have operated on cash for nearly 40 years. There are urgent telecommunication and infrastructure needs, and there will be no mass issuance of cards until currency becomes convertible. 'In terms of domestic markets there are some good opportunities,' said Visa's Mr Pearmund but he warns: 'They have to be very carefully weighed against cost and risk. It will take a while before any investment is covered.' Mr Stainer agrees: 'It's a nice thing to talk about but this is a scale business. Volume in eastern Europe is so minute as not to be interesting for serious players.' Managing editor of Card World</p>

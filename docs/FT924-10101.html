			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: No sign of meeting point in cocoa talks COCOA PRODUCING and consuming countries yesterday began a third round of talks to thrash out a new price-stabilisation commodity agreement, with both sides still maintaining the same divergent positions on the main issues as in July when the previous talks ended. The two-week session, held here under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, will centre on the price to be defended by the new agreement, the consumers' plan for withholding production from the market, and how the agreement is to be financed. The existing 1986 cocoa accord, which expires in September 1993, has failed to prevent mounting stockpiles and a disastrous collapse of prices as production has grown far more rapidly than consumption over the past 20 years. Buffer stock operations, intended to stabilise prices, were suspended in 1988 after cocoa purchases reached the maximum allowed by the agreement. Stockpiles currently stand at over 1.4m tonnes and prices are at their lowest levels in real (inflation-adjusted) terms ever recorded. Producers want the new accord to defend a price range with a mid-price of SDR1,820 (Pounds 1,620 at the present conversion rate) a tonne, more than double current market levels. Consumers are insisting on a mid-price of SDR1,000 a tonne. Producers have proposed 600,000 tonnes as the maximum that can be withheld from the market under the new accord, twice the amount envisaged by consumers, and want the accord financed equally by producers and consumers. Consumers say money should first be raised by repayment of arrears and controlled sales from the existing 240,000 tonne buffer stock. However, there is consensus on the need to reduce cocoa output. Meeting in Kuala Lumpur last month, the Cocoa Producers' Alliance agreed to set up a production committee to co-ordinate measures by its 13 member countries, which account for 85 per cent of world cocoa production. Mr Alain Gauze, commodities minister for the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, said yesterday that his country's production would be cut by 15-20 per cent as a result of the new output policy instituted by the government.</p>

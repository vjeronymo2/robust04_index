			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: New stores and organic growth boost Carpetright to Pounds 14m Carpetright, Sir Philip Harris's carpet retail chain, yesterday announced a 79 per cent jump in profits for its first full year as a public company. The pre-tax return rose from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 14m for the year to April 30 on sales ahead 40 per cent to Pounds 110.4m (Pounds 78.6m). Sir Philip, chairman and chief executive, said the profits performance was satisfactory against a background of stable prices. The improvement was due both to the addition of new stores and organic growth, with like-for-like sales ahead 16 per cent in the year. Sir Philip implied that the rate of sales growth had slowed in the first few weeks of the current year. 'We would be very happy if we get that again', he said. The housing market remained flat and any substantial improvement in prices was not expected. Sir Philip was confident, however, that Carpetright would generate substantial growth through net margin improvements and its increased share of the UK carpet market. Since flotation in June operating margins had risen from 9.5 per cent to 12.2 per cent and market share had risen from 6 per cent to 9 per cent. Sir Philip said his ambition was for a 20 per cent share with 250 outlets. Carpetright opened 31 new stores in the year, taking the total to 149. A further 26 stores are scheduled to open this year. The group ended the year with cash of Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 8m). There is a final dividend of 4.3p, for a total of 7p. This compared with 1.23p, adjusted for the capitalisation issue. Earnings were 12p (6.25p). COMMENT The impressive performance in the first year may be hard to sustain in the longer-term, given the glaring absence of any substantial recovery in the housing market. Yet Carpetright is generating cash - some Pounds 6m in the current half - which should help fund the aggressive expansion programme and give comfort on the thin dividend cover. Forecasts are for profits of Pounds 19m this year, for a prospective p/e of 15. This is not aggressively priced, but the share performance may be constrained by concerns over whether the company's strategy can be sustained.</p>

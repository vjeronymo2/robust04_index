			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL CELEBRATES ITS 50TH JUBILEE;  </P> <P> POPULARITY OF SUMMERTIME RITUAL ENDURES  </P> <P> The boys of summer turned 50 this year, but they never lose a step or show a  touch of gray.  </P> <P> These boys of summer are the perpetually young products of America's fountain  of youth, Little League baseball.  </P> <P> Founded in 1939, Little League is celebrating its 50th anniversary and has been  in the Valley area for more than 30 years.  </P> <P> Although local leagues have done little to commemorate the anniversary, Little  League has celebrated with a variety of national events, including a recent  ceremony at the White House with a former Little League coach of some note,  President George Bush.  </P> <P> Little League, which originated in Williamsport, Pa., organized in San  Bernardino in 1950 and preceded the arrival of the major leagues in California  by eight years. The Brooklyn Dodgers, the original Boys of Summer, migrated  westward in 1958. By then, Little League already had taken root in the Valley  area.  </P> <P> "It's more organized now," said Jerry Goldfield, one of the coaches when the  Conejo Valley Little League was chartered in 1960. "We had some rawhide back  then. We had some real big country boys. It was good baseball."  </P> <P> Now, more than 10,000 players aged 6 to 18 participate in area Little League  programs that encompass parts of three of California's 63 Little League  districts. District 13 covers the area from Simi Valley to Oxnard; District 40  includes the San Fernando Valley and Canyon Country; and District 16 covers the  Glendale, Tujunga and Sunland areas.  </P> <P> About 6,000 youngsters participate in District 40 alone, and a major program  like the Northridge Little League boasts a membership of nearly 1,000 boys and  girls.  </P> <P> That's right, girls. Little League Inc. was legally mandated in 1974 to include  girls. Little League also has created softball divisions but not all area  leagues offer softball.  </P> <P> Girls tend to compete in younger age categories such as Tee-Ball for 6- to  8-year-olds, but 15-year-old Liz Vriese of Canoga Park has excelled in the  Woodland Hills-Sunrise Senior League. A Jill-of-all-trades, Vriese played  pitcher, third base and other positions well enough to make the league all-star  team.  </P> <P> "The boys treat me as a boy," she said. "They treat me well. Opponents, they  tease me and tell me a girl shouldn't be playing baseball but (should) be home  putting on makeup or knitting. I tell them to mind their own business."  </P> <P> The addition of girls and the expansion of the Tee-Ball division have helped  keep Little League growing. Despite competition from other baseball and youth  sports programs, Little League in the Valley area has flourished. One of the  fastest growing areas in District 40 is Canyon Country.  </P> <P> "I don't believe we'll be able to grow much larger," said Dave Bench, president  of Canyon Country Little League.  </P> <P> This year, Canyon Country had to turn down 200 children who signed up late but  was able to accommodate all those who met the registration deadline.  Eventually, the league might have to cap its enrollment but officials hope to  build more fields before reaching that point.  </P> <P> The traditional Little League includes youngsters aged 9 to 12, but Tee-Ball  (6-8), Senior (13-15) and Big League (16-18) divisions have been added.  </P> <P> "What we're running now is more Tee-Ball teams than anything else," said Merle  Sanders, District 40 administrator. "I would say we're extremely healthy and  enjoying tremendous success and the future looks good."  </P> <P> However, with sandlots becoming parking lots as the area population booms,  Little League officials have scrambled for fields.  </P> <P> "The big competition we have is for playing space," said Bruce Singleton,  president of the Thousand Oaks Little League. "We compete for use of fields  with softball leagues, soccer leagues, you name it. We have a facility with  four fields, and we're running out of space."  </P> <P> While finding fields presents a problem, sometimes the children at a Little  League game are not just those on the field. As one Little League brochure  notes: "It is in the deportment of parents at Little League games where the  program draws its greatest criticism."  </P> <P> The term "Little League parent" has come to connote overbearing adults who  pressure their children in youth athletics. Yet "Little League parent" also  refers to those dedicated parents who line the field, keep score, umpire, sell  concessions and coach.  </P> <P> Little League relies almost exclusively on volunteers, making parental  non-involvement a problem as well.  </P> <P> "Often it's gotten to be a kind of baby-sitters' program," said West Regional  Director Frank Yost, "in that the adults are unwilling to participate and they  expect a few coaches and administrators to carry the ball."  </P> <P> An increased emphasis has been placed on training all parents, not just those  who volunteer their time. Parents receive an instructional brochure to aid in  player registration, and Little League publishes another pamphlet titled: "Role  of the Parent in Little League."  </P> <P> Kon Slettedahl, coach of the Woodland Hills-Sunrise Little League All-Stars,  said that he has a mandatory parent meeting every year, during which he  outlines his Little League philosophy and the role of parents on the team.  </P> <P> "I just have a real hard time with people who take it too seriously,"  Slettedahl said.  </P> <P> Parents and other adults walk a fine line between helping and hindering. At a  typical Little League tournament game, the players are barraged by a Greek  chorus of adult voices commenting on the action.  </P> <P> "Five percent of the parents don't have the right perspective," said Dave  Sehnem, a former Little League player and coach. "They have what I call 'love  goggles.' They're prejudiced in favor of their son, and they make life  miserable. It was the same thing 25 years ago when I was 12."  </P> <P> Sehnem was not a typical 12-year-old, though. In 1963, he played for the  Granada Hills National team that won the Little League World Series  championship in Williamsport, Pa. No team from the Valley area has matched that  achievement, and Granada Hills is the last California team to win the World  Series.  </P> <P> However, area Little Leagues have continued to produce outstanding players such  as major leaguers Bret Saberhagen, Robin Yount, Kurt Stillwell and Rick  Dempsey.  </P> <P> "I'd say the quality right now is coming up again," said Slettedahl, in his  10th year as a Little League coach. "We're getting some pretty good athletes in  there. I'd say we're going to be OK."  </P> <P> Reaching the Little League World Series usually requires two dominant pitchers  and a certain amount of luck. An American team must win more than a dozen games  just to reach the final eight in Williamsport.  </P> <P> The 1989 tournament began a week and a half ago at the district level where  each league's all-star team competes in a double-elimination tournament.  Winners advance to sectional, divisional and regional tournaments and, finally,  Williamsport in the Little League Division. Tournaments are also held in three  other baseball divisions -- Junior (13-year-olds), Senior and Big League -- and  in softball.  </P> <P> Some coaches don't wait until the all-star tournament to resort to tactics that  would make Machiavelli blush. Sandbagging -- instructing a player to play  poorly at tryouts to dupe other coaches -- and empire building -- stockpiling  young talent -- are two of the tricks coaches employ in an effort to win their  leagues.  </P> <P> "They will sometimes do a lot of things that aren't in the book," said Sanders,  the District 40 administrator. "Some of the adults will carry this stuff  forever. I have a friend who's still talking about a situation in 1974. He  talks about it like it was yesterday."  </P> <P> Still, despite the cynic's view that Little League baseball has been spoiled by  egocentric adults and their machinations on the sidelines, the area between the  white lines remains, just as it has for the last 50 years, the kids' domain.  </P> <P> "It's a lot of fun even when we lose," said 15-year-old Jeff Naster, who has  nonetheless had his share of winning in helping Conejo Valley teams advance to  divisional tournaments in Little League and Junior League. "It really helped me  feel I can be the best at what I do."  </P> <P> Little League is the kids' own field of dreams, and one where the boys of  summer can still be boys . . . and girls.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric] </F>   [Text] The number of Azerbaijan's citizens applying to the  Russian Federation Embassy's consular office for Russian  citizenship has grown. The population's worry has been caused  by the fact that the validity of a simplified procedure, under  the law "On Russian Federation Citizenship," for acquiring  citizenship is expected to end soon -- in February 1995, as has  been announced.    Oleg Boyko, first secretary of the Russian Embassy in  Azerbaijan and head of the consular office, has advised that the  deadline will be extended by a special edict. He has served a  reminder that the simplified registration rule only applies to  those who originally come from Russia. Besides, persons moving  to Russia for permanent residence can register their citizenship  with internal affairs bodies of the Russian Federation after  they have decided on their new place of residence in accordance  with the law.</p>

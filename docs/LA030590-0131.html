			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SWENSON TAKES LEAD IN IDITAROD  </P> <P> Breaking out of Finger Lake before an eruption by Redoubt Volcano showered the  trail with sled-slowing ash, four-time champion Rick Swenson was the first  musher in the Iditarod sled dog race to top the towering Alaska Range today.  </P> <P> Swenson declared his mandatory 24-hour layover after reaching the 3,500-foot  pass, the highest point on the trail, but it wasn't immediately certain that he  actually would take it, said race spokeswoman Theresa Daily.  </P> <P> His decision to hold back in Skwentna during the hottest part of the day while  watching others leave, sparing his dogs and getting a slicker trail, proved to  be a good one. He left one dog at Finger Lake.  </P> <P> Three-time winner Susan Butcher continued to move up, leaving Finger Lake in  11th place. She started the race in Anchorage on Saturday as No. 68 of 70  mushers.  </P></p>

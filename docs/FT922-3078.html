			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / While the cat's away . . .: Ivo Dawnay says that renewed agitation among the Tories over Europe is more than a passing storm If 50,000 Danes had opted to stay in bed one day last week, the British parliament would still be dozing in its post-election doldrums. Mr John Major, the prime minister, would be undisturbed on his Latin American tour and 'the end of politics' would still be a viable, if dog-eared, topic for idea-starved pundits. Instead, MPs have had some of their most excitable 10 days since Mrs Margaret Thatcher's resignation in November 1990. A cabinet minister has felt obliged to take the drastic step of issuing a statement of loyalty to his absent leader and the Conservatives' grudging acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty is eroding like a sand castle in a typhoon. Meanwhile, the treaty's two keenest advocates have been virtually incommunicado: the prime minister abroad and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign minister, observing the protocol that demands he keep perfect media silence on the Queen's state visit to France. With the bosses away, Conservative whips have been unable to staunch a Babel of opinionated voices on the implications of the Danish 'no'. At a cocktail party in Whitehall this week, senior ministers did their best to appear philosophical. One veteran of numerous Euro-controversies concluded: 'There is no solution, not today, not tomorrow . . . but eventually we shall reach one.' Perhaps. But few in Westminster would describe this latest Euro-crisis as a passing storm. The forthcoming Lisbon summit of EC heads of government and the summer parliamentary recess at best offer Mr Major a lull for contemplation. But the task ahead - to unite his party and simultaneously keep the European Community moving forward through the UK's six-month presidency, which begins next month - poses real difficulties. If the prime minister fails, he could by Christmas be leader of a bitterly divided party with his reputation as a conciliator - and the Maastricht Treaty - in ruins, and with Britain back in the slow lane of a two-speed Europe. To some Tories, the Danes have changed everything. By boldly challenging Mr Jacques Delors' vision of Europe, they have also defied the UK government's claim that there is no alternative to the Maastricht compromise. For the first time, Mr Major is being portrayed by his followers as not in the centre, but on the Europhile wing of his party and as such dangerously exposed. One usually loyalist MP commented that the leadership had 'totally misjudged the mood' in the party. 'Up until the Danes, we were voting for what we were told was the best deal available in the circumstances - that we were boxed in,' he said. 'We were also sold the treaty on grounds that all 12 countries have to agree it. Now one country has not, it is a totally new ball game.' That view is now so widespread that the Danish question - 'to ratify, or not to ratify' - is no longer appropriate. In spite of Mr Hurd's undertaking at a meeting of EC foreign ministers last week to press on with ratification, the question has now to be hedged with the rider 'but not yet'. Privately, the Tory party's backroom number-crunchers know that, in its present mood, there is no chance of getting the Maastricht Bill through the House of Commons. Last month, 22 Tory MPs voted against the bill's second reading. By Thursday, 87 MPs had signed a motion calling for 'a fresh start' aimed at creating a European Economic Community and a common market. Their view that the UK can now use its presidency to promote a non-federalist blueprint for a Europe of free trading nations has been deemed naive by Mr Major's camp. Yet the signatories to the motion are tacitly backed by more formidable party figures, from ex-cabinet ministers Mr Kenneth Baker and Mr John Biffen to current cabinet members. Whatever their claims to the contrary, Mr Peter Lilley, Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Norman Lamont are all associated with the heresy. With Labour poised to use the Danish vote as a pretext to oppose ratification of the treaty, just 30 rebel Tory votes against a guillotine motion - limiting the time for debate in order to head off a filibuster on the bill - could kill it forever. The threat to oppose the guillotine will not be issued publicly by the now more organised, subtle and broadly based anti-Maastricht lobby. Rather than hectoring, Mr Michael Spicer, the urbane former energy minister heading the resistance, suggests that the treaty simply be put to one side. Britain would then pursue its presidency aims of completing the single market and promoting EC enlargement. Arguing that the UK's goals mesh well with those of the Efta and central European states applying to join the Community, Mr Spicer says that those who want a Euro-superstate must take that step on their own. 'The agenda should switch back to what it was before the Commission was allowed to take it over. The tide of history may have turned, and may be moving at last in Britain's direction.' So far, government loyalists have decided to roll with the punches. But there is a strong pro-Maastricht lobby which would like the whips to give what is seen as an over-cocky new intake a crash course in Westminster Realpolitik. While the tough Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, plays it hard, the emollient Mr Major will explain more delicately the dangers of a two-speed Europe over whisky and soda at Number 10. In the meantime, the government hopes that Thursday's Irish referendum, the Lisbon summit later this month and the French plebiscite in September may throw up new options and cool the headstrong at home and abroad. Several experienced hands believe that, with minor adjustments, the status quo ante can still prevail. A new commitment by the Commission to devolve powers back to national capitals, a declaration by the 12 to that effect, and a symbolic UK victory - say, on the right to maintain border controls - and opinion could turn back quickly, they say. Yet there are no guarantees. Mr Major cannot easily repudiate a treaty he hailed as a triumph. But a trial of strength with the hard-line rebels - an appeal to 'trust me' - could turn retabling the Maastricht Bill into a vote of confidence he cannot afford to lose. If luck is not with him the prime minister may be forced to choose between his obligations as EC president and his need to keep his party behind him. Most believe that of the two, the party takes priority. 'Whips,' said one old Westminster hand this week, 'know not to allow anything to go to the vote if there is the slightest danger that they might not have the verdict sewn up.' Like a besuited Sisyphus, Mr Major has just seen the rock he so painstakingly pushed up the mountain to the April 9 general election, tumble back to the bottom. An idle summer in England's cricket pavilions is no longer on the cards.</p>

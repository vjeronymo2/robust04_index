			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Names hail victory on evidence GOODA Walker Names said yesterday they had forced Lloyd's to disclose details of Mr Kenneth Randall's investigation into Gooda Walker. In a letter to the Gooda Walker Action Group's 2,000 members, Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, the group's chairman, said that 'had Lloyd's not agreed to publish the evidence obtained by GW Run-Off' his group would have applied for a court injunction to prevent the drawdown of Names' funds. Mr Doll-Steinberg supports the action at present before the Commercial Court, which involves some of the group's members, but the group has yet to take independent action. Legal action is in prospect, nevertheless, if Lloyd's proceeds to draw down Names' deposits to meet cash calls, he added. Lloyd's issued notices on March 4 allowing drawdown of deposits of Names who fail to meet cash calls after 30 days. A cash call totalling Pounds 101m for Names on syndicates 164, 290, 298 and 299 covering losses in 1989 and 1990 fell due on March 2. GW Run-Off has collected only limited amounts of the cash so far. Mr Doll-Steinberg said Lloyd's intention to let the drawdowns continue was 'absolutely crass'.</p>

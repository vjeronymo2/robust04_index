			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergei Skvortsov, secretary-coordinator of </F> the CPSU Central Committee, by MN correspondent Dmitry Pushkar:  "The Communist Party Hasn't Fallen to Pieces Yet"; first  paragraph is introductory paragraph]    [Text] The niche which was once occupied by Viktor Anpilov,  leader of the "Moscow Labour" movement who has been arrested,  was not empty for long. On February 10 in Moscow, revolutionary  romantics conducted a protest against the declining standard of  living. The small crowd was led into battle by the zealous  promoter of the people's wellbeing, the CPSU. Despite all  metamorphoses the CPSU retains its former goal, that of building  communism. Sergei Skvortsov, one of the few legal leaders of the  party, explained to an MN correspondent, how he would do this.    The CPSU, relieved of the heavy burden of power,  sanatoriums,  armoured limousines, game reserves and secret laboratories for  forging documents and deprived of Article 6 of the Constitution,  has shrunk to the size of an ordinary party. Its leaders  critically appraise the numerical strength of its Russian  organization at 20,000 roughly as many as the Russian  Social-Democratic Labour Party had in 1917. Some time ago the  central committee even allowed "dual citizenship" so that a CPSU  member could be also a member of other parties, but now the  rules have been made stricter.    The highest official of the CPSU Central Committee,  secretary-coordinator Sergei Skvortsov, is a short, balding  bespectacled man in his early forties. He completed a  postgraduate course as an economist and served in the army as a  deputy political instructor in a construction battalion. He  lives in the Moscow Region. Besides being responsible for the  party's leadership, he fulfills the role of chairman of the  movement in defence of Russian history (meaning Lenin). He is  also editor of the "People's Newspaper".    The CPSU is not registered and has no office nor address.  The  composition of its secretariat and the central committee is a  secret.  <H5>  Action </H5>   "On February 10 the party conducted a day of protest against  declining living standards", says Sergei Skvortsov. "Several  groups set up an interregional strike committee which I also  joined. We do not plan to organize a general strike which would  grow into an armed uprising, as was the case in 1905. We advance  economic and general democratic demands: a price freeze on  essential goods, the indexation of the minimal earnings to the  subsistence level, compensation for a delay in paying wages at  half of one percent a day, and a prohibition on the closing of  enterprises. We also demand the indexation of deposits in the  Savings Bank in keeping with the rising prices. Our only  political demand is for free democratic elections. Our party has  initiated the boycotting of elections. The action of February 10  was in fact the first step in building a mass people's movement.  The way out of an economic crisis is strict regulation by the  state, in any case, the strengthening of the state's role. There  is no other fitting model, you see, besides the Marxist one".    MN: Why do you laugh when you say "Marxist"?    S.: Because the word has been abused too much by  many, including our activists.  <H5>  Property </H5>   MN: What is your party's attitude to ownership of the  means of production?    S.: There is consensus among almost all communist  parties. We base ourselves on the classic Marxist approach that  the state should have the commanding positions, while private  property is eradicated as it gradually becomes socially  unnecessary.    MN: Ownership of land?    S.: It should not exist. It is not an absolute  dogma, but the absence of private property is necessary in our  country, because in the event of free purchase and sale of land  it does not get into the hands of those who cultivate it. The  law on land was built for the area around Moscow in order to  secure plots of land for country houses.    MN: What is your attitude on the property of the CPSU?  Do you consider yourselves its heirs?    S.: The succession is direct. We have elected a  new leadership of the party that existed. The number of new  members who joined the CPSU after it was reinstated is a mere  hundred or two. We practically have the same people. In legal  terms we are claimants to the property. We may probably raise  the question of property if a new political situation arises,  but we shall demand not the return of the entire property but  only of what is necessary for political activity.  <H5>  Cornerstones </H5>   MN: Dictatorship of the proletariat?    S.: The concept of the dictatorship of the  proletariat was considered to be a corner-stone of the Marxist  theory. Those who speak about it now mean the working class. But  this part of society is no longer in the majority. The leading  role in society should be played by the workers of manual and  mental labour, those who create not only material, but also, to  use a Marxist term, spiritual benefits. But this must not  necessarily be a dictatorship as it was understood before.    MN: Class struggle?    S.: Class struggle remains the way we understand  it. Today we may be allies, but the situation may change  tomorrow and we may have neutral relations or become opponents.    MN: The attitude to religion?    S.: According to our rules we may have believers  in our ranks. We believe, generally speaking, that Marxist  philosophy by which we are guided is atheistic, but do not  intend to force this viewpoint on anyone, including the members  of our party. This principle is now characteristic of almost all  communist parties, at least of those which are not in power.  <H5>  The Soviet Union </H5>   MN: What is your position on the national question?    S.: To reinstitute guberniyas is an entirely  unrealistic aim connected with doing obvious violence to  peoples. At the same time we naturally stand for the  reestablishment of the Soviet Union. We believe that it can be  done by means of adopting by the legislative body of Russia of a  decision on the restoration of the operation of the USSR  Constitution on the territory of the Russian Federation. Several  republics can practically immediately follow this way.  <H5>  The Final Goal Is To Work for Idlers </H5>   MN: It follows from the name of your party that you are  fighting to build communism. Do you think that "the next  generation of Soviet people" will live under communism?    S.: I cannot make categorical forecasts. I myself  belong to a rather young generation, but as for the next  generation... No, there won't be communism in 50 years from now,  so you are right.    MN: What will communism be like?    S.: People will be engaged in some kind of  creative work, though there may be some left who will want to  till soil because they may find it interesting, or for the sake  of relaxation. At the initial stage a certain minimum of life's  benefits will be granted to all. At this stage some additional  benefits will be offered to people who have made the greatest  contribution to society's development. Further on, the range of  these benefits will evidently decrease because the most  important element is the development of a new man. I consider  the desire to have two or three Mercedes cars a deviation.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Jon Kessler's large constructions mimic walls yet suggest whole buildings in  abbreviated shorthand. Partly well crafted minimalist objects, the aluminum  struts, wallboard and braces illuminated from the inside with fluorescent  lights gain their edge from the way a single wall's construction can echo the  overall configuration of a glass office building. Kessler pushes the poetry of  that rather mundane observation along by seeing architecture's walls as  curtains and using light to create a sense of theater.  </P> <P> His most intriguing pieces are quite literally off the wall. They involve a  roll of rusting fencing material and a light source on a motorized pulley that  moves slowly up and down behind it. Ever changing shadows from the coiled  material are cast onto a foggy piece of curved plastic for a lovely, albeit  romantic, view of a building stripped down to its girders.  </P> <P> Kessler seems to be trying to touch on issues like the economy by making credit  cards block the light source on one piece. But the theatricality and genuine  beauty of many of the light effects is too overwhelming to be disturbing. Even  the refinery-in-a-crate synchronized lights of "American Landscape" are too  charming to consider for long as a warning about the eventual depletion of  natural resources.

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Pleas grow for late-bill interest CHAMBERS OF commerce yesterday added their voice to the lobby which is calling for the government to give businesses a statutory right to interest on unpaid bills. This formed part of a package of measures intended to change the payment culture of business announced by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce at its annual conference in Leeds. Mr Richard Brown, the chambers' policy director, said: 'The stubbornness and complexity of the problem of late payment clearly indicate there is no single simple solution. Every effort to tackle the problem must focus on changing the payment culture. 'Consultation within the chamber of commerce movement has revealed that the voluntary process of exhortation is not working.' The chambers called for: The compilation of 'white lists' of good payers which would be kept for inspection in local chambers. The extension of the requirement for large companies to disclose their payment practices in their annual reports to cover all public limited companies. An investigation by the Lord Chancellor's department of the German system of warnings to late payers which uses standard reminder forms and avoids full court proceedings. The requirement for sub-contractors on government contracts to pay their suppliers within 30 days. At present only main contractors are expected to do this. The 30-day requirement to be extended to contractors and sub-contractors working for local authorities. More funds for late payment advice 'hotlines', which should be developed into a payment arbitration service. The government has refused to introduce a statutory right to interest on late payments, saying it would create more red tape. For many years it relied on exhorting companies to pay on time but over the past two years has funded pilot 'help-lines,' introduced a requirement - still to be implemented - for large companies to report their payment record, and simplified county court procedures for claiming debts. The lobbying campaign for a statutory right to interest has been headed by the Forum of Private Business, which has been joined by Intrum Justitia, a debt collection company, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business information group. Recently support has come from two clearing banks, National Westminster and Midland.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Funds sought for diamond projects Ashton Mining of Australia has two exciting diamond projects that, if all goes well, might be mined in 1997, according to Mr John Robinson, the chief executive. The race is between Ashton's Merlin prospect in the Batten area of Australia's Northern Territory, where the company has been exploring for 15 years, and its new diamond province in Finland. Ashton has been exploring in Finland for eight years but kept its operations there secret until September this year because Finnish laws do not provide for large and long-life exploration licences. The company is still not revealing the precise locations of some of the prospective areas in Finland where it has found 'commercially significant concentrations' of diamonds. Mr Robinson, speaking to analysts in London this week, said that Ashton was looking at options for substantial further funding if the projects lived up to their present promise. The least attractive option would be to bring in a partner for joint ventures. He preferred the idea of floating projects so as to bring in public money. Ashton is Australia's biggest diamond mining company via its 40 per cent holding in the Argyle mine in Western Australia, the world's largest producer in volume terms. Argyle's present reserves guarantee its open pit operations through to 2004 but Mr Robinson said there was a good chance that moving to underground mining could extend the mine's life considerably. He was 'very optimistic' about diamond market prospects for the next 10 years. Demand would grow strongly as new markets, such as China, India and Mexico, developed from a small base. On the supply side, apart from Ashton's two projects, only the discovery by another Australian group, Broken Hill Proprietary, in Canada's North West Territories, seemed to offer much promise. He admitted, however, that there were unanswered questions about the size of Russia's diamond stockpiles and what it might do with those gems.</p>

Dr. Faraj met the Kerman governor general on Sunday [2  January] and said that in view of the many common denominators  between Iran and Egypt and past cultural ties, cordial relations  between the two countries could foster bilateral cooperation in  the industrial and agricultural fields.    He expressed the hope that by forging ties with Iran, Egypt  could further expand its relations with the Central Asian  countries. He announced that Egyptian investors were willing to  upgrade economic relations with Iran.    Kerman Governor General Seyyed Hoseyn Mar'ashi elaborated on  the potential resources of Kerman Province especially with  regard to agricultural production in pistachios, dates, citrus  fruits, and in the mineral industries.    It is worth mentioning that in the past few years, the  Egyptian Government has made extensive efforts to eliminate  obstacles in the path of relations with Iran. The Egyptian  regime's desire for relations with Iran stems from the fact that  the Islamic Revolution of Iran has emerged as a model and a  legend in the minds of Egypt's revolutionary youth. By  establishing relations with Iran, the cradle of the Islamic  Revolution, Egypt will strive to shatter this pattern and legend  and to harm it.    Of course, in conjunction with these efforts, the Egyptian  Government continues to express its malice and hostility from  time to time and to level accusations against Iran. The  Egyptian Government also continues to instigate the regional  governments of the Persian Gulf against the Islamic Republic of  Iran by pursuing active diplomacy in this regard.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Mersey barrage project shelved PLANS FOR a Pounds 1.4bn electricity-generating barrage across the River Mersey have been shelved after 11 years of studies and Pounds 8m of expenditure since 1987. The project would have been the largest renewable energy scheme in the UK. The decision follows final government refusal to help keep the project in place until the economic and political climate improved. Funding has been shared equally between public and private sectors. The barrage was expected to have a capacity of 700MW, enough for three-quarters of Liverpool's needs. It would also have created about 5,000 jobs and made a substantial contribution to the legal obligation of Manweb, the local electricity supplier, to take 20 per cent of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources. The shareholders include Alfred McAlpine, Barclays Bank, BICC, Blue Circle, Costain, Ocean Marine, Rolls-Royce Engineering, Royal Insurance, Shell, Tarmac and Trafalgar House. Local shareholders are represented by Littlewoods, Mersey Docks, Manweb, Trinity International and Liverpool University. They believed they could raise about Pounds 400m, but wanted advance payments from the government's non-fossil fuel levy on consumers to fund the rest, with eventual repayments. Mr James McCormack, company secretary of Tarmac Construction and general manager of the barrage company, said yesterday: 'In years to come environmental issues will assume greater political significance. The next general election could be a watershed for future policy. We would hope there will eventually be the political will to proceed.'</p>

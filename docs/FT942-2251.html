			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (6): The health of all living things - Pollution reduction remains a high but increasingly costly priority European countries find themselves in a quandary about how to limit the environmental damage from electricity generation. Power stations are one of the main causes of air pollution in Europe. Moreover, they cause a diplomatically troublesome kind of pollution which can travel thousands of miles across national boundaries. The Green Party in Germany grew out of public rage that acid rain from abroad was withering Germany's beloved forests. The surge in public support for environmental campaigns in the late 1980s across much of Europe was also stimulated by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear explosion in Ukraine. Public concern has prompted many attempts at curbing pollution from electricity generation. However, these initiatives have proved controversial; even those governments which most fervently support controls have also been reluctant to relinquish their right to set energy policy without reference to their neighbours. According to the European Commission, around two thirds of emissions of sulphur dioxide in Western Europe come from power stations or domestic heating. Power stations also pump out about a fifth of emissions of nitrogen oxides in these countries. Both 'sox' and 'nox', as these collections of gases are known, can cause acid rain. They can retard plant growth, and cause skin and eye irritations and breathing difficulties in people. Power stations burning coal, oil and gas are also responsible for about a third of the emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the main gases implicated in the threat of global warming. Most European countries have signed up to two main rafts of regulation to tackle these threats. The Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention, drawn up in 1983, is a package of protocols directed primarily at sox and nox. Countries have negotiated separately on each of these protocols. In addition, at the end of last year, the European Union collectively ratified the climate change convention agreed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. Under the treaty, the EU must bring emissions of carbon dioxide back to 1990 levels in the year 2000. That will mean a cut of some 12 per cent on projected levels, the Commission estimates. European countries have assembled a range of tools to try and reach these targets. To combat sulphur emissions some such as Germany, and to a lesser extent the UK, have fitted power stations with flue gas desulphurisation. Before the Rio summit, European Union countries also drew up proposals for an energy tax of Dollars 10 a barrel of oil-equivalent, weighted towards those fuels with highest carbon content. However, the proposals have stalled because of worries about the impact on international competitiveness, and about political controversy. The UK government, which last year walked into one of its stormiest political rows when it imposed value added tax on domestic heating fuel, has been particularly unwilling to contemplate a further, Brussels-imposed hike in the price of fuel. France, which generates more than two thirds of its electricity from nuclear power, has also protested that the nuclear power should be exempt from the tax as it does not emit carbon dioxide, sox or nox. European Union countries have also drawn up an energy conservation programme called SAVE - specific actions for vigorous energy efficiency. The programme wants to urge higher energy efficiency standards on the building and car industries. However, momentum behind these has also slowed, partly because recession reduced the rate of construction and new design, Commission officials suggest. Despite those obstacles, there has been improvement on some of the fronts. However, there are many signs that this is due to wider industrial changes, rather than the success of the anti-pollution measures. While EU data is incomplete, Commission figures show a steady decline in sulphur emissions during the 1970s and 1980s, by roughly 20 per cent overall. In its 1992 overview of the state of the environment in the EU, the Commission comments that this fall is 'due mainly to the energy-saving measures taken in response to the 1973 and 1978 oil shocks and industrial restructuring' as well as to adoption of new anti-pollution regulations. It notes that 'since the mid-1980s emissions have been falling at a slower rate'. Nox has proved a tougher battle. While measures to control pollution from power stations and other industry have had some success, 'the reductions in emissions .. are more than offset by the increases in the number of vehicles on the road. The net result is that nox emissions are still rising in many countries,' the report says. While carbon emissions have been growing more slowly than expected, for instance in the UK, this is largely due to recession, environmentalists warn. Commission officials suggest privately that further improvements may follow that pattern: due less to specific measures than to structural changes within Europe, such as east German modernisation, or the UK's switch from coal to gas in power generation. Equally, future energy policy changes - for example, if the UK decided to phase out nuclear power in the recently-launched review of the industry - could counteract the effect of measures to curb air pollution. The environmental impact of electricity generation is likely to continue to be politically contentious. But while there may well continue to be environmental improvement, the driving force is likely to be the economic and industrial changes in Europe as much as purely 'green' concerns.</p>

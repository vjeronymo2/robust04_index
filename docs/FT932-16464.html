			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Judges call eating-up time RESTAURANTS ARE entitled to give customers 'eating-up time' in the same way that public houses can give drinking-up time, the High Court ruled yesterday. In a decision that could have wide implications for the restaurant trade, the judges ruled that magistrates erred in law in convicting Mr Anwar Amin, joint holder of a licence for the Dhaka tandoori restaurant in Southampton, of staying open too late. The city's magistrates fined Mr Amin Pounds 100 in June 1991 when they found him guilty of contravening a condition of his late-night refreshment house licence which prevented him from 'keeping open' between 3am and 5am. Mr Amin admitted that about 30 people were still eating at 3.45am on a Sunday in November 1990, when two women police officers visited his Onslow Road restaurant. But he argued that the mere fact that the officers could get in through an unlocked door did not necessarily mean the restaurant was being kept open within the meaning of the Late Night Refreshment Houses Act 1969. The act regulates places kept open between 10pm and 5am for 'public refreshment, resort and entertainment'. No customers were admitted after 3am, and diners were in various stages of finishing their meals, Mr Amin argued. Southampton magistrates decided he was guilty of an offence because the officers could get into the restaurant without hindrance. Allowing an appeal against the conviction, Mr Justice Rougier, sitting with Lord Justice Watkins, said that if the magistrates' interpretation of the law was correct it would place restaurant owners in 'an impossible situation' and mean that customers had to be out by closing time. Those in the restaurant at 3am were entitled to finish their meals, he said.</p>

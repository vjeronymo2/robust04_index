			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Observer: Huntsman packs Packer Last year was red letter time for Jon Huntsman. He had an audience with the Pope and he met media mogul and polo fanatic Kerry Packer. The latter relationship has blossomed and Huntsman was last week escorting Packer around chemical plants in Texas, celebrating completion of the purchase of most of Texaco's chemical interests in a joint venture between the Huntsman family and Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings. Unlikely pair though they may be, the odd couple will be hatching more plans. A devout Mormon based in Salt Lake City, Huntsman runs America's largest privately owned chemical company which he built from scratch to a Dollars 1.8bn turnover - due nearly to double again after the latest deal. Inventor of the old McDonald's hamburger containers, he also has a finely developed philanthropic streak and a fascination for the former Soviet Union. If he sounds like Armand Hammer reincarnated, he did meet the controversial oil magnate towards the end of Hammer's life, at the time of the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, and the country has been a focus of his activities ever since. His 18-month-old reinforced concrete facility is probably the largest western manufacturing operation in Armenia, while Huntsman funds, and three of his sons, helped distribute food to its starving people last winter. Succession is assured, with the Huntsman clan encompassing nine children and 21 grandchildren. Four sons and two sons-in-law are already in the business, though eldest son John, still only 33, took time out as US ambassador to Singapore during the Bush administration. A 29-year-old son-in-law is chief financial officer, and number-something-else son works nights supervising machines printing bread bags. Meanwhile, despite his endless ambitions, Huntsman is clear that the company remains private while he's alive. 'I'm not emotionally equipped to become the CEO of a public company. I couldn't give employees a house or a car when they need one.'</p>

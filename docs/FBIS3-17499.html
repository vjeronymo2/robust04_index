			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Sahib Aliyev] </F>   [Text] It was week ago that the Iranian C-130 was shot  down. Despite the passage of a considerable time, the causes of  this incident still remain a mystery, and two questions arise  from this mystery. First, why, like the act of terrorism  committed in the Baku metro, did this incident take place on the  eve of Novruz? Second, what is the aim behind the dissemination  of reports by the Russian and Armenian mass media that the plane  crashed due to supposedly technical faults?    And this despite the fact that, just a day after this  incident, authoritative sources in Azerbaijan, citing  indisputable facts, announced that the plane was shot down.    Leaving aside this statement by the Azerbaijani side, an  Iranian expert visiting the scene of the incident two days ago  also confirmed that it was shot down.    And contrary to the Armenian claims, the Iranian side also  announced that the plane was not off course, but was forced to  fly at low altitude because strong pressure caused cracks on its  windows.    In short, it is a fact that the plane was hit. It should be  kept in mind that apparently it was shot down by those who have  tried to link this incident to technical problems or weather  conditions; that is, by the Armenians.    Many ascribe Iran's failure to react strongly to this  incident to its unwillingness to harm its warm ties with Armenia.    In our view, Iran is waiting for the completion of the  formal  investigation; and one of the strongest states in the region  cannot remain indifferent to such a tragic death of 32 of its  citizens, because if such indifference is observed in the  Iranian Islamic Republic, which passes itself off as the ardent  supporter of Moslems and Islam in the world, it might create, at  the very least, disappointment among the Islamic population of  the former USSR, and trust in it might be shaken.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Power station may be sold NUCLEAR Electric, the state-owned nuclear power generator, is preparing to put the disused Bankside power station in Southwark, south London, on the market, Vanessa Houlder writes. The building is more likely to be demolished than converted, although the Tate Gallery has considered housing a gallery in it. The 6m cu ft brick structure was built on an 8 1/2 acre Thames-side site in 1957. It was recently given a certificate of immunity from listing and its future depends on the planning brief to be negotiated with the local authority. The building was one of the assets given to Nuclear Electric when it was created. The company has paid Pounds 2.5m for the removal of asbestos, with which it was contaminated.</p>

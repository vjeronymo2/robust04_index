			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU ready to meet Russia half way on aluminium plan Russia has rejected a European Commission suggestion that its aluminium exports to the European Union be restricted to 200,000 tonnes next year and asked for the level to be set at 300,000 tonnes. The Commission is ready to make a concession, moving the total to 240,000 tonnes, and this will be put to the Russian delegation later this week. Meanwhile, the Commission has extended the temprorary curbs of imports from all the Commonwealth of Independent States for another three months, mainly because it has not been able to organise talks with other CIS republics. It hopes to reach agreement soon with Russia, the main CIS producer, and there is even a possibility that details will be announced on December 9 when Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, may be in Brussels to sign a trade agreement. Agreement in principle has been reached about the need for CIS export restraint, including a method of double checking by the use of both export licences in the CIS and import licences in the EU. The commission imposed a restriction on CIS aluminium to 'safeguard' the EU industry, saying that only 60,000 tonnes could be imported between August and the end of this month. The curb is to be extended at the same rate, so only another 45,000 tonnes can be imported between December 1 and the end of February. The commission still insisted that an EU/CIS arrangement would not conflict with attempts to get agreement between most of the big aluminium producing countries who will meet in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday. The Commission's new offer will be made to Russia at these meetings. Russia is suggesting to the western producers that the industry should cut annual production by 1.5m tonnes, or about 8 per cent, to help bring supply back into line with demand. The US industry is seeking instead an immediate 1.1m tonnes cut in CIS output - and for its exports next year to be held at 500,000 tonnes, down from the expected 1.5m tonnes in 1993.</p>

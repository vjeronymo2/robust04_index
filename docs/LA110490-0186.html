			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ROMANIA;  </P> <P> PROTESTS OVER RISING PRICES ENTER 3RD DAY  </P> <P> Thousands of Romanian demonstrators roamed the capital, blocked traffic and  demanded the government's resignation in a third day of noisy protests against  price rises. The demonstrations underlined the fragility of new elected  governments in Eastern Europe's former Communist states as they try to switch  from central planning to a market economy. The protests in Bucharest were  ostensibly triggered when the National Salvation Front government scrapped  price subsidies, but most slogans were directed specifically at President Ion  Iliescu, a former Communist.  </P></p>

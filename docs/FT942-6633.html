			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Gardening: Chelsea blossoms in London's gloom - Robin Lane Fox enjoys its variety and spectacle How can one Chelsea flower show be different from another? After 30 years, surely we middling gardeners have seen it all before? In fact, if you were there this week you probably saw more of it than usual because the tickets, although limited, did not sell out in advance. If you were not, you missed the usual acts of extravagance outside the main tent, the perpetual threat of mud, and a marvellous range of exhibits inside which would keep anyone going for the next few months. Outside, horticultural bookseller Wells and Winter, of Mereworth, Maidstone, Kent (tel: 0622-813627), was distributing lists of rabbit-proof plants, and a diving girl in white marble had been sculpted with a trendy pair of bathing shorts, while the theme gardens continued the new focus on sufferers, whether blind, allergic or prison inmates. The press proved to have pulled itself together and the Daily Express staged a rather charming impression of a railway cottage's garden with eroding rails, no timetable and a glimpse of what rail privatisation could mean for a rural track. Much the best garden, though, was the Daily Telegraph's abbey garden which Julian Bannerman mounted with unusual flair on the difficult corner site. For once, a theme garden was more than promotional hot air. Bannerman assembled genuine fragments of medieval walling, pinnacles and windows. Salisbury cathedral chipped in with lengths of superfluous stonework, on offer to potential buyers, and I began to see a future for the fabric of my Oxford college if the funds become much tighter. But it all seemed like an abbey garden and, where the planting had come right on the day, it maintained a style around 1900. One of its best touches was the tall, white tobacco plants, but they had come over at short notice from the Prison Service garden on the site opposite. HM's glasshouse director described how he and his staff grow fresh vegetables for the major sites behind bars. When tempers rise in hot weather, they can send in a fresh salad on demand to divert the inmates. In the recent downpour, they could also lend bedding plants to the best of this year's newspaper gardens. Inside the tent, the scale and the spectacle still amaze me. I know that it is the world's largest tent and that the aisles go on forever, from the lupins on one side to hints for the disabled on the other. Just before judging, it looks like a miracle as wave upon wave of flowers, stretching further than the eye can see, await their prizes and a royal visit. This year's stars were well commemorated. Woodfield Brothers, of Tiddington, near Stratford-upon-Avon (0789-205618), crowned their superb display of new lupins with a pale pinkish number called Gloria Hunniford. Peter Smith, of Chanctonbury Nurseries, Ashington, West Sussex (0903-8 92870), is making real progress with the size and colour of his hardy alstroemiras, and every gardener now needs to consider them for new borders as they rise up the social scale to the names of yet more princesses (including Elizabeth, a superb, low-growing innovation). The corner-piece of the S &amp; N Brackley (Wingrave, Aylesbury, Bucks 0296-681384) sweet pea exhibit was a big bowl of the latest pale pink variety, named Kiri Te Kanawa for the 50th anniversary of the singer's birth in New Zealand. Opera-going gardeners ought to go for this heavenly cut flower with such an excellent scent. Among the big set pieces, I need hardly say that the best was Notcutts Nurseries of Woodbridge, Suffolk (0394-383344). Notcutts is master of the huge exhibit, and this year it excelled among some strong competition because it seemed to know how to arrange colours, keep out horrors and avoid kitsch. It staged a series of separate, adjacent colour schemes in a sequence that developed as we walked round the ropes of the stand. It took us from pale pinks to dark purples and reds and round again to fresh whites and a final flourish of scented philadelphus to remind us of the summer ahead. Notcutts placed colours to such advantage that it could even get away with two of my personal hates, the pink cherry Kanzan and yellow-variegated Acer drummondii. In context, even these brutes acquired a certain charm; but I wish they had never appealed to so many of our town planners. Since the mid-1980s, the smaller exhibitors are the people who have lifted the show to a new quality and elegance. Gone are dreary old pans of alpines and the seasonal clematis, shown on canes against canvas. Exhibitors are marvellously clever at moving large climbers in full flower and re-arranging them naturally: valley clematis managed tall, white arches of the fragile vitichella forms, while Peter Beales Roses, of Attleborough, Norfolk (0953-454707), even contrived to show a life-like arch of the little, pink-flowered Himalayan musk roses which will not be climbing up my beastly old conifers, or showing any colour, until mid-July. At the lowest level, the Alpine Garden Society put on another of those exhibits which emphasises its standing among our specialist groups. Its president had contributed a plant of a heavenly white oxalis, collected personally in the Falklands; and its Himalayan poppies were the best in the show, including the rare red as well as the huge blues and the pale lavender form. These poppies are a heartache to me because they hate my dry soil. But I can grow the encrusted saxifrages; their sprays of white flowers are so obliging, yet used so rarely by keen gardeners who want to enliven the next two weeks. Perhaps it was a dark, rain-laden sky but my lasting impression from this year lay with the many shade and damp-loving plants which the smaller stands show to such perfection. The Paradise Centre, of Lamarsh, Bures, Suffolk (0787-269449) had even brought a perfect example of the white-flowered Japanese glaucidium, which prefers woodland and is hardly ever a visitor to Chelsea. The many new and large-leaved hostas at Goldbrook Plants have totally revived my interest and fondness in the family: Londoners in shade or with large pots should pay special attention to the list from Hoxne, Eye, Suffolk (037975-770). Glebe Cottage Plants, of Warkleigh, North Devon (0769-540554) had caught the dampness of the exterior with a splendid country planting of pale flowers, unusual polemoniums, a wide carpet of moss, a half-open little gate, and a pair of gardening boots. I have concentrated on the showing because Chelsea is above all a show. Anyone who thinks that many of its exhibits are somehow being bought in from the market at short notice is very far off the mark. There have always been some question marks and they have had their publicity this year. But the fact remains that the majority of the exhibitors plan their display for months, even years, in advance and try to excel in everything for this one occasion, even though the Royal Horticultural Society pays them nothing and they are not allowed to sell stock during the main duration of the display. The exhibitors this year were requested to display notices assuring the public that everything shown had been grown or raised in the nursery itself. To my eye, the fact has never been in doubt, because we are all being transported briefly to heaven by the focused efforts of the most whole-hearted growers in this country.</p>

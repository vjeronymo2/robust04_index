			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SECURITY CONSULTANT' CONVICTED OF KIDNAPING ADOPTED TODDLER  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court jury on Friday convicted a man of kidnaping a  13-month-old boy at gunpoint from the Pacific Palisades home of his adoptive  parents in December, 1987.  </P> <P> In its second day of deliberations, the jury found Jonathan Cosby, 28, of North  Hollywood, guilty of one count of kidnaping. Cosby is to be sentenced in April.  He faces a maximum 15 years in state prison, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeannette  Bernstein, who prosecuted the case.  </P> <P> Cosby, a self-styled "security consultant," was hired by the child's biological  mother, Bonnie Jean Kiefer, 41, to bring back the infant she had given up in a  privately arranged adoption. Kiefer was placed on five years probation after  pleading no contest to a kidnaping charge.  </P> <P> Charges against her husband, Francis Kiefer, were dropped at the preliminary  hearing, Bernstein said.  </P> <P> An earlier trial resulted in a deadlocked jury that voted 10 to 2 to convict  Cosby.  </P> <P> The child was taken at gunpoint from a baby-sitter at the home of Kenneth and  Barbara Smith. When the Smiths returned home about 1 1/2 hours after the  abduction, they found the sitter bound and gagged.  </P> <P> The child was found in the Kiefers' custody two days later in New Jersey, where  they lived. Earlier, the Kiefers had lost a court battle to regain custody of  their child.  </P></p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Letter: Post Office already in banking Sir, Your interesting article on the possible privatisation of Britain's Post Office ('Return to sender - cost unknown', December 10) was generally a balanced and stimulating feature on this difficult issue. I was particularly interested in the comment that the Post Office might be in a better position to fulfil its obligation to maintain a national network 'if it were permitted to undertake banking transactions'. I should point out, of course, that Girobank, as I am sure you are aware, provides a wide range of banking services for personal and corporate customers through the Post Office network. Girobank has well over 1m personal account holders and handles more than Pounds 55bn a year through its cash handling service for corporate customers. Perhaps you may recall that Girobank plc was privatised from the Post Office in July 1990 and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society. Lewis Evans, managing director, Girobank, 49 Park Lane, London W1Y 4EQ</p>

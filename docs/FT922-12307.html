			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Economics: Attention moves to trade figures in search for clear signs of recovery WITH the UK election out of the way, the race to spot clear signs of economic recovery is on. The evidence so far has been patchy. Last week's figures were contradictory  -manufacturing output rose in March while the rise in unemployment eased, but the Confederation of British Industry's survey of distributive trades showed retail sales falling in February. Two sets of figures this week will therefore be closely scrutinised. On Friday the Central Statistical Office publishes figures for retail sales in March and trade figures for the same month. In spite of a recession and an upward trend in exports, the underlying UK trade deficit is still high, at around Pounds 1bn on a monthly basis. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief European economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese securities house, says: 'To run a trade deficit when the economy is in recession suggests that there are acute structural problems. Moreover, as the economic recovery moves on to a firmer footing, the trade deficit is set to deteriorate sharply.' Another fear is that with 57 per cent of Britain's exports going to the European Community, a downturn in economic activity elsewhere in Europe will hurt British exporters. In Germany, with March marking the peak of West German inflation, April's cost of living figures should show a deceleration in the annual rate to 4.7 per cent. According to Midland Montagu Research, inflation in the second quarter is likely to average around 4.5 per cent. It predicts that from now on, both headline and underlying inflation should decline through 1992. German M3 data are also released this week. The M3 figure continues to grow outside its target range of 3.5-5.5 per cent a year, slowing only slightly in February to 8.5 per cent. March is expected to show a marginal deceleration in the annual growth to about 8 per cent. Highlights of the week ahead, with median forecasts in brackets from MMS International, a financial information company, include: Today: US, March Treasury budget; France, February industrial production (up 0.4 per cent); Denmark, March consumer price index (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 2.4 per cent on year); Canada, February retail sales (down 0.3 per cent).

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / MoD faces Pounds 500m gap in budget next year: Problems in housing scheme put spending plans at risk The Ministry of Defence faces a Pounds 500m gap in its budget next year if it cannot resolve problems which are dogging a scheme to transfer servicemen's quarters to the private sector. The ministry will be forced to look for savings elsewhere in its budget, including scaling back its procurement plans if the scheme fails to take off. The Department of Trade and Industry is monitoring developments because it is concerned that UK defence companies could suffer if there are further cuts in the MoD procurement budget. Mr David Hart, a businessman who is a friend of Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, has been brought in to advise on raising the money for the transfer and on how to modernise the housing stock. The scheme - unveiled in March and described by Viscount Cranborne, then defence minister, as 'a sort of finance lease' - involves creating a non-profit-making housing trust to own and manage the homes. For the housing project to deliver the savings projected for the defence budget in 1995 and 1996, it would have to be in operation within the next 12 months. However, it is thought that the ministry has not received any firm commitments from housing associations or the private sector to get the scheme started. Under the plan, 68,000 armed services married quarters would be transferred to the housing trust under 30-year leases. The trust would be independent of the MoD, but would contract with it to provide accommodation for married service personnel and to improve its quality. Capital for the deal would be raised in the City, secured against the future stream of rental income. Although there has been a good deal of interest in principle among potential lenders, aspects of the proposals have provoked concerns which the ministry is yet to overcome. Much of the property is in poor condition and located near military bases, rather than in towns and cities where it could be more easily sold or rented if it is not needed by the armed forces. Some of it is inside secure areas, which restricts its use to defence personnel. Doubts have also been raised in the housing association movement over the capacity of the markets to raise an additional Pounds 500m a year. Associations currently raise around Pounds 1bn a year to top up government grants for building low-cost homes. With concern over the supply of funds in the future, the Housing Corporation, the quango that distributes the grant, has been trying to attract foreign investors. Potential investors are thought to have been asked to accept a 30-year estimate of the likely cost of upgrading the accommodation. Some are said to have regarded this as taking an unacceptable risk. Mr Hart, a political adviser to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is helping to devise a plan that meets the government's objectives. Mr Hart is a former aide to Baroness Thatcher and helped set up the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. According to the MoD, 'a number of variants' for structuring the deal are currently under consideration. It will be 'some time' before ministers decide which one to adopt, the ministry says, but it has 'every expectation' of meeting 'the original objective set for the whole exercise'.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 2 ROBBERS FOILED TRYING TO OPEN GAS STATION SAFE  </P> <P> A Simi Valley gas station manager was bound and held at gunpoint Monday in a  robbery attempt that was foiled by an electronic counter safe, a Simi Valley  police spokesman said.  </P> <P> Vijaykumar Kardani, manager of the Thrifty station at 2211 Tapo St., said two  men entered the station's mini-market around 8:30 a.m. while he was doing  paperwork.  </P> <P> He said that he recalled seeing the pair at the station earlier Monday.  </P> <P> One man asked Kardani where he could find a certain candy bar, then shoved the  barrel of a handgun into the manager's chest after he came out from behind the  counter, Kardani said in an interview.  </P> <P> "He told me, 'I've killed a lot of people, so do you want to live or do you  want to die?"' Kardani said. "My life was in front of me. I told him to take  whatever he wanted."  </P> <P> Kardani said the gunman bound his hands behind his back with duct tape and put  him in a bathroom. He kept the gun trained on the manager while his partner  attempted to open the safe.  </P> <P> "Two customers came in and the other guy must have gotten confused what to do,"  Kardani said.  </P> <P> Lt. Neal Rein said the thieves took a key from the manager but lacked another  key needed to open the safe. The men, in their 20s, fled in a late-model,  light-blue BMW 735i. Customers then freed Kardani and called the police.  </P> <P> "They must have been targeting the safe," Kardani said, "because there was  about $100 in the cash register they left behind."  </P></p>

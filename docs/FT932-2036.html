			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Arts: Goehr and Takemitsu - Aldeburgh Festival Toru Takemitsu is the featured composer at Aldeburgh this year, and Peter Serkin very much the featured performer. Richard Fairman mentioned Serkin's performance of the Goldberg Variations in his report on the opening weekend and the pianist appeared again at the Snape Maltings on Friday, when Oliver Knussen conducted the London Sinfonietta in an enterprising 20th century programme which was also relayed on BBC Radio 3. There was the statutory piece of Britten - the Nocturne sung by Adrian Thompson - and an hors d'oeuvre from Knussen himself in the shape of his 1978 Skryabin Settings, piano miniatures craftily turned into chamber-orchestra studies. Between them Serkin revived Alexander Goehr's Piano Concerto from 1972, and Knussen introduced Takemitsu's Archipelago S, commissioned by the festival. Goehr's Concerto was written for Daniel Barenboim and is full of pianistic touches and tangled, sinewy keyboard writing. As so often in Goehr the argument seems driven by its harmony rather than its rhythm; there are ghosts of classical archetypes behind its pair of movements, and an orchestral palette designed to keep the accompaniments bright and limpid. The burden of the argument is consistently taken by the soloist and Serkin projected it all superbly, giving Goehr's lines a brittle lyricism and bite which made light of the work's complexities. The rewards come slowly and only sporadically through the first movement, but the second, hybridising slow movement and finale, moves towards a very positive climax in which Serkin was bold and thrillingly convincing. Archipelago S. proved to be another luminous sample of Takemitsu's Debussyan poetry, a 14-minute essay in call and response between three antiphonal groups and a pair of solo clarinets stationed at the back of the hall. The title comes with Takemitsu's usual bundle of allusions: the 'S' refers to archipelagos - Stockholm, Seattle, the Seto Inland Sea - which have most captured the composer's imagination, and to Snape itself. 'I wanted to create a piece', says Takemitsu, 'wherein the (instrumental) islands calling out to each other across the great distances separating them could be experienced as a metaphor for the universe.' There are some stirring exchanges, melodic figures that are passed around the groups then out to the offshore clarinets and back again, almost theatrical pronouncements by solo trumpets and horns, and impressionist washes which round out the sound world. It is music of the rhapsodic moment, full of beautiful sound objects faultlessly arrayed. In this performance everything was in place; the extreme precision that Takemitsu's poetry demands was impressively achieved by Knussen and the 21 Sinfonietta players. * The 'Composer's Portrait' has become a regular fixture at Aldeburgh. The subject this year was Peter Paul Nash, whose programme on Saturday afternoon included three of his own works interspersed with piano pieces by Ravel, Sibelius, Bach and Norgard, neatly played by Rolf Hind. Two song cycles sung by Sarah Leonard - the student Terrace from 1971, setting Wallace Stevens in a post-Schoenberg, post-Ravel mode, and the 1988 In a Walled Garden on Tennyson - were invoked to demonstrate the development in Nash's style, though the difference seemed much more a question of attitude, of ironic undercutting in the later work, than of profound linguistic changes. The novelty was the first performance of Nash's Second String Quartet, introduced by the Brindisi Quartet. It's a subtle and intriguing 12-minute structure fashioned from a sequence of a dozen aphoristic movements, which on another level are shaped into an introduction-fast-slow scheme. Towards the close chiming bells are heard, and the music delves back into the 19th century (was it to Smetana perhaps, or Sibelius?) for a fond reminiscence before moving on to an enigmatic close.</p>

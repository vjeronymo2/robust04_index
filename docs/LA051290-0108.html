			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MESSAGE IS LOST ON DODGERS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: PEP TALK BY LASORDA FAILS TO INSPIRE VICTORY AS CLUB LOSES FIFTH IN A  ROW, 9-4. GOODEN STRIKES OUT 15.  </P> <P> You know those heartwarming baseball stories in which the manager of a slumping  team delivers an inspirational pregame speech, then his team beats the  bejabbers out of an opponent?  </P> <P> This isn't one of those stories.  </P> <P> Tom Lasorda provided the inspiration Friday, but the Dodgers didn't respond.  Dwight Gooden pitched one of the worst 15-strikeout games in recent memory, and  the Dodgers lost their fifth consecutive game, 9-4, to the New York Mets.  </P> <P> Lasorda, who prefers individual pep talks to team meetings, broke tradition  before this first game of a weekend series. The short session behind closed  clubhouse doors was as necessary as it was unexpected.  </P> <P> "We were told we have to stop getting beat by mental errors," Mickey Hatcher  said. "We were told to keep going all out, going hard, and not to lose by not  doing the little things."  </P> <P> So what do they do? In addition to a three-run triple by Gooden against Mike  Morgan, the Dodgers were hammered by the little things:  </P> <P>  -- A ground ball that skipped off Lenny Harris' glove at third base.  </P> <P>  -- A low throw to first base by Willie Randolph on an attempted double play.  </P> <P>  -- Alfredo Griffin challenging one of the best left fielders in the league,  Kevin McReynolds, on a play at third base.  </P> <P>  -- Three Dodgers reaching third base with fewer than two outs, only to be  stranded.  </P> <P> The Dodgers took a 3-2 lead in the third inning, but those little things added  up to a five-run Met half of the third.  </P> <P> "It really looked like we got off in the right direction," Lasorda said. "Then  the roof caved in."  </P> <P> As a result, the Dodgers are eight games behind the first-place Cincinnati Reds  in the National League West. Last season, the Dodgers weren't as many as eight  games out of first place until June 23. Last year, they never lost more than  five games in a row and only did that twice.  </P> <P> "More and more, you have to sit back and wonder what is happening," said  Hatcher, who drove in the Dodgers' final run with an eighth-inning pinch  single.  </P> <P> That hit also should have set up a final Dodger rally, as it came with one out  and runners on first and third. Except that Griffin tried to take third on  McReynolds, who in 1988 led all National League outfielders with 18 assists. He  easily threw out Griffin.  </P> <P> "I was trying to make something, but I guess I did it at the wrong time," said  Griffin, who had reached base with a single -- his first hit in 12 at-bats. "It  had been so long since I was on base, I got all excited."  </P> <P> Most of the crowd of 34,817 were excited about Gooden, who showed his best  strikeout form in five years and the best hitting form of his career.  </P> <P> He finished with the most strikeouts in a game in the league this season, and  his most strikeouts since his career high of 16 on Aug. 20, 1985. But he also  gave up nine hits.  </P> <P> "This guy could have gotten beat," Lasorda said. "You look at the game and you  see that his performance was very unbalanced, very misleading. He could have  easily lost."  </P> <P> For example, in the first inning Randolph singled and stole second with one  out. But Kal Daniels and Eddie Murray struck out.  </P> <P> In the second inning, Scioscia doubled with one out and took third on Harris'  infield single. Griffin and Morgan then struck out.  </P> <P> In the fourth, Samuel hit a one-out double and stole third against catcher  Mackey Sasser, who allowed four steals. But Samuel was stranded as Randolph and  Daniels struck out.  </P> <P> "The point of the game is that," Lasorda said. "Not getting those runners  home."  </P> <P> Morgan, who fell to 4-2 while Gooden improved to 2-3, gave up four hits in  three innings, but the Mets scored seven runs on four walks, a hit batter and  Dodger blunders.  </P> <P> The Mets scored their second run in the second inning when Randolph couldn't  complete a double play on Gooden's grounder. Gooden's four runs batted in tied  a club record for pitchers.  </P> <P> The Mets' five runs in the third inning came after Harris couldn't handle a  possible double-play grounder by McReynolds with one out and runners on first  and second. Four batters later, Gooden hit his triple.  </P> <P> "A different play here or there, and it could have been a different story,"  Morgan said. "It is a game of inches, and tonight we didn't have the inches."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson took 40 swings in a batting cage Friday, setting the stage for his  first live batting practice next week. He also sprinted through the outfield  and on the basepaths. "Our plan was to have him take live hitting when he could  run full speed, and he looks close to that now," therapist Pat Screnar said.  Gibson could be back in the lineup for the start of the Dodgers' first series  with the division-leading Cincinnati Reds at the end of the month.  </P> <P> Jay Howell threw a 28-pitch simulated game Friday, and, while he has yet to put  stress on his surgically repaired left knee, he said the knee continued to feel  good. He will throw another simulated game in Los Angeles Monday, the day he is  eligible to return from the disabled list. If he feels well, he could be back  on the roster by the middle of next week. "I've worked very hard, but it's also  amazing," Howell said of his rapid recovery.  </P> <P> Jim Gott retired three consecutive class-A batters in his fourth rehabilitation  assignment for Bakersfield against Palm Springs Thursday. In seven innings at  class A, Gott has given up two runs on six hits with two walks and six  strikeouts. While the Dodgers acknowledge that he still does not have full arm  strength, Gott's two rehabilitation innings in Bakersfield against Reno today  and Sunday could be his final efforts there and a decision on his status could  be made Monday. Also pitching for Bakersfield Sunday will be rehabilitating  Dodger Pat Perry.  </P></p>

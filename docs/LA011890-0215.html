			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP SOCCER ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OVERTIME GOAL GIVES EDISON VICTORY  </P> <P> Craig Harrigan scored in overtime to give Edison High School a 1-0 Sunset  League boys' soccer victory over host Fountain Valley Wednesday.  </P> <P> Harrigan scored one minute into the second 10-minute overtime period after  Fountain Valley goalkeeper Joe Penaflor knocked down a hard shot by Tim Mann.  </P> <P> "We knew (Penaflor) was going to be tough to beat," Edison Coach Mike  DiGiovanni said. "He's won some games for them. He got his head on the first  one and luckily enough we were there for the follow up."  </P> <P> The Chargers (10-4-2 overall, 2-1 in league) kept the ball in Fountain Valley  territory most of the second half but couldn't break through against Penaflor  or the Fountain Valley defense, which hadn't allowed a goal in Sunset League  play. Penaflor, who has nine shutouts this season, finished with 10 saves for  the Barons (12-2-3, 1-1-1).  </P> <P> In the first half, Fountain Valley outshot Edison, 6-1, to set the pace. In the  final 15 minutes of the half, the Barons had a number of good scoring  opportunities, including a Bryan Kojima head shot off a corner kick that barely  missed.  </P> <P> But Fountain Valley's offense wilted in the second half.  </P> <P> "We're asking too much from our defense," Fountain Valley Coach Cameron Beaulac  said. "That's the first goal we've given up in the past four games. Our  forwards have only scored one goal for me in the past six games.  </P> <P> "I think we have the best defense in the league, but if you don't score goals,  you don't win games."  </P> <P> In other Sunset League games:  </P> <P> Ocean View 4, Westminster 1 -- Jed Smith scored two goals, both in the first  half, to lead the Seahawks (10-3-3, 2-0-1) at Westminster. Todd Johnson and  Jason Merkel also scored for Ocean View, which plays first-place Marina on  Friday.  </P> <P> In the Century League:  </P> <P> Foothill 2, Canyon 2 -- Brian Rice and Eric Sukuda scored for Foothill (15-2-2,  2-0-1) and Randy Campbell and Danny Thomas scored for visiting Canyon.  </P> <P> El Modena 2, Santa Ana Valley 1 -- Marc Gonzales and Mike Glaspey scored for El  Modena (6-2-3, 1-1-1).  </P> <P> In the Empire League:  </P> <P> Katella 2, Esperanza 2 -- Armando Orizaba and Brian Schenk scored for Katella  (8-5-4) and Jason Wheeler and Jason De Lucca scored for host Esperanza (11-2-4,  3-0-1).  </P> <P> In the Garden Grove League:  </P> <P> Kennedy 4, Garden Grove 1 -- Joe Rodriguez, Kyong Kim, Tony Lidayer and Jeremy  Weber scored for host Kennedy (6-3-2, 3-2-1).  </P> <P> Pacifica 3, Rancho Alamitos 2 -- Blaine Wilkins scored two goals and Phil  Noetzel scored one as visiting Pacifica rallied from a 2-1 deficit.  </P> <P> In the Orange League:  </P> <P> Valenica 3, Magnolia 2 -- Mario Torrez had two goals and Gary Thompson had one  to lead visiting Valencia.  </P> <P> In the Pacific Coast League:  </P> <P> Orange 7, Costa Mesa 0 -- Ricky Heimer had three goals to lead host Orange  (11-0-2, 8-0).

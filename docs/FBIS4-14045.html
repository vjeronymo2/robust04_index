			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tamar Asalem] </F>   [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Avi Yehezqel asserted at  today's meeting of the Labor caucus that two men are not equals  among equals in the government and the faction. He was  naturally referring to the prime minister and the foreign  minister, who are steering the peace negotiations but keeping  the faction in the dark. In response, Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres delivered an extended political review.    The faction members' questions focused on two issues: the  conclusion of negotiations and the prime minister's remarks at a  United Kibbutzim Movement forum concerning the evacuation of  Golan Heights settlements. On the first issue, Peres repeated  the remarks he made yesterday at the cabinet meeting:    [Begin Peres recording] There are no disagreements between  Yitzhaq [Rabin] and me. We both believe the negotiations should  be concluded. They could be dragged out through eternity, but I  think -- and that is the opinion of our colleagues in Cairo, too  -- that we should assemble all the outstanding issues in one  cluster and resolve them in one fell swoop this coming weekend.  [end recording]    Peres added that it had been agreed that only two issues  will  be left for Rabin's and 'Arafat's ruling: the size of Jericho,  which the Palestinians want to be 100 square kilometers and  Israel will agree to about 60 only; and the matter of the  Palestinian policeman on the bridge. Peres stressed that Israel  does not wish to leave any unresolved issues. The reports I  receive indicate that the other side is likewise interested in  wrapping the thing up, Peres said. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in  Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 25 April adds that "addressing the Labor  caucus, Shim'on Peres said that the reports he received from  Cairo today reflect a certain optimism. He said that after the  prime minister returns from Russia, all the finalized issues  will have to be revisited and decisions will have to be made on  the outstanding issues, such as the judicial procedures and the  air and sea space."]    As for rumors about disagreements between the foreign  minister and the prime minister, Peres clarified that they were  totally baseless.    Peres was forced to parry another attack by faction members,  including MK's Avigdor Qahalani and Eli Goldschmidt from the  Golan Heights lobby, over the prime minister's remarks about  settlement evacuation made at the United Kibbutzim Movement  forum.    [Begin Peres recording] Want peace? There is not a single  person who does not realize that peace entails a deep and  painful change in the Golan Heights. Whoever is ready for a  territorial compromise understands that if we cede territory,  our settlements will not remain there. The settlements  themselves are not going to want to remain. [end recording]    It will be noted that some faction members lauded the prime  minister's remarks. Peres, however, asked the forum to refrain  from discussing the issue while the prime minister is abroad.</p>

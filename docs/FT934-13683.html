			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (2): A two-pronged development - The burgeoning market in interest-rate derivatives INTEREST rates are hitting rock bottom, the US government is serious about trimming its deficit, and portfolio managers, stung by unthinkably low returns, are baling out of the bond markets for more profitable venues. Does this mean the burgeoning markets in interest-rate derivatives, one of the more stunning financial phenomena of the eighties, are close to peaking? No, say dealers. Fixed income derivatives, which are proliferating rapidly, are thriving on the uncertainty created by a 300-basis-point drop in US interest rates in a year, the volatility in European currency differentials following the demise of the ERM, and a massive restructuring of corporate debt. Last year US corporate treasurers moved en masse to switch fixed-rate obligations, which looked very attractive only a few months earlier, to lower-cost floating rate debt. Even the US government, confident of its own ability to keep inflation low, shifted its debt sales to shorter maturities. The phenomenon is now hitting Europe as rates there fall. To hear some bankers tell it, on a quiet day in London you can almost hear the scurrying as corporate treasurers, locked into fixed-rate debt at 8 and 9 per cent, rush to swap into adjustable-rate deals, to take advantage of falling interest rates. Reversing once-attractive fixed rate deals is expensive, although they ultimately lower financing costs, and dealers have become creative about embedding option-like features into the contracts to bring down their cost. 'Interest rate derivatives are developing into a two-pronged market,' says Mr Leon Tatevossian, vice-president for derivatives research at Salomon Brothers. 'New products are evolving to meet ever more complicated risk management needs, while the use of structured transactions by asset managers to enhance portfolio yields is another big growth area.' Once the province of US government securities dealers who used the Chicago interest-rate futures and options pits to hedge their wholesale bond purchases, the use of derivatives trickled down from banks to corporate treasurers, then to asset managers, and now even to individuals seeking higher yields by investing in derivative-driven mutual funds. Derivatives dealers who once focused exclusively on designing vehicles for customers who wanted to hedge liabilities are now reaching out to asset managers who are beginning to use manufactured securities as investments. Shrewd futures traders have been speculating in derivatives for years, but for the portfolio manager who does not want to be exposed to daily market moves, a tailored over-the-counter deal is more suitable than an exchange trade. Creating a healthy 'buy side' audience for structured debt will provide balance to the derivatives industry, although some critics say asset managers, by piling into the instruments in a frantic search for yield, could get burned if there is an unexpected interest rate shock. And the liability-management side of the derivative utility equation is nowhere near being exhausted, in the US or elsewhere. In the US, a new accounting regulation known as FAS 115 is likely to pull conservative regional bankers, insurance companies, and other capital-sensitive businesses who have resisted the trend, into the derivatives fold. The regulation, which becomes effective in January 1994, requires that securities be classified as either 'held to maturity', 'available for sale', or 'held for trading'. Securities in either of the two latter categories must be regularly marked to market, a factor that makes them suddenly vulnerable to even small fluctuations in long-term interest rates. The new requirements are expected to throw many more securities into the 'available for sale' accounting bin, and while the marked-to market process will not show through on income statements, it will affect equity and capital requirements. 'A company that is capital-sensitive will have to keep a closer eye on what is happening in the available-for-sale account. Its just one more risk they'll have to manage,' says Marjorie Marker, a senior manager and derivatives specialist for Arthur Andersen. She believes derivatives will play a large part in helping these companies mitigate this new market risk. However, conservative organisations, mainly small banks, will simply move assets into shorter maturities, an action that will trim the margins they now reap in the spread between borrowing customer funds at 3 per cent interest and lending them to the government at 6 per cent. Far from stealing business from organised futures and options exchanges, the evolution and diversification of interest-rate derivatives has fuelled tremendous growth in exchange-traded products. Even the most exotic swaps and structured notes designed for a single customer are eventually distilled into a risk a dealer will hedge in a futures or options pit. Sometimes, when the custom transactions are for long maturity periods or require frequent rate adjustments, the over-the-counter deal will be hedged and covered and re-hedged repeatedly on an exchange. This helps explain why the total notional value of interest-rate swaps outstanding at the end of 1992, at Dollars 3,800bn, as reported by the trade group ISDA, was smaller than the same measure of current open positions in US-exchange-traded interest-rate derivatives, and far smaller than the value of exchange-traded government debt worldwide. The exchanges are best described as wholesale debt-management markets, and their growth rates expand in concert with custom-tailored derivatives. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange had a 14.2 per cent year-over-year growth rate in interest-rate futures and options at the end of the third quarter, while at the Chicago Board of Trade, interest-rate transactions grew by 17.8 per cent. That compares with ISDA estimates that over-the-counter interest rate swaps, in all currencies, grew at a 19 per cent rate last year.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Engineers call for tax allowance to boost innovation A new company tax allowance should be introduced to encourage innovation by recognising the importance of professionally qualified engineers, scientists and marketing staff, the Institution of Electrical Engineers said yesterday. The plea was one of four linked national initiatives proposed in a report by the institution which aim to improve the UK's output, productivity, share of world trade and balance of payments. It comes a few days before the long-awaited Department of Trade and Industry white paper on competitiveness. Professor Jack Levy, who prepared the institution's report, said: 'We hope the DTI will take at least some of our ideas on board.' The institution says innovation in research and development, design, manufacturing and marketing depends crucially on the employment of qualified people. The new tax allowance would cover more than the total cost of employing professionally qualified engineers, scientists and marketing staff plus overheads and support. As a starting point, the report suggests that 150 per cent of the cost of such staff plus an agreed percentage for overheads should be allowed for tax purposes. The institution says there would be a number of immediate benefits: innovation would be encouraged and the scheme would motivate staff and employers. It would also help combat the UK's anti-industrial culture. Unveiling the report yesterday, Prof Levy said the initial cost of such a scheme would be repaid in the long term through increased tax revenues from an expanded manufacturing base. The institution's innovation initiative also includes a plea for 100 per cent capital allowances in the year of purchase to help companies re-equip at the same rate as overseas competitors. The three other proposals in the institution's Manufacturing Expansion Scheme are initiatives on management, technology and finance for industry. The finance proposal renews and expands on the institution's plea for a new bank to enable small and medium-sized manufacturers to borrow money more cheaply.

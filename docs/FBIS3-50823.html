			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] We would like to reiterate that Blas N. Riquelme  resigned today as president of the Colorado Party. The  controversy between Riquelme and President Juan Carlos Wasmosy  came to a conclusion today when the controversial politician and  brewery owner resigned.    Riquelme's resignation was reported at the headquarters of  the Colorado Party by Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, first vice  president of the Colorado Party Executive Board, to whom  Riquelme conveyed his decision to resign after a telephone  conversation they held this morning.    According to the statutes of the Colorado Party, Sanabria  Cantero automatically becomes the acting president of the  Colorado Party. The party's executive board is holding a  closed-door meeting to evaluate Riquelme's situation regarding  his controversy with President Wasmosy. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920728 FT  28 JUL 92 / Checkpoint Charlie in business A BERLIN court yesterday approved an DM800m (Pounds 276m) business centre project on the site of Checkpoint Charlie, the former crossing into East Germany. It dismissed a case by an east Berlin woman who claimed to own the site, ruling that property at the Berlin Wall could not be returned under the terms of the 1990 German unification treaty. Checkpoint Charlie was dismantled in June 1990 after the city was united. Central European Development Corporation, majority-owned by US cosmetics company Estee Lauder and headed by Mr Mark Palmer, former US ambassador to Hungary, was given the green light by the city government last year to erect the American Business Centre on the site. , Nearly 3,000 dentists in Germany's populous North Rhine region downed drills and closed surgeries yesterday in protest at the government's plans to cut spending on the state-subsidised health care system, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. Members of the Free Association of German Dentists are being urged to only accept patients privately.</p>

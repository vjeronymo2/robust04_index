			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Ministers Press Center issued a  statement today in connection with the statement that Professor  Krustyu Petkov made today at a news conference of the KNSB  [Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria] in which  he claimed that the telephones of the trade unions that are  preparing to conduct national protest actions on 4 May are  tapped. The statement denies the KNSB claim. In its own  announcement, the Interior Ministry Press Center points out such  actions are not allowed, as they would violate the Law on  Special Intelligence-Gathering Devices.</p>

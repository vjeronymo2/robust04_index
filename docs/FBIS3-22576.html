Debbache: "Sour El-Ghozlane: 67 Typhoid Cases </F> Confirmed"]    [Text] In the last two weeks, public health authorities in  Sour El-Ghozlane have reported numerous cases of typhoid. Out of  more than 80 reported cases, 67 have been confirmed by  laboratory analysis, and these alone are enough to constitute a  veritable epidemic -- to the great distress of local  inhabitants, some of whom are close to panic. The first case was  reported on 27 December 1993. To deal with the situation, public  health workers have mobilized personnel and equipment resources  commensurate with the threat. Two wards -- one for men and the  other for women -- have been reserved on the third floor of the  hospital, under strict isolation procedures. The pediatric ward  is overcrowded and looks more like a day nursery than a hospital  ward, but the important thing is that tests and proper care are  being administered. The hardest part is still ahead, because if  wider contagion is to be prevented, the source of contamination  will have to be identified and eliminated. Some observers blame  the poor water treatment facilities, others the decrepit state  of water mains vulnerable to contamination from waste water,  while still others point to the whey sold in the street in  plastic containers exposed to the open air. In any case, and as  a preventive measure, the sale of whey in plastic sacks has been  suspended temporarily, while the churns used by small producers  to make the whey have been idled. In addition to identification  and eventual elimination of the loci of contamination, an  extensive vaccination drive has been launched at the community  and even the family level. Visits have been paid to Dachemia and  Bordj Okhris, where suspected cases have been reported.    Also, with the appearance of diphtheria cases in the wilaya,  steps have been taken to arrest this scourge. It should be noted  that the reappearance of diphtheria after its eradication more  than 15 years ago signals a certain fall-off in the vaccination  program. All of which serves to emphasize the high priority that  must be given to dissemination of information and to general  public awareness campaigns. Also, we noted during our visit the  large number of medical personnel on hand, including Dr. Garti  himself.</p>

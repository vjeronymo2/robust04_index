			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Business Travel: US air safety Air travel in the US over Christmas could be severely disrupted following the grounding of dozens of commerical flights because of a crackdown on commuter airline safety standards. At the weekend American Eagle suspended all commuter operations to mid-west cities for the second time in less than a week, and Kiwi International Airlines suspended all services. Crashes have given US aviation its worst safety record in six years, with the pall over the commuter airline industry deepened by two American Eagle crashes in five weeks that killed 83 people. The result is that some travellers have been scrambling for rental cars rather than short-hop flights. Prompted by last week's crash of an American Eagle UK-built Jetstream Super 31 (a two-engined turbo-prop), US transportation secretary Federico Pena said that commuter airlines in the US faced more safety inspections and their crews would get more rest under new safety rules. He said American Eagle has been observing the safety standards required for larger aircraft, but that the authorities would start an immediate safety audit of every US carrier, large or small. In addition, commuter airline safety standards would be elevated to match those of regular airlines. Pena set a 100-day deadline for this to be achieved. 'We are very troubled by the number of accidents we've had this year,' he said. An American Eagle spokesman said the company had complete confidence in the type of aircraft it uses.</p>

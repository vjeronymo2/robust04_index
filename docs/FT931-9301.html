			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Compelling challenge for Europe Sir, Samuel Brittan's article, 'Time for the UK to buck up' (Economic Viewpoint, February 11) squashes the old chestnut of Britain's poor relative economic performance against Germany and France. But the real revelation is the miserable performance of the main European economies put together, as compared to the US, which shows American output per person averaging twice that in Europe. Could there be a more compelling illustration of why Europe must get its act together, complete the integration process and create the critical economic mass which, as the American example shows, really works?

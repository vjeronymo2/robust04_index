			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Europe's Jobs Crisis: Economic recovery alone offers no cure  -Why is unemployment so much worse in the European Community than in the US or Japan? Is it the recession, or are there deeper factors?  / FT writers report as EC leaders seek answers at today's summit EC COUNTRIES, facing further increases in unemployment during the next year, are implementing a mixture of shorter and longer term moves to try to keep the rises to a minimum. Often, however, the governments know the measures are little more than palliatives. Everyone agrees there are no simple answers. As the Bank for International Settlements put it in its annual report this month: 'Especially in continental Europe, where 40 to 50 per cent of the unemployed have been without work for 12 months or more, unemployment constitutes a structural problem which cannot easily be resolved through higher output growth.' The EC Commission recognises that, to make even a modest dent in the Community's 17m unemployment total, labour market deregulation needs to be near the top of the agenda. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has carefully avoided suggesting the Maastricht treaty's social chapter contributes to joblessness. But the Commission's new strategy on unemployment unveiled during the last few weeks pinpoints high labour costs as an important factor. In particular, the Commission has suggested unemployment could be brought down through reductions in employers' social security contributions. The cost to national exchequers of direct measures to alleviate unemployment is relatively small in terms of the EC's overall spending on social security. But, including indirect effects, rising unemployment has had a considerable impact in increasing overall EC social transfers to an estimated 19.3 per cent of gross domestic product this year from 15.8 per cent in 1980, according to OECD figures. Social transfers (including medical and pensions payouts as well as other forms of social security) have risen during this period to 14.5 per cent from 11.0 per cent for the UK, to 21.0 per cent from 17.0 per cent for Germany, to 22.5 per cent from 19.2 per cent for France and to 18.9 per cent from 14.2 per cent for Italy. According to the OECD, most EC countries spend between 1 and 3 per cent of GDP on 'active' and 'passive' labour market programmes. 'Active' measures are classified as various forms of training, youth employment measures, subsidised employment and the like, whereas 'passive' spending comprises unemployment benefit and early retirement pay-outs. In the 'active' category, Ireland, Denmark and Germany lead the league table with spending put at 1.48, 1.39 and 1.21 per cent of GDP respectively. In 'passive' measures, Denmark heads the list with 4.72 per cent, followed by Ireland (2.83) and Belgium (2.71). The UK comes near the bottom of both lists with spending of 0.56 per cent of GDP on 'active' measures and 1.35 per cent on 'passive' ones. Since 1985, governments have moved away from direct job creation towards more targeted measures aimed at mobilising labour supply for productive work. Success has, however been only limited. Employment creation in such countries as France or Spain has slowed sharply in spite of buoyant economic growth in the latter half of the 1980s. In view of forecasts that French unemployment, already more than 3m, will rise by a further 300,000 this year, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has recently been forced to expand the scope of planned employment creation measures. He has also appealed to French industry to offer a further 200,000 apprenticeships and training posts to take more young people off the dole queue. The Netherlands offers an instructive example of how generous welfare benefits can impede labour market schemes. The country focuses efforts to combat unemployment on providing training and work experience. For people up to the age of 27, the government offers guarantees of work experience at public and non-profit institutions. However, only 7,200 people take part. For the long-term unemployed, there are 'job pools' that offer mainly unskilled work experience in hospitals, schools and other public bodies. About 14,000 people participate. In both cases, participants get paid little more than they would receive under the Netherlands' generous welfare benefits - so that participation rates are inevitably low. As continental Europe confronts the realities of the recession, the greatest financial squeeze is being felt by Germany. The federal labour office warned last week that its deficit could rise to DM20bn (Pounds 8bn) this year, with spending climbing to over DM100bn, up DM13bn from the 1993 budget. Over DM11bn was spent on job creation schemes with DM9bn channelled to east Germany. The labour office also spent DM9.7bn in early retirement programmes whereby 55-year-old workers receive their full wages for five years, until the normal retirement age. Measures to make the labour market more flexible are being proposed with much greater urgency. Mr Julius Louwen, a Christian Democrat parliamentary deputy, has drafted 13 recommendations on which the federal labour ministry is working. In Spain, labour market inflexibility is also a growing preoccupation. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, is starting discussions with trade union leaders on a social pact aimed at bringing wages under control. Mr Gonzalez is also trying to gain trade union agreement to less rigid guidelines on job classification, on labour mobility and on short term contracts. Perhaps the most painful task in Europe awaits Italy. No government in Rome since the 1950s has envisaged a long recession or imagined chronic unemployment being a serious problem. As a result there is no welfare state concept of unemployment benefit - merely a system of funding temporary lay-offs for up to two years, so that workers can return to their jobs once the production cycle picks up.</p>

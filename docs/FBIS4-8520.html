			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Following his tour  yesterday of the Bosnian Serb Army positions on the Gorazde  battlefront and areas devastated by NATO air strikes, Vojislav  Seselj, chairman of the Serbian Radical Party, met with Serb  President Radovan Karadzic in Pale this afternoon.    Following that meeting, Seselj told journalists that NATO  air  strikes against Serb positions have greatly complicated the  situation on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina, since  the air strikes against Serb positions mean NATO has sided with  the Muslims.    The leader of the Serbian Radical Party added that this made  NATO one of the warring sides, and as a result, it will have to  bear all the consequences. The United Nations, by siding with  the Muslims, has also lost its elementary objectivity.    "They can no longer be mediators in this conflict. In this  way they have lost a lot -- not the Serbs. The morale of the  Serb fighters, in my opinion, has never been better than now,"  Seselj stressed.    He added these air strikes have shown the war cannot be won  from the air and that the Serbs cannot be defeated in this way.</p>

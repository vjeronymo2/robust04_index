			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Wife wins mortgage battle MRS BRIDGET O'BRIEN, a mother of six who acted as surety for her husband's business debts, yesterday won her six-year legal battle with Barclays Bank, allowing her to stay in the matrimonial home. The House of Lords ruled that she was entitled to set aside a charge over her home in Slough, Berkshire, because her husband had lied about the extent of the guarantee liability and Barclays had failed to explain the transaction to her and to suggest she seek independent legal advice. Mrs O'Brien's victory will give hope to hundreds of people facing eviction from their homes after being pressured or tricked into acting as surety for their partner's borrowings. But giving judgment, Lord Browne-Wilkinson warned that a person could not disown their obligations just because they subsequently proved they had not fully understood the transaction. To escape obligations the person had to show misrepresentation or undue influence by the partner. After the decision Mrs O'Brien said it had been a long fight, but 'worth it'. She urged people having similar disputes with banks to 'keep fighting'. In a second, related, case the law lords rejected the appeal of a woman who had been induced by her domineering husband to apply for a second mortgage on the matrimonial home so he could play the stock market. The court said that CIBC Mortgages v Pitt was different from the O'Brien case in that Mr and Mrs Pitt were joint borrowers. Although Mr Pitt had exerted undue influence over his wife, there was nothing to put the mortgage company on notice that there might be a problem. Mrs O'Brien signed documents for a second mortgage on the matrimonial home in 1987. The extent of the guarantee liability was Pounds 135,000, although Mr O'Brien had told his wife it was only Pounds 60,000. When his business overdraft exceeded Pounds 154,000, the bank sought foreclosure. The lords said that on the facts Mrs O'Brien had not understood the transaction. The bank had instructed the sub-branch manager to have the transaction and extent of the guarantee liability explained to her. This had not happened. Because of her husband's misrepresentation she had not realised the charge was for more than Pounds 60,000. But the five law lords stopped short of ruling that people acting as surety in such situations should be treated as members of a specially protected class to whom banks owed a duty of care. Lord Browne-Wilkinson said in future the rule in this type of case should be: That the surety is valid and enforceable unless there has been undue influence, misrepresentation or other legal wrong by the principal debtor. If there has, the bank will be 'fixed with constructive notice' of the surety's right to set aside the transaction unless it took reasonable steps to ensure that the partner entered into it freely and understood it. Banks will be deemed to have taken reasonable steps if they have warned the surety of the amount of their potential liability and of the risks involved and advised them to take independent legal advice. Lord Browne-Wilkinson said if the law were thus framed it would hold the balance fairly between vulnerable people who rely implicitly on their partners and financial institutions.</p>

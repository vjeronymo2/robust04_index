			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Interim verdict Hope deferred is, apparently, more enjoyable than hope realised. That at least seems to be the conclusion of the UK equity market since continental interest rate cuts faded into the indefinite future, yet UK share prices rallied to all-time highs. In part that is a more sober realisation that continental governments will take time to adjust to their new found freedom. Clearly the French government had not prepared any more of a fall-back plan than the UK had when it was ejected from the system last September. Weighing desire for economic stimulus against the appearance of monetary rectitude will take some time. Yet with inflationary forces very subdued, cuts in continental rates can only be a matter of time. When continental rates start to fall, and if sterling begins to strengthen, UK rates can decline further. Equities have discounted that now the FT-SE 100 Index has moved decisively above its 2800-2900 trading range, and there must be concern over the high valuation of the market. Low interest rates and low inflation certainly help support high equity multiples. With little incentive to hold cash, equity yields just below 4 per cent have an attraction, even though dividend growth will be sluggish. Ratings which look daunting may thus be maintained and even pushed a little higher. Yet with overseas earners, recovery stocks and financials all having powered the rise since sterling left the ERM, and even stores having bounced from their recent lows, it is difficult to see which sectors will provide the energy for a substantial run. Perhaps the scatter of winners and losers in September's interim reporting season will provide the clues.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Arts: Fanfares for Masur, murder at the Met - New York Music Kurt Masur, who has just begun his second season as the New York Philharmonic's music director, seems to have decided that his first task must be to develop their expertise in the central 19th-century European repertory: Schubert, Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Bruckner dominated his first subscription concerts. But since the orchestra is marking its sesquicentenary this season, there is some conflict between the earnest pressures of the future and the celebratory wish to make a noise about the past. Somebody had the odd idea of commissioning for the anniversary a whole lot of orchestral 'fanfares': time-consuming things to write and to rehearse, and destined for instant oblivion. Tobias Picker's Bang] was the first of these to come and go, producing a stream of rushes, whistles and flurries for three and a half minutes which is an awful long time for a firework. Otherwise we were with the classics. Masur's strengths in the repertory are obvious: his energy and his self-effacing dedication to the task. But equally plain are his and his orchestra's problems. Some of these have to do with the Avery Fisher Hall, where a gentle rake his been introduced in an attempt to lift the woodwind sound. This is not altogether successful, and the massed violin tone is harsh - though the desperation in the orchestra's style is a matter more of rhythm than of sound quality. Masur's emphatic downbeats give his players too many immediate goals and encourage fuzzy attacks that suggest only a frustrated forcefulness. That was particularly the effect in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, played here near the start of this jubilee season because it was the very first piece the orchestra performed. Alongside it, in an unusual moment of didactic programming, Masur placed the First Symphony, in G minor, by Etienne-Nicolas Mehul, a work whose finale, as Schumann was the first to observe, has a four-note tag similar to that of the first movement of Beethoven's Fifth. But one can make too much of this. Mehul's treatment puts a lighter touch on the three-note repetition, and uses the idea for its spinning impetus rather than expounding it as a thematic shape in itself. Then, more generally, there is the vast difference in harmonic awareness, which makes questions of motivic correspondence irrelevant. To hear the Beethoven after the Mehul was to be confronted by a monument after an ink sketch, and for that demonstration of how and why Beethoven towers, the comparison was worth making. Nothing uncommon so far at the Met, where the season's first offerings range from a splendid Tales of Hoffmann, through an uneven Falstaff with old troopers among the merry wives (Mirella Freni, Marilyn Horne), to a depressing Madam ButterflyOffenbach opera is being presented in a new, longer conflation of the old Choudens score with the Oeser edition, and with a new set by the production's designer, Gunther Schneider-Siemssen, for the Venetian act: a view out from something very like the Ca d'Oro, onto the Grand Canal and a duly passing gondola, all very much in keeping with the visual extravagance of the rest of the show. What is lacking is control of movement and posture and interaction among the principals. Instead, four great animals of the stage - Placido Domingo, Carol Vaness, Susanne Mentzer and Samuel Ramey - are pretty much allowed to get away with murder. Domingo portrays Hoffmann as a man anxious to catch up withe the creatures of his own imagination, tugged on a tight wire between reality and desire. Something of this may come out of a technical care, a manoeuvring of his voice through the nasal sound of French, but the excellent effect is a watchful reserve, overcome in moments of glorious abandonment, especially in the third act. Vaness thoroughly enjoys the ironies of projecting herself as a singing machine in the first act, and goes on to show a dignified sensitivity as Antonia and a lusciousness as Giulietta. Mentzer as Nicklausse is spectacularly good, singing with a winning enthusiasm and freedom; Ramey links all the demands of the piece to a solid thrust of vocal power, a steady glare. The orchestra under James Levine, both here and in Falstaff, are luxuriously assured. Not so their colleagues at City Opera, who labour through Busoni's Doktor Faust in what is that opera's first New York staging. This is not a happy debut for a famously challenging work. It looks consistently grim, the entire action being played behind a screen, whose function is to interleave the scenes between pages and diagrams from magical treatises (shades of Prospero's Books), but which disastrously separates and occludes the stage from the audience. William Stone as Faust - at once sure and insatiable, majestic and troubled by dreams - deserves more prominent exposure. So does Michael Rees Davis as Mephistopheles, triumphing against his better, lyrical inclinations, and Eva Zseller as the Duchess of Parma, warmly conveying the piece's only aria.</p>

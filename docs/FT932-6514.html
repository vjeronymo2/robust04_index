			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Hungary faces party split THE GOVERNING Hungarian Democratic Forum is stretched to breaking point after the resignation of the party leader who has held the conservative and nationalist factions together. Mr Lajos Fur, who gave up his unifying role as party president late on Wednesday, said in a statement published yesterday that his efforts to resolve an 'intolerable war between brothers' had ended in 'bitter failure'. Mr Fur's departure leaves the Forum without a bridge between the moderate conservatives of Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, and a smaller group around Mr Istvan Csurka, the populist writer who broke Hungary's political calm with a virulently anti-communist and anti-semitic tract last year. One party leader said the only solution was a 'peaceful divorce'. The long-awaited formal split could come as soon as next week at the Forum's national delegate meeting. A breakaway by Hungarian Justice, the party-within-a-party set up by Mr Csurka and claiming the support of 29 far-right MPs, would cost Mr Antall's government its parliamentary majority. The Forum's internal strife coincides with growing restlessness among the governing party's coalition partners and promises a rough parliamentary passage for emergency budget proposals considered yesterday by the government. Government officials are braced for a parliamentary rebellion against a plan to increase value added tax, cut public sector pay and lower the public sector deficit from 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992 to 5.6 per cent in 1994. The government's task looked more daunting this week when the finance ministry admitted economic recovery would not start in 1993 and there could be a fourth year of recession. The ministry said GDP would stagnate or fall by up to 3 per cent in 1993, abandoning predictions of 0.3 per cent growth. Consumer prices were forecast to be 20-22 per cent higher this year than last.</p>

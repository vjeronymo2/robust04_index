One beneficiary is the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, which will consider how to apply Jewish beliefs to the modern world. Mr Kalms would not specify the amount, but said: 'It is an open-ended commitment.' The donation follows his announcement last month that he had given money to the University of North London - formerly the Polytechnic of North London - to help fund a readership in business ethics and strategic management.

Last July he made a donation of Pounds 1m from Dixons to the London Business School for a chair in business ethics and social responsibility. There are already two other related academic posts in the UK: the DBM chair in corporate governance at Leeds University and the Co-Operative Bank chair of corporate responsibility at Manchester University. Mr Kalms originally offered the money to the economics department at the London School of Economics, which he said declined the offer, saying that such a subject properly belonged in the philosophy department. There has been some concern about the way in which the interviews for the chair at the London Business School have been conducted, with little advertising, no job description and long delays before unsuccessful candidates were notified.

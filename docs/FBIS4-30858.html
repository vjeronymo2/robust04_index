			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["km"-signed report: "Experts Believe the Presence of the </F> United States in Europe Is Necessary"]    [Text] Prague -- Experts from the Institute for  International Relations claim that the only security guarantee  for the Eastern European countries is the presence of the United  States in Europe and partnership. If, for any reason, the  influence of the United States abated, the entire Europe would  be, according to them, in a security vacuum, and only the  Western European Union led by Germany could assume the  initiative. Diplomats and military experts believe, however,  that this organization is not a sufficient counter force to the  military power of Russia.    Moreover, the German concept of European security might lead  to the transformation of the region of Central and Eastern  Europe to the sphere of economic, cultural, and eventually also  political influence of the FRG.    Nevertheless, the experts, who prepared the documentation  for  the government analysis of the security situation, expect that  the security of Europe will continue to be guaranteed, above  all, by the North Atlantic Alliance. The security system in  Europe will be, according to them, with the highest probability  connected with the U.S. concept of the European and world  security.    The analysis allows for only a marginal probability that the  world could again become bipolar. This could occur only if the  democratic development in Russia slowed down or turned around  and, at the same time, NATO could not be transformed. "The  security of Central European countries would thus become for the  North Atlantic Alliance, from the point of its own security  interest, irrelevant," the experts claim. The possibility that  the development in Europe could be significantly affected by the  power aspirations of Russia is, according to them, not likely.    Another of the not very likely alternatives mentioned in the  analysis could occur if the great powers -- the United States,  Germany, Great Britain, and Russia -- agreed on a system of  balance of power and interests on the European continent. Under  these circumstances, the small countries would be eliminated  from the decision-making process, and their future would depend  on the situation worldwide.</p>

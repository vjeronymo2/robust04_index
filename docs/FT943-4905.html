			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Saint Gobain chief indicted Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, head of the Saint Gobain glass group, was yesterday charged with 'influence trafficking' by a French magistrate investigating allegations that Pont-a-Mousson, a pipe-making subsidiary, paid a FFr4.4m (Pounds 530,000) commission in 1988 to a Nantes politician to get a water contract. After the announcement, Saint Gobain shares plummeted 4.2 per cent in the hour before Paris trading closed. The investigating magistrate, Mr Renaud van Ruymbeke, questioned Mr Beffa for five hours. Saint Gobain said: 'Considering that he had not got certain information from subsidiaries in 'the Nantes affair', Mr Ruymbeke thought it necessary to put the president of the group under investigation.' A company spokeswoman claimed that the magistrate had brought the accusation to force more information out of the company and that the charge of 'influence trafficking' was chosen only because a political party was involved. Mr Ruymbeke has been trying for a year to track the commission, which is said to have reached a Republican party councillor in Nantes via the Swiss bank account of a local industrialist. He has also been trying to establish whether any of the money ended up with Mr Gerard Longuet, the trade and industry minister, who presides over the Republican party and also over the region of Lorraine where Pont-a-Mousson has its headquarters.</p>

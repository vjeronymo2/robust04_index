			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski </F> by an ELTA correspondent in Warsaw; date not given: "A New  Stage in Relations"]    [Text] [ELTA]Mister Minister, the initialing of the  Lithuanian-Polish treaty is scheduled to take place on 18 March  in Warsaw. How do you assess this fact?    [Olechowski] It is very important that negotiations on the  bilateral treaty are over. It will be possible not only to  begin a new stage in Lithuanian-Polish relations but also to  remove the last formal obstacle hampering Poland's active  foreign policy toward its Eastern neighbors. Lithuania is the  only neighbor with whom we have no principal document signed. I  will remind everyone that Poland began to draft the treaty in  March 1992 -- exactly two years ago. However, the problem of  disbanding the self-governments in Vilnius and Salcininkay  regions, mostly populated by the Poles, arose then. We submitted  our draft treaty to Lithuania on 13 January 1993, while the  Lithuanians presented their version last June. It is then that  the true negotiations began.    [ELTA]Thus far, the contents of the treaty have  remained unknown. However, there are people both in Lithuania  and Poland who criticize this document. Some of them are  dissatisfied with the absence of General L. Zeligowski's name in  the treaty, while others -- with the fact that the treaty does  not protect the rights of the Polish minority in Lithuania.  What is your view?    [Olechowski] I have also heard different opinions. Speaking  about the mention of General L. Zeligowski's name in the treaty,  Poland has consistently opposed the assessment of historical  events. We believe that the complicated historical relations  between Lithuania and Poland must be a matter of research and  disputes of professional historians. The treaty is an  interstate document. It must serve as the basis for developing  our relations. These are two different issues that must not be  confused.    Protecting the rights of our ethnic minorities, we followed  this principle -- to seek the integration of the Polish minority  as Lithuanian citizens by preserving the cultural and linguistic  autonomy and respecting minority rights. I am convinced that  emotions over the secrecy of the text will subside after the  treaty is publicized, and the text will be analyzed calmly.    [ELTA]Lithuania is the last country among Poland's  neighbors with which the latter has no interstate agreement  signed. One Polish social figure has said that Lithuania is the  key to Poland's Eastern policy, while Ukraine is its foundation.  Do you share this opinion?    [Olechowski] Both states play an important role in Poland's  Eastern policy, because they, as Russia and Belarus, are our  neighbors. Poland is interested in their political stability  and in consistent changes that bring them closer to European  structures. We hope that Poland's cooperation with Lithuania and  Ukraine will develop further in the "Partnership for Peace"  program.    [ELTA]What are the key trends of your Eastern  policy?    [Olechowski] Seeking a successful execution of its foreign  policy, Poland must stress the key priorities. For well-known  reasons, these are primarily our relations with neighbors. Our  Eastern policy must focus on three principal directions: To  expand political and economic contacts with Russia and Ukraine,  as well as with Belarus, Moldova, and Kazakhstan; to seek  political and military stability in the region; and to upgrade  the application of possibilities for economic cooperation.    [ELTA]What will the first moves be after signing the  Lithuanian-Polish interstate treaty?    [Olechowski] First of all, we must make our economic  relations more intensive. To this aim, we would like to hold a  roundtable meeting soon and discuss economic issues. We expect  mutual benefit from this.    We will also seek to resolve specific problems between our  two countries. I would ascribe the registration of the Polish  Home Army Veterans' Club in Lithuania as one of the most  important issues. Moreover, we must clear up the problems  concerning the property of Polish prewar social organizations in  Vilnius.    [ELTA]Thank you for the interview.</p>

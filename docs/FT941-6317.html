			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Currency: the risk that can appear benign If Mr George Soros can get a currency exposure wrong to the tune of Dollars 600m, as he has admitted to have done on February 14, should the average portfolio manager be getting involved with the active management of foreign exchange positions? There is an odd contrast here between US and British pension funds. The Americans are increasingly drawn to the separate management of foreign exchange exposures - on some estimates a quarter of US pension funds are already using so-called currency overlays. British pension funds, in contrast, are inclined to leave investments in foreign currency securities unhedged, except in unusual circumstances. The feeling that dealing in securities counts as investment but trading in currencies is speculation is deeply ingrained. It is reinforced in the UK by the risk that currency gains unrelated to holdings of securities might be taxed as profits from trading. There is a theoretical reason, too, why currency exposure is different. Whereas investment in, say, bonds carries a particular level of expected return (and an investment in equities brings the reward of a rather higher return, because of the risk premium) the expected return from holding currencies is zero. A currency index fund will give no return over extended periods. Although some currencies have proved to be consistently strong and others consistently weak over the long term, these shifts have been offset by interest rate differentials. This does not mean, of course, that currency trading can never be profitable. That may happen when central banks are intervening, as happened in summer 1992. But although Soros made big gains then, he has found it much trickier in freely floating conditions and, in the recent politically volatile circumstances of the dollar and the yen. Over short periods, investment returns on securities have a substantial currency element, as much as 40 per cent of the annual returns in dollar terms. Therefore a hedging strategy will be attractive if it reduces volatility. US pension funds are sensitive to short-term volatility because their corporate sponsors are more directly subject to market-related valuations. There is also a particular problem with the dollar: a volatile currency which tends to move in a similar direction against most other currencies at any particular time, whereas sterling often tracks a more moderate course between the dollar and other European currencies such as the D-Mark. A further structural factor is that US plan sponsors are used to layers of specialist managers. Currency managers can easily be added on. In the UK, however, balanced managers remain dominant. Trustees are inclined to leave all decisions to them, including currencies. But the currency decisions are not usually very well handled. Most British fund managers have been very bullish of the dollar throughout the past year, for instance, to no avail. British managers are focused on equities, where the assumption has been that local market returns are inversely related to the strength of the currency: devaluation, for instance, boosts share prices. Hedging is therefore less important, especially from the perspective of a sterling investor, who is accustomed to regular currency gains in his portfolio returns. Things look different to a bond manager. Currency returns are more easily divorced from domestic bond returns and separate management of the currency and interest rate risks is more naturally embraced. True, the returns tend to be positively correlated: weak currencies encourage fears of inflation and undermine domestic bond prices. But this is not universally true: bond prices, for instance, soared in the devaluing European countries after September 1992 because the danger of soaring fiscal deficits was seen to be reduced. It is slightly strange that UK funds, which have an overseas exposure of some 30 per cent, are less worried about currency risks than US funds, with an exposure which may be about 6 per cent on average at present (albeit rising). But the currency impact on UK funds, most notably in late 1992, has been perceived as benign. It will probably take a shock, in terms of large, avoidable currency losses, to trigger UK pension fund trustees into action.</p>

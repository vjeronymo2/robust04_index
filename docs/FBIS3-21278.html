The  figures also indicate that the number of domestic and foreign  industrial firms in Morocco stands now at 6,100.    The figures indicated that the rate of growth exceeded 7  percent in the dehydrated and canned food industries and  amounted to 8 percent in the paper industry. It was 11 percent  in construction materials, 16 percent in tobacco and beverages,  and between 3 and 5 percent in the remaining conversion  industries.    An official at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry &amp;  Privatization in Rabat told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that approximately  351,000 workers are now employed as permanent workers in the  conversion industries, and 86,000 workers are employed in those  industries on a seasonal basis. The total number of workers,  which is 437,000, represents about a 3-percent increase over the  total number of employed workers last year.    The ministry official said that total investments in the  conversion industries rose by about 14 percent to DH9 billion.  He added that a worker's average rate of productivity stands now  at DH103,000. The industries with the highest returns are the  tobacco and beverage industries where average worker production  stood at DH980,000. In the pharmaceutical, food, and chemical  industries, average productivity in those industries stood at  DH339,000.    The ministry official said that production at the  government's industrial firms now amounts to about 27 percent of  total industrial production. He added that firms engaged in the  production of food, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals produce about  three-quarters of the total output produced by the government's  industrial firms.    The ministry official [also] said that the value of  industrial exports rose by 4 percent to about DH29 billion. That  is equal to about 63 percent of industrial imports. He said that  the most important export industries were the chemical and  pharmaceutical industries (24 percent of the total), the textile  industry (23 percent), and the food processing industry (19  percent).    The ministry official added that the number of exporting  firms stands at 1,600, a figure which represents about 28  percent of the total number of industrial firms. He said that  these firms contribute more than half the industrial production  and employ about 60 percent of industrial workers.    The number of firms in which foreign investors have a share  stands at about 1,000. These firms produce approximately  one-third of total industrial production.    Investment by foreign capital in the conversion industries  amounts to about 15 percent of total investment in those  industries. The value added to conversion industries stands at  about DH36 billion. That is about 15 percent of the total  domestic added value.</p>

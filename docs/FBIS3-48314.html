Japan's Parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Syozo Azuma and  Dilendra Prasad Badu, Nepal's assistant minister for housing and  physical planning, signed two separate agreements for the grants  in Kathmandu.    Modernization of the Tribhuvan International Airport, the  only international gateway to Nepal, includes installation of  radar equipment, improvement of air navigation and an air  traffic control system, the embassy said in a statement.    The bridge, to be built over Bagmati River at Thapathali, is  expected to greatly reduce traffic congestion between the two  densely populated cities, the statement said.</p>

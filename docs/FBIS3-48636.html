The former Transport Ministry official pointed out in an  interview that the airport is in closer proximity to other Asian  countries than Japan's busiest international airport at Narita  near Tokyo.    The airport has been built on a man-made island five  kilometers off the Senshu District of Osaka Prefecture.    Matsumoto, who assumed his post at the beginning of the  month, predicted the airport will be a boon for those coming  from local areas to make connections with international lines  since it will also serve domestic lines.    In contrast, the new Tokyo international airport, located  east of Tokyo in Chiba Prefecture, has very few domestic lines  so many passengers must commute the considerable distance  between it and Tokyo's domestic airport at Haneda.    Matsumoto, who has lengthy experience in promoting airplane  safety measures, said the Kansai airport will be a "faultless"  one when it comes to air safety.    Matsumoto, 49, said the only thing that concerns him is the  fact that side winds can reportedly be quite strong at times.</p>

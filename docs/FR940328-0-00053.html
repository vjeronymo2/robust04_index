Four cases of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0157:H7 were positively linked to undercooked hamburger patties served at the Reading Country Club.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0157:H7 was isolated by the Connecticut State Lab and the FSIS Beltsville Lab. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Ft. Bragg, CA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Mendocino County Health Department reported confirmed cases of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0157:H7 in a 13 year old girl and an 84 year old woman in Ft. Bragg. The two cases appeared unrelated except that both victims consumed home-cooked hamburgers which may have been made from ground beef purchased at the same supermarket during the same time period. FSIS isolated  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0157:H7 from ground beef returned to the market as well as a patty from the residence where the 13 year old girl had eaten. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Texas <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A total of 10 separate cases  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0157:H7 occurring over a 6-week period in the autumn of 1993 are being investigated by the Texas Health Department. These included three cases that resulted in hemolytic uremic syndrome and one death. No common source has been identified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Parameters of Good Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing available information, FSIS in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified the following parameters of safe handling by consumers: How to safely store raw product and thaw frozen product; how to avoid cross-contamination during preparation; how to cook for optimal safety and palatability; and, how to store leftovers after preparation. For institutions, hot holding of prepared food is an additional parameter. (The term institutions as used throughout this preamble includes hotels, restaurants, or similar institutions.) In addition, the Agency proposed that the safe handling instructions include a rationale statement specifying the reason why it is important to follow such instructions. The Agency believes that consumers will pay more attention to the safe handling instructions if they understand that mishandling will lead to the growth of bacteria and possibly to illness. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

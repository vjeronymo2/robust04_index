			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In his government work report to the second  session of the eighth provincial people's congress, Governor Bai  Qingcai indicated: The province's capital industry and  infrastructure were augmented in 1993. Investment in fixed  assets was 21.5 billion yuan, up 50.9 percent from the previous  year, of which investment in state-owned capital construction  was 10.1 billion yuan, up 55.4 percent, which was mainly put  into capital industry and infrastructure. Investment in raw  materials industry increased by 74.6 percent, investment in  agriculture increased by 9.6 percent, investment in energy  resources increased by 49.8 percent, investment in  communications, transportation, post and telecommunications  increased by 97.3 percent. [passage omitted]    In his report, Governor Bai Qingcai said: In 1994 it is  imperative to grasp building capital industry and infrastructure  with unremitting efforts to augment the staying power for  development. The planned social investment in fixed assets is  to be 27.5 billion yuan, up by 14 percent. [passage omitted]    The most conspicuous problem in building key projects  remains  the shortage of funds. It is imperative to try our best to  collect construction funds through many channels. In collecting  construction funds, it is necessary to make all sorts of funds  available to localities to found the Shaanxi fund for developing  capital industry and infrastructure. At the same time, it is  necessary to face society and other provinces and encourage  everyone to make joint investment to conduct infrastructure  construction. It is especially necessary to utilize the  share-holding system to collect funds, and to actively import  foreign funds. On the one hand, foreign businessmen should be  guided to directly invest in infrastructure and the building of  capital industry; on the other hand, some stock ownership of  some capital industry could be transferred to foreign  businessmen, with the funds thus obtained put into capital  construction. In this way, we can keep the funds rolling,  accelerate the pace in building key projects, and augment our  strength.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (8): A new look emerges on the Piraeus waterfront - There is something of a revival in shipping SOMETHING OF a 'new look' has emerged on the Piraeus waterfront in the year since the conservative New Democracy party came to power. It started with a decision by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, to take on the shipping portfolio himself, a move seen by the community as long overdue recognition for its contribution to the economy, as major employers and earners of foreign exchange. Day-to-day running of the Merchant Marine Ministry was left to Mr Aristotle Pavlides, who eventually took over as minister six months later. By that time, the prime minister's promise to address the shipping industry's problems with 'imagination and daring' had resulted in new measures intended to boost the competitiveness of Greek flag vessels in the international market. Tonnage tax on vessels of 80,000 gross tons was slashed by 75 per cent, while ships from 40,000 to 80,000 gt were granted a 50 per cent reduction. An extension of the tax breaks to smaller vessels is now under consideration by the ministry. The crew reductions removed up to five members from the complements required on Greek flag vessels. To counter the outcry from seafarers' unions, Mr Pavlides made it clear that this was mainly a paper exercise to normalise a situation in which companies applied individually to use reduced 'experimental' crews. The government has also acted on shipowners' long- standing complaints about the dismal state of telecommunications in Piraeus. Efforts by the Greek PTT to upgrade the system include a pilot project giving the port priority. By June an extra 17,000 lines should become available, together with other improvements. Maritime education, another nagging problem in the eyes of owners, is also being tackled. Some training schools that were expensive to maintain and not fully used have been closed. Now the British sandwich-course training system is being adopted and the ministry is consulting owners on further reforms to be implemented in the 1991-92 academic year. Though the government's moves were favourably received by the shipping community, the number of vessels attracted to the national flag has remained relatively small. This is largely because of factors over which the government has little control. Just as the tax and crew cuts were announced, a wave of strikes paralysed banks, communications and power supplies for a three-week period. The walk-outs underlined all too clearly the kind of problems that owners had been pointing out for years. Piraeus shipping offices were forced to relocate staff abroad temporarily, to keep in contact with their vessels. In addition, a weak freight market and an uncertain outlook worldwide following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were more than enough to induce hesitation about changing office location or flag. Nonetheless, figures have improved. At the end of 1990, the Greek flag fleet stood at 2,031 vessels totalling 22.53m gross tons, compared with 2,003 vessels of 21m gt at the end of December 1989. Foreign exchange earnings from shipping soared by 29.3 per cent over the same period to Dollars 1.79bn, the highest total since a 1981 peak of Dollars 1.82bn. The trend continued in January this year with earnings increasing by 21.1 per cent to Dollars 139m, against Dollars 111.5m in the same month last year. The fleet's accident record also improved, with incidents involving Greek ships falling in 1990 to 54 from 58 the previous year. However, 51 lives were lost compared with only nine in 1989, principally because of two disasters. Mr Pavlides stresses the need to rebuild a climate of trust between owners, seafarers and the government. Unquestionably, the government's efforts have made a difference. But Greek owners will continue to be market-oriented on the whole. Unless it makes sound business sense, they will not opt for the home flag or a Piraeus office. Still, one indication of a revised perception of the situation in Greece came with the announcement by the London-based Papachristides Ship Management Services that it would transfer its ship management operation to Piraeus this spring. The shipowners' associations continue to emphasise their stated aim of attracting new shipping and financial activities to Piraeus. But Greek owners, individualists to the last, always look at the bottom line where their own business is concerned. One of the major issues, especially for smaller owners, is fleet replacement. By the end of 1990 Piraeus banks were offering new types of facilities to clients such as standby lines of credit for future vessel purchases. As ship values dropped in the second half of the year, Greek owners, with their traditional knack for spotting a good buy, began to inspect vessels with a view to purchasing. The Gulf war put a temporary brake on plans, but since late February, owners have come strongly into the second-hand market again, showing interest in a wide range of vessels. At the same time, two Piraeus-based companies have revealed new building orders for products carriers. One, Eletson Corporation, is already the largest dedicated products shipping company in the world. The other, Forum Maritime, is only now preparing to enter the wet trades. Both new building contracts are for modern, highly sophisticated tonnage in line with standards required for trading with the US. They are an indication of the moves being made in the Greek shipping industry to slough off an unflattering image of operating an elderly fleet, kept under tight family control.</p>

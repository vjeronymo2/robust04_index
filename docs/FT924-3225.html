			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / TSB to shed 400 more junior managers TSB yesterday disclosed that it expects nearly to double the number of staff redundancies caused by the merger of its banking and insurance operations by making 400 junior branch managers redundant in the new year. The bank, which announced last month that it was making 440 staff redundant, said the merger of operations into TSB Retail Banking and Insurance with the downgrading of 200 branches had left it with surplus junior managers. The disclosure is the latest in a series of job cuts in banks, many resulting from the restructuring of branch networks. Barclays expects to have reduced its staff by 18,000 between 1991 and 1995. TSB yesterday briefed the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union on the job cuts. Bifu is already balloting its members at the bank on a series of one-day strikes in protest at the job cuts that were announced earlier. The bank said the managers affected were staff who worked as assistants to branch managers. Some would be affected by the downgrading of branches because such branches would be left with only a single manager. It said it would try to avoid compulsory redundancies among junior managers but could not guarantee that all would be voluntary. It expected that most of the redundancies would be agreed by early next year. The earlier tranche of redundancies included 80 senior managers and 150 managers from the branch network. A further 120 computer staff and 90 clerical staff from within the retail and insurance operations are to lose their jobs. Bifu said yesterday before meeting TSB that it was worried that there could be further redundancies in the branch network. The union criticised the first job cuts as 'totally indefensible' and damaging to customer service. TSB employs a total of 25,000 staff. It is implementing a series of changes in the structure of branches intended to make its sales operation through the network more effective. In the past, insurance sales operated separately. The union has also come into conflict with the bank over its plans for an experimental 24-hour telephone service supporting its branch network. The service is being tested in Tyneside as part of a branch restructuring pilot scheme.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHIA MUSLIMS BATTLE 3RD DAY; 13 DIE, 39 HURT;  </P> <P> HIGH IRANIAN OFFICIAL TO TRY TO BRING PEACE  </P> <P> Rival Shia Muslim factions fought with grenades in Beirut and rockets in  southern Lebanon's shattered apple orchards Monday, the third day of their  latest battle in a sporadic war that began nine months ago.  </P> <P> Police said eight people were killed and 25 wounded in the Shia slums of  southern Beirut, and five were slain and 14 wounded in fighting near Israel's  "security zone" along the border.  </P> <P> Muslim-controlled Voice of the Nation radio said Iran is sending Deputy Foreign  Minister Mohammed Javad Larijani to negotiate peace between Amal, a Shia  militia backed by Syria, and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which has tried to  expand its Beirut power base into southern Lebanon. The report gave no details.  </P> <P> Twenty people have been killed and 47 wounded since the fighting began  Saturday, a police spokesman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cease-Fire Short-Lived  </P> <P> Syrian peacekeeping troops called a "total and comprehensive" cease-fire at  midday, but it collapsed four hours later.  </P> <P> A Syrian officer said Hezbollah was responsible for violating the truce.  </P> <P> Bulldozers demolished sandbag barricades and earth mounds set up by both sides  along a stretch of the Beirut slums along the highway to the international  airport.  </P> <P> Hezbollah fighters in black headbands hurled grenades in a charge backed by  mortar fire and overran a police station in Beirut's Ghobeiri district, the  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Amal militiamen responded with heavy fire from tanks stationed in nearby woods  as a dozen policemen sprinted to safety under heavy rain, the spokesman added.  </P> <P> The explosions lit the night sky above the suburbs, home to about 500,000  impoverished Shias.  </P> <P> "Several fires are raging in the suburbs. Columns of smoke rising above the  area can be seen from my house," said one resident of a section of Christian  East Beirut that overlooks the area.  </P> <P> Ambulances and rescue teams could not reach the scene of the fighting, and  there were no immediate casualty reports.  </P> <P> The police spokesman said the two sides were locked in house-to-house fighting  in Ghobeiri and the neighboring district of Haret Hreik.  </P> <P> Amal, a mainstream militia, and the fundamentalist Hezbollah (Party of God) are  struggling for dominance of Lebanon's 1 million Shias, the largest sect in the  country.  </P> <P> Each accuses the other of starting the latest battle, their most intense since  November, when 40 people were killed and 87 were wounded during six days of  fighting in Beirut.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Living in Basements  </P> <P> Police said thousands of residents had been living in basements and bomb  shelters since New Year's Eve.  </P> <P> Several Beirut radio stations said Syria plans to review its deployment of  4,500 soldiers in the slums to "improve their performance and prevent further  fighting."  </P> <P> Syria is Lebanon's main power broker and has about 40,000 soldiers in the  country, including at least 7,500 in the Muslim sectors of Beirut. It first  sent troops into the 16 square miles of southern Beirut slums in May, after a  three-week battle between Amal and Hezbollah in which 300 people were killed  and 1,000 wounded.  </P> <P> In southern Lebanon, the current fighting is the most serious between Amal and  Hezbollah since four days in April, when 62 were killed and 150 wounded.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in  Ukrainian at 1955 GMT on 18 January carries the program  ``Nonnuclear Ukraine'' providing scientific and ecological  justification for the signing of the tripartite  U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement by President Kravchuk. The  program is attended by Ukrainian Academy of Sciences chairman  Borys Paton, unidentified deputy chairman of the same academy,  Viktor Zelenskyy, manager of the Academy of Sciences Institute  of Physics, Nur Nigmatullin, first deputy chairman of the  Nuclear Committee, Mykola Steinberg, chairman of the State  Committee for Nuclear and Radiation Security, and Leonid Kapkan,  head of the department at the Institute of Physical-Organic  Chemistry.    Borys Paton opens the program saying that the signing of the  treaty in Moscow by President Leonid Kravchuk is ``an event with  a historic meaning long-awaited by mankind.'' He points out  that the legislature should promptly ratify the agreement,  because otherwise, Ukraine will face ``political and economic  hardships.'' Paton underlines that the issue of security  guarantees for Ukraine has been finally resolved, following a  long period of ``evading'' this problem by both the United  States and Russia. Paton believes that readiness to grant  Ukraine security guarantees facilitated the signing of the  agreement. He emphasizes that Ukraine has been a merely nominal  owner of, and has not exercised control over, the nuclear  missiles deployed on its territory due to lack of necessary  facilities and qualified personnel. In Paton's opinion, Ukraine  has scientists, engineers, and military experts capable of  dismantling the missiles in Ukraine. However, he points out  that this would take a very long time and entail huge financial  resources. Thus, the agreement, providing for involvement of  international funds for the elimination of Ukrainian nuclear  arms, will enable the elimination of the latter ``with an  advantage for Ukraine.'' Paton concludes by saying that the  Academy of Sciences staff positively assesses the signing of the  agreement by the Ukrainian president and believes that the  Supreme Council will ratify it.    Viktor Zelenskyy enumerates the facilities and equipment  necessary for launching nuclear missiles which are not available  in Ukraine. These include tracking stations and tracking  satellites. Neither does Ukraine have the software and computers  capable of correcting missiles' flight paths. Thus, ``Ukraine  has had a gun but has not known how to pull the trigger or where  the bullet will fly.''    Adding to the discussion, Nur Nigmatullin says that it is  ``practically impossible'' for Ukraine to create its own  infrastructure for maintaining and servicing the missiles, and  signing the agreement on eliminating the latter was the only  sound resolution.    Speaking of Ukraine's chances to build its own nuclear arms,  an unidentified speaker points out that Ukraine is a state with  highly developed industries. However, to produce nuclear arms  it would have to train qualified personnel, conduct scientific  research in the field of splitting the isotopes of uranium-235,  and build reactors for producing plutonium and tritium.  Ukraine's scientific potential permits this. A nuclear warhead  is a very hi-tech product, and Ukraine having no experience in  this field, would have to establish a design bureau and a  research institute in the Republic and furnish them with  equipment. Finally, the process would involve creating entire  new industries. However, Ukraine's lack of test-ranges would  still be the main factor precluding the building of nuclear  weapons in Ukraine.    Commenting on ecological aspects of nuclear arms stationing  in Ukraine, Viktor Zelenskyy points out that the liquid  propellant in Ukrainian nuclear missiles is ``enough to cover  half of Ukraine with a 500-meter layer of a highly poisonous  substance.'' Half of the Ukrainian population would die  ``provided there is no wind or rain.'' Zelenskyy believes that  President Kravchuk undoubtedly took the ecological aspect into  account when signing the Moscow agreement.    Adding to the discussion, Leonid Kapkan says that the  maximum  admissible concentration of the liquid propellant ``heptyl'' in  the atmosphere is 1/10,000 grams per cubic meter, while  ``hundreds of tonnes'' of the substance are stored in Ukraine.  He points out that the Institute of Physical-Organic Chemistry,  aware of the fact that Ukraine is a ``powerful'' spacecraft  producer has developed a technology permitting the processing of  heptyl into a harmless salt and, if needed, back into heptyl  with losses not exceeding 15 percent of the substance.  According to Leonid Kapkan, the technology developed by the  Donbass Institute of Agroindustrial Technologies brought about a  50 percent increase in crops of wheat and barley in test-fields.    Answering the moderator's question on what will happen if  the  legislature refuses to ratify the Moscow agreement, Mykola  Steinberg, chairman of the State Committee for Nuclear and  Radiation Security, says that maintaining and servicing nuclear  arms is as complicated as producing them. The processes under  way regarding warheads will make them worthless in the future.  On the other hand, the expiration of the missiles' warranty  time period will make them dangerous and extremely expensive to  dismantle.    According to Nur Nigmatullin, nuclear devices of  Ukrainian-based warheads will be processed into fuel sufficient  for six to seven years of the 10 Ukrainian reactors' operation.  Nigmatullin points out that Ukraine will not receive this kind  of fuel free; the costs will be some 30 percent lower than the  current ones. Given the dramatic situation in supplies of power  resources, including nuclear fuel, Ukraine will be able to save  ``the badly needed billions of rubles.'' As a ``future user''  of this fuel, Nigmatullin appeals to the legislature to ratify  the agreement, and assist nuclear power engineering in Ukraine  that covers 35 percent of the demand for electric power in the  Republic.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Aleman Aleman] </F>   [Text] Upon learning that the Zapatist National Liberation  Army [EZLN] ratified the Civic Action National Coordinating  Board for National Liberation (CONAC-LN) as its legal adviser,  leaders of this group denied being the "political arm" of the  rebels or belonging to the EZLN.    Ricardo Barco and Benito Miron Lince said: "It should be  clear that we listen to the opinion of civilian society. We are  not seeking to make CONAC grow as an organization. Our  representatives have made it very clear that the EZLN is one  part of the organization and civilian society is another."    As for the possibility that the coordinating board will  harbor other organizations, they pointed out: "Our goal is not  to make CONAC grow, but we are not opposed to other  organizations either. We are not aiming to become a political  organization. We want to listen to civilian society, and those  who understand this are welcome."    Barco and Miron insisted: "We are definitely not the  political arm of the EZLN, because it is clear that the power  that we were given is the power of juridical or legal  representation to appear before international forums,  authorities, and organizations -- a representation that has a  legitimate nature granted by the armed group.    "It must also be clear that as members of CONAC's legal  commission, we are not EZLN members. We are accepting work as  agents in the terms agreed upon with the EZLN. Our capacity as  legal representatives will last as long as our client  [otorgante] deems it advisable. There are authorities, however,  who are demanding representation before a notary public, but  that is not possible. There must be no confusion between our  mandate and possible sympathies for the EZLN struggle," they  pointed out.    Born in the wake of the armed incidents of 1 January 1994  and  established on 10 February, CONAC-LN was ratified yesterday as  the EZLN legal representative through a letter addressed to the  general public and signed by Subcommander Marcos.    The EZLN approved the CONAC-LN's legal commission as the  legal representative for the Zapatists. Their first work  consisted of a juridical study of proposals made by Commissioner  Camacho Solis. Another assignment is the installation of  civilian society tables in various states, such as the one  installed in Mexico City on 14 March.    Finally, those who are responsible for the CONAC-LN legal  commission stated: "One of the EZLN aims is to demonstrate the  willingness of the Zapatist movement -- the will to achieve a  dignified peace."</p>

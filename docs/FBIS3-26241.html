			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yang Chin-hui; from the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] In the talks between Chiao Jen-ho and Tang Shubei  yesterday [2 February], they failed to reach a consensuses not  only on the ideas of judicial jurisdiction but also on the  agreement concerning protecting Taiwan investors' rights and  interests on the mainland. Economic issues will also be  formally put into today's agenda, the first time for both sides  to talk about economic issues. The following is a report by Yang  Chin-hui.    [Begin recording] [Yang Chin-hui] Just as they failed to  reach a consensus on the ideas of judicial jurisdiction, the  Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] still stick to their  own ideas about issues concerning protecting Taiwan investors'  rights and interests on the mainland, another focal point of the  Chiao-Tang talks. At the second round of the Chiao-Tang talks,  ARATS Executive Vice Chairman Tang Shubei brought up economic  issues for discussion. Commenting on the SEF's demand to sign  an agreement on protecting Taiwan investors' rights and  interests on the mainland, Tang said in a strong tone: If  Taiwan hopes that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will sign a  nongovernmental agreement on protecting Taiwan investors' rights  and interests on the mainland, Taiwan should open a two-way  channel for cross-strait economic and trade exchanges on a  mutually beneficial and reciprocal basis. Otherwise, I would  like to ask the SEF what Taiwan has done for Taiwan businessmen  while the mainland has drawn up a law to protect Taiwan  compatriots' investments on the mainland.    [Tang Shubei] As for Taiwan compatriots' rights and  interests on the mainland, just as I mentioned earlier, today,  when we see such flourishing development in the cross-strait  economic exchanges, if two organizations [words indistinct;  responsible for?] issues of cross-strait economic exchanges, we  should be ashamed of ourselves for failing to live up to the  expectations of people from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.    [Yang] SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho pointed out  disapprovingly: The title and motives of the mainland's law on  protecting Taiwan compatriots' investments on the mainland are  ambiguous, its contents are impractical, and the wording is  unacceptable. The government feels uncomfortable letting Taiwan  businessmen invest in the mainland under conditions prescribed  by this law.    [Chiao Jen-ho] Do you think our government is able to tell  our businessmen to feel free to invest in the mainland under the  law on protecting Taiwan compatriots' mainland investments  passed by the so-and-so republic? I do not think their motives  for giving this law such a title are clear and its contents are  not practical. I do not think such wording as "other provinces"  is acceptable to us, either.    [Yang] Chiao Jen-ho said how the mainland legislates laws is  their own internal business. Our government still holds that we  should protect Taiwan businessmen by signing agreements with the  mainland.    This is special correspondent Yang Chin-hui reporting from  Peking.

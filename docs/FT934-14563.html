			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation data helps to lift US stocks Wall Street GOOD inflation and earnings news, declining bond yields, and more positive fall-out from Wednesday's big merger deal helped US stock markets post solid gains yesterday, lifting most indices to record highs in the process, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.44 at 3,621.63. All the other main indices ended at record highs. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 5.34 to 466.83, the Amex composite 5.80 to 481.65, and the Nasdaq composite 6.44 to 785.41. Trading volume on the NYSE was exceptionally heavy at 353m shares. Release of the September producers prices index had been eagerly awaited by investors, and when it came out yesterday they were not disappointed. The PPI rose only 0.2 per cent last month, and the 'core' index (minus the volatile food and energy components) was actually flat in September. The figures sparked a strong rally in bond prices, lowering the yield on the 30-year issue to a new all-time low of 5.851 per cent. The good inflation news and the fall in bond yields set the stage for early rises in stock prices, although it was not until a round of computerised buying programs hit the markets mid-morning that prices began to put up substantial gains. Other positive factors, including strong earnings from Chrysler and a host of banks, and continued buying linked to the recently announced merger between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc, were also behind the buying, which pushed the broader and secondary indices to new peaks. Chrysler led the markets higher with a gain of Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 51 3/4 after reporting third quarter earnings of Dollars 1.13 a share, almost double the 62 cents a share earned at the same stage last year. The news lifted other car stocks, with General Motors advancing Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 44 3/4 and Ford adding Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 57 1/2 , all in heavy trading. Bell Atlantic continued to reach new highs, rising another Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 67 5/8 as analysts welcomed its planned merger with TCI. The latter, traded on the Nasdaq market, rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32 7/8 , and partially-owned Liberty Media, which will also be bought by Bell, rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 31 1/2 . Time Warner rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 , Cablevision added Dollars 2 at Dollars 65 5/8 , and Comcast climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 5/8 . Canada TORONTO stocks rose sharply in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index gained 33.17 points, or 0.81 per cent, to 4,144.96, with advancing issues outnumbering declines 400 to 358. Volume fell to 61.01m from 61.40m shares yesterday.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Rexrodt seeking investment Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, yesterday appealed to western German and foreign companies to invest more in the chemical sector in eastern Germany, which he said had the potential to become a base for research and development, writes Judy Dempsey from Bitterfeld, Saxony-Anhalt. But he warned that investments in the sector must be coupled with greater wage restraint. Productivity in the chemicals industry in eastern Germany is about 65 per cent below western German levels, leading to losses of over DM1.2bn a year.</p>

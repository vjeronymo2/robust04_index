			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Korea Telecom [KT] yesterday announced it will  spend 320 billion won, or an estimated 6.1 percent of its  revenues this year, on research and development. The state-run  telephone company also announced the establishment of Korea  Telecom Research Laboratories, which comprises the six existing  research arms of the company.    "The reshuffle of our research efforts was necessary because  most research projects call for close coordination between our  research centers," said Yi Yong-kyong, who became the first  president of KT Research Labs.    A spokesman said Korea Telecom will funnel 320 billion won  and 684 researchers into 69 R&amp;D projects this year. The  research fields will include automatic translation, intelligent  network and integrated digital service network (ISDN)  technologies. For each project, KT Research Labs will form a  research team by recruiting related specialists from the  existing research centers.    "We hope this process, which is already adopted by advanced  foreign research institutions, will greatly enhance our  technological competitiveness in the world market," Yi said.    The nation's largest telephone company has steadily  increased  its R&amp;D budget, from 198 billion won in 1992 to 277 billion  won,  or 4.2 percent of its annual sales, last year. The company will  expand its R&amp;D budget up to more than 8 percent of its annual  revenues by the year 2000, a spokesman said.    Most of the nation's research funds in the  telecommunications  sector come from the three major operators--Korea Telecom, Korea  Mobile Telecom and Dacom.    In 1993, the three companies invested a combined 300 billion  won in research and technological development. Their combined  R&amp;D investment will increase to 400 billion won this year,  or an  estimated 6.5 percent of this yearly revenues [as published].</p>

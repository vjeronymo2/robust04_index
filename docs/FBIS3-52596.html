			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali today  received in his office the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd. They discussed relations between the two friendly  countries and ways to bolster them in all fields. They also  exchanged views on recent developments in the peace process.  Dr. al-Majali explained Jordan's firm stand and commitment to  both the bilateral and multilateral levels of the peace process  -- a commitment based on the resolutions of international  legitimacy until just, comprehensive, and lasting peace is  achieved in the region. He also praised the United Kingdom's  efforts in this regard.    For his part, Hurd praised His Majesty King Husayn's efforts  to achieve peace, stressing the importance of the role played by  Jordan in its capacity as a factor of security and stability in  the region.    The meeting was attended by Talal al-Hasan, minister of  state  for foreign affairs; the Jordanian ambassador in London; the  British ambassador in Amman; and the delegation accompanying the  guest secretary.    Moreover, the Jordanian and British sides today held talks  at  the Ministry of Water and Irrigation dealing with the water  situation in Jordan. The Jordanian side was attended by Dr.  Hisham al-Khatib, minister of water and irrigation, while the  British side was headed by Douglas Hurd, the British foreign  secretary.    Dr. al-Khatib said the talks focused on Jordan's water  situation and the talks on water issues which Jordan held within  the peace process, whether on the bilateral or multilateral  levels. He added that talks also covered relations between the  two friendly countries in all fields, especially British  technical aid to Jordan in order to exploit the waters of Qa'  Disah in southern Jordan and to transfer these waters for use in  northern Jordan.    The minister noted that EC countries, especially Britain,  are  aware that Jordan is suffering an acute shortage of water due to  natural factors and because it is not receiving its fair share  of the waters from the al-Yarmuk and Jordan Rivers. This was  confirmed by all international studies in this field.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: General Electric climbs 10% in quarter GENERAL Electric of the US yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in first-quarter profits to Dollars 1.16bn after tax, helped by strong earnings advances in most divisions other than aircraft engines and technical products and services. The improvement translated into earnings per share of Dollars 1.36, up by 11 per cent on Dollars 1.23 reported for the first-quarter of 1992. If the discontinued aerospace operations are excluded from the comparisons, after-tax profits from continuing businesses would have risen by 13 per cent, to Dollars 1.08bn. First-quarter revenues from the continuing interests increased by 3 per cent, to Dollars 12.9bn, year-on-year. Mr Jack Welch, GE's chairman, said that the earnings growth was 'broad-based as double-digit increases were reported by GE Capital Services, transportation systems, motors, NBC, power systems, appliances and plastics'. The lower profits in the aircraft engines division, which produces Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, 'reflected an increase in product development costs and restructuring costs necessary to meet market conditions', he said.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Global warming The world's first treaty on combating the threat of global warming - one of two conventions agreed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit - becomes international law today. Last Wednesday in Geneva, 80 countries also reached broad consensus on setting up the Global Environment Facility, a Dollars 2bn fund to help developing countries pursue this goal. These agreements represent some of the past decade's most ambitious attempts to tackle global 'green' concerns. However, neither the treaty nor the fund come close to a solution. The global warming hypothesis is that increasing amounts of 'greenhouse gases' in the atmosphere - particularly carbon dioxide - will cause the planet to warm. Scientists say that it may take decades to establish or reject this theory conclusively. Nor will it be clear for years whether, if warming is occurring, its effects are damaging or beneficial. Rio set out to find ways of curbing growth in emissions of these gases, in case the hypothesis proves correct. However the treaty, in the much-amended version which finally received agreement, requires signatories only to draw up plans for curbing emissions, not to make actual cuts. The GEF is also unlikely to do more than scratch the surface of its task, given the small size of its budget and the dozens of countries petitioning for a share. In practice, devising a workable agreement on curbing emissions is likely to be impossible. First, policing such agreements is hard since emissions are difficult to monitor. Second, countries will be tempted to renege, particularly if they are convinced that they will benefit from other countries' continued observation of the rules. The greatest obstacle, however, is securing agreement on the distribution of cuts in emissions between different countries, given that any deep cuts are more than likely to slow economic growth. Developed countries see the rapid projected growth in emissions in China and India - and in Russia, should its economy revive - as the greatest threat to atmospheric stability. However developing countries may reasonably respond that the present atmospheric concentration of these gases comes from industrialised countries, which will continue to supply the bulk of emissions for years. A more fruitful route may be to pursue the co-ordinated removal of subsidies to fossil fuels, particularly coal, which would also encourage energy efficiency. Countries should also redirect their time and money towards considering how to mitigate the effects of climate change if it occurs. That could mean changing agricultural patterns, or even building dams around low-lying regions in case sea levels rise. Governments showed at Rio that they wanted to take precautionary steps while global warming remains a potential but unproven hazard. These two approaches  -eliminating subsidies and mitigating the effects of climate change - should provide the way ahead.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Tandy plans to spin off manufacturing operations TANDY, one of the largest US consumer electronics retailers and manufacturers, is to split into two independent companies by spinning off its manufacturing operations. The new manufacturing unit, to be called TE Electronics, will produce personal computers, audio equipment, office furniture and other consumer products. It will be publicly traded. Tandy, meanwhile, will continue operating its chain of 7,000 Radio Shack consumer electronics stores as well as expanding its Computer City and Incredible Universe superstores. The company said about 100 of its 413 McDuff's and VideoConcepts specialty stores in the US that are unprofitable would be closed. 'The proposed separation of retail businesses from our manufacturing business will permit Tandy to focus on retailing and its new retail concepts and broaden its product line,' said Mr John Roach, Tandy chief executive. For the year ended June 30, Tandy recorded earnings of Dollars 184m on revenues of Dollars 4.68bn. The previous year, the company earned Dollars 195m on Dollars 4.56bn in revenue. TE Electronics will include all 25 of Tandy's manufacturing operations world wide. In fiscal 1992, the combined sales of these units as a separate company would have been about Dollars 1.5bn. TE Electronics expects to take a pre-tax charge of about Dollars 20m related to the spin-off. The sales of Tandy's retailing operations during calendar year 1992 were approximately Dollars 3.8bn, the company said. Tandy's US retail sales for the month of December were Dollars 604.6m, a 7 per cent increase over the same month last year. Tandy will take a Dollars 47.5m charge for restructuring its retail operations, including the closure of 100 unprofitable specialty stores. Mr Roach said most of Tandy's 6,300 employees would not be affected by the restructuring. Tandy stockholders will receive shares of TE in the form of a tax-free dividend, pending approval by the company's board of directors and the Internal Revenue Service. Tandy said yesterday it had agreed to resolve all outstanding litigation between itself and Texas Instruments.</p>

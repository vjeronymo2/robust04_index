			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDUCING THE RISKS WHEN EATING FISH  </P> <P> What's a seafood lover to do these days? While the politicians and pressure  groups continue to debate turf battles over mandatory seafood inspection, the  guy on the street is stuck wondering whether his favorite fish dish is safe to  eat.  </P> <P> Nobody, not even the diehards who are screaming for safer seafood, advises  eliminating this healthful food from a diet. But everyone from the U.S. Food  and Drug Administration to consumer advocacy groups agree that you can reduce  the risk of illness or death. The following advice is compiled from Public  Voice for Food and Health Policy, the Center for Science in the Public Interest  and FDA.  </P> <P>  -- Eat a variety of different kinds of fish and shellfish. Do not concentrate  on only a few species.  </P> <P>  -- Select young or small fish because they have had less time to accumulate  contaminants in their flesh.  </P> <P>  -- Trim away the skin and any dark flesh before cooking. The highest chemical  contaminants concentrate in these areas.  </P> <P>  -- Don't eat the mustard in blue crabs or the tomalley in lobsters; PCBs and  cadmium concentrate in these areas.  </P> <P>  -- Shellfish taken from contaminated waters can causes viruses, the bulk of  seafood-associated diseases. Avoid raw shellfish if you have chronic liver or  kidney problems, diabetes or any disease that impairs the immune system, such  as AIDS or AIDS-related complex.  </P> <P>  -- Forget the trendy undercooked fish that is popular in many restaurants.  Fish should be heated to 140 degrees in the center.  </P> <P>  -- When cooking clams, mussels and oysters, allow them to sit in hot water for  five minutes after the shells have opened.  </P> <P>  -- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, avoid bluefish, striped bass,  swordfish, shark or any freshwater fish. The bluefish and bass often accumulate  high levels of PCBs. Swordfish and shark often contain methyl mercury.  </P> <P>  -- Limit tuna consumption, fresh and canned, to 8 ounces a week because of  methyl mercury contamination.  </P> <P>  -- Avoid the larger reef fish: grouper, snapper, barracuda and Spanish  mackerel are the chief candidates for ciguatoxin. Because the toxin is heat  stable, cooking does not make the fish safe to eat.  </P> <P>  -- Scombroid poisoning can result in certain fish that aren't stored properly  and form histamines. The three fish typically associated with these complaints  include tuna, mahi-mahi and bluefish. The heat-stable toxin often gives the  fish a peppery taste.  </P> <P>  -- When buying or ordering fish, make sure to ask where it was caught. If it  is caught near shore or industrial pollutants, you may want to reconsider.  </P></p>

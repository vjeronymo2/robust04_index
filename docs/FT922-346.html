			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Management: Oil and troubled waters - The departure of Robert Horton raises questions about whether the cultural revolution he sparked at BP will be sustained. Christopher Lorenz argues that the changes are here to stay In a smart hotel in rural England, some two dozen besuited senior BP managers take their places around a conference table almost as long as a cricket pitch. They glance nervously around, or chat tensely to neighbours whom they scarcely know - the company has had precious few such get-togethers in previous years, and a surprising number of senior managers hardly ever meet each other. For the next 24 hours, in an intense atmosphere which veers between scepticism and enthusiasm depending on the speaker, they debate their incoming chairman's radical proposals for changing how the company operates and for transforming the way that people - including themselves - behave within it. Over the ensuing 18 months a series of such meetings takes place, sometimes over several days. Each time the atmosphere becomes less formal, more positive and much more cohesive. The suits give way to casual dress. People get to know and trust each other, and express their real opinions more openly. The quotient of jokes rises, as do incidents of the chairman being teased, or making cracks against himself about his supposed infallibility, or his 'running for Pope'. Managers trade stories of how the reform campaign is being turned eagerly into action by employees at various levels in their own parts of the company. Then, as BP's financial performance turns from satisfactory to dull, and finally dire, a stripped-down version with just the dozen top managers, lasting less than a day, is held in a head office room with no windows. The heads of several of the company's constituent businesses agree that rampant fear about job security throughout BP now risks interfering with further progress of the reform campaign. The mood is sober and decidedly worried. But the communal drive for further reform is still evident. This was how, over a two-year period between December 1989 and last Christmas, the atmosphere shifted as Robert Horton's top lieutenants at British Petroleum got together repeatedly with him to discuss the progress of his ambitious corporate 'culture change programme', and to agree successive next steps. There have been two further such meetings since then. Last Thursday Horton resigned, ousted by his non-executive directors with at least the tacit compliance of his senior executives. The immediate causes of his departure were his dividend policy and his forceful, if not abrasive, management style. The latter went down so well in his previous job - streamlining BP America in the late 1980s - that it helped catapult him into the chairmanship of the group. But in the last few months it caused growing unease in the City of London, as well as among BP's non-executive directors. But there have also been suggestions that an internal backlash against his culture change programme could have played a part in his downfall. In its early stages, the programme was rather American-style. Did some of his senior British managers, having prospered in BP's traditional 'command-and-control' culture, tolerate the changes at first but finally find them too hard to stomach? If so, does this suggest that dramatic changes in culture may be less feasible in a British environment than they are in the US? The core objectives of Horton's programme were, to use consultancy jargon, both 'hard' and 'soft'. The 'hard' side was the replacement of BP's traditionally hierarchical, committee-ridden structure with a flatter, 'delayered' organisation. Hence the successive rounds of staffing cuts since March 1990 at BP's various head offices: corporate, regional, and divisional. With the added impetus of the recession, these are still continuing - with a vengeance. To make this flatter structure work effectively - as well as to cut costs, speed decision-making, and improve management morale - Horton also determined to re-engineer the 'soft' side of BP. To do this, he set out to demolish its old culture of bureaucracy, stuffiness, lack of delegation, rampant mistrust, and constant second-guessing - both by bosses of their subordinates and of each other. In its place would be bred a culture of 'openness, care, teamwork, empowerment and trust'. Many of the culture change workshops which were run in the year after Horton's assumption of the chairmanship in March 1990 helped managers understand what was meant in practical terms by this, and by 'essential new behaviours' such as 'networking' - sharing information informally. By March 1991, what had begun as Horton's culture change programme had become 'owned' (to use jargon again) by almost all his top managers - a group by then shorn through retirement of several of the older and more recalcitrant barons. What had been 'his' had become theirs. Rather than espousing all sorts of reformist behaviour in which they did not really believe, some of the top managers who had prospered most in the old 'command and control' regime had really embraced it. The most important was David Simon, who had been Horton's rival for the chairmanship. Simon had been expected to be a conservative brake on the culture change process, but in both words and action he emphasised repeatedly his commitment to the values which underpin it. He did so again on Friday, after he had taken over as chief executive. Back in 1990, a memorable early internal expression of his support and commitment was a statement that people might expect him to be the rock on which the culture change would founder, but he would actually be one of the rocks on which it was built. This was an oblique reference to Simon Peter, one of Jesus' best-known followers; the word Peter means 'rock'. In February 1991, Simon also put his strong support on public record, at a conference on the management of change. 'I stand four-square with Bob Horton on triggering this change throughout BP,' he said. 'We senior managers at BP want a nimble, new culture for our company. New cultures - new behaviours and new motivations - are taking over the business world fast these days.' Another surprising convert was Russell Seal, head of BP Oil, the largest employer in the BP group. Seal always used to be seen by insiders as a classic commander-controller, yet he has made a radical change in the way he manages people. He has also supported an intensive culture change and development programme for the managers and other employees beneath him. It has already had all sorts of pay-offs, in terms of greater staff involvement, productivity and performance. One example is of an American refinery where much greater employee involvement in decision-making has improved its operating reliability from barely 80 to almost 100 per cent, with the result that it was impressively profitable last year after a decade of almost constant losses. With hard men such as Simon and Seal having become true converts to the new culture - even if they dislike some of its attendant jargon - it is hard to sustain the argument that part of Horton's undoing was his application of a rather American-style change programme to a company which, despite its considerable US presence, is still heavily British. Nor, even if it were true, should one apply such a conclusion to other British companies. In slightly different ways during the 1980s, the cultures of both British Airways and ICL were transformed out of all recognition by programmes somewhat similar to BP's. Both these companies had the immeasurable advantage over BP of launching their programmes at a time of considerable external crisis brought on by intense competition; crisis is one of the most powerful factors in successful corporate culture change. In pushing through the change programme which he (rightly) felt was vital to BP's long-term survival, Horton would have had an easier task if the company had been facing the sort of strategic crisis which it now confronts. Instead, he had to play up the importance of an - albeit woeful - lack of morale in BP's managerial ranks. With help from an adept set of consultants - including several Americans - the corporate programme and its sister efforts within BP's various businesses have had a surprisingly quick impact. But, as at BA and ICL, they will have to run for several more years if they are to anchor the new behaviours fully in the company's collective subconscious. After showing initial impatience, Horton was fully aware of this - as is Simon. So it is not Horton's culture change process which proved too American for BP and its board to swallow. Rather, it was his own management style. Abrasive leaders with an all-powerful air may be admired in America, but in most parts of Europe they still tend to be distrusted. Perfect evidence of this culture gap was contained in the now infamous interview which Horton gave to Forbes, an American business magazine, and which was published in February just as the full magnitude of BP's financial problems began to be outwardly apparent. It has been quoted widely for Horton's extraordinary comment that he sometimes had to wait impatiently for subordinates to deal with some of BP's problems. 'Because I am blessed by my good brain,' he said, 'I tend to get to the right answer rather quicker and more often than most people' - by clear inference, his colleagues. Whereas most British readers gasped at this statement, the Forbes interviewer praised him for showing 'precisely the mix of self-confidence and personal discipline' required to run an organisation as sprawling and complex as BP. In some respects, there is indeed a yawning gulf in transatlantic management attitudes.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Flotation expects to raise ADollars 245m BORAL, the Australian building materials group, yesterday announced that it expects to raise ADollars 245m (USDollars 163m) from the flotation of its non-core manufacturing interests, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. These interests range from the production of yarn and rope to tools and hardware. Brand names include Gerrard springs, Kinnears ropes, and Trojan hardware. The company plans to float 122.5m shares in Azon - the name of the holding company for the diverse range of business - at ADollars 2 apiece. Boral will then receive a further ADollars 55m through the repayment of inter-company loans and a dividend from Azon - bringing the total benefit from the flotation to about ADollars 300m. News of the Azon flotation comes less than a week after Boral won control of Sagasco, the Adelaide-based gas business.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: IBM fails to see any sign of market improvement INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, which earlier this month reported a 50 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, said yesterday that it had not yet seen any sign of an improvement in the market outlook. The downbeat assessment of global business conditions by the world's largest computer manufacturer follows expressions of doubt about the strength of the expected US economic recovery from companies in several large US sectors over the past few weeks. Mr John Akers, IBM chairman, told the company's annual meeting that the war in the Gulf and economic problems worldwide had made the business environment increasingly difficult - not just in North America but in Europe and Asia as well. During the quarter many customers had deferred buying decisions and product installations. This had been felt fairly uniformly across IBM's product line and around the world but particularly in the US and in its large systems. 'How long this cautious approach by our customers will last is hard to tell,' Mr Akers said. 'Our operating rates will only improve when our customers' confidence about their business improves. 'We have seen no evidence yet to indicate any improvement in the near term, and consequently the year remains uncertain.' For the first quarter IBM reported net earnings of Dollars 500m, down from the Dollars 1bn earned in the same period of last year, on revenues down 4.5 per cent at Dollars 13.5bn. The figures disappointed Wall Street, despite IBM's earlier warning of a sharp drop. Analysts were particularly surprised at the depth of the fall in its hardware sales and some questioned whether this was entirely due to general economic conditions. Yesterday Mr Akers said the future of the computing industry remained bright for those who managed their business well and IBM must prepare to take best advantage of the eventual economic improvement. IBM shares fell Dollars 2 1/2 in on the New York Stock Exchange to stand at Dollars 107 3/8 at lunchtime.</p>

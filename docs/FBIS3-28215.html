During his new year inspection tour here, Kim  asked Inchon officials to try to bolster the role of Inchon as  the gateway to the capital area taking advantage of its location  and such facilities as an international airport being built and  a modern harbor.    The president said that though some people demand  re-discussion of the Uruguay Round agreement, it is impossible  to have new Uruguay Round [UR] talks now that the talks have  already been completed with 117 countries of the world.    After his visit to the Inchon City Hall, President Kim  dropped into the Daewoo Motor Co. in northern Inchon, where he  took lunch together with 1,200 Daewoo workers at a company  cafeteria.    During his call at the Kyonggi Province administration in  Suwon, President Kim told Governor Yun Se-tal to be especially  careful about protecting the sources of the 20 million capital  zone people's household water.    Kim especially suggested that marking poles be placed at all  waste water displacement ducts so that nearby villagers could  know the state of waste water disposition by plants.    From Suwon, President Kim drove to a high-tech pilot farming  estate at Chongbuk-myon, Pyongtaek-kun.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Equity Issues: Buyers show early interest in first Taiwanese sell-off offering the first opportunity for foreign investors to invest direct in a Taiwanese company, rather than through a mutual fund - gets into full swing this week, with early indications that much of the stock on offer internationally has already found buyers. The privatisation of China Steel has been keenly awaited internationally all year, and there seems little sign at this stage that the transaction will disappoint its supporters. In all, 18m depository receipts, each representing 20 shares, have been put on offer to foreign investors, of which 10.5m receipts have been offered outside the US. According to one adviser close to the transaction, this non-US portion has already been fully subscribed, with the roadshow to promote the flotation only just getting into gear in Europe. The US promotion is due next week. In all, just over 1bn shares are on offer, 680m of them domestically. At a current market price of around TDollars 24 each, the privatisation is set to raise almost USDollars 1bn. The flow of transactions from Asia looks set to continue in the weeks ahead: Grasim, an Indian cement and fibre producer, is queueing up to follow in the wake of Reliance Industries, which is on the brink of pioneering a move by Indian companies to attract international equity capital, while Kia Steel is set to join the growing stream of Korean companies with a Dollars 40m convertible offering. Not that all the news from Asia has been positive in recent days: political uncertainty in Thailand led to the suspension last week of the first international share sale from that country, a Dollars 40m offer of global depository receipts from Shinawatra, a computer company. The rating on the long-term debt of Ontario and Ontario Hydro, two of the international bond market's most active borrowers, was cut by US rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's yesterday in reaction to its budget announcement last week. The ratings of both entities - which between them borrowed about CDollars 10bn last year - was lowered from AA+ to AA.</p>

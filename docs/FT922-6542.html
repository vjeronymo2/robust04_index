			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Rightwing upsurge feared in Berlin poll GERMAN politicians are braced this weekend for further evidence of a rising extreme right-wing protest vote in local government elections in Berlin, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. In the first city-wide elections since 1946, more than 2.5m voters from East and West Berlin will elect tomorrow 23 district councils, and opinion polls suggest that the far-right Republicans could win more than 10 per cent of the vote. Leaders of all the big parties have been campaigning in Berlin, in an extraordinary demonstration of the importance they attach to the outcome. They fear a combination of an acute housing shortage, rising rents and prices, unemployment in the former east Germany, and an influx of foreigners, could encourage support for the far right.</p>

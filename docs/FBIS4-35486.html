			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 31, IRNA -- President Akbar Hashemi  Rafsanjani said here today that the government has planned to  create a balance between the supply and demand process in the  foreign exchange market.    Speaking to a group of students from the Amir Kabir  Technical  University, he said that all importers should obtain their  foreign exchange from the banking network, and hoped that  private sector would cooperate with the government on the new  plan.    On the elimination of the subsidies, the president said the  government tackled half of the problems regarding the subsidies  in the First Five Year Plan, and that the issue would be totally  settled during the Second Five Year Plan (to begin in 1995).    He said that the wages will rise parallel to the prices  increase, and that the government will not eliminate the  subsidies without increasing the wages.    On Iran's foreign debts, the president said the government  could arrange installments on about 10 billion dollars of the  foreign debts, i.e., paying back an annual three billion dollars  up to the year 2000. "The debts will be paid back with an  interest of less than five percent," he added.    Refuting the rumours on the disposal of the southern Kish  Island to Germany in return for the debts, the president said  there is nothing in the island to be disposed. "Fortunately  Iran's debts to Germany have been rescheduled, and Germany owes  Iran more than Iran does. [no ending quote as received]    The president explained that Germany demands nearly 7  billion  marks from Iran over the Bushehr Power Plant, while, it should  pay compensations up to 7 billion to 8 billion dollars to Iran  for leaving the project incomplete.    The case has been presented to the court, "and if the court  is fair, it will vote in favour of Iran, and if Germany  completes the project, 2,400 megawatt of electricity will be  generated into the nationwide power network which is very  valuable for the country."    On relations with the Saudi Arabia, he said there are some  problems regarding the relations with Saudi Arabia including the  hajj ceremonies.    At the same time, he said, Saudi Arabia makes troubles for  its neighbours, namely Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar  and Yemen. "Saudi pressures on the Iraqi people, its relations  with the U.S. and some problems regarding the oil market are  among other issues."    "We will not step back from our principles for the  settlement of these problems" he stressed.    Asked about the satellite dishes, he said the satellite  dishes do not contradict export of the cultural revolution.  However, the president said the majlis (parliament) is working  on a plan on banning the use of satellite dishes.</p>

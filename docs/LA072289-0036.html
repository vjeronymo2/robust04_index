			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: IF BILLY JOE IS SO GOOD, WHAT WERE THE CHARGERS WAITING FOR?  </P> <P> Dan Henning was kidding, I think, when he walked into a conference room packed  with writers and sportscasters and said: "This is more guys than we'll have in  camp."  </P> <P> Indeed, the football season, in its own way, is about to begin. Training camp  opens today for Charger rookies and free agents and a handful of veterans.  </P> <P> However, it was Thursday as Henning was talking, and a total of 21 players were  still unsigned. In fact, none of the nine draft choices had yet signed.  </P> <P> Henning, about to begin his first year as the Chargers' head coach, thus could  be excused for wondering exactly what players he would be coaching.  </P> <P> Would this team with a ghost of a chance in the AFC West begin training with a  ghost of a team?  </P> <P> It became obvious, once Henning had worked his way through the litany of camp  procedures, that one position and one person concerned him most.  </P> <P> As you might have guessed, the position is quarterback. Anyone who has watched  the Chargers since Dan Fouts retired could come to that conclusion.  </P> <P> And this year's cast of characters at quarterback includes (a) the AFC's  lowest-ranked passer the past two years, (b) a promising youngster coming off a  devastating knee injury, (c) a veteran who will answer no one's prayers and (d)  an untried rookie drafted near the bottom of the second round.  </P> <P> It was hard to imagine that any of these people would have dominated Henning's  pre-training camp observations.  </P> <P> But Billy Joe Tolliver, who comes under the heading of untried rookie, was the  man of that hour.  </P> <P> Billy Joe Tolliver?  </P> <P> The impression I got from Henning is that there is no more pressing business  for Steve Ortmayer, the director of football operations, than getting Billy Joe  Tolliver under contract and into camp.  </P> <P> This is rather heady stuff when it is considered that Tolliver was not the  first player the Chargers took in the draft. Burt Grossman was. Tolliver was  not the second player the Chargers took in the draft. Courtney Hall was. And it  was not that both of them already were signed, because neither was.  </P> <P> It also was noteworthy that stars such as Gary Anderson and Lionel James were  unsigned, as were 10 other veterans.  </P> <P> Billy Joe Tolliver seems to be an obsession with the Chargers.  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> I can think of two possible reasons:  </P> <P> * He is a marvelously skilled quarterback who represents the future (and maybe  even the present) of the franchise.  </P> <P> * The coaches are mortified at the prospect of trying to win (or even be  respectable) with any of the other three.  </P> <P> The notion that this is a marvelously skilled "instant quarterback" is belied  by the fact that he was the 51st player selected in the draft. If he is that  good, there are 28 stupid teams in the National Football League. I include the  Chargers, because it would have been stupid to let anyone that good slip past  their first second-round selection.  </P> <P> It is a little more understandable that the Chargers would be, to say the  least, greatly concerned about being competitive with bottom-ranked Mark  Malone, rehabilitating Mark Vlasic or journeyman David Archer.  </P> <P> In contrast, almost anyone else looks prettier.  </P> <P> Is that Billy Joe Tolliver's charm? Is he pretty or just prettier? Is he an  answer just because everyone else is a question?  </P> <P> Regardless, Henning went on and on about the importance of Tolliver being at UC  San Diego today. It was almost as if he was portraying Tolliver as a son who  had gotten in with a bad crowd, the "bad influence" in this case being agent  Vic Vines.  </P> <P> "I think Billy Joe will be making an error if he doesn't come in here on time,"  Henning said. "And his agent would be making a superior mistake if he doesn't  work things out."  </P> <P> The agent, of course, represents only one side of the negotiating process. And  Vines has been paying attention to all the rhetoric about just how wonderful  the Chargers think his client might be. Coincidentally, I am sure he has hiked  the price tag just a bit (maybe a big bit) in response.  </P> <P> The Chargers' problem, as I see it, is that they now must pay the price for  their own selling job.  </P> <P> Maybe they have been just a little bit overanxious and overzealous in their  assessment of Billy Joe. Maybe they should have introduced him as a  developmental project. Maybe they should have yawned and said the kid QB from  Texas Tech would do a good job carrying the clipboard for a couple of years.  </P> <P> But maybe, just maybe, they were (and are) panicked over the quarterback  situation. They don't need someone to carry a clipboard. They desperately need  someone who can carry the team, or at least move it.  </P></p>

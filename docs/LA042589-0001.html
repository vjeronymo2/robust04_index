			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: QUAYLE SAYS 2ND LADY HAS 1ST JOB  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle told a Chicago audience that the principal job of his  wife, Marilyn, is to take care of him. Last week, in an interview with The  Times, Mrs. Quayle, 39, who is a lawyer, had suggested that she was considering  returning to work or becoming involved in some sort of cause. "I haven't ruled  it out," she told The Times. "I think we are moving to a place where the  question shouldn't ever cross anyone's mind, 'Why should the Second Lady work?'  I think I've been given talents I should use." But when asked at the annual  meeting of the Associated Press whether his wife might soon espouse some new  cause or interest, Quayle seemed to throw cold water on the idea. "She has a  very major cause, and a very major interest that is a very complex and  consuming issue with her," the vice president replied with a smile. "And that's  me." The Quayles have three children aged 14, 12 and 10. Mrs. Quayle practiced  law in Huntington, Ind., until 1976, when her husband was elected to Congress.  </P> <P>  -- After 100 years as an all-male bastion, members of the Players Club in New  York City decided they wanted some female companionship. So, on its 100th  anniversary, the club founded by celebrated Shakespearean actor Edwin Booth  inducted 30 women, including actress Helen Hayes. Previously, women had been  permitted into the club only on April 23, William Shakespeare's birthday. The  1,000-member club for actors, performers and writers also gave Hayes the first  Edwin Booth Award for her lifetime achievement in theater. Also inducted were  Eudora Welty, Lauren Bacall, Carol Burnett, Mary Tyler Moore, Agnes de Mille,  Colleen Dewhurst, Lillian Gish, Angela Lansbury, Toni Morrison, Dina Merrill  and Kitty Carlisle Hart.  </P> <P>  -- Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste drew upon his sense of humor during a  "portrait" competition at a ceremony opening a new pressroom. Kirk Walters of  the Toledo Blade, whose drawings of Celeste as a modern-day King Louis XIV of  France -- with over-the-shoulder curls and spectacles -- won first place in the  competition judged by reporters in Columbus. "If you have a good chin, you  might as well use it," said Celeste, who has a jutting chin. Walters said  Celeste has a profile "that is easy to draw . . . a half-moon face." The news  conference room is in a new state office building, across the street from the  Statehouse. Celeste moved his office to the new building weeks ago. SHIRLEY  MARLOW  </P></p>

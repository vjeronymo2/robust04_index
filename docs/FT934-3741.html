			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / London allowances for civil servants to be ended The government is to abolish the London weighting allowances of up to Pounds 1,776 a year paid to civil servants working in the capital. The Treasury proposes to replace allowances with a payment of up to Pounds 3,000 a year targeted at groups of staff which are hard to attract. It will be payable in any part of the country where the civil service has problems in recruiting and retaining staff. The move comes at a time when many employers have frozen the allowances they pay to London staff. Allowances paid by banks and other large businesses reached Pounds 3,000 or more a year during the 1980s when many companies experienced difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff in the capital. Civil servants currently receiving the allowance will retain their pay levels so long as they continue to work in core government departments. However, recruits and staff moving to London, will not receive the weighting. The 24 agencies and departments which take over pay bargaining for their own staffs next April will be free to make individual arrangements. The surprise proposal has been put to the civil service unions by the Treasury. Officials have made it clear that while there is scope for negotiation over the details, ministers are determined to proceed in principle. The new recruitment and retention allowance, due to be introduced on July 1 next year, would sweep away London weighting currently paid at three rates: Pounds 1,776 in central London, Pounds 1,015 for offices between five and ten miles from the centre and Pounds 736 for 10 to 18 miles. It would also absorb other special allowances paid to staff in London and regional offices with recruitment and retention problems. Currently, a local addition of up to Pounds 1,000 a year is paid to some 65,000 civil servants  -more than 40,000 of them in London. A report published last year by the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, said targeted allowances were a more economical means of addressing local staffing problems. The allowance would be paid at the discretion of departments and agencies to meet 'vocational, discipline-related or other pay-related recruitment and retention problems'. The payment would be up to a maximum of Pounds 3,000 per person a year. Departments and agencies would be free to decide whether the allowance was pensionable - present allowances and pay additions are pensionable. The allowance could be changed, reduced or withdrawn if recruitment or retention conditions changed. Thin on the ground, Page 13</p>

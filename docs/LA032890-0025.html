			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A City Council committee has recommended a $65 rate increase for the ambulance  company that provides paramedic service to the city but rejected a request for  a two-year extension of the city's contract with the company.  </P> <P> The rejection by the Public Services and Safety Committee of the extension  proposed by Hartson Medical Services raises the possibility of a paramedic  strike as early as next month.  </P> <P> Paramedic union leaders had sided with the ambulance company and favored the  extension so both sides can make final a recently negotiated three-year labor  contract. The city's agreement with Hartson expires June 30, 1991.  </P> <P> Hartson and the Service Employees International Union, Local 102, which  represents paramedics, wanted the two-year extension so it could coincide with  the scheduled end of the tentative labor contract settlement.  </P> <P> However, the committee said that its staff needs two months to study the  extension request. The City Council is expected to make a final decision next  week. Union leaders said paramedics will also vote on the contract next week  but may reject it unless the council approves the extension. If the pact is  rejected, paramedics could strike, union leaders said.  </P> <P> The $65 rate increase approved by the committee brings Hartson's average  ambulance charge up to $347 a trip. Company officials had asked for a $145  increase. The increase is necessary to pay a 21% pay increase negotiated by the  union for paramedics, Hartson officials said.  </P></p>

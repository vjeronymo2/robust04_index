Rexrodt said that, apart from the developments of  the Middle East peace process, his one-hour talk with Al-Shar'  in Bonn on Friday [18 March] focussed on the possibilities for  developing German-Syrian economic ties.    According to Rexrodt, Syrian exports to Germany totalled  1.12  billion German marks [DM] and were twice as high as German  exports to Syria (DM546 million). The reason for the high  Syrian trade balance surplus are Germany's oil imports from  Syria. In the first 11 months of 1993, Germany's exports to  Syria grew by 25 percent over the same period in the previous  year, while imports from Syria only increased by 6 percent.</p>

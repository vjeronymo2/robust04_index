			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TEAM SANTA BARBARA EVICTED;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: THE ISLANDERS OF THE CONTINENTAL BASKETBALL ASSN. WON GAMES, BUT  THEIR INVESTORS LOST $610,000, AND ONE CALLED THE FORMER CLUB PRESIDENT A  CROOK.  </P> <P> Shirley Otto and a few hundred other fans are sitting on wooden bleachers  before a Continental Basketball Assn. game between the hometown Islanders and  the Rapid City (S.D.) Thrillers. A dozen future Laker Girls -- dolled-up  10-year-olds wearing lipstick and leotards -- finish their pregame routine.  It's tipoff time, and Otto gets ready for the action to begin -- off the court.  </P> <P> "I don't see him," Otto says, scanning the gym from her courtside seat. An  Islander investor, she is awaiting the arrival of Craig A. Case, the embattled  former president of the team. "He usually comes late," she says sardonically.  "That way he won't run into any of us."  </P> <P> The Islanders score on a spinning inside move by Luther Burks, and the crowd  cheers. Otto is too preoccupied to notice. She zeroes in on the last few rows  of the bleachers, then frowns. "There he is," she says, indicating a heavy-set  man sliding into his seat. Otto, a widow in her 60s, shakes her head. "He does  have his nerve, I'll give him that."  </P> <P> Welcome to Islander basketball. In this, their first, and probably last,  season, the Islanders won the Western Division title with a 37-19 record,  making them the most successful expansion team in the CBA's 44-year history --  on the court. Off it, they lead the league in controversy and melodrama. "It's  the real 'Santa Barbara' soap opera," says Bob King, CBA vice president of  marketing.  </P> <P> How the world turned for the Islanders this season: Investor Howard Schneider  goes on talk radio and calls Case, one of the town's leading citizens, a crook;  the CBA commissioner, a man who could settle a key issue, is killed in a plane  crash, and the Islanders are kicked out of town, evicted for not paying bills  and forced to play their playoff games in Ventura.  </P> <P> "They're a poor motherless team," Otto says.  </P> <P> Normally astute businessmen say they disregarded caution for the chance to  become an owner of a sports team. All seven investors lost not only their  money, a total of $610,000, but their team as well -- the league took over the  Islanders Feb. 23, declaring them "abandoned" and refusing to pay the team's  creditors an estimated $500,000. Investors are alleging fraud by Case and  blaming the CBA for contributing to the franchise's problems with questionable  business practices. Lawsuits are planned.  </P> <P> Despite her losses -- Otto alleges that Case "flimflammed" her out of nearly  $250,000 -- she still feels deeply about the team. It was her vision that  helped give Santa Barbara its first professional basketball franchise. Then she  breathed life into the Islanders with money and nurtured them with emotion,  attending all 34 home games. The collapse of the franchise, she says, "breaks  my heart."  </P> <P> "None of us expected to make a fortune," Otto says. "We went in it for fun  because there's nothing to do in Santa Barbara."  </P> <P> Otto didn't want a basketball team in town so she could be merely a patron of  the athletic arts. She loves the game. "I was born and raised in Indiana," she  says. "It's in the genes." Her family even had season tickets to the old Ft.  Wayne Pistons, forebears of the Detroit Pistons.  </P> <P> In the mid-1960s, she and her husband moved to Santa Barbara. Several years  ago, Otto's satellite dish pulled in a CBA game from Chicago. She remembers  seeing a CBA commercial that basically said: "You, too, can own a pro  basketball team." She stored the information "in the back of my mind."  </P> <P> In 1987, Otto ran into Bill Bertka, longtime Laker assistant coach and a Santa  Barbara resident. She mentioned the CBA to him and her interest in bringing a  pro basketball team to town. Bertka, 62, knew Case casually. They often saw  each other at various charity functions and would sometimes discuss the  possibility of the CBA putting a team on the West Coast, Bertka says. A year  after his first conversation with Otto, Bertka brought her and Case together.  They met for lunch twice. Otto says that Case impressed her as a man who had  the requisite enthusiasm, drive and connections to go after a CBA franchise.  </P> <P> Case, a 42-year-old Santa Barbara native, owned the Case Detective Agency and a  real estate investment company, and he was active in the community -- he is a  past president of both the Athletic Round Table and the Las Positas Park  Foundation. Bertka calls him "a very prominent civic leader in the community."  Otto saw no need to check further.  </P> <P> But had she promptly looked into Case's background, she says, she would not  have invested. Santa Barbara County Superior Court records indicate that Case  has been a defendant in several lawsuits. Among them: In 1985, according to  court records, Santa Barbara Bank and Trust obtained a default judgment against  Case for $72,195. In addition, Case and his detective agency have been involved  in dozens of municipal and and small-claims court lawsuits.  </P> <P> Last spring, the CBA wanted to expand to the West Coast for the 1989-90 season.  To make travel and scheduling easier, the league was eager to have two teams in  California, both starting play in the same season. At a mid-May owners' meeting  in Iowa, the league granted conditional franchises to Case in Santa Barbara and  to State Assemblyman Dominic Cortese in San Jose. Each owner had to pay a  $500,000 franchise fee -- $125,000 down plus three equal installments spread  over three years -- and provide detailed financial statements plus a mandatory  letter of credit from a bank guaranteeing the $375,000 balance on the franchise  fee.  </P> <P> The two franchises were bonded together. According to the minutes of the May  meeting, "Both teams must qualify together or neither is approved because of  economic and divisional alignment reasons."  </P> <P> Cortese had his financial package ready in June. Case never did, contrary to  league rules and strict federal and state guidelines for selling shares in a  corporation. But the CBA approved both franchises on June 2, 1989.  </P> <P> "The league kind of took a chance on Santa Barbara," says Dave Cortese, the San  Jose owner's son who runs the Jammers. "They rushed into it. They never should  have hitched Santa Barbara's wagon to ours. San Jose was ready."  </P> <P> Santa Barbara wasn't, basically because Case had nothing but promises from  potential investors. When Case made a presentation to the CBA last May, Cortese  says, "Representations were made that apparently didn't pan out. But the league  thought the information they got was correct and reliable."  </P> <P> The league has been burned many times before by undercapitalized franchises.  About 150 teams have come and gone in CBA history. The league prides itself on  never having ceased operation -- it traces its lineage back to the 1940s and  the Eastern Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> But the CBA has come under fire for its handling of the Islander situation.  "They're a bunch of third-rate guys who wanted to be NBA owners and couldn't  cut it," says Schneider, who owns a Santa Barbara luxury automobile dealership.  When Schneider became an investor last January, he says he got no satisfaction  from the league. "They're an arrogant bunch of wise guys," he says. "When we  went to them (for help), they said drop dead. It wasn't their problem."  </P> <P> From the start, the Islander franchise was in trouble. Case, himself not an  investor, received a check from only one substantial investor until Schneider  got involved. Of the original $200,000 raised by Case last spring, $175,000  came from Shirley Otto. But Otto says that Case told her the money was only a  deposit to the league to obtain the franchise, that it would be refundable if  she chose to withdraw. Hugh Haferkamp of Santa Barbara, Case's attorney,  counters that Otto was "clearly and fully advised" of all her options.  </P> <P> Case refused to comment for this story, but a source close to him says he is "a  victim of circumstances."  </P> <P> "The franchise came about quickly, and Craig was always pressed for time," the  source said. "He decided to go forward on the basis of certain assurances (from  potential investors) that didn't materialize. It was a perfectly innocent  thing. I think the only thing you can really say is that Craig's bookkeeping  was not as good as it should have been."  </P> <P> Case did have investors drop out. He had been counting on Barry Berkus, a Santa  Barbara architect. But in June, a few days after the franchise was granted,  Berkus decided not to invest, citing what he calls "a difference in philosophy"  with Case. Mainly, Berkus says, Case refused to provide full-disclosure  information to Berkus and other potential investors. Berkus also disputed  profit-and-loss projections that Case was showing to potential investors. The  projections showed the Islanders making money their first season, a very  unrealistic assumption, Berkus and others say.  </P> <P> Although CBA players don't get rich playing basketball -- a team's entire  player budget for a season is only $90,000, which comes out to $500 a week per  player -- an owner still has "to expect to lose money his first season," Dave  Cortese says.  </P> <P> A team's expenses for a season, Cortese estimates, are between $700,000 and $1  million, and the Jammers "have definitely incurred some cash losses this  season."  </P> <P> Despite his lack of capital, Case forged ahead to prepare for the Nov. 14  season opener. A staff -- marketing, public relations and community relations  directors -- was assembled. Players were drafted. A coach, Sonny Allen,  formerly of Nevada Reno, was hired. But at CBA headquarters in Denver, the  league was getting very worried. By September, Case still hadn't provided the  league with any details about shareholders, including their names and the  percentage of shares they owned, nor had he posted the mandatory letter of  credit.  </P> <P> In a Sept. 22 letter to Haferkamp, acting commissioner Jerry Schemmel said it  was "absolutely mandatory at this point" for Case to come forth with financial  details. An Oct. 10 letter from Schemmel cited "additional problems . . . that  are quite serious" and said that Case "was currently in default with the CBA"  for not posting the letter of credit.  </P> <P> "It was very difficult dealing with them," Schemmel now says, referring to Case  and Haferkamp.  </P> <P> Case, through Haferkamp, continually stonewalled the CBA on the  letter-of-credit issue by contending that Jay Ramsdell had privately waived the  requirement. Ramsdell had been commissioner of the league. However, he could  neither confirm nor deny Case's claim because he had been killed July 19 in the  crash of United Flight 232 at Sioux City, Iowa.  </P> <P> "I was not aware of any agreement with Jay," Schemmel says. "I have a tough  time believing Craig on that one."  </P> <P> Corporate law experts say that incorporation is a routine, two-day procedure.  But the Islanders weren't incorporated by the California Secretary of State  until Sept. 19, 1989, meaning that the operation was not a legally recognized  entity for nearly four months, which investors were not told, Otto says.  </P> <P> Confusion also resulted because the CBA had awarded the franchise to  Professional Basketball in Santa Barbara, Inc. -- the name Case was calling the  entity. But the California Secretary of State lists the corporation as Santa  Barbara Islanders, Inc. "We originally gave the franchise to a corporation that  didn't legally exist," Schemmel says. Case reportedly still has banks accounts  under both corporate names.  </P> <P> On the court, the Islanders were playing Allen's fast-breaking offense and  leading the league in scoring with an average of 128 points. Not that Santa  Barbara noticed. Maybe it was the $15 ticket price -- highest in the league --  but there were believed to be only about 400 hard-core Islander fans, including  about 250 season ticket-holders. The CBA says the Islanders' regular-season  average attendance was 1,940 in the 2,500-seat Santa Barbara City College  Sports Pavilion, but a source claims that Case gave away a large number of  tickets for most games.  </P> <P> "We love our Islanders," says David Avrick, who has season tickets with his  wife. "What happened is just a shame. They were the most exciting team in the  league."  </P> <P> By the first of this year, while the Islanders were headed for the playoffs and  the record of most victories by an expansion team, the franchise was in  turmoil. Creditors, notably City College, were pressing Case for payment.  That's when he went to Schneider.  </P> <P> Schneider, 46, owns Gregg Motors, which he says has $100 million in annual  sales. He was an original Islander season ticket-holder, becoming one at the  request of his 14-year-old son, Gregg. Schneider knew Case from charities in  which they were both involved. Case approached him on Jan. 11. "He said he had  an emergency need for capital to pay the players," Schneider says.  </P> <P> Schneider immediately wrote a check for $12,500. "I usually do a lot of digging  before I put any money in anything, but I didn't do a diligent search,"  Schneider says. "I just acted impulsively because the team was involved."  </P> <P> Schneider kept "writing checks" to Case, four overall. He says he gave Case a  total of $42,500 and then "all of a sudden realized I was in for some serious  money."  </P> <P> The more Schneider got involved, the more he grasped the corporation's  peculiarities. There had never been stock certificates or meetings with  investors or corporate minutes. On Jan. 31, Schneider assembled all seven  investors along with Case, Haferkamp and a court reporter. At the end of the  seven-hour meeting at a law firm, the investors voted unanimously to remove  Case as president and put the team in Schneider's hands.  </P> <P> Schneider says he never would have become involved had he known about the  team's financial problems. But he says Case told the investors during January  that the franchise was only $50,000 in debt. Schneider also says that the CBA  never mentioned any problems with the franchise. In a mid-January conference  call with two CBA owners and new CBA Commissioner Irv Kaze, Schneider says, "I  asked them, 'Is everything OK?' and they said, 'Oh, yeah, all it needs is the  front office cleaned up.' "  </P> <P> Schneider says he also asked them, "How is Case's standing with you?" and they  replied, "We're current with him." But the CBA did have several problems with  the Islanders at that time -- for instance, it was trying to collect $90,000 in  travel fees and the illusive collateral from Case. The CBA office had also  withheld about $50,000 -- the club's share of NBA money -- from the Islanders.  </P> <P> "The CBA knew what was going on," Schneider says. "They're culpable for  allowing this monster to be created by prior management."  </P> <P> The league blames their misstatements to Schneider on the confusion in  transfering the stewardship of the CBA from Schemmel to Kaze, who took over as  commissioner Jan. 2. "I only went by what Case had told me -- I had met him in  January and he said things were excellent," says Kaze, a former executive with  the Raiders.  </P> <P> It didn't take Schneider long to figure out that the franchise he was now  running was anything but excellent. "The day after the (Jan. 31) meeting, we  were in Case's office and found huge stacks of unopened bills," Schneider says.  </P> <P> In going over the Islanders' books, Schneider says, he also found checks for  more than $100,000 made out to Case. A source close to Case claims that Case  had lent the money to the team and was simply paying himself back. But  Schneider says he asked for copies of checks Case allegedly made out to the  team, but Case never provided them.  </P> <P> Schneider appointed investor Bill Richling as general manager and they ran the  Islanders for three weeks, eight games in all. But more bills were arriving in  the mail. Despite "pumping up the team" with about $200,000 of his own money --  plus a few thousand more from Otto and other investors -- Schneider added up  the bills and was startled to discover that the franchise debts didn't total  $50,000 but more like $500,000. There was $40,000 owed to a bank, $25,000 to  the state and federal governments for payroll taxes, $12,000 to City College  for arena rental and dozens of other payables.  </P> <P> In mid-February, the CBA owners met at the Santa Barbara Inn, but nobody from  the Islanders was allowed to attend unless the league was paid the outstanding  $90,000 in travel fees. The CBA also didn't recognize Schneider as the new head  of the Islanders because he hadn't been approved by the league.  </P> <P> Unable to meet with the owners, Schneider phoned in a proposal that could have  resolved most of the franchise's problem. The investors would pay off the  outstanding bills and continue to run the team, he said over the phone, if the  CBA would waive the $375,000 franchise-fee balance. The league turned him down,  then countered with an offer that only gave Schneider's group an 8% discount on  the franchise fee.  </P> <P> "The owners took the position, 'Why should we help you pay your debts? Nobody's  helping us,' " Dave Cortese says. "The league was not responsible for the  Islanders' bills."  </P> <P> Schneider and the other investors promptly advised the CBA that they were  discontinuing their involvement with the Islanders. CBA attorney Alan  Rothenberg of Los Angeles then sent Case a certified letter dated Feb. 23,  saying the league was taking over the operation of the franchise for the rest  of the season.  </P> <P> "Multiple and material breaches of (the franchise) agreement, as well as  numerous violations of the CBA bylaws have previously been called to your  attention and have not been cured," the letter stated. "Termination of your  franchise is justified on many grounds."  </P> <P> The Islanders became orphans, then homeless when City College evicted them just  before the playoffs. Playing all six "home" playoff games at Ventura College,  they advanced to the best-of-seven semifinals before being eliminated by Rapid  City last Tuesday night, four games to two.  </P> <P> Schneider took some heat from fans for backing out of the Islanders, so he  explained his reasons on radio talk shows and in newspaper articles, using  strong words not usually heard in this quiet, genteel seaside community where,  according to punsters, citizens are either "newly wed or nearly dead."  </P> <P> All of a sudden, there was shock radio in Santa Barbara: "I found out the  people I was dealing with were a bunch of crooks," he said on the air and in  print. "Case lied to us and robbed all the investors. This is the most  mismanaged, mis-run, fraudulent, misrepresented thing I've ever seen in 28  years of business."  </P> <P> The source close to Case dismisses Schneider's claims. "The problem with  Schneider is ego. He said the owners don't know how to run the league. They've  been running it for 44 years; he'd been in it for 44 minutes and he was telling  them how to do business. They rebuffed him, and now he's blaming (Case) for  everything that went wrong."  </P> <P> The Islanders' front-office problems may have upset some people but had  virtually no effect on team morale. "The players always got paid, and they  don't care who the owners are," says Allen, the team's coach. The players, in  fact, don't have much more than a fuzzy concept of the corporate quagmire. "The  first owner messed up, and the others took over and then backed out and left us  hanging," says 6-foot-10 forward Brian Christensen.  </P> <P> The players also say they're ambivalent about the team's future. After all,  their goal is getting out of Santa Barbara and into the NBA (during the season,  four Islanders were called up, including Jawaan Oldham by the Lakers).  </P> <P> But Allen wants to stay. "I like living in Santa Barbara. That's one of the  reasons I took this job," he says. Allen, 54, was living in Las Vegas, coaching  the Silver Streaks to the World Basketball League title, when Case called last  fall.  </P> <P> Allen recently approached Berkus, who had originally decided against investing,  about bailing out the franchise, but Berkus says, "I haven't made up my mind."  The possibility also exists, sources say, that the CBA may simply disband the  Islanders and move a franchise from either Topeka, Kan., or Wichita Falls,  Tex., to Santa Barbara. So fans, of Santa Barbara -- the team, not the soap  opera -- might still wind up with pro basketball.  </P> <P> "Maybe we can get this resolved in a very happy way for a lot of people," Kaze  says.  </P> <P> Whatever happens, Case has told associates that he will not be involved. Stay  tuned.  </P></p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / EC pressed to back Pounds 3bn steel restructuring EUROPE'S steelmakers, hit by overcapacity, recession and cheap non-EC imports, are planning a radical restructuring which could cost more than Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.14bn) and lead to the loss of 50,000 jobs. The chairmen of the EC's 15 largest steel companies have asked the Commission and member states for aid to cover the redundancies. They also want 'guidelines' on market developments, and swift action against unfair competition from outside the Community. The move could raise fears among EC free-traders, like Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner, that the industry wants to return to the sheltered and heavily-subsidised steel regime of the 1980s. It could also add to trade tensions with the US, which is already looking to impose duties on EC steel products. Mr Dietrich von Husen, director general of Eurofer, the confederation of EC iron and steel producers, said yesterday there was a real danger that the efforts and successes of the last restructuring would be put in doubt. 'If we don't take urgent action, 1992 and 1993 will be catastrophic,' he said. Commission officials said they hoped to react positively to the steelmakers' proposals. The problem would be finding sufficient financial resources. Coal and steel treaty reserves amount to Ecu750m (Pounds 590m), of which Ecu500m is in principle available. The steel industry's plan would involve: Restructuring, including a redundancy programme which could cost at least Ecu2bn over the next three to four years. Eurofer indicated that related costs, such as incentives for plant closures and reduction of supply, could more than double that figure. State aids will be 'resisted', said the steelmakers, but if member states grant subsidies then capacity and production will be reduced in return. Market regulation. The Commission would draw up guidelines on production, consumption, exports and imports, to help the industry adapt to changing demand. Protection from increased imports, for example, by accelerating the procedure for examining dumping complaints against third countries. The industry is particularly concerned about low-price imports from east European countries and the former Soviet Union, which have increased by 70 per cent over the last year.</p>

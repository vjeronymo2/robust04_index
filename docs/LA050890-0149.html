			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> NEW EFFORT DUE ON MARINE LAND SWAP  </P> <P> Orange County is preparing to negotiate an end to a complex, longstanding land  dispute that has prevented the Marine Corps from building badly needed housing  in Tustin and the county from completing highway improvements near El Toro.  </P> <P> County officials will sit down by the end of the month with the Irvine Co. to  try to set a purchase price for 41 acres next to Tustin Marine Corps Air  Station, said Michael M. Ruane, director of the Orange County Environmental  Management Agency.  </P> <P> A resolution of the land impasse would mean that the county and the city of  Irvine could proceed with key road projects near El Toro Marine Corps Air  Station.  </P> <P> Among them are the extension of Alton Parkway through the El Toro base to the  foothill communities, building a Bake Parkway interchange on Interstate 5 and  the widening of the El Toro "Y" interchange, where Interstate 5 meets the San  Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> The Alton project, which would be first off the drawing board, would provide an  alternate route around heavily congested residential neighborhoods in El Toro  and Lake Forest, Ruane said.  </P> <P> Irvine Co. land near the Tustin base is the linchpin in a complicated land deal  involving the county and the Corps that was originally conceived during the  administration of President Richard M. Nixon, said Col. Jack Wagner, community  liaison officer for Marine air bases in Arizona and Southern California.  </P> <P> The county plans to turn over the newly acquired Irvine Co. property to the  Corps, which will use it to build housing for some of the 1,400 Marines who are  on housing waiting lists at both the Tustin and El Toro bases.  </P> <P> In exchange, the Corps will give the county, for use as parkland, 137 acres at  Mile Square Regional Park in Fountain Valley, a former military installation.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors formally agreed to buy the Irvine Co. property in  December, 1987, but the deal stalled while the county grappled with the  question of how to pay for the land, which has continued to rise in value. One  appraisal reportedly placed its worth as high as $1 million an acre.  </P> <P> For a time, officials searched for county-owned property to swap with the  Irvine Co. rather than pay cash, Ruane said. But the land the county wanted the  firm to accept in trade "really wasn't anything they wanted," Wagner said.  </P> <P> The Corps raised the ante last year, when county officials approached the  Marines about buying land and a right of way at the El Toro base for the road  projects.  </P> <P> "When they wanted to come to us to talk about Alton," Wagner said, "I simply  said, 'That sounds reasonable. . . . However, live up to your first agreement.  Why should we enter a new agreement with you if you haven't fulfilled your  first agreement?' "  </P> <P> Instead of proposing a land swap with the Irvine Co., the county has decided to  make a more conventional offer: cash.  </P> <P> The county also plans to buy about 65 acres of Marine Corps land at El Toro for  the road projects. According to an unclassified Marine document obtained by The  Times, "the sale would generate a minimum of $17 million" for the Corps.  </P> <P> The Corps would use that money to build housing on the former Irvine Co. land  near the Tustin base.

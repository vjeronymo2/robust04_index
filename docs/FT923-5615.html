			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Business expects fall in production A FURTHER fall in manufacturing output in the next four months is expected to prolong the recession - already the longest since the 1940s - into the second half of this year. Output expectations among manufacturers are at their weakest for more than a year as flat consumer demand has allowed stocks to build up. The latest industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry shows that order books have weakened significantly in the past three months. Sixty one per cent of manufacturers reported orders below normal when they were questioned earlier this month. The only encouraging element in an otherwise gloomy assessment of the economy was that expectations of price rises were at their lowest since October 1966, suggesting that inflation will continue to fall rapidly. The CBI's findings indicate that manufacturers had increased their stocks since the early summer in expectation of higher consumer demand that has not emerged. This is likely to hinder the growth of output in the second half of the year. Only 3 per cent of manufacturers reported that their current stocks of finished goods were less than adequate, while 25 per cent reported that they were more than adequate. The survey of 1,300 companies in 50 industries showed that although export orders improved slightly in early August, they were weaker than in May and June. The main points of the survey were: Output - 15 per cent of respondents expect output to increase in the next four months, against 27 per cent that expect it to fall. These were the weakest expectations since May last year. Orders - order books have weakened a little since July and only 9 per cent of companies reported them above normal. Exports - total order books have improved since July although only 14 per cent reported their export orders above normal against 47 per cent that reported them below. Prices - only 10 per cent of respondents expect to raise the prices of goods as they leave factories against 16 per cent that expect to cut them. These were the weakest price expectations since August 1966.</p>

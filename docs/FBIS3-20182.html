Kinkel's  lecture at the invitation of the "French Institute for  International Relations" (Ifri) and the "International Liaison  and Documentation Office" (BILD) had been on the program for  some time. However, at a time when it is important for the  parties involved to overcome irritations in Franco-German  relations, the German foreign minister's appearance in Paris is  particularly important. During his visit, Kinkel also met with  President Mitterrand.    The European unification process has opened a new road to  the  future for Germany, Kinkel said. The overwhelming majority in  the Bundestag and the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court  confirmed the general conviction in Germany: "We need more and  not less of Europe." France and Germany agree on the historic  finding that two neighboring states in the heart of Europe that  are so big can only exist together. "Therefore, Germany and  France have always placed unification of Europe before going it  alone and going special ways." Thus, the two states have become  "Europe's pacemaker." "This will and must continue!"    The new Europe is no longer the divided Europe of the Cold  War, but "the whole of Europe," Foreign Minister Kinkel  explained. Here the following "fateful questions" arise both  for France and Germany: How can we consolidate peace? How will  we ensure the prosperity of our peoples? How will we stand our  ground in a global framework? For Germany the answer is clear:  "We can only cope with this challenge in and with the European  Union [EU]." Kinkel is certain that France's answer is the  same. As the first issue in fact, the enlargement by Austria,  Sweden, Finland, and Norway is now at hand. "It would be foolish  to cling to questions of voting rights now." In 1985 one had  jointly made possible the entry of the south of Europe, now it  is the turn of the north, he said.    French-German cooperation has stood the test in joint  initiatives, such as the establishment of a European corps, the  resumption of the "Yugoslav" negotiations, and the GATT  negotiations. Now the two partners are faced with the further  development of the EU: the admission of new member states, the  reform of the European institutions, the relationship between  deepening and enlargement. "Germany and France must maintain  their role as a hinge in an EU that is continuing to grow. This  is our joint future task."    From 1 July onward, Germany and then France will chair the  EU. For these 12 months, the German foreign minister sees a  German-French "presidential program" with four focal points:    1. The implementation of the EU treaty, starting from  Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]. "Our joint objective is the  convergence of our economies." Not all member states can make  the step to the third stage of EMU at the same time. "Germany  and France have to defend the logic of the EU treaty against all  attempts at undermining it," Kinkel demanded.    2. An independent European security and defense policy as an  answer to the security policy challenges in Europe. Here the  future Europe also needs the security partnership with the  United States. "Franco-German cooperation is strengthening the  pillar of the bridge across the Atlantic." Kinkel paid tribute  to the French efforts for NATO's decision on Sarajevo. "I see  with satisfaction that the EU peace plan, which is based on a  Franco-German initiative, is now developing into an  international peace agreement, which, as I hope, will be solid  on a long-term basis. It is an example of the power of the  Franco-German agreement." Kinkel and French Foreign Minister  Juppe agree on the wish to commit the CSCE member states to  "joint action against those who disturb the peace." "The old  thinking in terms of zones of interest is no longer acceptable.  In the new Europe there can no longer be any room for so-called  vital spheres of interest and for the concept of `close foreign  countries.'"    3. The EU also has to strive for a more active Mediterranean  policy. The German and the French foreign ministers want to  "explore" the opportunities for joint initiatives.    4. With a joint EU policy toward the East, the reform states  in Central and East Europe are to be taken closer "step by step  to our community of stability." Since 1990, France and Germany  have been striving for a joint policy toward the East. Kinkel  mentioned the contacts with Poland as a positive example.  Kinkel proposes a "European development corps" for the Central  European reform states. The German foreign minister was more  reserved regarding Russia's wishes for help: "Russia's  integration within the world economy is only possible as Russia  enforces the market economy at home itself." "Together with  France," Germany wants to take the Baltic states increasingly  closer to the EU.    As in his initial comments on European polices that were  marked by German-French cooperation, Kinkel had tried before to  dispel concerns about a disturbance of relations in an interview  with the daily LE MONDE. The contacts between the two countries  are "so diverse, close, and natural" that even "different points  of view" cannot shake the "excellent bases of our relations,"  Kinkel said. Referring to Bonn's sensitiveness over preparation  for the commemoration of the Allies' landing in Normandy, the  foreign minister said: "I do not doubt that (after the meetings  between de Gaulle and Adenauer in Reims and Mitterrand and Kohl  in Verdun) French and Germans will also succeed in adequately  commemorating the end of World War II and Germany's return to  the community of democratic states."</p>

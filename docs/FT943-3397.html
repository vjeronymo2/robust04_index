			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: United Friendly ahead sharply to Pounds 13.6m A turnround in the general insurance business underpinned a sharp rise at United Friendly, where pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 13.6m for the first six months of the year. Premium income increased to Pounds 170m (Pounds 166m), while earnings per share advanced to 11.8p (7p). The interim dividend is raised to 6.1p (5.5p). Mr George Mack, assistant managing director and finance director, said the general insurance business, which at the last interims showed a loss of Pounds 7m, had benefited from changes to the underwriting and a general improvement in the trading environment. However, life assurance profits fell from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 2.7m, largely as a result of losses incurred by Acuma, which United purchased from American Express last year. Mr Mack said the court action being pursued against the US group over the purchase price of Acuma was now likely to be settled out of court. Life fund investments fell to Pounds 2.41bn (Pounds 2.6bn), reflecting weak bond and equity markets.</p>

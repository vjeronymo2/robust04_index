			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT THIS 4-H SHOW, COMPUTERS WILL HOG ALL THE ATTENTION  </P> <P> Be careful: The blue-ribbon winner in this 4-H contest bytes.  </P> <P> Opening Monday is the Second Artificial Life 4-H Show, featured attraction of  the Artificial Life II Workshop in Santa Fe, N.M. While artificial intelligence  uses computers to model the mind, artificial life practitioners use computers  as a medium for evolution, ecosystems and self-reproducing automata.  </P> <P> More than 400 biologists, physicists, anthropologists and computer scientists  are expected to attend and discuss the latest approaches to transforming  software and silicon into life-emulating creatures.  </P> <P> "Artificial life is the new metaphor for machinery," says Esther Dyson, a noted  computer science critic. "In the last century, people built things; this  century, people are going to grow them."  </P> <P> To add the spice of competition to the conference, the organizers sponsored  their own 4-H contest in 1987 to let the participants show off their artificial  life forms. "It was a way to have fun and reward people who did interesting  things," says Chris Langton, a staff scientist at Los Alamos National  Laboratories' complex systems group and a 4-H judge. "Our criteria were for  things that were the most lifelike -- we won't say alive yet."  </P> <P> "Best of Show" at the first Artificial Life conference in 1987 went to a team  that developed a program that grew "branching structures." These structures  evolved in forms uncannily similar to real life plants.  </P> <P> Second place went to a computer scientist who developed software "boids" --  bird-like computer creatures that emulated flocking and schooling behaviors.  </P> <P> The possible front-runner in this year's contest -- expected to have more than  50 entries -- is "Rod Brooks' Lab at MIT," says Langton, "if they bring along  some of their critters." The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's  "Microbots" are a hot topic in the growing artificial life community.  </P> <P> The real 4-H Council -- the one that sponsors thousands of county fair contests  each year -- doesn't quite know what to make of this. "Are you serious?" asks  4-H spokeswoman Denise Miller. "I'm having difficulty visualizing this."  </P></p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: US producer price data hit bonds and equities - Market report The unexpectedly large jump in August producer prices in the US, raising the spectre of further rises ahead in the Federal Reserve's key interest rates, hit UK financial markets very hard yesterday afternoon. Short-dated government bonds, those most closely linked to base rate prospects, fell by a quarter of a point while the longer dates which reflect deeper inflation worries, collapsed by more than 1 1/2 points. Early confidence in the equity market was wiped out by the setback in government bond prices. A gain of plus 12 on the FT-SE 100 Share Index in early afternoon had been replaced by a net fall of 40.7 points at the closing reading of 3,139.3. At the day's low, the Footsie touched 3,134. The September futures contract on the Footsie closed at around 3,125, after trading at a substantial discount to the stock market for most of the afternoon. The Dow Industrial Average was more than 30 points off in New York when London went home for the day. Most analysts admitted that the Footsie 3,100 mark would be at hazard on Monday morning, when the UK's producer price numbers are due. Next week also brings further important challenges to market sensitivity to inflation prospects in the form of the US Consumer price index, expected on Tuesday, and the Britain's Retail price index, which is due on Thursday. There was little time in London for any disciplined reaction to the news from the US that the August Producer price index had risen by 0.6 per cent overall, compared with market forecasts of around 0.4 per cent. Sellers poured into London's stock index futures market, and there was a good deal of technical activity between futures and cash equities, with some negative arbitraging operations involving buying the futures and selling the underlying stocks. Substantial losses were suffered by the retail and consumer stocks which are directly in line for the negative effects of higher interest rates. BTR lost further ground as the market continued to react badly to the half time trading report. Bank shares, too, suffered sharp losses as investors weighed the prospects for their bad debt customers should domestic interest rates begin to move higher. The picture was no better across the range of industrial sectors, where building and construction issues also felt the threat of higher base rates. While the focus was on the blue chip stocks which make up the Footsie 100 list, the reverberations reached well down into the list of stocks in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which closed 25.8 off at 3,736. Seaq-reported trading volume of 642.3m shares compared with 668.5m on Thursday when retail business returned a value total of Pounds 1.3bn. The first half of the trading session appeared fairly confident. Market analysts remained optimistic for a further rise in the stock market over the medium term, although most agreed that UK base rates would rise well before the end of the year. The losses in US and in British government bonds yesterday afternoon hit hard at a stock market where worries about inflation have increased over the past week. The FT-SE 100 Index has fallen by nearly 2.6 per cent over the week and appears likely to fall further. The loss on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was held to only 1.4 per cent, reflecting the focus on the blue chip stocks which suffered from the fall-out in stock index futures. However, not all the market specialists were negative. Some believe that, while next week will inevitably bring further pain, the UK stock market may still move higher before the end of the year. Base rate rises have been built into market forecasts and, in spite of this week's shocks, company earnings are still expected to continue rising until well into next year.</p>

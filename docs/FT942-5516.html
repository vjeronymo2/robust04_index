			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Sharp decline in US jobless rate unsettles bonds Leading government bond markets swung wildly yesterday as traders struggled to interpret US employment data which seemed to signal a stronger than expected improvement in the labour market. Bond prices at one stage were down by more than a point on both sides of the Atlantic on fears that the sharp fall in the US jobless rate, to 6 per cent last month from 6.4 per cent in April, would lead to higher inflation and interest rates. Investors were disturbed by upward revisions in April and March payrolls, which left the three-month average in line with expectations. The markets found the sharp drop in the unemployment rate even more troubling because it suggested greater upward pressure on wages. The falls were wiped out by a strong rally as analysts focused on other aspects of the employment report, including weaker than expected employment growth last month. Non-farm payrolls rose by only half as much as the consensus forecast. The upturn in prices was also said to have been influenced by rumours that the US Federal Reserve was buying shorter maturity bonds and a spurt of retail buying. Dealers in US Treasuries attempted to cover their short positions in a rising market. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year bond was trading up nearly a point at 87 21/32 , pushing the yield down to 7.268 per cent. The so-called 'short squeeze' triggered rebounds in European government bond markets. The yield on the benchmark 10-year UK government bond slipped to 8.33 per cent from 8.47 per cent on Thursday as the price rose to 89 3/32 from 88 5/32. The yield on 10-year German government bonds fell to 6.97 per cent from 7.04 per cent on Wednesday, the previous trading day. Bond prices were also buoyed by technical factors caused by the imminent expiry of futures contracts. On Liffe, London's financial futures exchange, the September long UK government bond futures contract fell as low as 99 13/16 before rebounding to 102 3/32 in heavy volume for a gain of 1 15/32 points. Stocks partly followed the movement in bonds. After opening with a 15-point decline, the Dow Jones industrial average pushed into positive territory and then hesitated. An unexpected decline in manufacturing employment contained in the May report may have restrained enthusiasm. Later, however, the Dow gathered fresh strength and finished up 13.23 at 3,772.22.

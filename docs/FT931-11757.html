			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Moody's cuts Sweden rating SWEDEN, the heaviest borrower in the international capital markets in the past three months, had its long-term debt rating cut yesterday. The downgrading to Aa2 from Aa1, by Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, comes at a difficult time for Sweden, which needs to raise substantial further amounts internationally to finance its large budget deficit. The cut comes just days after Sweden launched the biggest-ever foreign bond issue in the Japanese domestic bond, or 'Samurai', market. The Y200bn (Pounds 1bn) issue ran into difficulty because of the aggressive pricing at a time when the country's credit rating was already under review for possible downgrade. Moody's, which has had the country's rating under review since last October, pointed to Sweden's weak economy, sizeable deterioration of public sector finances and high level of unemployment. 'These imbalances can only be corrected gradually, and may delay a needed recuperation of investment,' Moody's said. 'This, in turn, may hurt the country's long-term competitiveness and creditworthiness.' About Dollars 39bn (Pounds 25bn) worth of outstanding foreign currency debt is affected. However, dealers said that there was little impact on the price of the bonds because a reduction of two notches in the country's credit rating had been rumoured. The move leaves Sweden in the unusual position of having conflicting ratings from the biggest credit rating agencies. Standard &amp; Poor's, the other big US agency, said it had no plans to downgrade Sweden from its current AAA. Ms Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister, said she was not surprised by the downgrade, as Sweden was already on the observation list. However, she added that the decision underlined the serious Swedish economic situation and the importance of the policy in the finance bill implying structural reforms and measures needed to increase growth. Sweden has almost completed its SKr230bn (Pounds 21bn) borrowing package announced last autumn. Capital Markets, Page 23</p>

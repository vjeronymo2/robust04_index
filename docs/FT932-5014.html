			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Private View: The actor who reclaimed his crown - Robert Stephens is back at the centre of the English stage. He talks about the perils of being 'too much yourself' WHAT IS an actor? Someone who is not a bank manager or a hairdresser. What else? A man like any other - a bundle of habits and attributes surrounding a vulnerable self. When an actor has scaled the heights of his profession, as Robert Stephens has, the world wants to know what the man inside is like. When he has also surveyed the depths, it turns him into the hero of his own morality play. It is easy - too easy - to contrast the public and the private person. On stage, Stephens has a huge presence and an exuberant confidence that borders on the reckless. At home he is self-effacing, sweet-natured and trusting in an almost childlike way. In company he can be garrulous yet elusive, metaphorically diving into the dressing-up box to put on another cloak for another character. Or he will just switch off and drift silently away. He talks appreciatively and at length about other people, very modestly and awkwardly about himself. A personal question is likely to be answered with an anecdote, no detail omitted, in which the full range of his actor's voice  -melodious, highly-inflected, now drawling, now rushing - is exploited to divert you. Stephens, the ladykiller with film star looks, arrived at the Royal Court theatre in London in the mid-1950s moved to the National Theatre in the early 1960s and took the town by storm. Before long he was being talked about as the man to inherit Olivier's crown, both as actor and head of the company. It led to Olivier rejecting him. Then his marriage to another rising star, Maggie Smith, failed and Stephens, always one for the high life, hit the bottle. His career sagged into minor roles and bit-parts for film and television. He did not exactly disappear from the theatre - he had seasons at the National in 1978 and 1983 - but his name faded from the public mind. Then two years ago the Royal Sheakespeare Company's director Adrian Noble (who as a boy had seen Stephens' famous performance as Atahualpa in Royal Hunt of the Sun) asked him to play Falstaff. The man might have gone astray but the actor was as potent as ever. His Falstaff won him last year's best actor prize in the Olivier Awards. Two weeks ago, the critics were back at Stratford to see his King Lear. If some questioned the interpretation all agreed that Stephens was moving and magnificent. Lear resumes on Monday. I went to see the protagonist, who was hobbling round his London flat suffering the after-effects of an infected foot. Despite a series of medical mishaps, I found Stephens looking almost unrecognisably young: at 61, he has become handsome again. At first he was reluctant to call his recent success a come-back. But he agreed eventually, saying: 'It's nice to know you can still get up there and do it.' After he had described all the factors that had contributed to his absence I asked him: don't you blame yourself for being out of the picture for so long? 'Well, I do. Because I think I got lost. I lost my ambition. I lost my . . . because of the failure of the marriage, because of the ending of my relationship with Olivier. I felt a bit bereft of many things. And also I lost my direction.' I tried to get Stephens to talk about himself. You are very modest aren't you? 'Yes, very.' Are you too nice for theatre politics? 'Yes. It is very difficult; I've tried to do it several times. If you're not careful you can get let down very badly by people.' A very trusting person? 'Very.' He described a West End venture which had collapsed. He had been misinformed and badly advised, he said. 'I was naturally shattered by that experience.' A deeper blow was the ruction with Olivier, a father figure with whom he had spent the best eight years of his acting life. 'He was my great symbol, someone I aspired to, not only as an actor, but as a man, as a friend, as a companion, as someone to be with, to talk to, whose company was always incredibly engaging, fascinating. As Olivier's associate director he found he had become a pawn. 'When you didn't agree with him you got the old cobra eye for about a week. He didn't like the word No. He was the kind of person who would allow nobody to make decisions but himself. I was given an office and secretary but I didn't have anything to do.' I asked if he was ambitious about acting but not competitive. 'I never have been. I don't understand it.' He added that he was 'very cross' about stories that he had been jealous of Maggie Smith's success. 'That was completely untrue. I've never felt jealous of an actor or actress. You can't be them. I was thrilled for any success she had because it was deserved. She is a genius as a comedienne. You get cross when you see somebody with no talent become very successful, irritated that they've got away with it somehow.' Do you need a lot of supporting as a person or is that true of all actors? 'I think it's very much the kind of person you are. I've always worked my best in a company atmosphere. I think it's conducive to better work: you get to know their little ways. Also to work with directors you trust.' It seemed unfair to ask Stephens now to talk about his famous appetite for women and drink when he has been living happily with the actress Patricia Quinn for over 15 years and has stopped boozing. 'Certainly as a young actor I did abuse the drink for a time,' he said. 'I was very unhappy and going through a bad period. But when I was young all actors drank. Now there are vintage waters.' He scoffed. 'If you get taken out by an American producer and order a drink they look at you as if you are a bit odd. Faddism.' 'What happens, and it's a bad thing because it creeps up on you, is when you become a habitual drinker. Your system becomes used to it. Then if you're not very careful, which is what happened to me, it begins to affect your health.' What about women? You were very popular with the girls . . . 'I enjoy the company of women, always have done, and that can get you into trouble. I think when I was married to Maggie - you can't blame people if things go wrong - I was very much on a high and as the marriage seemed to be failing you stupidly start playing the field.' Was it the sex or the admiration . . ? ' . . and adulation. There are men who feel it is necessary to conquer every woman who steps into their line of vision. But that's a kind of mental problem - the Don Juan complex. I always despised people who have no respect for the other person at all.' Do you fall in love at the drop of a hat? 'Yes. And of course that is extremely dangerous. Any advice I would give to a young blade is you must always be absolutely sure that you're not going to hurt anybody.' Stephens' has reason to feel strongly about rushing into wedlock. His parents, a working-class couple in Bristol, married, he suspects, only because his mother was pregnant. His childhood was very unhappy because he felt, or was made to feel, to blame for his mother's own unhappiness. He spent a lot of time at the pictures and it was there watching the cowboys and Indians that the actor was born. 'I thought: Oh, I would like to do that] I would like to be somebody else. 'It was like the desire to play games, I suppose. That's all acting is really. It's a grown-up playing cowboys and Indians or gangsters.' But leading actors are not born every day. What makes them? 'An aspiration to do something, an ambition to play great parts, a certain daring, a certain courage to believe that you can go on and convince others you are somebody else. But I think there is a lot of nonsense talked about it . . . though of course a bank manager can't go on to the stage or screen and kiss somebody else's wife or shoot somebody. 'I think the great thrill of it is: you stand on the stage before the play begins and the lights go down in the auditorium - at Stratford there are 1,500 people - and you don't know any of them, where they've come from, whether they want to be there or not been dragged by their wives, whether they've just got divorced, whether they have just lost their father - you know nothing about them. 'When the lights go down on them and the curtain goes up on you you have to convince them in a split second that for the next two and a half or three hours they're going to have a jolly good time in your company, that they're quite safe, that nothing awful's going to happen, and they will go out feeling a bit better than they felt when they came in. 'In fact it's a sense of power. That's why I think acting on stage is much more interesting than acting in films.' It's a perilous profession, I said. Can you imagine having done anything else? 'No. I mean, I've directed a little, but you have to plan your life so well . . .' Outside the theatre, I mean. He answered without hesitation. 'I would like to either have been a hairdresser or a dentist.' Why a hairdresser? 'I suppose because they're so garrulous. Also they have to put on some kind of performance for all their clients . . . as so do dentists.' What does an actor do after Lear? Stephens would dearly like to play Uncle Vanya, or Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman. I asked him if there was a moral in his story. 'Yes, a man once said to me there is one thing you ought to be, or try to be, in your life. Try to be circumspect. Don't jump until you're absolutely sure what you're jumping for. Because of your generosity, your enthusiasm for things you can jump on the wrong bandwagon or jump with the wrong person and carry the brunt of the mistake.' But could you act the way you do if you were circumspect? Robert Stephens flashed a big smile. 'I think I could be circumspect some of the time.'</p>

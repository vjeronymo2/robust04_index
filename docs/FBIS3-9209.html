			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Chairman of the  government coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) Jan Kalvoda  expressed his support for a proposal by the coalition leader  Civic Democratic Party (ODS) to terminate the restitution  process through a relevant law, the Czech daily RUDE PRAVO  reports today.    At its session in Spindleruv Mlyn, east Bohemia, the ODS  Executive Council decided to work out a "post-transformation"  bill aimed at the regulation and termination of the restitution  and compensation process in the Czech Republic.    The left-leaning paper quotes Kalvoda as saying on his  return  from a Latin American trip on Monday: "If it (the bill) is a  broad agreement on terminating restitution and settling  controversial questions between coalition parties, then I  support it strongly, in a general sense."    At the same time, Kalvoda noted that it was the ODA which  had  already pronounced the words "the final point of restitution" a  few months ago.    RUDE PRAVO also quotes Josef Lux, chairman of another  government coalition party, the Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), as saying at a  press conference on Monday [21 March] that his party, along with  the ODA and the last coalition member, the Christian Democratic  Party (KDS), clearly defined and presented the idea of  concluding restitution some time ago. In view of this, Lux  welcomes the Saturday [19 March] resolution by the ODS Executive  Council to work out legislation on the issue.    However, Lux admitted that the stances of the ODS and the  KDU-CSL on the conclusion of restitution may differ, the daily  writes. Lux confirmed that within a week, the cabinet, where he  holds the post of agriculture minister, should discuss the  KDU-CSL proposal that the government decide on the transfer of  state property to churches and religious communities.    Reacting to a remark by RUDE PRAVO that the ODS seems to  have  a negative stance towards this question, Lux responded that only  the vote in the government would be decisive. He would not  raise such a proposal if he saw no chance for its passage, he  said.    At the close of the report, RUDE PRAVO quotes KDS Chairman  Ivan Pilip as saying to CTK on Monday that the ODS's views are  becoming closer to the views of the KDS.</p>

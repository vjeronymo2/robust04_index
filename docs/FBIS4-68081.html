			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- A Turkish Airlines flight  from Tokyo made an emergency landing in Moscow earlier this  month after the Turkish Embassy in Tokyo received a message  threatening to blow up the flight en route to Istanbul, police  said Friday [13 May].    According to police and airline officials, the message was  received at the embassy by facsimile on May 5 at 2:45 P.M. from  a group which identified itself as a Kurdish liberation  organization.    The message, typed in English, said that TK Flight 593 would  be blown up at 0500 GMT the same day, or 2 P.M. Japan time, and  the blame would be shouldered by the governments of Turkey and  Japan, the sources said.    The fax did not display the telephone number nor the name of  the country where the message originated, police said.    The jetliner was flying over Siberia and was contacted by  the  airline's office, which had been informed by the embassy.    The plane made an emergency landing in Moscow and a search  of  the interior and luggage was made. Nothing suspicious was  discovered and the flight continued to Istanbul.</p>

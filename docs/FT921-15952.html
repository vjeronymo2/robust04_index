			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Dealing in the business of fear: How rival paramilitary groups raise and launder money through commerce and industry BEHIND the more visible measures to deter terrorism in Northern Ireland the government and the Royal Ulster Constabulary are fighting a secret war against the IRA's fund-raising efforts. Officials believe the IRA raises up to Pounds 6m a year, which finances arms and explosives, weekly payments to about 500 active 'volunteers', safe houses, travel, bribes and research and development on armaments. Protestant paramilitaries also fund operations from racketeering, generating income estimated by officials to be about Pounds 2m a year. But the IRA's financial activities and military organisation have been identified as far greater and more sophisticated than those of the Protestants and are the main focus of RUC activities. The IRA's bombing campaign against commercial targets and its assassinations of executives whose companies supply the armed forces have fuelled the climate of fear on which racketeering and extortion breed. The war against the paramilitary fund-raisers centres on two special units; one at an anonymous-looking building by the river in east Belfast, the other in the government offices at Stormont Castle. The first is the RUC's C13 anti-racketeering squad. The second is a little-known department made up of tax experts, accountants and an assortment of secretive intelligence gatherers from various sections of the Civil Service. Both units are considered by some officials as being as important as the detachments of police and soldiers that patrol the streets in the fight against terrorism. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, underlined the importance that the government attaches to its anti-racketeering strategy last year. He told the Commons that businessmen and accountants - 'persons of substance' - were becoming increasingly involved in raising and laundering funds used to finance terrorism. He also warned that, without action soon, there was a serious risk that those acting on behalf of terrorist organisations would succeed in establishing a commercial or business infrastructure capable of providing long-term support for terrorism. C13, set up in its present form in 1986, has recently had its status in the RUC upgraded. It has greatly increased its personnel and introduced state-of-the-art surveillance equipment and computerised intelligence databanks. Its officers are slick and - uncharacteristically for the RUC - worldly-wise. They have had contacts with the FBI in the US and with European police such as those in Italy, who have had experience of dealing with organised crime. The Civil Service unit at Stormont is a more recent creation. The Northern Ireland Office, for security reasons, carefully protects the identity of its members, some of whom are drawn from government departments not normally associated in the public eye with counter terrorism. Racketeering is one of the few issues that the Confederation of British Industry's regional office in Northern Ireland is not prepared to comment on. It argues that to go public would only fuel the IRA's campaign and produce more potential targets on both sides of the political divide. The main areas of the black 'micro-economy' in which officials claim paramilitaries have been operating include: Taxi services. Contributions are believed by officials to be made from companies operating in the republican and loyalist strongholds of Belfast. Non-invoiced drink sales. Money is thought to be channelled from sales in the social clubs which have taken the place of some of the Belfast pubs burnt down in the rioting of the 1970s. Tax fraud. This is thought to arise from the use of forged or illegally obtained tax exemption certificates by sub-contractors on building sites. Protection rackets. Business-people are forced to pay 'subscriptions' rather than risk having their operations disrupted by bombing or assassination of personnel. In addition, companies supplying the armed forces have been subjected to a campaign of intimidation often involving the killing of key personnel. New powers under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill include those empowering the courts to seize the assets of anyone who benefited terrorist-related activities. Both the RUC and government officials claim they have begun to stem the tide of terrorist funding. They say that is the result of raids on organisations alleged to have been making significant contributions to the republican movement that had the potential to be diverted to the IRA. Not all the raids have been successful. Fourteen months after being raided by the security forces, offices of Sinn Fein (the political wing of the IRA), the Prisoners Welfare Committee, a charity called the Green Cross, and a Catholic taxi co-operative called West Belfast Taxi Insurance are operating within a short walk of each other off the Falls Road. Their fund-raising activities on behalf of the families of political prisoners remain unobstructed by the security forces as do those of the New York offices of Noraid, which channels funds from the Irish-American community. The only common link admitted to by all five organisations is that they are responsible for shouldering part of the costs of the republican movement. According to accounts registered with the US Department of Justice, Noraid has made deposits and payments through two US banks, Citibank and First Citizens. Green Cross says it has been a client for many years with Allied Irish Bank, while West Belfast Taxi Insurance says that it banks with Northern Bank. Noraid, Sinn Fein, the Prisoners Welfare Committee, the Green Cross and West Belfast Taxi Insurance all deny financing the IRA, although Noraid is registered with the US Department of Justice as a 'foreign agent representing the Irish Republican Army'. All four banks say they are not prepared to comment on accounts held by individuals or organisations. Documents seized so far have failed to provide evidence linking the fund-raising of the organisations and terrorist activity, although the RUC and the Stormont unit claimed to have found evidence of false accounting in the case of one Belfast taxi association and several social clubs. The RUC says several hundred thousand pounds have gone missing from the West Belfast Taxi Association. The accusation of false accounting, however, is denied by Mr Jim Neeson, the organisation's chairman. He said the 650 taxi drivers who belonged to his organisation paid an average of Pounds 2 a week each to the Green Cross, which he described as a 'charitable organisation' channelling funds to the families of political prisoners. The security forces, in their search for what may be much larger sums of money, are understood to be up against a complex system of money laundering by the IRA. According to government officials this is thought sometimes to involve front companies and the accounts of sympathisers or nominees who are not easily identifiable. They possibly extend to numerous banking jurisdictions both onshore and offshore, although the RUC and Stormont admit they may still have some way to go before coming to grips with the IRA's complex financial structure. While the identity of some individuals close to the IRA's finance 'command'  -responsible for supervising the collection and distribution of funds within the organisation - may be known to intelligence, there is as yet no hard evidence to ensure their conviction. One security official said: 'There is a disparity between what we know to be the case and what we can do because of lack of evidence.' Mr Alasdair Maclaughlin, of the Northern Ireland Bankers' Association, says he had no information as to how many local banks had shared the experience of the Bank of Ireland, which was presented with an extortion demand by the IRA for Pounds 2m last year - a demand it rejected. But he confirmed the practical difficulties faced by the authorities as they attempt to track more subtle forms of terrorist-based financial transactions involving the use of nominee directors for front companies and money laundering. 'It's bound to be difficult when you have the criminal fraternity remarkably well qualified. They have brains which are trying to be ahead of the game . . . there are ways of getting into the system and laundering money.' Few companies will talk openly about the costs of protection rackets or their motives for not supplying the armed forces. The real costs of resisting terrorism is only slightly clearer. Economists believe the government compensation fund (see chart) understates the costs of terrorist activity against commercial activities. Short Brothers, the defence manufacturer and Northern Ireland's biggest private employer, has been the victim of seven IRA bomb attacks in the last two years. but it says it has never paid protection money, and its investment programme has not been affected. Smaller companies, however, cannot afford to pay the Pounds 10m Shorts says it has spent on security in the last two years. They have therefore been more vulnerable to extortion and threats against personnel. In September one of Northern Ireland's leading timber companies, McCue Dick, announced it would no longer supply goods to the security forces after Mr John Haldane, its managing director, was shot dead by the IRA. The issue of payments to terrorist organisations and the operation of contracts with the security forces is regarded as virtually taboo by the majority of the business community. The Northern Ireland Building Federation refuses to discuss the issue in public. But one senior member of the Federation said extortion had been on the increase since the beginning of 1991. 'The difficulty comes when a contractor is two thirds of the way through his project and has made a financial commitment . . . but the practical reality is that it is impossible to have a 24-hour police guard and there is no choice but to abandon it.' The construction company Mivan is among the few businesses to have talked about its difficulties, after testifying against paramilitaries that extorted money from it. Although Mivan faced racketeers that belonged to Protestant paramilitary organisations, the case illustrates the problems of construction companies which feel threatened by the IRA. The company had started work on a building site in Belfast when one of its managers was approached by men claiming to be raising funds on behalf of a prisoners' welfare fund. In the following weeks the pressure intensified with warnings that, unless the company agreed to pay cash directly to collectors, plant and machinery would be damaged and members of staff attacked. Mivan agreed to be party to a sting operation involving C13 and subsequently testified in a court case against the men involved. Last year it was again approached for money when it began work on a Pounds 500,000 renovation programme in the low-income Shankill area of Belfast. It decided to abandon the contract. Money paid by the Northern Ireland Office in compensation to companies which have been victims of terrorism reached a record last year and forced the government to freeze its public-spending budget. The government argues compensation is necessary if future investment is not to be deterred, but it has not succeeded in eradicating the fear felt by wide sectors of the business community. Fear underlined the words of a Belfast businessmen who told a local journalist soon after Mr Brooke's appeal in October: 'If businessmen have any sense they'll keep their mouths shut . . . even if we do own up, the police won't catch the big boys. I'm paying Pounds 600 every six months to the Provos and Pounds 600 to the Prods, so I'm getting off pretty light. 'The way it works is that you get a phone call saying a collection's going to be taken in a couple of days for political prisoners and to have the money ready. But if you phone the police and they lift the man who calls for the money, that's only the messenger. When he doesn't get back the godfather knows what's happening and I'm dead.' Police are urging businesses to use their 'helpline' to tip them off about extortion attempts and to testify in court. But a leading builder, who insisted on anonymity, commented: 'Most people are unwilling to go to court unless they feel the weight of evidence is such that the police can get a conviction and are quite certain that neither (they) nor their families would be put at risk.' He added: 'The reality is that the IRA have the potential to kill and the security forces are unable to protect us.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FINANCES OF TERRORISM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Estimated running operational costs (per annum):   Includes average payment of Pounds 40 per week to some 500 'active'   volunteers; safe houses; arms; military research and development;   travel; bribes: Pounds 6m; Protestant paramilitaries: Pounds 2m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Major sources of alleged IRA income (per annum):   Taxis: Pounds 600,000   Drinking Clubs: Pounds 750,000   Protection and Extortion: Pounds 1.3m   Tax Fraud: Pounds 1m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other sources of Republican funds:   Contributions of 10 drinking clubs to Green Cross: Pounds 100,000   Declared contributions of West Belfast taxi drivers to Green   Cross: Pounds 28,800 (approx)   Declared income of Green Cross: Pounds 384,000 (approx)   Declared income of Republican Prisoners Welfare Committee: Pounds   20,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NORAID:   Aug 1987-Jan 1988 Income:    Contributions: Dollars 110,223    Merchandise sold: Dollars 55,764    Expenses: Dollars 180,077    Money sent to An Cumann Cabhrach: Dollars 62,425   August 1988-January 1989: Money sent to An Cumann Cabrach: Dollars   73,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COSTS OF TERRORISM:   Government's business compensation budget:    1990/1: Pounds 22.5m    1991/2: Pounds 33.5m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TWO-YEAR TOTAL: Pounds 56m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (Sources: UK government departments; report by David Davis MP; US Department of Justice; Green Cross; West Belfast Taxi Insurance; Republican Prisoners Welfare Committee)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

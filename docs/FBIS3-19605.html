			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 20 (AFP) -- President Francois  Mitterrand said Sunday [20 March] he had spoken personally to  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a bid to defuse a diplomatic  row which blew up last week between France and Germany.    A "dialogue" is underway between advisers to the two  leaders,  the French president told AFP, aimed at mending fences between  the two normally close allies.    In a move highly unusual between friendly states, German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Thursday summoned French  ambassador Francois Scheer to explain remarks he allegedly made  about the German attitude toward the European Union. Scheer had  spoken earlier to German journalists on condition of anonymity.    Relations between the two countries also became strained  after Kohl was omitted from celebrations for the 50th  anniversary of the Allied landing in Normandy, taking place on  June 6.    Mitterrand moved to play down the row, saying he had  discussed "these issues by telephone with the Chancellor last  week," adding: "Our advisers have met. The dialogue is  continuing."    He said he would meet Kinkel next Thursday "as has been  scheduled for a long time."    Mitterrand said Kohl had "not asked me" for an invitation to  the D-Day memorial ceremonies, adding: "I'm considering with the  prime minister (Edouard Balladur) what is the best way to...  celebrate the 50th anniversary as it should be and mark that,  after the period we're commemorating, has come historically  unprecedented cooperation." [sentence as received]    Recalling that cooperation between the two countries had led  to the creation of a French-German military corps, "a European  corps," Mitterrand said: "We remain in this spirit."    The French president said he and Kohl had done "lots of work  together in the best spirit and we shall continue to do so in  the interest of both our countries and Europe."</p>

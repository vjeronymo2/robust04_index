			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: More progress for '95 less and less likely - London Any market that can survive relatively intact after a week which included news of a significant defeat for the government in the House of Commons, a half percentage point rise in UK interest rates, a mini-budget featuring big tax increases in consumer areas, and the threat of another base rate rise in the US has to have very solid foundations. Whether the UK equity market can build on such solid ground in the short term is another thing. More than ever, markets appear to be at the mercy of a Wall Street showing increasing volatility and being hit by a succession of hammer blows. With each blow confidence is draining away from Wall Street and worries about the US are gnawing at London's fragile grip on the 3,000 level. Not even the prospect of a bid battle triggered by the merger discussions between two of the financial world's biggest names - SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley - could check stock market slides across Europe on Friday. The woes affecting Wall Street last week came from three different directions. First, Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund, one of the biggest mutual funds in the world with assets of Dollars 35bn, said it would not make a year-end distribution to its 3m investors, causing ripples of unease across world markets. Second, the local authority in Orange County, California, filed for bankruptcy, prompting fears that it may be forced to liquidate its Dollars 20bn bond portfolio. Third, and most importantly, the prospects of another interest rate rise in the US grew strongly after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, testified to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that the US economy was growing faster than expected and that the financial markets apparently still doubted the Fed's determination to fight inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee meets on December 20 and Mr Greenspan's remarks can only be interpreted as a strong indication that US rates will rise again, only a month after the last increase. The response in London to the government's defeat over the second stage of the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and the subsequent interest rate rise was impressive, as it was initially to the increases in taxes on alcohol, tobacco and fuel. However, with the Conservative government lurching from crisis to crisis and Wall Street unnerving even those with the strongest of constitutions, it is looking increasingly unlikely that UK equities can make much progress before the end of the year. Unless of course, there are more big bids in the pipeline and the Warburg saga developes into something of an auction.</p>

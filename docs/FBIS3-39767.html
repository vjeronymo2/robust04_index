			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias addressed a  message of peace and a crystal clear warning in every direction  from Ioannina, where he spoke at the official luncheon hosted in  his honor by 8th Army Division commander Major General Andonios  (Nialamangas). Mr. Papoulias said: We really live in a period  that is fraught with immense dangers from the plunging of the  Balkans into a series of wild civil wars. The involvement of  foreign forces in these clashes and the impending bombing of  Bosnia-Herzegovina constitute a deadly threat to world peace.    Mr. Papoulias added: The war flames are burning in our  neighborhood, where unprecedented instability and uncertainty  prevail. Our homeland constitutes the only oasis of stability  in this sensitive region. With a steadfast peace-loving  orientation, Greece extends a hand to all its neighbors seeking  relations of friendship and cooperation. We do not claim  anything from anyone. The only thing we demand is respect for  our borders, respect of our fellow nationals' rights, and  respect of our history.    The foreign minister further said: Unfortunately, certain  quarters have interpreted this stance as weakness and began and  are still continuing with provocations and claims against our  country. The more we assert our stance on the question of peace,  the more determined we are to defend our history, our emblems,  and national heritage.    Mr. Papoulias also noted: We would like to send a message  from here in Ioannina to our friends and partners: It is not  Greece who is harming European Union [EU] solidarity; it has  already been injured by all those who support the intransigence  of [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia President Kiro]  Gligorov and tolerate his indescribable claims. It is our  homeland's inalienable right to protect our national integrity  by adopting all those measures that will ensure that our rights  are respected. Greece, far from harboring hegemonic intentions,  wants the Balkans to become a place of sincere cooperation and  mutual respect by all the peoples who live in this [words  indistinct] peninsula. We cherish the hope that this prospect  will prevail in the end over the disastrous logic of violence  and war. We are certain that many of those who now criticize us  will finally recognize the righteousness of our policy and our  devotion to peace.    Mr. Papoulias concluded: The Greek Armed Forces, with their  excellent morale, all-round training, and devotion to their  professional duty, constitute the most stalwart basis of this  peace-loving policy of our government.</p>

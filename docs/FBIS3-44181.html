Trilateral negotiations between the government, the African  National Congress and the Freedom Alliance, of which the IFP is  a member, are to resume on Thursday in a last-ditch effort to  ensure the alliance's participation in the election.    The IFP Central Committee in a statement on Wednesday night  also expressed concern that the lack of progress in separate  negotiations on the position of the Zulu king and kingdom would  "impair the ability of (the) conference to consider what course  of action to adopt and to come to a final decision as to the  IFP's responsibility to South Africa in regard to the  forthcoming elections".</p>

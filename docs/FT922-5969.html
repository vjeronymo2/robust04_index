			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Canadian grain for Russia hit by cash shortage CANADIAN grain exports to Russia have slowed to a trickle because of Moscow's inability to pay foreign shipowners and a ban imposed by Ottawa on many Russian-owned vessels to counter an infestation of leaf-eating moths. Russia's shortage of hard currency has already caused Canadian authorities to impound at least one fully-laden vessel, and appears to be discouraging other owners from sending ships to Canadian ports. The slowdown in shipments to Canada's biggest grain export market has also caused a domestic transport crisis. About half the grain freighters plying the Great Lakes are at present idle, and several hundred crew members and grain handlers have been laid off. The Canadian Grain Transportation Agency (GTA), which co-ordinates deliveries to the ports, yesterday cut its estimate of June exports. Total shipments through the Great Lakes port of Thunder Bay are now projected at 0.5m tonnes, half the volume expected a month ago. The GTA has cut its projection of export volumes through west coast ports from 1.7m tonnes to 1.36m tonnes. Canada exported a total 7.2m tonnes of wheat and 1.2m tonnes of barley to the former Soviet Union in the season which ended last July. Although Canada has extended a CDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 714m) line of credit to Russia for wheat purchases, this does not cover shipping costs. A spokesman for the Canadian Wheat Board said yesterday that Russia's inability to pay for foreign-owned vessels appears to be the main problem. Use of Russian ships is limited by a Canadian government order banning vessels in port in the Russian Far East during the Asian gypsy-moth spawning season. The moths, voracious foliage eaters, are a threat to west coast forests in the US and Canada. An official with Morlines Maritime Agency, which handles the bulk of wheat shipments to Russia, said that Export Khleb, the Russian grain-purchasing agency, has not chartered any vessels to load in a Canadian port before June 3.</p>

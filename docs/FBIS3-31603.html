			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Grubac] </F>   [Text] The Russian initiative has worked and there will be  no bombing of Serb positions. The news on the first channel of  the French television that the Muslims committed the crime at  the Sarajevo market sounds cynical. It arrived, as always,  after everything [sentence as heard]. Russia has finally  stepped on the international political scene and -- through  offensive diplomacy at a very delicate moment -- stopped the  militant West. The Russian initiative, whose author is  President Yeltsin with his closest associates, would not have  worked, of course, had it not been met with full cooperation by  the Serb side. The triumph of Russian policy over the Western  arms should not only be temporary. As a serious country with  serious policies, Russia has now imposed on itself certain  obligations. Does that mean there will be a new balance of  power? Is this the beginning of a new era in international  relations with the new -- that is, old -- Russian factor?    According to CNN, 80 percent of the Russians in a poll  opposed the bombing of Serb positions. Again, according to CNN,  60 percent of the Russians believe that an attack on the Serbs  is an attack on Russia. The Russian Church also opposes air  strikes against Serb positions. Patriarch (Aleksey) II said  that even the thought of air strikes must be rejected. Of  course, the Russian initiative contains the views of Serbia's  policy, since -- as we could see -- Vitaliy Churkin, as Boris  Yeltsin's special envoy, spent most of his time in talks with  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. So Serbia and the Serb  republic, or rather the Serb side, has been providing evidence  of the continuity of their peace-loving policy.    We will soon see whether the United States will use its  influence on the Muslim side, not only at this time but also in  the future. Izetbegovic promised that the Muslim artillery would  also be moved and silenced. This is a promise that will mean  nothing unless there is clear insistence on that by the  international community, particularly the United States, as  pointed out two days ago by Russian Foreign Minister Andrei  Kozyrev. The Russian minister stressed the obligations facing  the Muslim side. Russia has done its bit, now it is the turn of  the United States. The new peace negotiations will begin, no  doubt, with new territorial demands by the Muslim side. All  this has been staged for that reason, to strengthen the  negotiating position of the Muslims -- from the event on the  Sarajevo market to the threat of air strikes.    The threat of sanctions against Croatia, of course, remain  in  the media shadow of these events. Croatia was told to withdraw  its army from Bosnia by 17 February, as Butrus-Ghali reminded.  However, it is hard to believe that Germany and its bloc, which  is still very powerful, will allow sanctions to be introduced  against Croatia. That would be yet another example of  inconsistency and double standards of the international  community toward the protagonists in the crisis in the former  Yugoslavia.    Those who wanted to could have seen once again that had it  been up to the Serb side, the war would have stopped a long time  ago.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / ICI wins tariff cut in water charges appeal NORTH West Water has agreed to cut its tariffs at Imperial Chemical Industries' complex at Runcorn by 25 per cent after appeals to Ofwat, the water regulator, that some big users are being overcharged. The rate cut for the site in north-west England takes effect next month. It could prompt other large users in England and Wales to seek reductions. Although this would be welcomed by industry as a benefit of privatisation, water companies would make up any shortfall by raising prices elsewhere, including charges to domestic users. Ofwat said ICI approached the regulator about a year ago to discuss tariffs at the site and was followed by several other big users. Gatwick airport negotiated a 25 per cent tariff reduction from East Surrey Water, which came into effect at the start of April. Tariff reductions are not automatic and big users need to show that the costs of supplying them are lower. ICI argued that it was supplied at Runcorn directly from North West Water's trunk mains rather than the more expensive household distribution network. ICI is the UK's largest industrial user of water with annual water bills of more than Pounds 20m. The North West Water agreement will save a 'substantial six-figure sum' each year, the company said. 'If these circumstances apply elsewhere, we will expect similar treatment,' said an official. ICI has been a leading critic of rising utility prices since privatisation. The company is still in discussions with the government about lower electricity prices for its Runcorn site, where its main product is chlorine. The discounts were welcomed by Ofwat as 'correcting imbalances' between water users. In the past, industrial users and owners of large properties have subsidised small domestic users. But the cuts will be attacked by water companies, under pressure to keep prices down yet improve water and sewage quality. Mr David Highet, director of communications at North West Water, warned that the lower charges for big users could mean higher bills for consumers. 'The money has to come from somewhere,' he said.

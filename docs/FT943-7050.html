			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Emap acts to meet industry rules Emap, the media concern, has sold Radio City to Radio City 1994, a holding company owned equally by Emap and Schroders, its merchant bank. The move ensures that Emap complies with industry regulations following its acquisition of Trans World Communications, the Preston-based local radio group. The Pounds 71m deal raised the number of radio licenses held by Emap from three to eight - two more than permitted. Consequently Emap and Schroders set up the holding company to allow two of the licences to be 'warehoused'. Radio City operates two local radio services - City FM and Radio City Gold in Merseyside. Consideration for Radio City was Pounds 15m of unguaranteed interest bearing loan stock, to be retained by Emap.</p>

But on what bases could an agreement between the  League and the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] be formed? At  the very most, after the elections, if the progressive forces  fail to win, there would be an agreement with Martinazzoli's  Popular Party [PPI]." Franco Bassanini swore that for the  present the PDS is not thinking about a constituent government  at all, "because we do not want it and because the conditions  for forming one do not exist. In any case, there is no question  of our joining with [Northern League Secretary] Bossi." So the  PDS is rejecting the solicitations from the League which, behind  its official statements, seems prepared to govern "with the  devil himself" as long as it can get rid of Berlusconi and have  its hands free again.    Thus the League's harsh voice became mellifluous when  [League  ideologist] Miglio addressed [PDS Secretary] Occhetto on the  subject of federalism, when the mayor of Varese said in  Strasbourg that "the League is willing to engage in dialogue  with the left if it embraces the idea of local government," when  [League lower house floor leader] Maroni spoke about an  "institutional government" in the event of none of the  alignments gaining a victory on 27 March -- that is, a  government that will enable parliament to further modify the  ground rules, to complete the "restyling" of the Constitution,  and to restore decisionmaking power to the country. In fact,  the League is not alone in thinking this way. [Pact for Italy  leader] Segni too believes that "unless a majority capable of  producing an executive is formed after the elections, the only  remaining path will be an institutional government." This is  perfectly consistent with Martinazzoli's thinking (he introduced  the idea within the context of the political debate) and with  [Senate speaker] Spadolini (who originated the idea).    But Occhetto does not seem to be allowing himself to be led  astray by the sirens, is attacking "the brokers of the old  politics" who "have set to work recently," and said that he does  not like such formulas as the "institutional government" or the  "constituent government." The PDS secretary expressed his  "amazement" that there are those who are aiming to "dispossess"  people of their votes and thus to recycle the old way of  conducting politics. Let the voters decide, Occhetto is saying,  though he too has his own "formulas" and his own kind of  government, which he calls the government "of national  reconstruction" or the "caretaker" government. On what kind of  majority would it rest if the progressive pole fails to achieve  an absolute majority? The PDS secretary did not explain this  openly, but when he says that the left will never join "with the  three cronies of the right" -- Berlusconi, [National Alliance  leader] Fini, and Bossi -- that leaves only the Pact and the PPI.    To protect himself against charges of consociationism,  Occhetto specified that "to rebuild is a national necessity, not  the same old sham of the old politics of consociation." Of  course, in an election campaign every alignment will say that it  is sure of victory: The Left is doing so, the Right is doing  so, and even the center is trying to do so. But it is equally  clear that some major maneuverings are being planned. And while  the League is doing so brazenly, the PDS and the center are  trying to avoid making it explicit, while on the Right only the  CCD [Christian Democratic Center] still professes its faith in  Berlusconi.

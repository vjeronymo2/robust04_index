			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 25 LIQUOR STORE CLERKS CITED FOR SALES TO MINORS  </P> <P> An underage Los Angeles police employee was able to buy beer at 25 of 67 liquor  stores in the northwest San Fernando Valley that were targeted in a two-day  crackdown on illegal alcohol sales, police said Saturday.  </P> <P> Two clerks were arrested on outstanding warrants and citations were issued to  the remaining store clerks who sold beer illegally to the 19-year-old police  employee during the undercover operation, Sgt. Ken Kreider said. The operation,  which included stores in Granada Hills, Northridge and Chatsworth, was  conducted Dec. 21 and Friday.  </P> <P> Selling alcohol to people under 21 years of age is a misdemeanor in California.  </P> <P> "The stores we targeted were locations that had a general reputation of making  sales to minors," Kreider said. "We got the word from direct complaints about  the sales and from previous violations."  </P> <P> An unidentified woman arrested at a Granada Hills liquor store during the  operation had an outstanding warrant from a previous arrest for selling alcohol  to a minor, Kreider said. "This is the fifth time in six months that she's sold  alcohol to a juvenile," he said. She was arrested on charges of failing to  appear at a previous court hearing on an illegal sales charge.  </P> <P> A man who also sold beer during the undercover operation was arrested on an  outstanding warrant unrelated to illegal alcohol sales, Kreider said.  </P> <P> Kreider said it will take more such undercover operations to reduce the  percentage of stores that apparently sell alcohol to minors. He said the  practice is not only illegal, but it also endangers the lives of both the  youths who consume the alcohol and of local residents.  </P> <P> "During Christmas, Easter and summer vacations, all of our available time is  consumed by the shenanigans and carrying on of young people around here who buy  alcohol and then race around in their parents' expensive sports cars," Kreider  said.  </P> <P> In a related operation, undercover officers attempted to buy ammunition from 10  area gun stores last week. But none of the clerks at the stores violated the  city ordinance that prohibits the sale of ammunition for the seven days prior  to Jan. 1. The law is an attempt to reduce the number of people who discharge  weapons into the air on New Year's Eve.  </P> <P> "We had no violators, but a couple of the stores referred us to the cities of  San Fernando and Simi Valley," Kreider said, where the ammunition sales  prohibition would not apply.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ee/bad" report: "Whatever the Land Likes Is Permitted"] </F>   [Text] The laender decide at their own discretion the  amount for which possession of hashish, heroin, cocaine, and  other drugs is not liable to punishment. DIE TAGESZEITUNG  presents on overview:    Baden-Wuerttemberg: Examination of each individual case.    In Bavaria, too, each individual case is decided. For  amounts of up to five grams of hashish, criminal prosecution can  be waived. No tolerance for hard drugs.    Berlin: Examination of each individual case. Same as in  Bavaria for cannabis products.    In Brandenburg criminal prosecution can be waived. In this  case, the "amount of drugs needed for approximately three hits"  must not be exceeded.    Bremen: The amount of hashish must not exceed a limit of 10  grams. The limit for hard drugs is three grams.    Hamburg: No information.    Hesse: Examination of each individual case. The prosecutor  general's office has issued a noncommittal recommendation that  criminal prosecution can be waived for amounts of up to 30 grams  of cannabis products and one gram of heroin.    Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: Examination of each  individual case.    Lower-Saxony: Examination of each individual case.    North Rhine-Westphalia: Up to 10 grams of hashish and up to  half a gram of heroin should not be liable for punishment as a  "small amount."    Rhineland-Palatinate: Already in January 1993 Justice  Minister Caesar introduced a Bundesrat initiative, according to  which possession of less than 20 grams of hashish and less than  100 grams of marijuana is punishable only with a fine.    Saarland: No guidelines. Criminal prosecution for the  possession of small amounts is usual only on the third  repetition. In the case of hard drugs "criminal prosecution  measures" are taken no matter what.    Saxony: Examination of each individual case.    Saxony-Anhalt: Here the Justice Ministry "decided quite  deliberately" not to give any specific amounts as a limit so as  not to limit "the leeway of the public prosecutor's office."    Schleswig-Holstein: Upper limit 30 grams of hashish; cocaine  and amphetamines up to five grams; heroin up to one gram.    Thuringia: Thuringia may be renowned for its sausages, but  relatively little is known about hashish there. Last year  police seized 300 grams all over the land. Thus, the public  prosecutor's offices have little experience. Proceedings may be  halted for amounts up to five grams. In other cases: "No soft  treatment for hard drugs."</p>

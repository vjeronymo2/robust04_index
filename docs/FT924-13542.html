			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / CBI plea to PM on Europe: Employers urge caution over re-entry to exchange rate mechanism THE Confederation of British Industry called on Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday to ensure that Britain did not risk its economic future by becoming a 'semi-detached' member of the European community. The plea, which was issued as the prime minister prepares for tomorrow's EC summit in Birmingham, was accompanied by a warning that Britain should not re-enter the European exchange rate mechanism until tensions have eased between German and British monetary policy. The CBI also emphasised that the government should do nothing to close off the option of re-entry. In a letter to Mr Major, the CBI criticised aspects of the community's development and the performance of the EC Commission, but it quoted the prime minister in contending that Britain had to remain at the heart of Europe. Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, voiced concern that any failure by Britain to ratify the Maastricht treaty would transmit the wrong signals about the country's future position in the community and damage its ability to attract critical inward investment. Sir Michael said that the Birmingham summit had to make progress on the issue of subsidiarity, which needed to be emphasised and expanded in a clear summit declaration. The powers of the Commission, he added, had to be more tightly constrained, although it also needed to ensure that member states were not able to provide financial assistance to industry through 'the back door of subsidiarity'. Sir Michael called on Mr Major to press for improvements in the way the Commission conducts its business, suggesting the wider use of green papers to ensure that the implications of proposed directives are fully understood by the business community. Sir Michael criticised the Commission for failing to enforce single market directives evenly across the community. He said CBI members resented the Commission's 'intrusive and sometimes erratic' approach to regulation and legislation, and called on Mr Major to press home measures to complete the single market, an objective that was being overlooked in the broader debate over the community's future.</p>

According to Silajdzic, "reassuring trends" emerged lately  in  many directions of a settlement in Bosnia. He said he hopes  that the Russian peace-keeping forces stationed in the area of  Bosnia's capital will continue to play a positive role and "help  Sarajevo become a symbol of peaceful coexistence between the  various ethnic groups on Bosnian territory".    The prime minister also noted "the extremely constructive  role played by the Russian government, particularly by Foreign  Minister Kozyrev and the special envoy of the Russian president,  Vitaliy Churkin, in the efforts to reach a settlement in  Bosnia." "I hope that in the future they will take an even  better-balanced stand. This will only help the process of  settlement."    The head of Russian diplomacy described his talks with  Silajdzic as a "detailed and open exchange of views concerning  the basic aspects of a settlement in Bosnia."    All the parties involved in the conflict are equally close  to  Russia, he stressed. "Russia is not only a Slavic nation, but  also one of the world's biggest Muslim countries. We strongly  oppose discriminatory approach to any of the conflicting sides,"  Kozyrev said.</p>

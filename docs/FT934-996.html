			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / French prices almost static French retail prices were virtually static last month with a rise of just 0.1 per cent, according to Insee, the state statistics institute, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The figures partly reflected the sluggish state of the French economy. The negligible rise in November's prices means that French retail price inflation has risen by a modest 2.2 per cent since the start of this year. The retail sector has come under intense strain and manufacturers in some sectors, notably food and clothing, have been forced to cut prices. Strains on the consumer sector were underlined by publication of a Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry study showing that retail sales fell in November compared with October. Hypermarkets and supermarkets were worst affected, with department stores mustering a slight rise.</p>

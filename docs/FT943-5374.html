			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Ukraine miners die in blast An explosion at a Ukrainian coal mine at the weekend killed 24 miners and left 15 injured. The mine blast in Slavyavo-Serbskaya, at the heart of Ukraine's eastern coal belt and just outside the regional capital of Lugansk, underlined the poor state of the country's coal industry, saddled with ageing pits and outdated equipment. Investigators have yet to find the cause, but methane gas was suspected. Accidents are frequent; some four miners die for every 1m tonnes of coal produced. Last year 212 miners perished in mine accidents; in 1992, an explosion in the Lugansk region killed 57 people. Ukraine's mining sector, now propped up by subsidies from Kiev, needs capital investment and layoffs to prosper in a market economy. But the Kiev government balks at such moves for fear of upsetting a fragile stability in the country's mostly Russian-speaking, over-industrialised and impoverished eastern region.</p>

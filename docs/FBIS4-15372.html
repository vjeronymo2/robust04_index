			<p>BFN     [Text] "Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov poses a danger to  the world as well as Europe because his hasty actions might turn  the Crimea into a hot spot," Nikolay Mikhalchenko, Ukrainian  president's chief adviser on domestic issues told  INTERFAX-Ukraine Thursday.    In his words, "if the situation is further destabilized in  the Crimea, the Ukrainian authorities will do their best to have  the Constitution of Ukraine respected and observed in the  Crimea."    Mikhalchenko emphasized his absolute confidence that the new  Ukrainian parliament will confirm the views of the previous one  on the Crimea.    He said that certain people in the Crimea had for months  been  trying to provoke a deterioration of Russo-Ukrainian relations.    Mikhalchenko emphasized that Ukraine had on every occasion  responded to specific violations of the Constitution and the  law, "never precipitating the events. Kiev has done nothing  that can be described as extremist or provocative."    He asked, "How can the Crimea be allowed to do what its  authorities want while the Crimean president teaches contempt of  legality to his citizens?"</p>

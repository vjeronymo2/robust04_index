			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sa'id al-Qaysi: "Secret Network Rules North </F> Yemen Using Saddam's Methods!"]    [Text] Yemen is on the threshold of war. The statement this  time was made by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's vice-president  in the General People's Congress [GPC], and it is considered to  be true by all the people in power, by observers, and by Yemenis  who are awaiting the catastrophe that is bound to happen--after  everybody has crossed the redline and reached the point of no  return; after the latest crisis has revealed behind-the-scenes  activities in the regime, the contradictions of the rulers, and  the absence of a unified authority. In this report from Sanaa,  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI reveals a [hitherto] unknown part of the  background of the conflict going on in Yemen, the part that has  played an important role in escalating this conflict and  bringing the situation to a head. It has to do with the makeup  of authority in Sanaa and the secret network built up by  President Salih--or rather, which he participated in building  up--in order to govern Yemen according to Saddam Husayn's  methods. This is being accomplished by means of a "secret  alliance" between the family and tribe that many people say  rules Yemen, that is, the al-Ahmar family, and the extremist  fundamentalist groups that have entered the arena and converted  President Salih into their hostage, whom they threaten to expel  any moment. It is known that southern Yemen is ruled by the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], but who really rules northern  Yemen, and what is the role that the fundamentalist groups and  Arab Afghans play there?    "Yemen is a country that is out of breath." Most of the  people in government and observers agree with this remark. And  there are those who are awaiting a catastrophe. This may happen  because there no longer is anything to stop it, and everybody  has crossed the redline. There is no authority. In the North,  authority is in "unknown hands," as some of the educated people  have said.    Talking about authority in Yemen is something that opens  doors to a strange world that the crisis began to reveal and  that has given it its dimensions. Everybody has come to know  what is going on and who the bosses are--the family, the tribe,  and the extremist fundamentalist groups. As for the corruption,  this is a complete world unto itself, and stories concerning it  have become regular fare at places of relaxation and  khat-chewing rooms. "Nothing is new," according to a professor  of sociology who has been in jail and does not care to go back  there.    First there is the question of who is in charge. Who rules  northern Yemen? The professor of sociology says: "We have a new  royal family in the guise of a republican cover. We have the  Bayt al-Ahmar monarchy in Yemen. Bayt al-Ahmar is one of the  villages belonging to the Sanhan tribe located not far from the  capital city of Sanaa. The al-Ahmar clan is considered to be one  of the clans of the Hashid tribe which is headed by Shaykh  'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, head of the Yemeni Chamber of  Deputies and head of the Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform  Grouping [YRG] (the political facade of the Muslim Brotherhood).    In northern Yemen, all power is in the hands of the al-Ahmar  family. The village of Bayt al-Ahmar was not known until it was  at the center of events when one of its native sons, Lt. Col.  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih al-Ahmar, took over the reins of power in  1978 after two presidents of the republic were killed in  mysterious circumstances; they were President Ibrahim al-Hamdi  and President Ahmad Husayn al-Ghashmi. From that time until  today, the al-Ahmar clan has endeavored to consolidate its power  and influence in the government, following the pattern of Saddam  Husayn in Iraq.    The important positions in the military establishment and  the  security apparatus are occupied by the president's brothers,  cousins, in-laws, and uncles--in other words, by blood  relatives--and they are followed [in the hierarchy] by the other  members of the clan. This is true in spite of the existence of  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], which has become merely a  showcase. The head of the party and president of the republic  does not trust anyone except individuals in his family and clan.  For this reason, he has placed them in the most important  military and security-related positions.    An examination of the rosters of the various commands of the  armed forces in northern Yemen shows that most of the commanders  of the brigades and units and all the management of the  (technical, operational, and financial) offices in the armed  forces and security apparatus are persons who are from the same  tribal grouping, that is, Sanhan.    If anyone from any other tribal grouping occupies any of  these positions, then he is at least from Hashid, the overall  mother tribe.  <H5>  Rule by Bayt al-Ahmar </H5>   One notices that Bayt al-Ahmar, the birthplace of the  president, accounts for the lion's share of the top positions,  in fact, about 48 percent of them. Bayt al-Ahmar is then  followed by the villages of Sayyan, Wadi Silmok, al-Jarda', and  al-Dhanin. We find that Bayt al-Ahmar and four of its  neighboring villages account for most of the top positions, that  is, 22 of them, and this constitutes about 70 percent of the  total. Consequently, we can say that many of the other villages  inhabited by people belonging to the Sanhan clan do not enjoy  the confidence of the president. In addition to this, no  effective military command position is occupied by anyone from  the Bakil tribe, which is Yemen's largest tribe that follows the  Zaydi school of Islam, as do the Hashid tribes. Also, the areas  of Ma'rib, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, al-Bayda', and Ibb, whose people  follow the Shafi'i school of Islam, have no presence in the  power structure.    The following is a list of persons who occupy the top  positions:    Col. Muhammad 'Abdallah Salih al-Ahmar--the president's  brother, commander of the central security units, which are  deployed throughout Yemen's cities.    Col. 'Ali Salih 'Abdallah al-Ahmar--the president's  half-brother by his mother, commander of the Republican Guard  which is composed of 30,000 highly-trained soldiers armed with  various modern advanced weapons.    Col. Muhammad Salih 'Abdallah al-Ahmar--the president's  half-brother by his mother, commander of the Air Force and Air  Defense Forces.    Col. 'Ali Salih Ahmad Muhsin al-Ahmar--the president's  half-brother by his mother, commander of the artillery units in  the Governorate of Sanaa.    Col. Muhammad Ahmad Isma'il al-Ahmar--the president's  brother-in-law, commander of the 8th Brigade and commander of  the troops stationed in the east.    Col. Muhammad 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar--relative of the  president, deputy commander of the air defense affairs [branch]  of the Air Force.    Col. 'Ali Muhsin Salih al-Ahmar--relative of the president,  commander of the 1st Armored Division (Sanaa).    Col. 'Abd-al-Malik Ahmad al-Sayyani--from the village of  Sayyan (Sanhan), chief of the general staff.    Col. 'Ali Ahmad al-Sayyani--from the village of Sayyan  (Sanhan), chief of military intelligence.    Col. 'Ali 'Ali al-Sayyani--from the village of Sayyan  (Sanhan), commander of the 1st Missile Brigade.    The list is long, and clearly indicates what the power  structure is.    However, what about the regime's activity as related to  terrorism, a matter which many people, both inside and outside  Yemen, are talking about?    "Fundamentalist terrorism," in particular, intensified  rapidly around the end of 1991, that is, after unification, and  it has targeted the YSP and the opposition parties. However,  since the end of 1992, investigations have begun to reveal the  links of the terrorist fundamentalist groups, particularly after  the attempt to assassinate 'Ali Salih 'Abbad, nicknamed "the  Next One" [al-muqbil], who is a member of the Political Bureau  of the YSP, and the explosions which targeted the Aden Hotel.  The investigation revealed that the organization responsible was  the Islamic Jihad movement, which is considered to be the  military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, led by Shaykh  'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, the strong man in the Reform Party,  who is also a member of the Presidential Council, the highest  body of authority in Yemen.  <H5>  Weapons from Somalia and Sudan </H5>   According to official information, the Reform Party  constitutes the political facade of the Muslim Brotherhood  movement, which has been historically linked to Egypt since the  sixties. However, starting in 1988, the movement began to  change. It was restructured, by means of the creation of a  military wing, during the war in Afghanistan. A total of 100  soldiers were sent to Afghanistan to participate in the war and  to train, and Sanaa has become the gathering point for a number  of young Arabs who fought with the freedom- fighters in  Afghanistan. In Sanaa they were supplied with official papers  and travel tickets, and the main financier of these operations  was one of the tribal leaders.    After [the war in] Afghanistan, the power struggles began.  Several groups emerged, one of which was led by Yasin  'Abd-al-'Aziz, a Shafi'i from Ma'rib who is not a bloody type  and is not allied with the power structure. There is also a  group known as the "Party of Iran," since most of its members  regularly travel to Tehran.    In Sanaa, the "Arab Afghans" enjoy great freedom, live in  "villas" in wealthy residential neighborhoods such as Hiddah  [name as transliterated], which is where 'Abd-al-Majid  al-Zandani's residence is, and they have offices on Hiddah's  main street. Usually the "Arab Afghans" engage in political  activity in Sanaa and go there to rest before returning to their  training camps located near the city of Sa'dah, in the far  north, in the Ma'rib area, and in the Maraqishah mountains on  the [former] border between the North and the South, near the  southern Governorate of Shabwah. These camps are financed by the  Reform Party and a wealthy Yemeni living in Khartoum whose name  is Usamah Bin-Ladin and who is a friend of Shaykh al-Zandani.    Reports indicate that the terrorist groups have strong ties  to the military commanders, especially the brigade and unit  commanders, since the groups are transported in military  vehicles. Some of the military commanders are directly  responsible for some of the actions of terrorism. There is, for  example, the officer Salih Dahmash, who is in charge of a cell  in the southern Governorate of Abyan. He works under the command  of Col. Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander of the armored division, who  is the regime's strong man. Their weapons are transported in  boats from Somalia and Sudan. Some of them go to the coastline  of southern Yemen, and the rest are transported to the eastern  coastline of Egypt on the Red Sea.    Official sources indicate that the fundamentalist groups  have  become so strong that they are threatening the regime of 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih. One person close to the president says that the  problem is a very grave one, since these groups have capitalized  on the crisis and have contributed toward inflaming the  situation for the purpose of undertaking a palace coup and  replacing the president with somebody else in his family who is  from the Hashid tribe. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice-president and  secretary general of the YSP, says only that more than one  Lockerbie-type of terrorist operation is being hatched in Yemen.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: LTV to sell defence side to Lockheed and Marietta LTV, the steel group which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy since 1986, has agreed in principle to sell its aircraft and missiles businesses to a newly-formed company jointly owned by defence contractors Lockheed and Martin Marietta. LTV put its defence businesses up for auction in May last year as part of its plan to reorganise its finances and emerge from bankruptcy. A joint venture bid by rival aerospace companies is unusual and some analysts argue it could form a precedent others could follow as the US defence industry enters a period of consolidation. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but the joint venture is believed to have offered over Dollars 350m for the business, which employs 16,000 people and has sales of Dollars 2bn. Other companies believed to have been interested in all or parts of the group include Thomson of France. The deal is still subject to bankruptcy court approval and it is possible rival bidders could put in a fresh offer. The LTV business makes missiles for the Pentagon's strategic defence initiative and is also involved in the fabrication of large parts for the C-17 military transport and Boeing civilian aircraft. Lockheed yesterday reported fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 103m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, up 4 per cent from the Dollars 99m, or Dollars 1.57, in the same period of 1990. Sales dipped 7 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn. Operating profits from the missiles and space sector dipped from Dollars 110m to Dollars 88m, while technological services fell from Dollars 15m to Dollars 9m and electronic systems from Dollars 15m to Dollars 13. But aeronautical systems profits rose from Dollars 41m to Dollars 75m. Full-year net earnings were Dollars 308m, or Dollars 4.86 a share, on sales of Dollars 9.8bn, compared with Dollars 335m, or Dollars 5.30, on sales of Dollars 9.9bn. Mr Dan Tellep, chairman, noted that non-Department of Defence revenues rose from 26 to 30 per cent of the total and he expected this trend to continue.</p>

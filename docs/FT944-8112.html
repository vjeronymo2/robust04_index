			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Mieno dismisses fears over offshore output The shift of Japanese manufacturing capacity offshore in recent years does not threaten Japan's long-term industrial performance, the outgoing governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr Yasushi Mieno, said yesterday. It merely reflects an emerging division of labour within Asia, and as such, is even a healthy development, he declared in an interview. 'The movement of production offshore is a reaction primarily to the rapid industrialisation of Asia which is creating a division of labour between basic industrial work and high-technology, highly-skilled jobs. The changes would ensure growth prospects would improve for all countries, including Japan. Japanese industry would be 'upgraded' as it focused more on the sophisticated sectors where it is most competitive. Business and labour groups have expressed concern that the movement of Japanese investment to the rest of Asia represents an industrial 'hollowing out' that will reduce Japan's long-term employment and growth prospects. 'I disagree with the view that the new division of labour will reduce the potential rate of growth in the Japanese economy. The dynamism of the economy has enabled the country to overcome difficulties in the past and will do so again.' Mr Mieno, who retires next month, reviewed his five-year term, among the most turbulent in the bank's 100-year history, marked by policies aimed first at bursting the 'bubble' of rapid increases in asset prices at the end of the 1980s, then at reviving the economy from the ensuing slump. The central bank's main challenge remained the task of restoring soundness to the financial system as it continued to be burdened by bad debts, accumulated by the collapse of asset prices in the early 1990s, Mr Mieno said. The current trend of falling wholesale and retail prices stemmed from three developments: declining asset prices, the high yen's impact on import prices, and changes in the distribution system that were reducing business costs. A risk existed import prices might have a deflationary effect in the short term, but in the longer term, if the commitment to deregulation was maintained, lower prices and costs would benefit producers. He addressed concerns that Japan was losing financial business to other capital markets because of its rigid regulatory environment. Part of the explanation was purely cyclical, linked to the weakness of Japan's economy in the past few years and the reaction to the 'bubble' years. But 'I have to admit room exists to open further domestic financial markets, particularly by improving the ease with which foreigners and Japanese have access to capital markets.' He identified several measures which should be taken to improve Tokyo's attractiveness, including faster deregulation and improvements to the financial infrastructure, especially Tokyo's archaic settlements systems. If those measures were taken, Tokyo would continue its strong role as an international financial centre. Mr Mieno repeated his pleas for the central bank's greater independence, a theme of his governorship. He expected his successor, Mr Yasuo Matsushita, to share his view it was time to change the legislation governing the relationship between the bank and the Finance Ministry. The growing links between individual countries' monetary systems 'made it more important than ever for each country to pursue policy aimed at maintaining its own economic stability.'</p>

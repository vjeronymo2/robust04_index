			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RELFECTIONS: 'THIS IS A VERY BASIC LEVEL OF CHANGING THE WORLD THAT I'M WORKING  ON'  </P> <P> Every day is Valentine's Day for Andrea Brae. In a season devoted to tinsel and  bows, Brae has her office decorated with hearts and cherubs. The  thirtysomething native of Ohio is a professional matchmaker and founder of  Soulmates in La Jolla. Brae, a former reporter for the Cincinnati Post, started  her matchmaking career in San Diego 10 years ago by publishing a dating  magazine for senior citizens. Seeing the need for hands-on matchmaking, Brae  started Soulmates. Now, she boasts a client list of 1,500 men and women, and  says about 75% of the singles who come to her end up walking down the aisle.  Times staff writer Caroline Lemke interviewed Brae at Soulmates in La Jolla  Village Square, and Bruce K. Huff photographed her.  </P> <P>  When I moved out here, I wanted to do something that would make a  contribution, so I started publishing "Sweet and Sexy Seniors." After about  four years of publishing this magazine, I realized if I was going to be a  philanthropist and really change the world, I needed to take better care of  myself.  </P> <P> So I stopped everything I was doing and for a month really thought about what I  wanted to do. I decided my seniors weren't totally pleased with personal ads  because it's a real shotgun approach to finding a partner, so I became a  matchmaker for them, and I had outrageous success. I had lots of people getting  married.  </P> <P> I'm an Aquarian, and I've got this real sense of responsibility about the  world. I'm here to make the world a better place. My moon is in Libra, which  means I'm very interested in partnerships and romance.  </P> <P> I have a great deal of compassion for people. I cry frequently in interviews  when people tell me about their lives.  </P> <P> I'm very romantic and deeply need myself to be in a love relationship for my  own grounding, so that gives me a great deal of sympathy for people who are  not.  </P> <P> This is not about getting dates for people. What we do at Soulmates is  personal, professional matchmaking, which is very different from a dating  service.  </P> <P> Dating services for the most part are involved with computers and video and  photographs so, once the client is enrolled, there's no real personal service.  </P> <P> The first thing I do is handpick two people based on all the criteria they give  me. I go through hundreds of client files and I pull out a file I think is the  most appropriate match.  </P> <P> I don't think there is any substitute for the intuitive knowing of people, and  I have personally interviewed all of our clients so I have a million percent  sense of the client.  </P> <P> It's like a little light goes off in my head. At night, I'll be in bed and I'll  be thinking about a client and I'll get a sense, "Oh my goodness, this is going  to be exciting! I've got to introduce these two people."  </P> <P> We want to take these people who are committed and who want to find their  soulmate and who are expedient and intentional about that and take that  innocence and enthusiasm and reward that as quickly as possible rather than  have them run around the mulberry bush.  </P> <P> The problem with meeting people on your own is that you know nothing about that  individual, and then you get into a relationship and find out certain things  that, if you knew up front, you would never have gotten involved.  </P> <P> I save people years of running around the mulberry bush.  </P> <P> My vision is the most important thing. There was a time when I had $10 a week  for food money, when the phone was about to be disconnected, and I couldn't  afford to pay my printing costs.  </P> <P> But I really believe in myself, despite anything else to the external that  says, "You can't make it. You can't do this."  </P> <P> The world needs professional matchmakers. We'd have fewer divorces, happier  marriages, happy children and a happier society.  </P> <P> This is a very basic level of changing the world that I'm working on, but I  know it makes a difference.  </P></p>

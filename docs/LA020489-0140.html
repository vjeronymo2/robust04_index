			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE JUDGE: CLEARING GHOSTS OF CREDIT PAST  </P> <P> Q. For several years, as the sole support of my children, my income was not  enough to meet our needs, resulting in late payments to creditors. I never  defaulted on anything -- never had anything repossessed and now, what is not  paid off entirely is at least current.  </P> <P> My income has more than doubled in the last five years, and all I want is a  credit card so that I can write checks without a hassle -- and I can't get one.  How long will I have to pay for a previously poor credit history?  </P> <P> J.L.  </P> <P> Tustin  </P> <P> A. Both the federal government and California regulate consumer credit  reporting agencies. It is a little unclear from your letter, but it appears  that your poor credit rating is due to late payments which resulted in  collection. If this is the case, those delinquent accounts will appear on your  credit report for seven years either under the federal or the California law.  If your late payments caused your creditors to sue you and/or obtain a judgment  against you, these facts would appear on your credit report for 7 years or for  the period that a lawsuit could be filed against you, which ever is longer,  under both laws.  </P> <P> As you know, the ultimate decision as to whether you will obtain a credit card  is with the institution issuing it. You might contact the one whose credit card  you desire and find out what would you would have to do to qualify.  </P> <P> Q. My husband and I separated in February of 1986. He filed for divorce but it  isn't final yet. My husband has still not filed a 1985 tax return. I have filed  a single return for every year after 1985 but I understand that I am still  liable for the 1985 tax return as much as he. I wasn't working during 1985 and  I don't have his records or information to file an accurate single return.  </P> <P> I paid a $1,000 security deposit to the owners of the condo I am renting. They  placed the deposit into an interest-bearing account in their names but with my  Social Security number as tax ID. Can the IRS take that money?  </P> <P> M.J.  </P> <P> Tustin  </P> <P> A. Yes, the IRS could attach the $1,000 since your are still being identified  as having an interest in it through the use of your tax ID.  </P> <P> You should really attempt to protect yourself from any further liability for  his 1985 tax return. I would suggest that you contact the IRS Taxpayer Service  which could assist you in the preparation of a "married but filing as a  separate person" tax return. The Taxpayer Service phone number is toll free:  1-800-642-1040. Good luck!  </P> <P> Got a question for Judge Nomoto?

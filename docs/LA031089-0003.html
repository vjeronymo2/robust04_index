			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEED FOR NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY  </P> <P> Congratulations for your editorial. You are so correct, and the public does not  realize that companies cannot drill and produce oil in a short period of time.  I believe it was something like 10 years before Exxon was able to produce oil  from the Santa Barbara area after the discovery. And still everyone says "don't  drill off our shores." Anyone who has driven along the coast highway can attest  to the fact that there is nothing unsightly about the platforms out there. And  it is a proven fact, from the gulf areas, that the best fishing is near and  around the producing platforms.  </P> <P> People should be made to understand that it is in the interest of our national  security to find as much oil as possible, and all geologist think that the best  chances to find something big lie off the California and northern Alaska  coasts.  </P> <P> ROBERT L.

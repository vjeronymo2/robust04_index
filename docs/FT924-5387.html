			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Queen will start to pay income tax from April: Decision seen as move towards a smaller, European-style monarchy QUEEN ELIZABETH II has heralded the most sweeping reform of the British monarchy since her accession 40 years ago by agreeing to pay income tax and to support financially all but three members of her family. Her decision amounts to a move towards a smaller continental European-style monarchy. It was announced by Mr John Major just two days after the Queen hinted that she recognised public dissatisfaction over the cost - and behaviour - of her family. The prime minister said the move came at her initiative. The Queen is said to be the richest woman in the world with investments alone estimated at Pounds 50m. From next April she will pay tax on her private income at the 40 per cent top rate. She will probably also pay inheritance and capital gains tax - but under arrangements still to be decided because normally her wealth could be wiped out on her death. Discussions are taking place between the Treasury, the Inland Revenue and the Royal Household before a fuller statement early next year. The Prince of Wales is likely to pay more tax on income from the Duchy of Cornwall. After escaping paying the poll tax, the Queen will pay the council tax on her Sandringham and Balmoral homes. From next year only the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh will be paid incomes out of the 'civil list' voted by parliament. At present the Queen receives Pounds 7.9m, the Queen Mother Pounds 643,000 and the Duke of Edinburgh Pounds 359,000 from the civil list. The salaries drawn by five other members of the royal family will be reimbursed to the public purse. Buckingham Palace said the five - the Queen's three younger children, her sister Princess Margaret, and her 90-year-old aunt Princess Alice - will go on performing public duties. Although the Inland Revenue will keep details of royal finances secret, as for any taxpayer, and even though taxes were paid by Queen Victoria, George V and Edward VII, the move marks a watershed for the monarchy. It was seen at Westminster as an attempt to restore the monarchy's reputation after, in the Queen's words, an annus horribilis dominated by rumours about royal marriages and rows over its extravagance. The political debate over who should pay to restore the fire-damaged Windsor Castle may have led to the changes being announced. Moreover, the Queen, in whose name the Inland Revenue collects taxes has become liable herself. Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West, said she could have created an extra 25 jobs for tax inspectors at the Inland Revenue's high-security unit in Cardiff. The announcement came in pre-scripted exchanges in the Commons between Mr Major and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who had been briefed on Tuesday. Mr Smith asked the prime minister if, 'in view of the evident public concern', he had had discussions with the Queen about her finances. Mr Major replied that 'affection and respect' for the monarch were widespread and the sovereign was not liable to pay tax on her personal income. 'But Her Majesty some months ago, before the summer recess, indicated to me that she wished consideration to be given to changing these arrangements.' The Queen will not be taxed on sums voted by MPs to cover costs of items such as royal flights and trains, which totalled Pounds 57m last year. But she will pay tax on private income from the Duchy of Lancaster. The Prince of Wales already pays tax on his private income and voluntarily contributes 25 per cent of income from the Duchy of Cornwall.

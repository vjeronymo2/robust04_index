			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Keating acts to shore up economy YESTERDAY'S one percentage point cut in Australia's official interest rates to 7.5 per cent is a result of government determination to shore up confidence in the country's flagging economy. Short-term interest rates have now fallen by 10.5 percentage points since peaking at 18 per cent in January 1990. The reduction was expected following the appointment of Mr Paul Keating as prime minister last month, after he defeated Mr Bob Hawke in a battle for the leadership of the ruling Labor Party. Mr Keating argued during his leadership campaign for a more relaxed monetary policy to help the economy recover from the two years of contraction that has pushed unemployment to a 10.5 per cent post-war record. The size of the cut was limited by a deterioration in the balance of payments in November, when the current account deficit jumped to ADollars 1.7bn (Pounds 700m) seasonally adjusted, from around ADollars 1.4bn in the previous two months. Short-term bond rates remained below the official rate last night, indicating confidence that the government would announce a further cut of up to one percentage point in the next few weeks. Economists said the scope for further cuts was limited by the re-emergence of a balance of payments constraint on growth, and the weakness of the Australian dollar, trading at about 75.77 US cents in Sydney last night, against over 80 cents in September. Political pressure for a further relaxation of monetary policy is likely to grow if unemployment figures due today show the economy is still shedding jobs. Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, said the interest rate cut was 'an appropriate response to the weakness in the economy' which would 'assist in reviving confidence'. But the government is pinning hopes on an economic statement to be made by Mr Keating in late February or early March, following consultations with business and trade union leaders. Mr Dawkins said the government had some scope for a relaxation of fiscal policy without imperiling the federal budget, expected to be about ADollars 8.5bn in deficit this year but expected to return to surplus when the economy recovers.</p>

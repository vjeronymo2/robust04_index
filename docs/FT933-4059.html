			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keeping time with kinetic energy Twenty-five years after the launch of the first quartz wristwatch, Japanese manufacturer Seiko has launched the first quartz watch to work on kinetic energy. Instead of the traditional battery the watch is powered by the movement of the wearer. Sitting behind the watch face is a semi-circular rotor, which rotates with the movement of the wrist. This is attached to a motion-powered generator, smaller than the head of a match, which can generate up to 2.5 volts of electricity. A microprocessor ensures that the quartz crystal receives the required one-volt supply, and despatches the surplus power to a capacitor, where it is stored for up to a week. Three minutes of activity will generate enough energy to power the watch for five hours. Ten hours of normal activity will power the watch for three days. At up to Pounds 200 each, the range of 10 watches is targeted at the top 5 per cent of watch wearers. Seiko: UK, 0628 770001.</p>

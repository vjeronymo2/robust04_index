			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ansar Abbasi] </F>   [Text] Islamabad: There was unanimity among the speakers at  a seminar on "Pakistan's Nuclear Option" that the nuclear  programme is a deterrent, essential for the country's security,  and so it should not be rolled back, frozen or capped, otherwise  the country could face serious threats from outside.    The seminar, which was organised by the Institute of Policy  Studies, asked whether the fact that Pakistan has made a nuclear  device should be declared to the world or should be kept vague.    Those who enlightened the audience included: the former  Joint GOAS, General (Retd) K M Arif; the director general of  ISI, Lt General (Retd) Asad Durranl; the former federal minister  and ambassador to Washington, Abida Hussain; Senator Khuralud;  Dr Tahir Amin and a former ambassador, Dr S M Koreshi.    The speakers were also united in the belief that nuclear  non-  proliferation would be welcomed if it were universal, but any  selective application of the principle should never be accepted.    Without going into controversies concerning who capped the  programme, General K M Arif said the important question to ask  was, why was it capped? What was the aim? Was it done to get  US aid or to get the Pressler Amendment scappred?    General (Retd) Asad Durrani said ambivalence is better than  declaration because declaration would diminish the effectiveness  of the threat. He said the Pakistani nuclear threat was based  on assumption.    The retired general said that India believes that we have  the  capability and the will to use it. He said the enemy is  hesitant about launching a crackdown in occupied Kashmir because  of this deterrent.    If one side, he said, is conventionally weaker than the  other  side, it must rely on the strength of deterence. A genuine  deterrent, he said, would function at every level-both  conventional and nuclear.    Durrani said that the US linkage of Pakistan's nuclear  programme with that of India has helped in many ways. The  negative effect, he said, would be if India agreed to  denucle-arise its capability. Then Pakistan would have to give  up its deterrent, and that would leave Pakistan on an unequal  level with India's conventional weapons.    Syed Abida Hussain said that during her tenure as ambassador  to Washington she went through a very strange and rather  humiliating experience. She said the peosple in the US are very  crude, and they don't care for others, especially those who are  useless for them.    She said she landed in the US with the idea that the US was  Pakistan's friend, as they jointly struggled against the Soviet  Union for Afghanistan, but for the US Afghanistan has already  become history.    During her stay in Washington she said, she suffered severe  criticism and hatred of Pakistan and the Muslim countries.    North Korea, Pakistan and Kazakhstan are three countries  which are the constant target of their criticism in this regard.  The other thing she experienced there was that the Americans  used the terminology of Muslim "fundamentalists," militants and  "the Muslim threat."    Dr Tahir Amin, professor of international relations at  Quaid-e Azam University, said was between Pakistan and India had  been averted on several occasions because of the nuclear  deterrent.    He raised three very important questions. Why are  governments in Pakistan weak, and why do they compromise on  national issues? What is the extent of American penetration in  Pakistan? And what changes have taken place in the world, and  what will their implications on Pakistan be?    He said the national interest is defined by a small military  bureaucratic elite which is approached by outsiders, and they  always compromise the national interest defined by themselves.  He said no political government has the capacity to with stand  such pressures.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Trizec in CDollars 300m share issue TRIZEC, North America's biggest publicly traded real estate developer, is raising between CDollars 200m (USDollars 166.6m) and CDollars 300m of new equity through a private placement of common shares. The issue will be a considerable achievement at a time when investors are extremely wary of providing either debt or equity to property companies. Trizec, which is based in Calgary, did not disclose which institutions were buying the shares, but acknowledged that CDollars 50m will be taken up by its parent, Carena. Both companies are controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family. Olympia &amp; York Developments, which is now under court protection in Canada and the UK, has a 35 per cent stake in Trizec. Mr Kevin Benson, president, said the share issue was considerably larger than originally contemplated, but was raised to meet two large orders. The shares are being sold at CDollars 4.50 each, about a third of where they stood a year ago. Trizec shares lost 15 cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday to CDollars 4.70. The private placement is expected to close on June 19. The company will use some of the funds to reduce its CDollars 9bn debt load. Trizec has been called on several times in the past year to support its ailing subsidiary, Bramalea, which has debts of CDollars 4.8bn.</p>

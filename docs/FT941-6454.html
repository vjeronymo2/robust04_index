			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Israel begins freeing prisoners Israel began freeing 500 Palestinian prisoners yesterday, offered compensation to Palestinian victims, and said up to 100 Jewish settlers would be disarmed, as the government stepped up gestures to win back the PLO to peace talks after last Friday's Hebron mosque massacre. PLO leaders in the occupied territories said the gestures were insufficient, but Israeli ministers said the Jewish state would not meet all PLO demands. These include the disarmament of all 120,000 settlers and the dismantling of some of the more extremist settlements such as Kiryat Arba, the 6,000-strong Jewish community just outside Hebron where Dr Baruch Goldstein, who carried out last Friday's massacre, lived. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Israel would prevent the movement of extremist settlers into some sensitive areas, allow an unarmed international force to be deployed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for a short period, and increase the Palestinian police force for Gaza-Jericho from 8,000 to 10,000. But it rejected PLO demands for even tougher measures against the settlers and settlements. Palestinian leaders said Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, would have to stay away from direct peace talks with Israel for at least two to four weeks, to assuage outrage at the Hebron massacre. As the prisoner release got under way, clashes erupted for a fourth day throughout the occupied territories; Gen Ehud Barak, Chief of Staff, said the army was expecting a wave of revenge attacks from Palestinians which it could not prevent completely. In Hebron and surrounding areas, a 24-hour curfew on Palestinians was relaxed, but black flags of mourning remained on many homes. Relatives of the victims of last Friday's bloodbath vowed to take revenge on Jewish settlers.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Observer: From Gotcha to Gandhi He's taken tea with the Indian president; conversed with finance minister Manmohan Singh; brought chaos to Delhi's jammed roads; and posed for several front-page photos with his wife. Who he? Why, Rupert Murdoch, of course. What brings him to town? Satellite TV seems to be the answer; with China out of bounds, India is his Star TV's biggest market. A 10-day visit has seen him glad-hand a host of India's top movers and shakers. It may be a private trip, but the Aussie-born media mogul has overshadowed the state visit of Czech president Vaclav Havel, in India to get the Indira Gandhi Award for Peace, Development and Disarmament. Havel is a head of state, but the local media is keener on featuring the man who gave the world such classic newspaper headlines as 'Up yours, Delors'. Still not everyone was taken in. One paper wrote 'Murdoch probably needs India more than India needs Murdoch'. The length of his stay suggests there may be some truth in this verdict.</p>

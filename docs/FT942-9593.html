			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / The heights of fear - 'I knew one slip would result in certain death': Arnie Wilson was seduced into skiing down a remote and treacherous slope in the Alps. But he found himself exploring his own reserves of courage I was afraid. Stranded like a disorientated mountain goat on the edge of a snowy chasm, I looked down on the most magnificent of the Alps. Even Mont Blanc seemed to be below me. But I was too frightened to enjoy the spectacle. Opposite, spring avalanches thundered at regular intervals off the sun-baked shoulders and flanks of the mighty Meije and its glacier. In a strangely detached way, I knew that one slip on this traverse would result in certain death. I have skied in dangerous places before, but this was new. Below me - I could not resist looking down - was an impossibly steep gulley which fell away almost vertically to who knows where. I pictured myself tumbling hopelessly, down and down, bouncing off one cliff after another until I reached a frozen grave thousands of feet below Le Rateau, next to La Meije. La Meije (13,061 ft or nearly 4,000m), with its vast glacial terrain, was the last main peak to be climbed in Europe. Even Edward Whymper, the first conqueror of the Matterhorn, failed to climb La Meije, which rears up in fearsome splendour above the climbing village of La Grave and the spectacular Col du Lautaret. La Grave, in France, is no ordinary ski resort. It is 7,000 vertical feet (2,130m) of ungroomed, steep and spectacular terrain whose upper reaches are crossed by ice walls and crevasses, some of them more than 200 metres deep. I had come here as part of the FT round the world ski expedition, a madcap journey on which my companion, Lucy Dicker, and I are attempting to ski every day of 1994. A guide at La Grave is highly desirable. But perhaps not a guide who seduces you into exploring your own threshold of fear; perhaps not a guide such as Olivier Laborie, who takes the stronger skiers among clients of Ski Peak, a Surrey-based tour operator, on off-piste adventures. Few, if any of them, would relish the situation in which I found myself. It would be a quick death. I wondered what sort of sound I should make. A scream would be undignified. Silence would be better. I had studied the descent earlier in the day when Laborie had mentioned, more than once, with a glint in his eye, that the Pan de Rideau (Side of the Curtain) was a 'special run' which I would enjoy skiing with him. But was I good enough to ski it, I asked him? Would it be curtains for me if I fell. 'You'll be OK,' he said. 'You have a good mind.' By that, it turned out, he meant I did not panic. 'There is only one place where you must not fall.' Whenever a mountain guide says this to me, a frisson of fear chills my spine. Yet I know from many guided off-piste adventures in the mountains that sometimes a short, risky and heart-stopping section of terrain is the 'entrance fee' you must pay for the most sublime and exciting skiing. I had skied with Laborie before, a year earlier. So he knew I could not resist a challenge. But this was more than a challenge. This was coming face to face with the inner demons which haunt all skiers who mix skiing with mountaineering. And this time there were just the two of us: the supremely fit, confident young mountain guide, with everything from pulleys and tackle (for crevasse rescues) to ice axe, pitons and karabiners in his rucksack, and the 50-year-old, overweight, over-ambitious recreational skier suddenly beyond the limit of his competence. From below, I had seen a huge hole punched high in the rock face beside a vast and steep snowfield. Olivier had assured me: 'We will try to ski in the shade where the snow will be fantastic.' The terrifying traverse on which I now stood was above two or three precipitous couloirs which merged into a sheer gulley hundreds of feet below. To get to the Pan de Rideau (not that I will ever go again) you must climb in deep snow for perhaps half an hour from the Glacier du Vallon to the Col des Trifides. From here you look down, past a column of rock that juts out like a giant finger from the col, at what seems to be every peak in the Alps. Then you see the route Olivier wants you to take. Sweat from the heat of the climb was followed by cold sweat. Just as a leap of two or three feet seems easy when you are only a foot from the ground, the traverse from the Col des Trifides would, elsewhere, be merely awkward. 'I don't like the look of this Olivier,' I said. 'You don't have to do it,' he replied. 'But it will be all right. I don't want to die either.' Somehow I could not refuse. To reach the curtain, you must side-step gingerly down for five feet before reaching the traverse. Then progress is a matter of beating down the snow with your skis and making a platform before edging forward. Every now and then your eyes are drawn to the cliffs below. I was half way along the traverse and becoming more and more apprehensive when Olivier looked at me, concerned, and asked: 'Would you like me to rope you?' He had roped me - and the rest of the group - last year when we were descending the first part of the Viol couloir above the French resort of Alpe d'Huez, where a fall could be fatal. Indeed, the wealthy client of a prominent local guide fell to his death there a few weeks ago. The two of us were now teetering on the brink while he struggled to get the rope round my girth without either of us falling. Then he half skied and half climbed to the largest rock he could find and after instructing me to 'stay there' (I had no wish to move) began to drive in a piton. (It was an old Simond piton worth approximately 15 French francs and manufactured in the rather more famous climbing town of Chamonix, I discovered later.) After a few minutes, I began to wish I was on the move again. Anything was better than standing motionless on the edge of the abyss. As Olivier hammered, the sound was so clear that I thought it must carry all the way to Lucy, who - armed with our video camera - was awaiting our descent in the shelter of a huge rock on the glacier floor more than 1,000ft below. Knowing she was watching our drama unfold made the whole thing even more unnerving. Having secured the rope through a karabiner, which he attached to the piton, Olivier skied back to a point where the traverse disappeared into unknown territory around the corner. 'There's one thing you can do]' he shouted, almost as an afterthought. 'Double the rope up and push it through the piton. Retrieve the karabiner and then take the loop you have pushed through and you can lower yourself back to the traverse.' This was madness. What did I know of karabiners - snap-links used to connect ropes to pitons, which are metal spikes hammered into rocks? These were the impediments of climbers, not skiers. They were completely alien and frightening to me. They spoke of people who actually enjoy being suspended over vertiginous drops. Anyway, why did he want his wretched karabiner back? Surely it was not the expense of buying a new one? Might he want to use it again to keep me from falling? I would have happily bought him half a dozen karabiners instead of having to climb - still on my skis - three feet up to the rock to retrieve it before lowering myself back to the fearful perch I had just left. The rope would not go through the piton. I was reminded of the horror story I had read in The White Spider, a history of the ascents of the North face of the Eiger in which the sole survivor of a disastrous attempt on the summit had survived a freezing night hanging on to the mountain, before climbing down to the frozen corpse of his nearest colleague to make use of his rope - only to discover with his dying breath that when he knotted the extra rope to his, the knot would not pass through the karabiner. I tried again, and this time I managed to force the rope through. Totally inexperienced in climbing, I was now in slightly more control of my destiny. If I had fallen without my rope being threaded through the piton, Olivier was confident that he could have held me, and I believed him. But at least for the moment I would be spared the anguish of swinging across the slope like a pendulum before he rescued me. I retrieved the karabiner and then inched - no, centimetred - my way back to the traverse, and shuffled forward, slightly more confident now that I was closing the gap. At last I was round the corner, to be confronted with what we had really come for: the snowfield. It was steeper than anything I had imagined or ever skied. Olivier said later that the slope was 'almost 50 degrees, but not quite'. There was only one more psychological obstacle (or so I thought) to be overcome. At the bottom of the snowfield, 150 metres below, were more rocks. I wanted to traverse to a point where - if I fell - there were no hard objects to ski into. In spite of the steepness, traversing here was much easier. The snow was deeper, and there were no yawning couloirs to swallow you up. 'Don't worry,' said Olivier. 'Here you can fall without danger.' The slope was so steep that when I made my first turn, my shoulder and backside pushed through the snow. 'You must face down the slope the whole time,' said Oliver. I thought I had been. Every time I turned, he waited directly below me. 'I will catch you if you fall,' he said. 'Be careful at the bottom. There is huge crevasse - a rimee,' (a crevasse that forms between the end of a glacier and the rock face immediately below it). 'I thought you said I could fall here without being in danger,' I said, alarmed again. 'Ah' said Olivier. 'If you fall here you will be travelling so fast you will slide right across the crevasse instead of falling into it]'                         *      *      * At last we were out of danger. I was going to live. In front of us were thousands of feet of supreme powder. The sun was shining as brightly as ever. Even though the climb, the fear and the snowfield had exhausted me so much that I hardly had the strength to enjoy the vast fields of powder, it was wonderful to have emerged unscathed. And Olivier was right. From now on the skiing was ecstatic. I tumbled three or four times in the deep, sparkling powder. Both Olivier and I shouted in the direction of the rock where we had arranged to meet Lucy. Our voices echoed emptily among the moraines and seracs. Fearing the worst as the sun had begun to go down, Lucy had found her way - without a guide - down to the first stage of the gondola lift to raise the alarm, then - carrying her skis - walked the difficult, boulder-strewn and boggy terrain back to La Grave. There, the manager of the telepherique, armed with strong binoculars, had spotted Olivier and me making our way back through green fields carpeted with crocuses. From half a mile away, I waved at Lucy and she waved back. We were pleased to see each other. Over a beer in the Castillan Hotel bar, I asked Olivier how often he took clients down the Pan de Rideau. 'You were the first,' he said. 'I like to push clients beyond their normal limits.' Meanwhile, high above the Glacier du Vallon, a cheap French piton hammered into a rock is the only evidence of my most troubled hour on earth - a rather hellish gateway to some heavenly skiing.

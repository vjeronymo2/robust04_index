This morning the delegation from the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] held  a meeting with the mediators. We do not yet know the reasons  and the results of this meeting, because of the press censorship  imposed by Malian-born Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special  representative in Angola, at the beginning of the peace talks  last December.    All the same, it is known that the parties are discussing  the  formation of the new national police, national reconciliation,  the future UN role in Angola, the release of prisoners, the  sharing of power, and the second round of presidential  elections. The talks will continue tomorrow.</p>

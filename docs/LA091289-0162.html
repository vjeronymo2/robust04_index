			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ELLIOTT MAY SEEK $4-MILLION CONTRACT  </P> <P> Sean Elliott's agent indicated that he may seek more than $2 million a year for  the San Antonio Spurs' first-round draft pick, but Elliott's contract  negotiations are on hold at least a week.  </P> <P> "We want to see what the market tells us," said Bob Woolf of Boston, who  represents Elliott and Glen Rice, who was drafted No. 4 by the Miami Heat.  </P> <P> In published reports today, Woolf said he is waiting to see the "market value"  of the NBA's top draft picks. Elliott was drafted No. 3 overall.  </P> <P> Particularly, Woolf said, he doesn't expect negotiations with the Spurs to  start until Sacramento signs Pervis Ellison, the No. 1 pick in June's college  draft. There have been reports that Ellison has been offered a five-year  contract worth $14 million, nearly $3 million per year.  </P> <P> "I consider Sean and Pervis just about interchangeable," Woolf said, referring  to the possible money being offered Ellison.  </P></p>

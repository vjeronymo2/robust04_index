			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD COOKING;  </P> <P> SANDWICHES: A SUMMER ALTERNATIVE  </P> <P> Salads have long been the mainstay of light, summer meals. But now sandwiches  are starting to nudge salads aside.  </P> <P> There are a lot of reasons for our renewed interest in sandwiches. We are now  nutritionally savvy enough to know that bread is indeed the staff of life. Some  of us are such bread fans, in fact, that the filling has become secondary to  the quality of the bread that holds it.  </P> <P> And a sandwich makes a much more satisfying meal than a salad -- even when the  latter is accompanied by bread. A good sandwich is comforting too -- which  can't be said for salads. And for summer entertaining a few simple, substantial  sandwiches made with great bread are much easier to put together for a crowd  than a main dish salad.  </P> <P> Like most culinary preparations, successful sandwiches respond to seasonal  ingredients. The following sandwiches brim over with fresh, crunchy, refreshing  fillings; you might even say that they're salads between bread.  </P> <P>  A summer-perfect, fresh-tasting sandwich is an Italian mix of sun-ripened  tomato, red onion, young fennel and basil stuffed into a soft pita bread. For  my taste, I prefer pita bread that is softened and warmed through, best  achieved in the microwave oven on medium power (50%) with the bread wrapped in  paper towels. The timing depends on how many pita breads are heated at once;  it's usually 20 seconds per pita.  </P> <P> ITALIAN SUMMER VEGETABLE PITA WITH FRESH BASIL  </P> <P> 2 large tomatoes (about 13 ounces) seeded and cut into 1/3-inch dice  </P> <P> 1 large red onion (about 7 ounces), cut into 1/3-inch dice  </P> <P> 1/2 large sweet red pepper (about 8 ounces), cut into 1/3-inch dice  </P> <P> 1 young fennel bulb (about 7 ounces), trimmed and cut into 1/3-inch dice  </P> <P> 6 young spinach leaves, julienned  </P> <P> 20 large fresh basil leaves, julienned  </P> <P> 2 1/2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons grainy Dijon mustard  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> 3 softened pita breads, cut in halves crosswise  </P> <P> Combine tomatoes, red onion, red pepper, fennel, spinach and basil in 2-quart  bowl. Toss well to mix.  </P> <P> Combine balsamic vinegar, olive oil, mustard, sugar and salt in small bowl, mix  well. Season to taste with pepper. Add to vegetables. Toss gently to combine.  Refrigerate 2 hours to let flavors develop.  </P> <P> Just before serving, drain off excess juices. Adjust seasonings to taste. Fill  each pita half with about 2/3 cup vegetables. Makes 6 pita halves.  </P> <P>  Large lavash crackers make the best sandwich spiral slices; first, the  crackers are softened with water, then covered with fresh ingredients, rolled  up jellyroll-fashion and later sliced. They are the perfect answer to light  dining, making a great presentation on a buffet table. They are also easy  finger foods. Thinly sliced ingredients and/or spreads are the ideal fillers.  In this straightforward recipe, cilantro adds zest; substitute fresh basil or  tarragon, if desired.  </P> <P> SMOKED TURKEY AND HAM LAVASH CLUB WITH CILANTRO  </P> <P> 1 large (15-inch round) sesame seed lavash cracker  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons honey mustard  </P> <P> 1/2 pound very thinly sliced lightly smoked turkey  </P> <P> 1/2 pound very thinly sliced hickory smoked ham  </P> <P> 1 large tomato, very thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1/2 sweet onion (about 6 ounces), thinly sliced and separated into rings  </P> <P> 1/4 cup cilantro leaves  </P> <P> 8 large leaf lettuce leaves, core removed  </P> <P> To soften lavash cracker, hold cracker under cold running water and thoroughly  wet both sides. Place between 2 damp clean towels 45 to 60 minutes. Be sure  lavash is softened enough to roll up without cracking. If still too dry,  sprinkle with more water, then cover again with damp towels until soft and  pliable.  </P> <P> Center softened lavash, sesame seed side down, on plastic wrap, 3 inches longer  than lavash. Spread honey mustard evenly over cracker. Top with layers of  sliced turkey, ham, tomato (in single layer) and onion rings. Sprinkle with  cilantro leaves. Cover with lettuce leaves.  </P> <P> Use plastic wrap to help roll cracker up into compact roll, jellyroll-fashion.  Move roll to center of plastic wrap. Wrap tightly, including ends. Refrigerate  2 to 4 hours before serving.  </P> <P> Serve cold, unwrap and use serrated knife to slice roll crosswise into 1  3/4-inch spirals. Makes 4 servings, 8 spiral slices.  </P> <P> Here, shrimp is combined with apples and cucumbers, not only stretching the  shrimp but giving the sandwich great flavor and crunch. Fresh sourdough bread,  sliced about 1/3-inch thick, makes this a perfect sandwich.  </P> <P> CURRIED SHRIMP SALAD SANDWICH WITH APPLES AND CUCUMBERS  </P> <P> 1 medium pickling cucumber (about 3 1/2 ounces), peeled, seeded, chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 medium tart apple (about 3 1/2 ounces), chopped  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons dried currants  </P> <P> 12 large peeled cooked shrimp (about 6 ounces), cut into 1/3-inch pieces  </P> <P> Light mayonnaise  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon honey  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons plain nonfat yogurt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Red pepper flakes  </P> <P> 6 slices fresh sourdough bread  </P> <P> Watercress leaves  </P> <P> Combine cucumber, apple, currants, shrimp, 1/3 cup light mayonnaise, honey,  yogurt, curry powder, salt and pepper flakes in small bowl. Adjust seasonings  to taste. Refrigerate several hours.  </P> <P> Just before serving, spread mayonnaise on bread slices. Divide shrimp mixture  evenly between 3 slices, spreading to edge. Arrange watercress leaves over.  Close sandwich with remaining bread slices. Use serrated knife to cut each in  half. Makes 3 sandwiches.  </P></p>

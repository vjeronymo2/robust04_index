			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Japan's ruling coalition  today picked Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata to succeed Morihiro  Hosokawa as prime minister.    The decision was made at a meeting here this afternoon of  the  coalition parties which agreed to present the 58-year-old Hata  as their joint candidate in a parliamentary vote next Monday.    Observers here believe that the veteran Hata is certain to  win because of the coalition's majority in the decisive lower  house.</p>

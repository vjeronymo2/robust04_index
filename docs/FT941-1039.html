			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Books: China's housekeeper ELDEST SON: ZHOU EN-LAI AND THE MAKING OF MODERN CHINA 1898-1976 by Han Suyin Jonathan Cape Pounds 25, 283 pages During the decade of China's Holocaust, the Cultural Revolution, premier Zhou En-lai drew up a Schindler's list of those he wanted to protect from the forces of death and destruction. His main Ark was Peking's Hospital 301, to which he had healthy targets of the Red Guards' wrath confined. The numbers he protected were few but today he is chiefly remembered with affection in China because of these efforts and his desperate work to keep the nation afloat in the chaotic seas, in reward for which his master, Chairman Mao Zedung, labelled him China's 'housekeeper.' One would have thought that, after the chorus of contempt which greeted her two-volume hagiography of Mao, The Morning Deluge and Wind in the Tower, an instinct for self-preservation if not a sense of shame would have inhibited Han Suyin from attempting a biography of Zhou En-lai. Mao's faithful prime minister spent the last years of his life fighting cancer and vainly trying to limit the damage inspired by the senile monomaniac Chairman, his termagant wife and the Gang of Four. The Mao volumes ludicrously presented the Chairman, to quote from the blurbs on their dust-jackets, as 'a modest man and, moreover, a man merciful to his enemies, uncorrupted by power,' a judgment at odds both with historical truth and with any intellectual honesty. Mao had qualities as a thinker and a charismatic revolutionary still acknowledged in China, but as a disastrous peace-time leader he was a monstrous egoist and a ruthless tyrant. In writing this gushing tribute to Zhou, Han Suyin does her best to do justice to the bitter struggles of his last years while avoiding flat contradictions of her own deification of Mao. But, despite endless evasions, prettification and an insistent incantatory prose style, she fails by a long chalk to bring it off. The introductory paragraphs set the tone: 'Beloved Premier Zhou. Automatically, so many of my generation spoke of him thus, running the words together. . . Somehow because of him we all felt life was worth living . . . ' By the final chapters Han Suyin has transmuted this dedicated Marxist revolutionary into a Confucian gentleman and ends apotheosising him as a Christ-like figure, dying painfully for millions on the cross of Mao's Cultural Revolution. Like certain other lady novelists, she reproduces the thoughts of others as history. She presumes that Zhou's reaction to his betrayal by friends was 'grief unspoken, swallowed down, invisible,' and records the reaction of the audience to one of his last appearances: ''He is back, he is back,' one could hear the thought from every brain, though not a word was said.' Han Suyin bids fair for the title of being the Barbara Cartland of China Watchers. The writer ignores or plays down facts which fit uneasily into her theme that both Mao and Zhou were benign, if occasionally fallible, heroic figures and their enemies evil. The death of Liu Shaoqi, the main target of the Cultural Revolution, occurs with no mention of the cruelty that killed him, medicine-less on the floor of a freezing cell. She does record that Mao never bothered to visit his premier on his deathbed but reports that his nurse claimed that she saw 'tears running down his face' while he watched evening television on the day Zhou died  - an unlikely tale. Better sourced is that a coarse poem by Mao ('Don't fart or the heavens will be turned upside down'), was read to the dying Zhou, who wept before he died. Mao did not attend the funeral ceremony, an absence Han Suyin does not note. Zhou was, of course, a very considerable leader of great charm which I have seen him use to enormous effect while manipulating a roomful of foreign journalists. Evidently, he employed it on the author. Zhou used his charm and intelligence to rule, dominate, persuade, cajole and, in the end, to survive. Back in 1928, Zhou had said, 'For the sake of the Revolution, we must even become like a prostitute.' That turned out to be his fate. In the final analysis, Zhou who preached common sense, died a failure in the shadow of a chaos-sowing Monkey King figure. He had given his life to a lost cause, but is remembered with affection because of the few dozens he rescued from the spite of the man who embodied that cause. Under the billows of Han Suyin's romantic prose, Zhou's very real qualities disappear. His portrait is painted in the literary equivalent of China's revolutionary art: a saint-like, heroic-eyed worker gazing towards the rays of the sun of Mao.</p>

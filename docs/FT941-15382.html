			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Japan police in export raid: Machinery sales to N Korea may have breached Cocom rules Japanese police have raided the offices of several companies suspected of having exported a device to North Korea that could be used to guide ballistic missiles, in breach of Cocom rules banning strategic exports to communist countries. A police spokesman said the probe involved machinery manufacturers and trading houses but declined to name them. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, the companies are suspected of exporting spectrum analysers to North Korea which might have been used to test the country's ballistic missiles launches. Under Cocom rules, exports to communist countries of equipment that might be used for military purposes, are strictly regulated. The offices raided by the police include that of a Yokohama-based trading company which specialises in trade with China, North Korea and Vietnam. It is suspected that the trading houses under investigation acquired a number of spectrum analysers which they exported to North Korea, possibly through a third country, five years ago. While the manufacturer of the spectrum analysers is also being investigated, it is possible that staff did not know where the equipment was bound as sales are commonly made through trading companies, police said. The possibilty that spectrum analysers, commonly used to measure the spectrum of radar or telecommunications equipment, had been exported to North Korea from Japan, emerged after North Korea successfully launched its intermediate range ballistic missile, the Rodong 1, in the Sea of Japan last May. The missile is thought to be capable of reaching any point in western Japan in less than 10 minutes. There are some suspicions that the equipment exported from Japan several years ago may have been used in the test of the Rodong 1. Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, Minister of International Trade and Industry said that the ministry would co-operate with the police but also conduct its own investigation into the matter.</p>

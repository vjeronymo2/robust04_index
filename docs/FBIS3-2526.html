			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said that China will maintain its economic growth momentum  in 1994, a crucial year for the country's economic reforms.    The central government has set the growth rate of China's  national economy in 1994 at nine percent, he said.    In his 16,000-word report on government work he delivered  today at the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress (NPC), the premier called for a good handling of  relations among reform, economic development and social  stability.    Li's government work report consists of seven parts. They  are: a review of 1993 domestic work and basic principles for  work in 1994; maintaining a steady, rapid and sound development  of the national economy; speeding up the establishment of a  socialist market economy; expanding scientific and technological  undertakings and promoting education and culture; strengthening  socialist democracy and the legal system; actively promoting the  peaceful reunification of China; and diplomatic work.    The government work report devotes two-fifths of its length  to economic work and reform in 1994.    On economic work in 1994, according to Li Peng, the  government will: deepen reform, open wider to the outside world,  strengthen and improve macroeconomic controls, restructure the  economy, promote technological progress, explore new markets,  improve economic efficiency, keep inflation under control, and  maintain a sustainable, rapid and [word indistinct] of the  economy.    Li Peng said that the planned 1994 growth rate of nine  percent for the national economy is realistic given the fact  that the country has seen a growth rate of 13 percent in the  past two consecutive years.    The premier reiterated the fundamental status of agriculture  in the economy. He called for continued implementation of  existing rural policies, deepening rural reform, solving  problems that arise in the process of rural economic  development, and trying every means possible to boost the income  of farmers.    Li emphasized the importance of improving transport and  manufacturing industries, especially in terms of the management  and production of large- and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises, saying this is of vital importance for a sustained  development of the national economy.    Noting that some large- and medium-sized state enterprises  have a rough time nowadays, Li called for all social quarters to  take positive measures to help them solve their problems.    Li stressed that investment should be maintained at a  rational scale, urging all localities and government departments  to devote their funds and materials preferentially to key  projects now under construction in the sectors of  transportation, telecommunications, energy, essential raw  materials and the harnessing of large rivers and lakes. He said  that the government encourages coastal areas to invest in  central and western parts of the country. To rein in the  investment scale, the premier said, the central government will  not approve the establishment of any new economic development  zones in 1994.    On the country's open policy, Li said that attention should  be paid to making existing open areas perform better, which  include special economic zones, Shanghai's Pudong, open coastal  cities and regions, and economic and technological development  zones. Major cities along the country's borders, along the  Chang Jiang River and in the country's hinterland should be  opened wider to the rest of the world, he said.    The premier in his report expounded China's reform measures  in 1994, which have attracted wide attention at home and abroad.  Li called the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) "a  common program of action for continued in-depth reforms," which  he said has served as an overall blueprint for the establishment  of a socialist market economy in China.    This year's reform, which will combine breakthroughs in key  areas with overall progress, is expected to score substantial  progress in restructuring the economy, he said.    The government report dwells on taxation and finance reform,  establishment of a modern enterprise system, rationalization of  price relations and reform of the government structure.    Talking about financial difficulties faced by the  government,  Li said that deficit of the central government will be made up  by issuing bonds instead of overdrawing on the bank again; the  central bank will regulate money supply and stabilize the value  of the yuan; and the government will keep inflation for the  whole of 1994 under ten percent.    Li said that science and technology should be integrated  closely with the economy and that reform of the education system  should be accelerated with more fund to be put into education.  He urged people to develop socialist culture and pay more  attention to the social benefits and consequences of cultural  products than to their economic returns.    New achievements should be made in developing socialist  democracy and strengthening the legal system so as to ensure a  smooth progression of economic reform, a healthy economic  development and an all-round social progress, he said.    Li said that the most important task for public security,  procuratorial and judicial organs this year is to maintain  public order. He said that the government will continue to  crack down on crimes and social evils. Fights against special  types of crime will be combined with anti-crime campaigns, he  said.    The last two parts of Li's government work report deal with  the principles of peaceful reunification of China and "one  country, two systems," and China's independent diplomatic policy  of peace.</p>

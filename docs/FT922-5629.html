			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Hungary's new guard already beset by young blood: Ruling conservatives, are under pressure from the youthful free-marketeers TWO YEARS after free elections, Hungary's victorious conservatives are suffering from an acute case of that very democratic malady: the mid-term blues. Hungarians, more accustomed to protest in demonstrations and against communists, are learning to vent dissatisfaction with their new democratic rulers in the time-honoured western way: through opinion polls and by-elections. There is much with which to be dissatisfied. Recorded gross domestic product declined by 10 per cent last year. The bulk of the population has suffered deteriorating or stagnating living standards, made all the more frustrating by the showy prosperity of the rest. No wonder that several international polls showed Hungarians to be the gloomiest people in the world. No wonder, too, that the Hungarians want to punish their government. With what a vengeance. Support for the Hungarian Democratic Forum, holder of 42 per cent of seats in parliament and the leading party of the conservative governing coalition, has dived to a humiliating 15 per cent in the latest Gallup opinion poll - low enough to push Mr Bela Kadar, the influential minister of international economic relations, into a humiliating third place in a by-election last week. One thing is even more galling for Mr Jozsef Antall, the ailing conservative prime minister. The beneficiary of the government's unpopularity is a bunch of kids. If one believes the polls, a group of recent graduates from Budapest University is heading for an absolute majority at the next parliamentary elections. With about 50 per cent of support in recent polls, the young free-market liberals of the Alliance of Young Democrats would reduce the ruling centre-right coalition to a rump, and Mr Viktor Orban, the 28-year-old party leader, would sweep Mr Antall from the prime minister's office. The Young Democrats have gone from 9 per cent of the vote and junior partner in the liberal opposition in the 1990 parliamentary elections, to 18 per cent in local elections and an opinion poll lead since last year. A joint candidate with their liberal allies inflicted this month's by-election defeat on the government. As a result, the government has taken more than just a leaf from the western instruction manual: blame bad news on its bearers - the polling organisations and the media. Officials doubt the reliability of polling organisations, particularly Hungarian ones. They stress the fickleness of voters in general, and Hungarian voters in particular, whose party loyalty and sense of civic duty remain immature. They say that the voter's mind has been poisoned by the media, which, conservatives claim, is full of liberals and communists. Such is the government's displeasure with news coverage that it has tried to sack the heads of state radio and television, stumbling into a constitutional clash with Mr Arpad Goncz, the president. The government, while admitting to some public dissatisfaction, is still only halfway through its four-year term and remains sanguine. If mid-term blues is the malady, the conservatives put their faith in a classic western remedy: a pre-election boom. The government's strategy calls for the recession's bottoming-out this year and output growth reaching 4 per cent in time to win the 1994 elections. An extraordinary cabinet session recently decided to stimulate the economy through extra infrastructure spending and incentives for Hungarians to buy into privatisations. 'The old industries are shut down; something has to be started again,' said an aide to the prime minister. Even without an active further inflating of the economy, the public-sector deficit is set to roughly double the 1992 target agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The conservatives also can always appeal to the voters to support the devil they know. 'A governing party can win an election even when everybody hates the government, if they see no real alternative,' said one official. The government dismisses the Young Democrats as a passing phenomenon, laughing at the notion that Mr Orban might be Hungary's version of Spain's Felipe Gonzalez: a young radical taking power after dictatorship and a centre-right interregnum. But others are taking them increasingly seriously, not least the electors, who say they like their freshness, honesty, innocence and freedom from the past - rare enough qualities in post-communist eastern Europe. However, the Young Democrats are not appealing just to public sympathy. They have confronted the government on the battleground of economic competence. It no accident that Mr Orban calls himself a 'political manager' and rivals label the Young Democrats as 'yuppies disguised as revolutionaries'. The party has taken a fanatically rational approach even to the most emotional political issues. For instance, it opposed on economic grounds legislation to compensate those whose property was confiscated by the communists. Moreover, the party's unswerving technocrats have attracted a warm response from the business elite, who are still searching for a political home and frustrated at what they see as the government's lack of understanding. A leading Hungarian investment banker says that most older democratic politicians are 'bruised' by life under the former communist regime: 'They spend too much time correcting the mistakes of the past rather than building the future. Economic problems do not get the importance they deserve. We need a new generation which has not gone through frustrations in life.' But then again, the mood of the business establishment could just be another transitory symptom of the mid-term blues. The Young Democrats have two years to ensure it is not; the conservatives have two years to start the economic growth that makes any government look competent. The competition has a very western feel.</p>

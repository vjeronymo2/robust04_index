			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nadeem Hussain] </F>   [Text] Islamabad, May 31 -- The National Economic Council  (NEC) which met here Tuesday with Prime Minister in chair  approved the 8th five year plan of Rs [rupees] 1701 billion.    The 8th five year plan registers an increase of 48 per cent  over the 7th five year plan which was Rs 1149 billion. The size  of the plan has been fixed on the constant price to make the  comparison with the 7th five year plan easy.    The major emphasis in the 8th five year plan is on  education,  health and energy sectors. The share of public and private  sector in the plan has also been increased compared to the  previous plan.    The major character of the 8th plan is to ensure a minimum  investment of Rs 949 billion against Rs 596 billion in the 7th  five year plan.    The share of the public rector in the 8th plan has been  increased to Rs 751 billion compared to Rs 553 billion in the  7th plan, showing an increase of 59 per cent. The budget  announcing over the five years in the public sector would be of  Rs 483 billion.    The share of private sector has been envisaged as Rs 949  billion compared to Rs 596 billion in the 7th plan reflecting an  increase of 48 per cent.    The Deputy Chairman, Planning, Saeed Ahmad Qureshi and  Minister for Information, Khalid Ahmad Kharal, gave the briefing  regarding the 8th five year plan.

It has been kept at Rs 752 billion out of which Rs 483  billion would be budget financed whereas Rs 269 billion would be  corporate and market financed.    In the 7th five-year plan, the size of the Public Sector  Programme was of Rs 553 billion out of which Rs 457 billion were  budget financed and Rs 96 billion were corporate and market  financed. This means that in the 8th five-year plan, the share  of corporate and market financed has been increased three-fold  which to many seems overoptimistic.    The growth targets have also been fixed in the 8th five-year  plan. These targets for all practical purposes are unrealistic.    A comprehensive macro economic management policy has been  adopted in the 8th five-year plan, according to which the growth  targets would be achieved in a frame work of equity, stability  and sustainability.    The overall fiscal deficit would be reduced from 7.9 per  cent  to 4 per cent of GDP and the current account deficit would be  brought down from 3.7 billion dollars at present to 1.84 billion  dollars by the end of 8th five-year plan, which means the level  would be brought down from 7 per cent a present to 24 per cent  of GDP.    The plan is also aimed at containing the long-term external  debt at 36 per cent of GDP and keep monetary expansion below the  growth of nominal GDP and also to reduce inflation rate from 9.3  per cent to 6 per cent. The plan also envisages to raise  national savings from 15.8 per cent to 19.9 per cent and  generate 6.2 million new jobs against 3.2 million in the 7th  plan.    The 8th five-year plan has been targeted to make the GDP  growth rate to increase by 7 per cent, agriculture sector 4.9  per cent, industry 9.4 per cent, manufacturing 9.9 per cent and  services sector 6.7 per cent.    The annual plan for the forthcoming fiscal year 1994-95 was  also approved.    The targets for the forthcoming fiscal year 1994-95 have  been  envisaged as GDP growth 6.9 per cent, agriculture 8 per cent,  manufacturing 6.9 per cent, exports 19 per cent, imports 10.7  per cent and inflation to be reduced to 7.5 per cent.    The size of the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP)  for the forthcoming fiscal year was also approved. The original  size of the PSDP was Rs 94 billion but NEC approved the size of  the PSDP for Rs 90 billion.    Provinces would be given Rs 25 billion.

The participation in primary education for boys would be  increased from 85 per cent to 96 per cent and for girls from 54  per cent to 82 per cent, which according to the plan makers  would be quite a landmark.    In the health sector, 33,000 village health workers would be  engaged, which would be the first major effort of its kind be  rural areas, other salient features in this sector include the  full immunization of mother and child, enhanced coverage of  preventive services from 80 per cent to 90 per cent, life  expectancy to go up from 61.5 years to 66.5 years and infant  mortality rate to decline from 8.6 per cent to 6.5 per cent by  the end of 8th plan.    Regarding population control, the population planning  programme coverage would be increased from 20 per cent to 80  percent, i.e. in the urban areas from 54 percent to 100 percent  and in rural areas from 5 percent to 70 percent. The rural  water supply coverage would increase from 17 percent to 71  percent of the population. Rural [word indistinct] coverage to  go up from 14 percent to 32 percent.    In the energy sector, construction of Ghazi-Barotha dam of  1,450 MW would be the main priority. Whereas thermal generation  of more than 2,500 MW in private sector has also been envisaged.

			<p>BFN     [Text] This afternoon, Ukrainian servicemen seized one  large and one medium amphibious vessels of the 318th vessel  conservation group of the Black Sea Fleet stationed in Odessa.  The press office of the Black Sea Fleet told Interfax that the  Ukrainians also seized the group's training camp and hoisted  Ukrainian national flags there.    The families of 18 officers and warrant officers, including  the group's chief of staff, Second Captain Aleksandr Zelenko,  and the commander of a coastal base, Second Captain Dmitriy  Starikov, who refused to take an oath to Ukraine were expelled  out of their apartments on the same day.    According to the press office, the navymen and their  families  are sitting on their suitcases on the street waiting for  evacuation to Sevastopol.    In the meantime, Kiev stated it was forming its first coast  guards brigade on the basis of the 318th vessel conservation  division of the Black Sea Fleet which was dissolved after an  incident with the hydrographic vessel Cheleken. Ukrainian  Defense Minister appointed Second Captain Mikhail Marchenko as  the commander of the brigade on 10 April.    The press office of the Odessa military district said that  22  out of 34 warrant officers and four out of 11 officers of the  318th group had already taken an oath to Ukraine.    The Odessa military district commander, Lieutenant General  Vladimir Shkitchenko, told the former 318th group's command on  12 April on behalf of the Ukrainian defense minister that he  guaranteed "those officers who do not want to serve in the  Ukrainian navy the possibility to leave for any other place  without any obstacles."    "The seeing-off ceremony for the navymen leaving for another  place of service will be organized with the adequate military  honors," the Odessa military district press office assured  Interfax. "The officers and warrant officers will be paid their  salaries until the last days of their service in the Odessa  garrison."    In the meantime, the press office head, Vyacheslav Voronkov,  told INTERFAX that the Ukrainian Navy took under control the  Nikolayev and Odessa hydrographic districts on 11 April in  accordance with an order by the Ukrainian defense minister.    In particular, the Ukrainian navy created its first  hydrographic district headed by Third Captain Nikolay Zakharov  on the basis of the former Black Sea Fleet's 46th hydrographic  district. The new Ukrainian unit includes 11 servicemen,  including 10 officers and one warrant officer. As many as seven  of them have already taken an oath to Ukraine.</p>

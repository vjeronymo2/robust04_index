			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Anyone for pizza? When Peter Boizot brought authentic Italian pizza to Britain in the mid-1960s some early customers suggested he put chips on the Pizza Express menu. Others mistook the oregano for grass. But Boizot stood firm and ultimately his recipe for high-quality pizzerias proved a classic marketing success. From a single Soho restaurant in 1965 the Pizza Express chain has grown to include 68 company-owned and franchised restaurants which generated Pounds 1.5m in operating profits on turnover of Pounds 16.3m last year and sold 6.5m pizzas. Today its shares will begin trading on the stock exchange for the first time following a complex reverse takeover by the publicly quoted Star Computer group worth almost Pounds 15m. Mintel, the independent market researchers, said in a report last autumn that since 1987 the size of the pizza/pasta market in the UK has more than doubled to an estimated Pounds 694m last year. Pizza Express has become Britain's most popular pizza chain despite spending little on advertising. Instead it has relied on its predominantly upmarket, loyal customers to spread the word. Along the way Pizza Express has succeeded in trouncing a handful of look-alike rivals including Pizza Hut, the market leader in terms of outlets, PizzaLand and Deep Pan Pizza. So what is the secret? David Page, who ran the largest group of franchised Pizza Express restaurants and is managing director of the new publicly quoted group, believes the success is due to Boizot's refusal to compromise on quality or authenticity. For example, Boizot insisted on using real Italian pizza ovens which provide a very hot, dry heat. The Pizza Express interiors have all been designed by Enzo Apicella to exploit the character of each individual building. Similarly the menu has changed little in the last 28 years - even the introduction of cappucino coffee machines has been resisted - and only genuine mozzarella cheese and Italian tomatoes are used. Robert Bird has been in charge of food quality control for 14 years and the group runs a 'secret eater programme' designed to check everything from quality of food and service to the tiling in the toilets. Aside from pizza, Boizot's other passions include Venice, hockey and jazz, all of which have become associated with the group. More than Pounds 300,000 has been donated to the Venice in Peril appeal fund from a 25p surcharge on Pizza Veneziana. It might be tempting for Pizza Express's new management to try to squeeze a few more margin points out of the business by scaling down some of these activities, or tinkering with the formula. But Page, Luke Johnson and Hugh Osmond, who put the Star Computer deal together, insist there are no plans for change. 'It has been successful because it is authentic,' says Page.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Horton denies he plans to 'get tough' on signal strikers Railtrack yesterday said it had no plans to get tough with striking signals staff, saying that it hoped for a positive response to its offer when all the details had sunk in. It also expects the strikers to start feeling the affect of lost wages as the summer holiday period approached. But with three days of lost rail services and the prospect of the dispute intensifying in the weeks ahead, Railtrack may be starting to consider more radical options. A dispute which continued through the summer could make it more difficult to privatise the railway network if Railtrack were shown to be incapable of dealing effectively with its unions. One proposal made yesterday by Mr Harry Greenway, Conservative MP for Ealing North, was for Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, to emulate former US President Ronald Reagan, who sacked air traffic control staff who would not settle. Mr Horton said: 'I don't think it has really come to that at all. I think reasonable people can sit down and sort this thing out.' One drawback of such extreme action is that it would be likely to prompt sympathy strikes by other rail workers. These are outlawed but rail staff could defy their union's instructions or the union could find another issue which could become the trigger for a dispute. Relations between management and rail workers could be soured for many years. If Railtrack did opt for this approach it would not be as difficult to find replacement staff as is commonly supposed, some transport experts believe. Signals staff play a vital role in ensuring the safety of railways but the skill level required is not as great as has been suggested. 'It is a tedious, repetitive job, but not one requiring special skills,' said one observer. An alternative strategy for Railtrack might be to improve its terms to the striking signalmen in the certain knowledge that new technology would remove many of their jobs over the next few years. Other recently privatised organisations such as British Telecommunications have made considerable job cuts in recent years but avoided strikes by improving the terms of conditions of the smaller numbers still employed. The number of signalling staff has fallen from 8,900 to 4,600 over the past seven years as manual signal boxes relying on visual supervision of stretches of line have been replaced by automated signal boxes and computer controls. But there is still one signal worker for every 2 1/2 miles of track - without taking account of shift working - and there are considerable improvements which could be made to signalling systems. Increasing wages of signals staff in the expectation that there will be far fewer of them around in a few years time is also not without problems. An improved offer now not met by immediate productivity improvements would probably be regarded as breaching government guidelines. In the short term Railtrack and the train operating companies will be hoping they can minimise the impact of the strike using working signal staff in the most effective way. With about 1,600 trains running yesterday, up from 1,000 the week before and 500 the week before that, Railtrack has clearly been learning quickly. But its best bet still remains negotiating a detailed formula acceptable to the signal staff . . . and the government.</p>

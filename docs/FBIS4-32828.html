			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], has said unscrupulous  individuals will not be allowed to divert and make use of the  material results of the toil of selfless workers who comprise  the Youth Labor Army [EJT]. Castro presided over the final event  organized by the FAR General Staff for the EJT's Havana  division, which was created nine months ago.    After analyzing the work done by the EJT, Gen. Castro  praised  these forces doing farm work in Havana, describing them as the  pride of the country. In a brief statement during the final  meeting, he supported a profound restructuring of the Ministry  of Agriculture, which he said is the cause of inefficiency in  state farms. Bureaucracy, he stressed, destroyed state  agriculture. On this matter, he had words of praise for current  Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan and added that he is certain  Jordan will successfully carry out the task of bringing more  products to the market. The EJT is a group within the FAR  devoted to work in the agricultural and livestock sector, and  since its founding 21 years ago [as heard] has became the most  productive of the entire country.    [Editorial note: Mexico City NOTIMEX at 1840 GMT on 26 May  carries a report citing the remarks by Gen. Raul Castro, as  reported by Cuban daily GRANMA. Castro is cited as urging the  EJT members to implement "new formulas" to eliminate  shortcomings, negligence, red tape, and theft. He is also cited  as saying that enforcement measures will implemented "within the  law."]</p>

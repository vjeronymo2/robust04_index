			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Ozawa was once asked for a definition of "a normal  nation," and he described the conditions as "not expressing its  dislikes or saying anything merely to suit its own convenience."  However, Ozawa himself appears to be acting at his or his  party's own convenience. Before aiming for an ordinary nation,  Ozawa should perhaps strive to become "a normal person" who can  be understood by the people.  <H5>  Parting With the SDPJ Is Inevitable </H5>   The Hosokawa administration, which appeared to be sailing  smoothly after its inauguration, is now showing conspicuous  signs of fraying. In addition to a mounting offensive by the LDP  [Liberal Democratic Party] which overcame its danger of  refracturing, loud noises of discord are heard from within the  coalition. The source is none other than the existence and the  conspicuous statements and behavior of representative Ichiro  Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party].    First of all, the political reform bill is vitally important  to the coalition administration. The solidarity among the SDPJ  [Social Democratic Party of Japan] upper house members who  oppose the bill has strengthened with time. At the outset, Ozawa  used his close associate, upper house member Sadao Hirano, to  try to persuade the rebelling group. He reportedly even dangled  the bait of cabinet posts to the hardline faction of Dietman  Osamu Yatabe, et al. However, he is said to have switched his  direction by stating: "It is now impossible to change their  minds. There are 15 or 16 persons with whom we cannot  communicate. The party cadres are also opposed at heart to  reform. The SDPJ is beyond our reach. There is nothing we can do  if a defeat in the upper house results in dissolution and a  general election."    He also spoke to his associates as follows. "If an election  results, both the SDPJ and the LDP will definitely split.  Because the tail wind has died down and organization is lacking,  the JNP [Japan New Party] and Sakigake [Harbinger] Party will  not increase their seats. The only winners will be Shinseito and  Komeito. These two and the JNP should unite, embrace the LDP  reformist faction, and form a major force. If Hosokawa's  popularity should wane at that point, we can set up Hata (deputy  prime minister and foreign minister). They enjoy similar  popularity among the people."    This is interpreted to be a clear cutoff of the SDPJ.    Nonetheless, given the fact that he considers even Prime  Minister Hosokawa as one of his chess pawns, Ozawa's dictatorial  demeanor is apalling.    Of course, the SDPJ does not remain silent. Diet Affairs  Committee chairman Koken Nosaka, who met with Ozawa on 29  November, reportedly said in rage to those around him after the  meeting as follows. "We fear neither a dissolution of the  coalition government nor an election. We endured political  reform to a certain extent, but if an opening of the rice market  and a rise in the consumption tax are forced down our throats in  the name of maintaining the coalition, our party will be dealt  an early death. We can make a breakthrough by striking out."    Chairman Tomiichi Murayama is also reported to have  conducted  secret liaison with "don" Seiroku Kajiyama, former secretary  general and a conservative member of the LDP. The SDPJ's  anti-Shinseito, anti-Ozawa posture is becoming more pronounced.    The trend was accelerated by the "constitutional revision  statement" made by Defense Agency Director General Keisuke  Nakanishi on 1 December. While explaining it as his personal  view at a lecture in Tokyo, Nakanishi made an extremely  provocative statement for an incumbent director general of the  Defense Agency. "I feel that it is ridiculous to continue to  adhere zealously to a Constitution of a half-century ago. We  should remake it to respond to realistic standards while  respecting the spirit of constitutionalism. I am speaking with  conviction. I am prepared to resign at any time."    Actually, Nakanishi resigned as the director general the  following day, because the resulting confusion caused a halt in  the supplementary budget deliberations. Nonetheless, it was a  well-known fact that the crux of the Nakanishi statement was the  same as Ozawa's longstanding argument. A commentary was even  leaked by a Shinseito affiliate that "it was Ozawa's farewell  declaration to the SDPJ."    SDPJ upper house member Masatoshi Ito says with heated  indignation: "It is outrageous. It was a mistake, after all, to  team up with Shinseito. The Nakanishi statement was actually  Ozawa's statement, and this clarifies the fact that the party  advocates a power state. The SDPJ cannot relinquish its party  spirit of protecting the Constitution. We must sever our ties  with the coalition government as soon as possible."    Upper house member Masao Kunihiro similarly declares in a  harsh tone: "If Ozawa continues to try to push through his  unreasonable demands, it will result in Ozawa's one-man control  which is worse than the LDP's one-party domination. We must not  allow it to happen. Cabinet members, including Director Eda of  the Science &amp; Technology Agency (United Social Democratic  Party  [USDP] representative), should leave the coalition, and I  believe that they will."    There are also voices from within Sakigake [Harbinger] party  ranks that fear Shinseito's constitutional reform posture, and  the Hosokawa administration has suddenly begun to careen because  of the single Ozawa faction.  <H3>  "All Right for Budget Formation To Be Postponed Until Next  Year" </H3>   Ozawa is also committing mistakes in the aspect of business  stimulus measures.    He has spoken frequently to his close associates as follows.  "The people are overly absorbed with the immediate future. They  should persevere longer for the time being. It is necessary for  the politicians to take the leadership and guide the people by  displaying that leadership. A system for that purpose must be  established."    At the root of Ozawa's thinking is the idea that "government  by the foolish masses" will result by listening to the people's  voice, and what is necessary is a politician with strong  leadership who can lead the foolish masses that tend to be  "overly engrossed with the near future." However, as an  extension of such a concept arises a contention to "postpone  antirecession measures" that holds contempt for the people.    For example, we quote a paragraph from his address before  the  Aichi Prefectural League on 25 November. "There are requests for  us to do something about the recession. Although the government  has taken various steps, there is no indication of an  improvement because it is a structural recession. The previous  concepts will not work. In order to execute drastic monetary and  fiscal measures, a prerequisite is to reform politics itself.  Therefore, political reform must precede antirecession measures."    He also stated clearly to a leading politician: "In order to  pass a political reform bill, a broad extension of the Diet  session is necessary. For that purpose, it is inevitable that  the formulation of the budget be postponed until next year."    Of course, the content of what is called political reform  here refers to electoral system reform which is often debated as  being problematical. Nonetheless, his nerve in declaring that  the antirecessional measures, which everyone argues loudly today  as a most urgent task, "can be postponed until after political  reform," and to also postpone the formulation of next year's  draft fiscal budget including the income tax reduction  anticipated at the earliest by the people, cannot be imagined of  the leader of a responsible government and ruling party.    However, like boss, like subordinate. Facing the executives  of the Japan Department Stores Assn who came to petition for an  early antirecession measure, Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] Minister Hiroshi Kumagae, Ozawa's close  associate, declared: "First, we must pass political reform.  After that, we will push through a business stimulus measure  with a bang."    The petitioners were reportedly aghast at the lighthearted  use of the term "with a bang." Meanwhile, the stock prices which  reacted against the Kumagae remark fell below the 16,000 yen  level with a loud "bang." As such, no insensitive remark could  make amends.    "Although the Hosokawa administration is said to be a  political reform administration, it is a big mistake to say that  reform is all it has to do. The present national task is  business stimulation and, unless you start by coping with it,  politics will be unnecessary" (LDP Dietman Shinji Sato).    This remark does not cast a damper on the government, but it  is a fair argument that castigates it. However, Ozawa's apparent  disinclination to heed it is clear in his aforementioned address.    Professor Setsuo Takahata of Teikyo University's economic  dept comments as follows. "Japan's economy is said to be  first-rate, but its politics is ridiculed as being third-rate.  However, at the present rate, its economics could also become  third-rate. Although Mr. Ozawa has offered various proposals for  Japan's future, his remark indicates his absolute lack of  knowledge about its current economic state. His continued stress  on a 10-percent consumption tax as a source of tax reduction  also has a reverse effect on the consumer mind which has  continued to cool. Speaking of tax reduction, it could have been  done in the summer at a cost of 5 trillion yen. Now, it will not  be effective unless it is about 10 trillion yen. This is not  merely economic tone-deafness, but economic ignorance. The  economy will not improve within this century with Mr. Ozawa's  awareness level."  <H5>  Cultivation of Zoku Dietmen Aimed Toward Money and Votes </H5>   There are other problematical and quesionable statements.  The  Ozawa statement about rice goes as follows. "I have not said  that rice must be deregulated. However, tariffication is a  principle of free trade which Japan does not negate."    His intent is not clear, but he seems to say, in essence,  that rice importation is inevitable in order to maintain  friendly relations with the other nations of the world. If so,  why does he fail to debate it seriously among the coalition  parties, and merely stacks up established facts in a manner that  bewitches the people? It is only natural for the SDPJ to  increasingly react and claim that it is contrary to the public  commitments made by the eight factions when they formed the  coalition.    "In effect, only Shinseito's future exists in Ozawa's eyes.  The future image of Japan, of which he speaks, is also merely a  future image with the condition that Shinseito becomes the focus  of politics" (an LDP leader).    Ozawa's comments are dangerous and unreliable to the point  that such views have a sound of credibility. For example, he has  stated about the LDP, his alma mater, as follows. "The LDP is  like a large tree at which one looks up, but it is hollow  inside. Therefore, forming Shinseito was inevitable" (from his  aforementioned address in Aichi).    We will not question here who was responsible for the  hollowing out of the LDP. However, if he had bolted from the  party based on such a judgment, it is the normal sentiment among  the people to want him to cleanly discard all LDP-style methods  and senses.    However, the collection of funds goes on as usual, and  political methods have not changed. For example, Shinseito  recently successively formed "research committees" completely  similar to those of the LDP and increased the number of petition  windows. "In effect, the intention is to gather votes and money  by looking after their special- interests organizations that no  longer go to the LDP with their petitions. They are aiming at  mass cultivation of the zoku Dietmen" (a Japan New Party Diet  member).    Prime Minister Hosokawa, who has sought to eliminate the  zoku  Diet members, has reportedly expressed displeasure concerning  this trend.    When the mass media criticized this, he (Ozawa) incorrigibly  refused to reconsider, but conversely criticized the mass media,  saying: "Various problems are aired in the mass media, but the  mass media is arbitrarily using names to do business. I do not  want you to misunderstand, because they are not reporting the  truth" (from his Aichi address).  <H5>  No One Gives Advice to Ozawa </H5>   Moreover, since 8 November, he has refused to hold any  scheduled press conference, which he himself originally began  with the foreign press and magazines allowed to attend, on the  pretext of "a divergence of views between the mass media."  Although there was a plethora of pending bills, including those  on political reform, rice and the budget regarding which he  should have explained to the people in press conferences as the  representative of a public political party, he makes no attempt  to do so. If he shows up at a press conference, he will be  questioned about the unexplained portion of his own nebulously  acquired funds. He cannot avoid the suspicion that he is evading  the questioning.    An Ozawa associate comments on this problem. "Well, Mr.  Ozawa's contention is probably that `there is any number of ways  other than a press conference to communicate to the people,' but  actually there has there been no increase in TV appearances or  local appearances by him. His true feeling is: `What is wrong  with not talking if I do not wish to talk?' There are some  within Shinseito who believe it is wrong. However, they are  afraid and do not dare give him advice. They can only be  yes-men, because they know that, if they resist him, they will  be thrown out."    LDP Dietman Yoshinobu Shimamura makes the following critical  comment. "It has been made clear that his `open press  conference' was a lie. Ozawa thinks that he can do anything to  form a political system which he can control himself. It is too  obvious. He exposed his true self by his refusal to hold any  press conference. Although he says that he will lay out  antirecession measures, he only thinks of using it to pass  political reform, and there is no reason to expect an honest  measure."    Without an honest antirecession measure, without obtaining  any consensus within the ruling coalition on rice deregulation,  and finally under circumstances where the SDPJ could leave the  coalition, the Hosokawa administrative has suddenly become  unsettled. Materialization of the political reform bill, which  is the major public commitment by the Hosokawa administration,  seems to be difficult not only within the year, but even if the  Diet sessiion is drastically extended.    The Nakanishi statement on constitutional amendment has not  only given the LDP an excuse for attack, but also polarized the  divergence of basic doctrines that previously existed among the  ruling parties, and has impressed the public with the protusion  by Shinseito.    If Ozawa should seriously cut off the SDPJ, the collapse and  dissolution of the coalition and a general election will result.  During this recession, a political vacuum exceeding a month will  recur due to conflicting party interests. It is the presumptuous  behavior of such men in power that has marred this nation.</p>

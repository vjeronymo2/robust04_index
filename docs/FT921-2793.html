			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Journey to the centre of the stage IT DOES not brook comparison with the Odyssey or the Quest for the Holy Grail. But tonight's Conservative party political broadcast, entitled 'John Major. The Journey', puts the prime minister at the centre of his party's campaign for a fourth consecutive term. The journey in question is Mr Major's epic quest, outlined in his conference speech last autumn, from the back streets of Brixton, south London, to the corridors of power. The film's sub-text is that Conservative policies allow a gnome-maker's son to aspire to high office. It is designed also to exploit Mr Major's strong image rating and to emphasise his personal commitment to the National Health Service and other core trappings of the welfare state. The broadcast consists largely of a tour around the inner-city streets of the prime minister's youth, during which Mr Major consistently exudes an air of boyish enthusiasm. 'Every time I go in it, I still get a thrill,' he says on arriving finally at the Houses of Parliament. The film concludes with the prime minister entering Number Ten to the strains of Henry Purcell's Conserv-ative campaign theme music. The journey takes in Brixton market, the church where he was married and the front doors of two of the houses in which he used to live. Lambeth town hall, the shrine of the 'loony left', is described as the place where Mr Major 'practically lived for three years' as a councillor. One passage in the broadcast, which was directed by the Oscar-winning film director John Schlesinger, intercuts footage of Mr Major meeting world leaders with film of banter with stallholders and ordinary electors. The use of a big name director and the relentless focus on the party leader make comparisons with Hugh Hudson's 'Chariots of Kinnock' broadcast, which significantly improved the Labour leader's personal ratings in the 1987 campaign, inevitable. The comparison is partly misleading: the Tories will tonight seek to capitalise on a perceived strength, rather than rectify a perceived weakness. But one measure of the film's success would be if the Tories decide to rebroadcast it later in the campaign, as Labour did five years ago.</p>

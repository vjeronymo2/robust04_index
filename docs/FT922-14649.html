			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Court winds up La Cinq TV channel LA CINQ yesterday made broadcasting history by becoming the first national French television channel to close after it was declared bankrupt by the Paris commercial court. The court's decision followed months of desperate attempts to salvage La Cinq, which went under with almost FFr4bn (Dollars 717.5m) of liabilities and had been blighted by financial problems since its launch in 1986. The station experienced several changes of ownership in its short life having started under Mr Jerome Seydoux, the industrialist and confidant of President Francois Mitterand. Mr Seydoux was ousted after Mr Jacques Chirac's conservative government took power in favour of Mr Robert Hersant, the right wing press baron who, in turn, sold out to the Hachette media group in autumn 1990. None of La Cinq's owners managed to get to grips with the channel. For a brief period in the late 1980s it was applauded for its current affairs coverage, but then dived downmarket in an attempt to challenge the light entertainment format favoured by TF1, the biggest French TV station. La Cinq has since had the dubious distinction of being best known for its late night soft pornography. Its failure to attract a significant audience - its share of viewing fell from 12.5 per cent in 1990 to 11 per cent last year - made it difficult to generate advertising revenue. When Hachette took control in autumn 1990, the channel had lost almost FFr2.5bn. Its losses have since escalated reaching more than FFr1.1bn in 1991 alone. On new year's eve Hachette, having tried, and failed, to find new investors, announced that La Cinq was filing for bankruptcy. The French authorities have since attempted to find a suitable rescuer. At one point it looked as though Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media mogul, would be able to put together a FFr1.5bn refinancing package. But he failed to secure enough financial support to implement his plan. La Cinq's closure has left its 600 staff without jobs and will involve significant losses for its shareholders, which include the banks Credit Lyonnais of France and Kleinwort Benson of the UK, as well as Hachette and Mr Berlusconi. Hachette has already totted up its losses. It is still in negotiations over possible compensation for the financial investors it introduced to La Cinq, including Kleinwort. But earlier this week it announced it would be making a provision of FFr1.8bn for La Cinq in its 1991 accounts, bringing its total losses on France's ill-fated fifth channel to FFr3.5bn.</p>

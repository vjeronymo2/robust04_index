			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / The Battle For Midland: Cost savings dictate bank mergers in US THE PROPOSED merger of Lloyds Bank and Midland Bank could become a nightmare for thousands of workers who might face redundancies, but in cost terms it could prove an extremely efficient method of rationalising bloated branch networks. That, at least, appears to be the initial lesson to be drawn from the experience of two of the three large-scale bank mergers that have been agreed over the past year in the United States. The two mergers that bear comparison are the joining of the Bank of America and Security Pacific in California and of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York. These two mergers, which resulted in the creation of the second and third biggest banks in the US in asset terms, were both known as 'in-market' transactions, combining competitors in the same markets - as opposed to an 'across-market' deal, such as the merger last year of the North Carolina-based NCNB and the Georgia-based C&amp;S/Sovran. In UK terms, a Lloyds-Midland link would be the in-market deal, with Hong Kong and Shanghai's bid for Midland clearly representing the across-market transaction. Although initially greeted with scepticism, in-market deals are fast gaining favour in the US. The cost savings that can be achieved are, in fact, beginning to outstrip earlier expectat-ions. Chemical Banking, as the newly combined Manny Hanny/Chemical institution is called, has said it expected to save Dollars 750m of annual costs over the next three years. This is to be accomplished by cuts across the board, but with a special focus on administrative and other 'back office' expenses. By the end of this year, Chemical should have managed more than Dollars 225m of its cuts, and some analysts reckon its eventual savings will exceed its Dollars 750m target by Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m a year. In staff terms, Chemical aims to shed 6,200 jobs out of its combined starting workforce of more than 43,000. By March 31 of this year - only three months after the merger was completed - Chemical had already cut 2,500 jobs. As the third largest US bank, with Dollars 136bn of assets, Chemical is well positioned to take advantage of future interstate branching possibilities, assuming the laws are eventually relaxed. Most of its branch closures are within the New York state area, with a target of 80 branches out of 430 to be consolidated. In San Francisco, the Bank of America, which is effectively launching a rescue of the much weakened Security Pacific of Los Angeles, is also likely to achieve significant cost cuts because of the merger. The present forecast is for Dollars 1.2bn of annual savings by 1995, with some 10,000 to 12,000 of the combined bank's 91,000 jobs being eliminated. Bank of America needs to sell off 183 branches just to conform to federal anti-trust guidelines. However, it is likely to close hundreds more as it integrates its branch network with that of SecPac in California and other Western states. The in-market nature of the Bank of America/SecPac union is more broadly regional than the Chemical Banking case, where the two banks involved in the merger were literally housed in buildings that faced each other across Park Avenue. But with Dollars 180bn of total assets and a position as the second biggest US bank after Citicorp, the new Bank of America should also emerge in a strong position for future national growth. Mr Lew Coleman, vice-chairman of Bank of America, recently described mergers as 'the only viable option' to eliminate overcapacity in the US banking industry at a time when legislative reform has been stuck in Congress and regulatory relief has been largely unavailable. It is less clear that the creation of Nations Bank out of NCNB and C&amp;S/Sovran was the only solution for these Southeastern banks. The Dollars 4.6bn NationsBank deal, which created a regional bank with Dollars 110bn in assets and a position as the fifth biggest in the US, was an across-market deal that seemed less urgent. The merger was, however, a personal triumph for Mr Hugh McColl, the expansive chairman whose ambitions go beyond his native region. Even if the creation of NationsBank had a touch more empire building than the other deals, it is positioned to save on costs. Some 9,000 jobs - out of 60,000 - are to be eliminated by 1994 and annual cost savings are now being estimated at Dollars 450m. A look at these three US bank mergers suggests that the larger cost savings are being achieved where the institutions are geographically closer together. That makes sense, but bankers note there is an important caveat concerning in-market transactions. While the elimination of duplication in branch, staffing and administrative costs may be attractive, the putting together of two banks in the same area may also result in a larger pile of bad debts from similar clients. The bad debt issue is especially relevant in New York, where commercial real estate loan losses have been severe. However, Lloyds and Midland will almost certainly have some overlapping company lending in the bad debt category. Bank mergers are nonetheless now considered a practical tool in the US market, and predictions from bankers and top regulators suggest that by the year 2000 America's 12,000 banks may be whittled down to as few as 5,000 to 6,000 institutions. More than anything else, cost saving is driving the trend.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / French PM vows firm stand over road blockades MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday vowed to hold firm against protesting lorry drivers who have brought chaos to French roads, as fruit farmers in the south added to the disruption by blocking rail lines from Lyons to the Mediterranean. The farmers later lifted their blockades after Mr Beregovoy called on the police to remove them to release the 10,000 passengers, mostly holidaymakers, stranded in railway stations and on trains in the Rhone-Alpes region over the weekend. Fruit farmers were protesting over their inability to deliver produce because of the lorry drivers' strike, sparked by a proposed system under which drivers lose points for motoring offences and can be banned if they lose six. The government opened talks with drivers' union representatives on Friday, but these broke down early the following morning and are to start again on Thursday. Mr Beregovoy said: 'Like me, the truck drivers have a family who travel on the roads, children or grandchildren who cross the road to go to school. They must have the same concerns as I do. I say to them, one does not play games with life, one does not play with safety.' He has so far resisted using force against the lorry drivers, who were maintaining their blockades yesterday afternoon. Reports on the state of French roads varied over the weekend, the start of summer holidays for millions of French and foreign families. The economic cost has already affected the tourist industry at the beginning of what was to have been a record holiday season for France. The national hotel federation said 60 per cent of its members' expected customers had failed to turn up since July 1, and that the situation was 'catastrophic'. Mr Karel van Miert, European transport commissioner, said: 'This phenomenal development cannot go on any longer because it has reached the limits of congestion and of acceptability in public opinion.' According to the national road information service, traffic was flowing freely, but slowly, across most of France. It advised drivers to stay away from the main south-eastern corridor along the Rhone valley, through Lyons to the Mediterranean. However, the news agency AFP reported continued hold-ups in Aquitaine, the western Pyrenees, Rhone-Alpes, and Normandy, but the partial removal of road blocks on the motorway from Paris to Lille and Calais. In the Gard area of southern France, farmers emptied three Belgian and Dutch lorries of their Spanish fruit and set the cases on fire while police watched. The roadblocks, the most serious threat to public order since Mr Beregovoy came to power in April, drew wide international criticism over the weekend because of the number of foreign motorists who have been delayed. Newspapers in Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy condemned both the lorry drivers and government inability to clear the roads, showing a sharper sense of outrage than the French press.

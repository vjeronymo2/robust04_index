			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Clive Sawyer, Municipal Reporter: ```Disastrous </F> Results' for City's Health, Tourism''; first paragraph is THE  ARGUS introduction]    [Text] Pollution from car exhausts in Cape Town has  increased by 80 percent in the past 10 years--and in the next 10  years could double, with disastrous results for health and  tourism.  <H5>  City Smog Guidelines Exceeded Twenty-Four Times </H5>   Pollution guidelines have been violated 24 times in Cape  Town  so far this year, says medical officer of health Michael Popkiss.    Whether smog is visible depends on weather conditions, when  warm air traps pollutants in a process known as inversion.    But even if pollution is not visible, it is there--and  suspicion is directed mainly at petrol-driven engines and  wood-burning in areas without electricity.    ``The only way to reduce air pollution is to get it at  source, and you can do that only by making cars with  cleaner-burning engines, with catalytic converters and a proper  fuel economy system,'' said Dr. Popkiss.    He said unleaded petrol was a prerequisite for cleaner  air--but warned that using unleaded petrol in cars without  catalytic converters could worsen air pollution.    However, unleaded petrol and catalytic converters were not  enough.    ``You have to stop cars ... and for this you need a better  system of public transport.''    The solution is to increase drastically the cost of using  private cars to raise funds for public transport, says a city  council report.    A city planner's draft report on a future public transport  policy said that even if traffic growth increased more slowly,  travelling speeds would drop by about 40 percent as congestion  worsened.    ``The detrimental impacts on the health of Cape Town people  and tourism, worth about R1,4 billion a year, will be severe.''    The report said Cape Town had to focus on public transport  if  it was to become one of the great cities of the world. This  could be done by introducing policies on parking provision and  fees, planning and development.    ``Such a policy will undoubtedly be unpopular with many  because for public transport to succeed, the playing fields must  be levelled and motorists must start to pay the true cost of  using cars.''    ``Motoring will become more expensive and the revenue  collected should be used to finance public transport  improvements.''    A metropolitan transport authority ``with sufficient  statutory power, accountability and financial clout'' was needed  to coordinate bus, rail, and minibus taxi services.    The population of metropolitan Cape Town was growing by  about  three percent a year and most new residents would be poor people  living on the periphery of the city.    The number of travellers, and distances travelled, would  increase dramatically. Most would have to use public transport.    A policy was needed to ensure public transport was  affordable  by all and offered an attractive alternative to car commuters.    ``It is likely spending in the new South Africa will focus  on  people's basic needs--housing, jobs, education and health.''    ``Convenient, affordable and efficient transport will be  essential in restructuring the apartheid city, but given the  backlog of needs the construction of transport facilities is  likely to be a low priority on the government's shopping list,''  the report said.    Proposed policies included:     -  The city council supporting the principle that the  motorist should meet the true cost of car commuting, and funds  raised in this way be used to subsidise public transport.    -  The council investigates and promotes measures to dissuade  commuting in single-occupant vehicles.    -  The council recognises the urgent need to improve public  transport termini.    -  Subject to availability of funds, the council will give  priority to the provision of public transport facilities.    -  A parking policy that encourages use of public transport.    -  A review of public transport subsidies to benefit users.    -  Support and promotion of high-density development along  public  transport routes.       City planner Neville Riley and medical officer of health  Michael Popkiss said the report should be put to the  metropolitan transport advisory board and the Western Cape  Economic Development Forum for discussion.</p>

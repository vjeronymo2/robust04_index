			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRICTEST ABORTION BILL INSPIRES CALL FOR POTATO BOYCOTT  </P> <P> Faced with a potentially disastrous nationwide boycott of Idaho potatoes, Gov.  Cecil Andrus said Monday he will seek advice before deciding whether to sign a  measure that would become the most restrictive state abortion law in the  nation.  </P> <P> The bill, which has been passed by both houses of the Legislature, probably  will arrive on the governor's desk today.  </P> <P> The bill would ban all abortions except in cases of severe fetal deformity,  threat to the mother's health or in cases of rape or incest.  </P> <P> Since the Senate gave final legislative approval to the bill last Thursday,  opponents of the measure have held candlelight vigils every night outside the  Capitol.  </P> <P> Abortion-rights activists in other states have vowed to launch a nationwide  boycott of Idaho potatoes if Andrus fails to veto the bill. Potatoes are  Idaho's No. 1 cash crop. Idaho accounted for 27.2% of the nation's potato  production in 1988, more than any other state.  </P> <P> "I consider myself to be pro-life," said Andrus, a three-term Democrat seeking  reelection. "But I reserve the right to handle this legislation the way I  handle any other legislation."  </P></p>

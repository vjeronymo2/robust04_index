			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuwaiti Parliamentary sources have said that Saddam  Husayn's regime is now setting impossible conditions for the  release of the Kuwaiti captives in Iraqi prisons. One of these,  they said, is the release of the 11 Iraqis now on trial in  Kuwait in connection with a plan to assassinate former U.S.  President George Bush. The sources said the regime also wants  Kuwait not to refer to its prisoners as hostages or detainees,  but as missing.    The sources said Kuwait responded through the Arab League,  saying that the Iraqis who are now standing trial in Kuwait  entered their country carrying weapons and bombs (?and tried to  carry out) assassinations, bombings, and terrorist acts. They  have confessed to this and are now in the hands of the Kuwaiti  judiciary. The Kuwaiti captives, on the other hand, are  prisoners and [words indistinct] because the tyrant's forces  kidnapped them by force in front of their families and friends  during the occupation.</p>

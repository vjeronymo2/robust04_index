The preferred alternative is the ``No Action'' alternative. Naval spent fuel removed from nuclear powered ships would be retained in shipping containers at five shipyards: Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine; Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia; Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia; Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington; and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Naval spent fuel also would remain in the Surface Ship Support Barge at Newport News Shipbuilding. The Department of Energy (DOE), with the Navy as a cooperating agency, is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement on longer-term storage of all DOE spent fuel, including Naval spent fuel. The time period evaluated in the short-term storage Environmental Assessment is the period through implementation of the Record of Decision for the DOE Environmental Impact Statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Environmental Assessment discusses alternatives to the preferred alternative and evaluates the environmental impacts of both the preferred and other alternatives. The Environmental Assessment concludes that the environmental impact of any of the alternatives would be very small. Therefore, there is no basis for determining that any of these alternatives would be environmentally preferable to the others. The No Action alternative, which is the preferred alternative, would allow all shipyard work, including refueling and defueling of nuclear powered ships, to continue unimpeded by the short-term accumulation of Naval spent fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program provided a draft of this Environmental Assessment to officials of Virginia, Maine, New Hampshire, Washington, and Hawaii for review and comment. Letters were received from Congressman Norm Dicks of Washington and Mr. T.R. Strong of the State of Washington Department of Health, both of whom agreed that the No Action alternative is appropriate, and Mr. Brian Choy of the State of Hawaii Office of Environmental Quality Control, who had no comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Strong suggested that the Navy and the State of Washington collaborate in monitoring of radiation levels in the vicinity of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and share results of past radiation monitoring. The Program agreed with these suggestions. Mr. Strong also suggested that the Navy pro-actively inform the public of its plans, emphasizing that this is a short-term measure, and not in consideration as a long-term solution. In the letters seeking State comments on the Environmental Assessment, the Navy stated that if the Environmental Assessment justified a Finding of No Significant Impact, the Navy would make the Finding available for public review prior to a final determination. Accordingly, the Program is making this Finding and the Environmental Assessment available to State and local officials, the news media, and the public for a 30 day comment period. The Environmental Assessment on short-term storage of Naval spent fuel evaluates short-term storage only, and the Finding of No Significant Impact would only cover short-term storage. However, it should be noted that long-term storage at shipyards is one of the alternatives being considered for Naval spent fuel in a separate Environmental Impact Statement which DOE is preparing with Navy assistance on spent fuel management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the analysis in the Environmental Assessment, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program considers that the preferred alternative is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). In accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality regulations which allow agencies to determine circumstances under which public review of Findings of No Significant Impact are appropriate, the Program is making this Finding available for public comment for a period of 30 days following the date of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication of this notice. Comments postmarked within the 30 day public comment period will be considered by the Program prior to a final determination. To facilitate review of this matter, copies of the Environmental Assessment have been placed in public libraries in the vicinity of the five shipyards. Additionally, persons desiring a copy of the Environmental Assessment may request one from the address indicated below.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> dates:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the Finding of No Significant Impact may be sent to Mr. Richard A.

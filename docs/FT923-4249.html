			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / SCA abandons alliance with MoDo SVENSKA Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA), the Swedish forestry group, yesterday abandoned its attempt to form a strategic alliance with Mo och Domsjo AB (MoDo), one of its main domestic competitors. At the end of 1990 SCA paid SKr1.4bn (Pounds 136m) for a 31 per cent stake in MoDo's voting rights and 16 per cent of its equity. The intention was to bring about closer co-operation between the two companies, particularly in the production of printing paper. SCA said yesterday it had become apparent that the desired co-operation was no longer possible because of differences of opinion between the two companies. It said SCA's influence on MoDo and its strategic development was very limited as a result. SCA's president and chief executive, Mr Sverker Martin's Lof, is to resign from the MoDo board, 'so that he could consider alternative solutions in the future'. Mr Bo Rydin, SCA's chairman, will remain on the board to look after SCA's investment. SCA said that since it could no longer regard MoDo as an associate, it would no longer account for MoDo's results on an equity basis. MoDo contributed a loss of SKr28m to SCA's earnings in the first four months of this year. SCA said it would now restate its 1992 earnings to account for its holding on the basis of the cost of the acquisition. The company said the value of its holding would be reviewed at the end of this year. Analysts speculated that this could involve a substantial write-down. The shares are believed to have cost around SKr1.4bn, while their present value is around SKr400m. SCA pursued an aggressive strategy of acquisition in the late 1980s, culminating in the Pounds 1.1bn purchase of Reedpack of the UK in 1990. Its attempt to buy Feldmuhle Nobel of Germany was thwarted by its larger rival, the leading Swedish paper maker Stora. At the time of the agreed deal with MoDo, SCA said it did not intend to increase its shareholding, since its financial position was already stretched. Since then the company has been hit by the downturn in the paper industry worldwide, resulting in large lay-offs and sharply reduced profits.</p>

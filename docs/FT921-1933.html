			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why Lautro needs you IF YOU are one of the tens of thousands of investors who bought a single-premium with-profits bond within the past two years, read this. Lautro, the self regulatory body for the life insurance industry, wants to know what you thought you were buying when you signed on the dotted line. After reviewing the advertising literature of six of the largest purveyors of this product - by far the most widely sold insurance product in 1991 - they think you may have been misled. If you were, the product provider will be required to explain matters fully to you in writing and if you are dissatisfied, you may be eligible for a full refund. While exact figures are hard to come by, the industry estimates that some Pounds 3bn of these policies are outstanding. Last week, Lautro sent a letter to all life companies with details it feels may have been misrepresented to consumers in the sales pitch. It has asked for copies of 'sales scripts' - the verbal assurances that were made to you about the product - as well as sales literature, In particular, Lautro is concerned that consumers signed up for the policy believing that it was simply a higher yielding form of building society deposit account, that the current high bonus rates were likely to continue and that withdrawals could be made without loss of principal. Also, Lautro believes the advertising too easily dismisses the ability of the insurance company to cut your bonus. The possibility of a bonus cut appears in the literature as the Market Value Adjustment Rate. What's that? 'And well you may ask,' said a Lautro official. The literature fails to tell you that a bonus based on strong equity performance in a preceding year, may be cut significantly if, for instance, future returns look likely to fall. 'The MVAF has been quite sparingly used in the life insurance industry,' said Melvin Lay, valuations actuary at Norwich Union, which pioneered the with-profits bond beginning in 1989. Furthermore, with-profits bonds have been paying bonuses at an average 8.5 per cent after-tax yield, making them look like very attractive alternatives for those who keep long-term savings in building society accounts. However, Lay says, the type of bonuses being offered by with-profits bonds can only be achieved through equity investments. Norwich Union has largely withdrawn from the market because of the effect the cost of paying bonuses was having on its regulatory reserves. The largest purveyor of with-profits bonds says it believes its literature is not misleading. Tony Kempster, managing director at Prudential Holborn, said the company has sold more than 20,000 policies and made only two refunds to individuals.</p>

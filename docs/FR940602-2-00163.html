			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 6. Offering of In-Lieu Lots. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The appeal decision faulted language in the 1988 policy that made the offering of in-lieu lots mandatory to holders who have received notification that a new permit would not be issued or whose permits have been terminated. (FSM 2347.1,6; FSM 2721,23a,13; FSM 2721.23f; FSH 41.23c.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the 1991 notice of proposed policy, the intent of the 1988 policy was to make the offering of in-lieu lots discretionary. It was use of the word ``shall'' in one sentence of the policy that conveyed the impression that offering of in-lieu lots was mandatory. In addition, however, the appeal decision expressed concern that making in-lieu lots available to holders receiving notice that their use was to be terminated or that they would not receive a new permit limited agency management discretion in determining use of National Forest land. Therefore, each of the four provisions in the 1988 policy dealing with the offering of in-lieu lots was examined. As a result, the 4 provisions dealing with in-lieu lots were revised in the proposed policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The overall policy on offering in-lieu lots to holders who had been notified that a new permit would not be issued or whose permit was being terminated prior to expiration (except when the termination is for noncompliance) was stated at FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6, of the proposed policy. This provision directed agency officials to determine the availability of in-lieu lots for eligible holders. It described sites available for in-lieu lot purposes as those in nonconflicting locations in established recreation residence tracts within the National Forest containing the recreation residences to be removed or in established tracts in adjacent National Forests. Lots appropriate for in-lieu purposes were undeveloped lots within or adjoining established recreation tracts not needed for other public purposes and lots formerly occupied and now vacant. This provision also directed that new recreation residence tracts could not be established for in-lieu lot purposes. This reversed the 1988 policy which stated new recreation residence tracts could be established for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Direction in FSM 2721.23a of the proposed policy, provided that in-lieu lots could be offered when a recreation residence was destroyed or substantially damaged by flood, avalanche, or massive earth movement and the holder was not allowed to rebuild. The 1988 policy stated that every reasonable effort should be made to offer in-lieu lots in this event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed policy in FSM 2721.23f, presented direction in cases of nonrenewal of permits and conversion of lots to alternative public purpose. It stated the lots may be offered if available and not needed for alternative public purposes. The 1988 policy provided that every reasonable effort should be made to offer the lots. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidance in FSH 41.23c of the proposed policy, gave detailed procedures on the offering of in-lieu lots. The offer would be made when notice was given that a new permit would not be issued. If a lot became available within 12 months of the notification it could be offered then. Priority was to be given to lots in the same recreation residence tract or an expansion of that tract. Holders would be allowed 90 days to accept the offer of an in-lieu lot and upon acceptance the lot would be reserved for that holder and a new permit issued. A fee would not be charged until construction of the improvements began. The lot reservation would expire if the holder failed to occupy the in-lieu lot on agreed upon schedule. Holders accepting offers could continue to use the current lot until the permit expired, but they should be prepared to move to the new lot 24 months prior to permit expiration. If accepted by the previous owner, the offer of an in-lieu lot would be extended to a new owner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Handbook guidance differed in several respects from the 1988 policy. The proposed guidance limited availability of lots to those becoming available to 12 months. Tracts could not be established specifically for in-lieu lot purposes. Holders were to be given a new permit when the offer of an in-lieu lot was accepted, a new requirement. Fees were to be charged when construction began rather than when improvement of the lot began, a clarification. Holders were to be prepared to move within 24 months of permit expiration rather than when the current use was removed, also a clarification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There were 359 responses to the in-lieu lot provisions of the proposed policy. Several respondents felt that the Assistant Secretary's appeal decision required only that the 1988 policy be changed to assure that the offering of in-lieu lots was not mandatory. Respondents overwhelmingly objected to the changes made by the proposed policy from the 1988 policy. Summarized, the respondents felt that the number of sites available for in-lieu lots available should be as large as possible and should include authority to establish new tracts for this purpose. The general belief was that a weak in-lieu lot program, when coupled with a policy of no new tracts for this purpose, would, through attrition, eventually lead to removal of all or most recreation residences. A much smaller number of respondents maintained that the offering of in-lieu lots should be discretionary and that no new tracts should be established for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents also objected to the removal of the phrase ``every reasonable effort'' when directing local officials to provide in-lieu lots to terminated or nonrenewal permits. They felt that this subtle change in wording reversed long-standing Forest Service policy to offer in-lieu lots in nonconflicting locations. They recommended that the proposed policy be strengthened or the language of the 1988 policy be restored. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

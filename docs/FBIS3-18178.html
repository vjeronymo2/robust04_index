Tanir sent a letter to fundamentalist Prosperity Party  member  Hasan Mezarci, who led 11 more deputies in the initiative,  saying that, "your motion which attempts to degrade a certain  period of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and Mustafa Kemal  Ataturk, our great leader who has founded the Turkish state and  republic and which, hurts the feelings of the public opinion,  has been rejected, under article 68 of the parliamentary  regulations."    Anti-Kemalist politician Hasan Mezarci, who announces in  every occasion that he is against the secularist and democratic  principles of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, led eleven more deputies  from various parties, in his initiative.    As the only True Path Party member in the motion, Melik  Firat  had been subjected to disciplinary action by his party just  after the motion was handed to parliament, another signatory,  Okkes Sendiller from Great Unity Party (UBP) decided to withdraw  his name from the motion.</p>

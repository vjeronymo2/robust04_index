Despite their casualties, Azerbaijan's Armed Forces made  a significant effort to advance against the Armenian defense  positions on various parts of the front line.    Bagram Aghadzhanyan, our correspondent in Stepanakert,  quotes  a statement by the NKR Defense Forces that Azerbaijan's military  units tried to attack Matavis and [placename indistinct] in  Mardakertskiy Rayon early yesterday morning. Serious clashes  took place and both sides had casualties. An effort is being  made to determine the outcome of the fighting. Elsewhere, NKR  units rebuffed the latest enemy attacks in Kelbadzharskiy Rayon.    Six of Azerbaijan's military aircraft violated NKR airspace  for 10 minutes and bombed several peaceful residential areas in  Askeranskiy and Mardakertskiy Rayons yesterday.</p>

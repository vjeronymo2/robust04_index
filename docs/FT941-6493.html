			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: German repo move sparks tentative recovery After last week's sell-off, most European government bond markets firmed slightly yesterday. However, with long-term investors still sidelined and cash dealings thin, dealers said the consolidation remains fragile. German government bonds sparked the early rally, fuelled by hopes for imminent credit easing after the Bundesbank called for bids on variable-rate securities repurchase agreements. After three months of freezing the repo rate at 6 per cent, the central bank's return to variable-rate repos - where banks bid what they are willing to pay - raised hopes that the repo rate could continue to edge lower. However, dealers were split over the likely extent of the easing at today's repo allocation. While some expect the rate to fall by between five and 10 basis points, others said banks might bid very cautiously given recent money market tightness. Bidding is further complicated by the fact that the Bundesbank's lower minimum reserve requirement takes effect today, releasing substantial liquidity. Bunds' strength was underpinned by strength in the US Treasury market on encouraging comments from Federal Reserve Board governor Lawrence Lindsey. However, traders started taking profits in the afternoon, dragging taking the March Bund future back below 97.00, which is seen to make it technically vulnerable to the downside. Comments from Bundesbank council member Mr Otmar Issing exacerbated late weakness. In an interview with AP-Dow Jones, he said January M3 money supply could be in the double digits, well outside the Bundesbank's 4-6 per cent target range. The numbers are expected to be released in the second half of this week. A further pressure on bunds was impending supply, with the Treuhandanstalt due to issue new bonds today. Most traders expect some DM10bn of 10-year paper, but say it is likely to meet a lukewarm reception. 'Most of the bonds will probably land on banks' books - investors are still quite wary and there's just no retail demand,' said Mr Torsten Bohler, senior bond analyst at UBS. French government bonds tracked Bunds higher, inspired by hopes that a lower German repo rate might give the Bank of France fresh scope for easing after last week's small 0.10 point cut in the intervention rate, to 6.10 per cent. The March notional OAT future rose 0.92 point to 126.96, though it fell back to around 126.76 in after-hours trading. UK gilts held on to most of their gains, with the March long gilt future closing at 113 7/16 , up  5/8 point on the day. 'It was a quiet day - we saw some buying, but not in great size,' said a gilt salesman at a large UK bank. Japanese government bonds held on to their soft tone ahead of today's release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan economic report, and the auction of 10-year bonds. Mr James Greener, economist at Toyo Trust, said he expected some Y1,200bn of 4.1 per cent 10-year bonds to be sold. 'Retail demand is likely to be very slack - especially after the disappointing four-year auction last week.' US Treasury prices firmed across the board yesterday in the wake of a report from Chicago-area purchasing managers viewed as bullish for bonds. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/2 at 94 21/32 , yielding 6.661 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  3/32 at 99 29/32 , to carry a yield of 4.658 per cent. After firming overnight, thanks to buying in Tokyo, prices were boosted by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's February report when trading opened in New York. The report showed that the February index of business activity in the region rose from 59.6 per cent to 60.3 per cent last month. Although an increase had been expected, what pleased bond dealers and investors was a decline in the price and employment components of the purchasing managers' index. Traders said the data might normally have had little impact on the market. However, with bonds looking oversold in the wake of recent heavy losses, it only took the slightest piece of good news to attract buyers, although most of those were in the market covering short positions. The market was also relieved that, following a worrying Philadelphia Federal Reserve report that pointed to rising prices in the region, Chicago purchasing managers said prices locally showed signs of easing in February.</p>

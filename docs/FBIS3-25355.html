			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Monrovia, l5 Feb (AFP) -- Liberia's rival factions  began fresh talks here on Tuesday [15 February] to try to  overcome political and military problems which have for months  blocked implementation of last year's peace agreement. The main  sticking points are disarmament of the various armed groups and  the setting up of transitional institutions ahead of elections  supposed to be staged this month.    U.N. special envoy Trevor Gordon Somers is chairing the  latest closed-doors parley. A marathon six-week session which  opened in December made no progress. Delegates said they  regarded the new discussions as a "last chance" to sort out  their differences.    The interim government is at loggerheads with the main rebel  movement the Patriotic Front and its rival United Liberation  Movement, which are both insisting on getting the key ministries  of foreign affairs, defence, justice and finance.    The new round of talks is being attended by General John  Inienger, commander of the military monitoring force of some  l9,000 troops stationed in Liberia by the 16-nation Economic  Community of West African States since August 1990.</p>

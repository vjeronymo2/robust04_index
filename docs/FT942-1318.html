			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Olivetti and GM arm in satellite joint venture Olivetti, the Italian computer manufacturer, and Hughes Network Systems, a subsidiary of General Motors of the US, have formed a joint venture to exploit the market for business satellite communications in Europe. Each company will own 50 per cent of the venture, called Hughes Olivetti Telecom. The first service, Hotstar, will provide interactive data and voice links between customer sites at a monthly rent of Dollars 280-Dollars 380 a site. Each partner has invested an initial Dollars 2m in infrastructure. Total investment over the first five years is expected to be Dollars 25m. The venture is targeted at large companies with more than 30 sites. It aims to build and manage a pan-European network based on a form of satellite communications called VSat (very small aperture terminal), which is increasingly being used to provide two-way communications services to businesses in the US and Europe. The first 'hub' for the service will be based in London. Talks are under way on establishing hubs in other European countries. Transmission licences are being agreed on a case-by-case basis. The initial investment cost is comparatively low, because Hughes is already an important manufacturer of satellite communications equipment  - it claims 70 per cent of the world VSat market - and because Olivetti has already established a Europe-wide marketing and computer services network. The companies say the new infrastructure will meet the telecommunications requirements of large corporations. However, the intention is also to offer new services such as software distribution and personalised newspapers. VSat systems are able to support a combination of voice and data communications, and can be cheaper than terrestrial equivalents. Some 75,000 two-way VSat systems have been installed in the US.</p>

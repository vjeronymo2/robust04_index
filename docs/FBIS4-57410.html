			<p>BFN     [Text] In a news conference, Brigadier General Luis Perez,  chief of the Military Industries Union, UIM [Union de Industrias  Militares], reported that this year the UIM will earmark 28  percent of its production for the national economy. Gen. Perez  added that in 1993, the UIM allotted 25 percent of its  production to the internal market and it intends to contribute  40 percent of its production in 1995.    He explained that in the past, the UIM had only provided  service to the Armed Forces, but that due to the current  difficulties, it has decided to help the national economy.  These industries manufacture carts for sugarcane transport,  cutting tools, agricultural appliances, wheelbarrows,  compressors, and other items in great demand.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUSHDIE DENIES BETRAYAL OF MUSLIM HERITAGE  </P> <P> Author Salman Rushdie, in hiding for almost a year after his novel "The Satanic  Verses" drew Iranian death threats, says he has not betrayed his Islamic  heritage.  </P> <P> "I am not the enemy of my own people," he said in a telephone interview  published in today's Guardian newspaper.  </P> <P> "I do not feel like the enemy of my people."  </P> <P> Rushdie, 42, born to Muslim parents in India, declined to comment on his  security situation but said, "You shouldn't assume that I have very much  freedom at all."  </P> <P> He went into hiding in Britain last February after Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini called on Muslims to kill him for blasphemy.  </P> <P> "One would wish the thing to come to an end," he said. "But I'm not the maker  of the problem. I think if some of the people who protested about the book took  the trouble to read it, they would see that it is not unsympathetic to them."  </P> <P> Rushdie said he has received many letters of support from Muslims.  </P> <P> Asked whether he plans to write a book about his present situation, Rushdie  replied: "It's not a question I can really begin to think about at the moment.  In the future, who knows?"  </P></p>

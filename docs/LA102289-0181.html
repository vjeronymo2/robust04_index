Gregory Scott  Scroggins, 27, bit David Crook as the officer was investigating a dispute  between Scroggins and his roommate in January. Crook said he has tested  negative for the virus twice. Scroggins said he bit because the officer had him  in a chokehold and he could not breathe. An Emory University medical school  professor said there have been no confirmed cases of the virus being  transmitted through saliva.  </P></p>

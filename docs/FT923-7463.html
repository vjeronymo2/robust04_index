			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / People: Bodies Politic Derek Lee and Alec Wilson, who are both registrars at the Registry of Friendly Societies, have been appointed the first two commissioners on the FRIENDLY SOCIETIES COMMISSION which is being set up to regulate friendly societies and promote protection of their funds. ***** Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers and a non-executive director of Siemens Plessey Electronic Systems and TI, has become a member of the NATIONAL DEFENCE INDUSTRIES COUNCIL. He was head of defence export services at the Ministry of Defence before joining Vickers. ***** Maureen Theobald, principal of the Nightingale and Guy's College of Nursing and Midwifery, has been appointed Chairman-Designate of the English National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting. ***** David Thomson, originally a trustee nominated by Portsmouth City Council, has been appointed chairman of the PORTSMOUTH NAVAL BASE PROPERTY TRUST, in succession to Robin Bishop. Thomson did his National Service in the Navy and was subsequently a lieutenant commander in RNR; he is a recently retired director of Lazard Brothers, a member of the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission, on the court of the Henley Management College, and chairman of the Fitzwilliam Museum Trust in Cambridge. ***** Rab Telfer has stepped down as executive chairman of BSI Standards, the largest division of the British Standards Institution, after three years in the job. Telfer, 64, whose children gave him a metal detector 'as a retirement present several jobs ago', retired as chairman of the petrochemicals division of ICI in 1981. But he then became chairman and managing director of Mather &amp; Platt during a period of stern rationalisation; in the mid 1980's he spent four years as director of the Manchester Business School; and he then chaired a management buy out of the fasteners division of GKN. The achievement he claims for his time at BSI, during which the approach of the European single market has greatly expanded the load, is a major transformation in the efficiency of what is primarily a voluntary organisation. When he arrived, about a year would elapse between the technical committees signing off on standards and the final product being published, whereas it now takes around six weeks, according to Telfer. He has recently been appointed chairman of the governors of the new University of Teesside and is also on the Higher Education Funding Council for England, which officially comes into being early next year. The BSI has not yet appointed a successor.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOBEL PEACE PRIZE AWARDED TO GORBACHEV  </P> <P> In response to Cal Thomas' "Reagan's Doing, Gorbachev's Glory" (Commentary,  Oct. 19):  </P> <P> The Nobel Peace Prize for Reagan, not Gorbachev? Sour grapes! While Gorbachev  was disengaging Leonid Brezhnev's army from Afghanistan, Reagan had resumed  U.S. military aid to nuclear Iraq, reversing the embargo Jimmy Carter had begun  in response to Saddam Hussein's atrocities -- crimes that both Reagan and Bush  have chosen to ignore until recently when an excuse was needed to prepare for  war over oil.  </P> <P> Gorbachev would have reformed the Soviet Union regardless of who was President  of the United States; but the Berlin Wall would still be standing today if the  Soviet conservative were still in power. Reagan deserves some credit for  neutralizing the American war lobby over the issue of cooperating with our  former enemies, but compared to the magnitude of Gorbachev's challenges to the  conservative rottenness of his own political party, Reagan's contribution is  minor.  </P> <P> DENNIS LUCARELLI, San Diego  </P></p>

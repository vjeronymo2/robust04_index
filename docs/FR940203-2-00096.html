			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Before the NRC approves a decommissioning plan, licensees can be allowed to undertake any decommissioning activity (as the term ``decommission'' is defined in 10 CFR 50.2) that does not: (a) Foreclose the release of the site for possible unrestricted use, (b) significantly increase decommissioning costs, (c) cause any significant environmental impact not previously reviewed, or (d) violate the terms of the licensee's existing license (e.g., OL, POL, or OL with confirmatory shutdown order) or 10 CFR 50.59 as applied to the existing license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This criterion seeks to ensure that funds are only used for those decommissioning activities that would be allowed to proceed before the NRC approves a decommissioning plan. Items (a) and (b) have already been addressed by this policy statement. For items (c) and (d), a licensee and the NRC would evaluate the proposed activity to ensure that the activity may proceed under the current license and that the proposed activity will not result in any significant environmental impact not previously reviewed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, the NRC may permit licensees to use their decommissioning funds for the decommissioning activities permitted above (as the term ``decommission'' is defined in 10 CFR 50.2), notwithstanding the fact that their decommissioning plans have not yet been approved by the NRC. After review of the licensee's proposed activities and fund withdrawal using the above criteria, the NRC would permit the licensee to use decommissioning funds and to undertake the proposed activities by tacitly consenting to the proposed withdrawals by not interposing, within a specified time, an objection to the licensee's proposal. The NRC would need 60 days to complete an effective review of a licensee's proposal and justification of how the above criteria will be met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Ancillary Issue <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the past, licensees have asked the NRC informally whether they would be able to withdraw funds from their trusts to pay for developing the &sect;50.82 decommissioning plan and for other post-shutdown administrative expenses. The NRC believes that these withdrawals should be allowed before the NRC approves the final decommissioning plan, provided the licensee meets the following guidelines: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The sum of withdrawals for such purposes should be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> , that is, less than $5 million. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In talking informally with several licensees, the NRC understands that most licensees expect to spend from $1 million to $3 million for completing decommissioning plans and for immediate post-shutdown administrative expenses. The amount of $5 million, therefore, is based on a ``best-guess'' estimated, but is small enough not to significantly deplete the decommissioning trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The decommissioning trust balance would not fall below an amount needed for safe storage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The licensee provided for these costs in its site-specific decommissioning cost estimate and increased its overall trust fund balances accordingly. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 12th day of January, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James L.

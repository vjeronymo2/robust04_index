			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Arts: Pictures worth picking up Autolycus, 'picker-up of unconsidered trifles', we know as the rogue and pedlar of The Winter's Tale, which brings me to a seasonal swag-bagful, not of trifles exactly, but of current offerings that otherwise might well pass unnoticed and well worth picking-up. Glen Baxter is that not uncommon type, the naturally funny man who would be taken seriously, the fool or Jaques, mordant, ironical, but funny nonetheless. Fortunately for us, he has abandoned previous attempts at overt seriousness, and reverted to being as funny as ever with his surreal confection of schoolboy-schoolgirl heroics, camp cowboys and art-aesthetical jokes, and all worked up in idiosyncratic pastiche of the juvenile illustration of the 1930s. It is for us to work out whether the results are art or not. But what else are we to make of these 'Further Blandishments', as he calls them? A 'Big Bertha' cannon looms over the landscape: 'He was known not to take kindly to trespassers' runs the caption. A cowboy comes galloping down the Long Gallery, along with the information that 'Hank's tour of the Louvre was usually completed in slightly under 18 minutes.' 'The night before the big match, Billy liked to put in a little extra practice,' by kicking anvils into goal. Quite where all this will lead him, who can say, but as conceptual art, Baxter's special variety certainly has popular appeal. It is a recurrent theme that our London view of Scottish painting is arbitrary and limited, but it must also be said that the Mercury Gallery has always done its best to repair the deficiency. David Michie, a long-time regular, now reappears after six years with as strong a show as any he has had. Until lately head of painting at the Edinburgh College of Art, he must have seen too many younger, lesser Scottish talents pass on to wider success and recognition, but I doubt that worries him too much. His subject, meanwhile, remains the intimate landscape of garden border and flower-bed, and the more introspective, enclosed world of the garden pond, with its darting ornamental fish, glancing surfaces and ambiguously redoubled spaces. These he paints with a deceptive fauvist directness and simplicity, and a Matisse-like purity of colour. Yet there is nothing brash nor 'see here' about them, but rather a quiet modesty and self-effacement that slowly draws the viewer to them. They are as good as anything being done of their kind. David Parfitt's present subject is the landscape of Crete and Macedonia, worked on paper, sometimes in oil but mostly in water-colour. There is no greater absurdity in art than the conventional hierarchy of the media that puts oil before water-colour and canvas before paper. It is what the artist does with his chosen and appropriate medium that matters, and here Parfitt shows us large and truly substantial paintings, that are as they are because they are in water-colour. The handful of oil paintings confirm the point, not by any qualitative distinction but by the simple fact of technical difference - neither better nor worse, but different. Where the one sort is light and shimmering on the surface, the other is dense and opaque, the mood now fresh, now heavier. Parfitt has a particular gift for the description of architecture, not as an exercise in close inspection, but generally and collectively: the cluster of houses set among the trees, the village street at a distance in the sun-lit valley below. Terry Lee is another painter of landscape, and also of the studio interior and still-life. Here I must declare my interest, for this show came of my suggestion and my support is therefore implicit. He, too, is seen too seldom in London. He is a romantic, idealising the landscape, whether at home in Derbyshire or in Spain. All is apparently straight-forward: flower in pot, bird in cage, artist in studio, landscape at a distance, all properly established in its particular space; yet all is subtle and complex. The spaces shift and alter; the curtains become landscape; the mirror leads into another world. Stan Smith and Geoffrey Humphries, showing together, afford a strong but sympathetic contrast. Both work from the life-model, but where Humphries stays close to the character and form of the particular model, Smith is more apt to generalise, the light filtering through the blinds to fall in descriptive stripes across the figure. Humphries also shows a number of studies of Venice, not the hackneyed tourist views, but rather the more personal and intimate face of the city in which he has lived and worked for nearly 30 years. A group of his larger life drawings is featured in the mixed exhibition at Collyer-Bristow, in which Smith also shows. And there is WH Patterson's annual Christmas Show, which, like any such exercise, would hardly hope to satisfy every taste, leaving it very much to the visitor to take his pick. The New English Art Club supplies the substantial core, supplemented by invited outsiders. I noticed some small landscapes by Julian Halsby, Victor Willis and Edward Fairfax-Lucy, Susan Ryder's interiors, the large pastel conversation pieces by Tom Coates, and, in particular, the small, authoritative landscapes by Colin Hayes.

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: ISMA stands at crossroads of a radical change - An extension of the association's TRAX system presages a shift in identity Munich was an appropriate venue for last week's annual meeting of the International Securities Market Association (ISMA), the trade association and self-regulatory body for the Eurobond market. Like the Bavarian capital, ISMA is on the surface solid and prosperous, yet it faces some tough choices about its future role in Europe. At the most superficial level the conference was uneventful, even self-satisfied. Last year was, after all, a bumper year for most Eurobond firms. ISMA's annual accounts were approved without question, and board members were elected unopposed. Even an increase in the annual membership fee was passed almost without complaint. However, seasoned observers of the Eurobond market noted that the conference contained the seeds of radical change. In particular, the time may be approaching when ISMA must decide whether it is an investment exchange, a regulatory body, a systems supplier or a trade association. The catalyst for change could be TRAX, the electronic trade matching and confirmation system introduced by ISMA in 1989. Although TRAX is now used by 260 international bond firms from London to Hong Kong, the system does not operate at anything near full capacity. To make use of its potential, ISMA officials have proposed that the system should be extended to cover equity transactions. ISMA is one of three suppliers - along with the London Stock Exchange and the Thompson group - chosen to supply an electronic trade confirmation system for equities to UK institutional investors. It is a measure of ISMA's sure-footedness as a systems house that it was chosen following a tender by 20 potential suppliers. The conference was used to set out a timetable for this development. The TRAX database is already being loaded with the details of around 100,000 liquid international equities. The technical specifications for the system have been drawn up by a consultative group of banks and investment managers. Programming work will begin this month and should be completed by the year-end. Those close to the project were adamant that the task was easily within the technological limits of TRAX. If the deadlines are met, ISMA should have a fully operational equity trade confirmation system to offer to investment institutions by the start of next year. The marketing drive has already begun. Whether TRAX is capable of beating either the London Stock Exchange's Seaqual system or Thompson's Oasis remains to be seen. But if TRAX were capable of winning business, there would be no reason why the system should stop there. It is also within the limits of TRAX to carry real-time dealing prices and to meet regulatory trade reporting requirements. If institutional demand for these functions surfaced, ISMA would start to look more like an investment exchange than a trade association. ISMA has already shown itself to have similar ambitions for bonds. In the late 1980s, it proposed that TRAX should carry 'real time' trading prices for bonds, contributing to market transparency. The proposal was roundly rejected by the association's membership. Many bond firms saw increased price transparency as a threat to profit margins which were already painfully thin. Some within the association still regard TRAX as a Trojan horse. Even after a year of fat profits, there is no sign that opposition to TRAX as a carrier of real-time bond prices has weakened. But it may be more difficult for the membership to object should ISMA prove able to provide investment institutions with similar exchange-style services for cross-border equities. Extension into the international equities business is certainly seen as the way forward by many Eurobond market participants. For example, the International Primary Markets Association (IPMA), the trade association for new issue firms, has started to rewrite its rules on equity issues in recognition of the dramatic growth in the 'Euro-equity' market. ISMA has already found that its hybrid character does not fit neatly with the new European regulatory framework for securities trading being designed by European Community governments. In particular, a number of European countries led by France have proposed that the draft Investment Services Directive (ISD) should restrict securities trading to 'recognised investment exchanges'. As currently constituted ISMA would not qualify, not least because it has no formal listing or issuer reporting requirements. Several European governments, including the UK and German authorities, with the vocal support of ISMA, object to the French proposals. As a result the draft ISD has been deadlocked for months. However, there was informed speculation circulating in Munich last week that the Dutch government was softening its opposition to the French-led proposals. Whether the issue is forced by European regulation or the success of TRAX, it is likely that ISMA will sooner or later have to choose a clearer identity. There are signs that it is preparing the ground. The increase in membership fee was proposed even though the association turned in a big surplus last year. Capital and reserves are quite openly being built to meet 'future challenges'. The shape of these challenges became a little clearer in Munich last week.</p>

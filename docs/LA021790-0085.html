			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FAN PUT TYSON, KING DOWN FOR THE COUNT  </P> <P> Once again the big-money people of boxing, the rich, the selfish money-hungry  crooks are going into the gutter for the almighty dollar. They don't care about  right or wrong or about Mike Tyson or Buster Douglas.  </P> <P> All they care about is the money they are not going to make because of the  outcome of this event.  </P> <P> I love Mike Tyson. He is a great boxer and a fine man and he will probably win  a rematch, but right is right and nobody has the right to take away what  Douglas won. He beat Tyson badly and the people who control boxing don't like  it because it costs them loads of money.  </P> <P> The credibility of boxing is on the line once again because big money has been  hit in the pocket book.  </P> <P> Tony Altieri  </P> <P> Vista  </P></p>

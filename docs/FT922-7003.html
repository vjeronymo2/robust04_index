			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / New challenge made to German currency role in the EMS THE FRENCH franc is just as important as the D-Mark in the European Monetary System, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, said yesterday, issuing a fresh challenge to the anchor role of the German currency in the EMS, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The future single European currency would be built around all its members and not just the D-Mark, the central bank governor said. Mr de Larosiere's remarks, on the eve of the Franco-German summit, underline France's efforts to make the franc a strength to rival the D-Mark before the projected single currency comes into effect by the end of this decade. 'The franc is not in the D-Mark zone,' he said. Nobody could deny that the D-Mark had been the anchor of the European Monetary System for years, said Mr de Larosiere. But 'we are now coming to a phase in our monetary relations where there is much more equality between countries and where France's performance is rather better than its partners,' he said. France, Denmark and Luxembourg were the only countries currently able to fulfil all the criteria for monetary union, he pointed out. 'So the notion of this mono-currency anchored on to the D-Mark gives way to the real necessity for a collective anchor and a common monetary policy,' he said.</p>

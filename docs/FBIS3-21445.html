			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mihir Mukherjee: "CPI(M) (Communist Party of </F> India-Marxist) in Troubled Waters Over Corruption, Ideology"]    [Text] More than two years after the CPI(M)'s [Communist  Party of India-Marxist] Party Congress decided in Madras to  redraft the party programme--and set up a committee for this  purpose--no progress has been made in this regard.    There has been no amendment to the party progamme, despite  significant changes in the political situation both within the  country and abroad. The redrafting committee, which includes Mr  Jyoti Basu and Mr Anil Biswas, editor of GANASAKTI, as  representatives from West Bengal, met last month in New Delhi  but is reportedly yet to come out with any concrete proposals.    In fact, senior leaders say that the CPI(M) finds itself in  a  dilemma over the policy that it should follow. Sources say that  the 1964 party programme, which borrowed heavily from the  Chinese line of the Progressive Democratic Front, now seems  anachronistic considering the momentous changes in Beijing  which, of late, has been cosying up to the International  Monetary Fund.    This ideological crisis has been deepened by the break-up of  the Soviet Union and the current political instability in Russia.    However, the State CPI(M) has apparently little time to  deliberate on these theoretical issues as its leaders are  reportedly busy suppressing internecine conflicts and charges of  corruption against party leaders.    Veteran leaders say that the conflicts within the party can  be gauged by the demand for State plenums. Such demands have  been raised in Kerala and Tripura, two strongholds of the party.  Some time ago, such a demand was raised in West Bengal by the  former State Education Minister, Mr Partha Dey.    Dissident leaders in the State CPI(M) say that corruption  has  been pushed to the top of the party's agenda in the State. They  allege that it has become so rampant and widespread that even  the Chief Minister, Mr Jyoti Basu, who earlier preferred to  gloss over the complaints has reportedly expressed serious  concern.    Sources said that Mr Basu was informed by the Centre of the  involvement of local CPI(M) leaders in the alleged pilferage of  Metro Railway property from Noapara stockyard and Railway  property from Kancharapara. Responding to this, Mr Basu  reportedly asked his party secretary, Mr Sailen Dasgupta, to  probe the matter.    However, sources say that the party hiearchy now finds the  situation beyond its control. Mr Dasgupta reportedly called a  meeting of the local committee of the party at Baranagor to look  into the complaints of Metro Railway contractors. However,  sources said that he could not attend the meeting owing to stiff  resistance from a section of the party.    Dissidents allege that in North and South 24-Parganas, the  party is virtually split between haves and have nots--"those who  can make money and those who cannot."    The CPI(M) leadership is allegedly unable to take drastic  action as corruption has reportedly spread its network far and  wide. Disgruntled CPI(M) leaders allege that in South  24-Parganas a bitter confrontation is being witnessed over  several bheris where a strong lobby--headed by a  State Minister and close associates of the party  leadership--calls the shots.    Many in the rank and file of the party complain that the  party leadership does not take action against the people at the  top but take disciplinary measures against those at the bottom  of the hiearchy. This has been indicated, they allege, by the  relatively light punishment meted out to the Calcutta district  committee members, who were allegedly close to the satta don,  Rashid Khan.    Members of the inner circle of the party say that in the  context of the crisis looming over the party, Mr Basu is now  looking for a relatively easy way out. Sources say that,  therefore, an early election cannot be ruled out.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Cooper's ill-health prompts board reshuffle at Upjohn UPJOHN, the US pharma-ceuticals group, announced a reshuffling of its top management yesterday following the unexpected deterioration in the health of its chief executive, Mr Theodore Cooper. The company named Mr Ley Smith as president and chief operating officer with the responsibilities of the chief executive in Mr Cooper's absence. Mr Smith was previously vice-chairman. Mr William Parfet, the son of Mr Cooper's predecessor, was named vice-chairman. He was previously president of the company. Mr Cooper, 64, discovered he had bone marrow cancer in January. The cancer was diagnosed at an early stage and Upjohn had hoped it would not affect Mr Cooper's ability to lead the company. Upjohn's board held a special meeting yesterday after Mr Cooper was moved into intensive care as a result of a lung infection and respiratory failure. His condition was described as critical but stable. Mr Cooper joined Upjohn in 1980 and succeeded Mr Ray Parfet as chairman in 1987.</p>

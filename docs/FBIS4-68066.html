			<p>Guards   <F P=102>   JN0305151694 London AL-WASAT in Arabic 2-8 May 94 pp 19, 20 </F> <F P=103> JN0305151694 </F> <F P=104>  London AL-WASAT </F> <F P=105>  Arabic </F> BFN   <F P=106> ["Text of a Dialogue" with Shaykh Na'im Qasim, deputy </F> secretary general of Hizballah, by Faysal Jallul in Beirut; date  not given]    [Excerpts] Jallul: Hizballah is at odds with the  Lebanese State, and therefore, it has to either accept or reject  it. It seems to us that your party has decided to adapt to the  situation. This is clear because it did not respond to the  al-Ghubayrah incident and because it takes part in parliamentary  action and politics.    Qasim: Adaptation usually means a relinquishment  of principles. This is wrong and unacceptable. Adherence to  principles, however, does not necessarily mean a military clash  with those with whom we differ. The West may want to promote  the idea that any ideological and political difference with a  party like ours will inevitably lead to a military clash. We in  Lebanon have chosen the way of clashes with the Israeli enemy  only. On the internal level, we believe that ideological and  political differences should not lead to military clashes. We  also still believe in the need to promote the Islamic trend and  thought as the best alternative for the people. We offer our  faith to others, share with them issues acceptable to us and  them, explain our views on issues of dispute, and do not believe  in the use of force to impose our will on others.    Therefore, we did not respond militarily to the 13 September  massacre. Those who perpetrated the massacre wanted to draw us  into an internal military conflict to justify the international  security situation, confuse the party, and try to settle some  scores under the pretext that our party opted for a military  clash, especially with the Lebanese Army.    We did not respond militarily because we do not believe in  the use of that method by any side and because we did not want  to be drawn into others' plans whenever and wherever they  wanted. We view the 13 September massacre as part of a plan to  strike at the resistance, and not as a transitory issue designed  to prevent a peaceful demonstration. [passage omitted]    Jallul: You are linked with Iran by spiritual and  strategic ties, and you are linked with Syria by political  relations on the ground. Do you not fear the risks of a  collision between the two parties over the Middle East issue?    Qasim: [passage omitted] In our relations with  Iran and Syria, we do not feel that Iranian-Syrian relations are  contradictory, and we feel that we are in harmony with both  parties. [passage omitted]    Jallul: Will you continue to fight Israel if it  withdraws from Lebanon?    Qasim: We support the Palestinian people in  defending their occupied territories because we regard this  people as rightful. However, details of this support would be  discussed at an appropriate time. [passage omitted]    Jallul: In your slogans you say that "Israel is a  germ" and should be removed from the map. Let us suppose that  the Lebanese state and Israel would sign an agreement for  withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Would you continue to open  fire on Israel across the Lebanese border?    Qasim: We will oppose any agreement that gives  legitimacy to occupation which usurps lands.    Jallul: In Palestine or Lebanon?    Qasim: Anywhere in this occupied territory.  Details on the way of dealing and on confrontation will be left  for the future.    Jallul: Is the Iranian "Revolutionary Guard"  playing a role in the confrontation you are waging with Israel?    Qasim: The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard  does not fight in southern Lebanon. However, it is known that  some of its members are present in the al-Biqa' area; they play  an educational and training role and do not participate in other  matters. This is partly due to the Islamic leadership's  attitude and partly due to the harmony among those concerned in  the region. [passage omitted]</p>

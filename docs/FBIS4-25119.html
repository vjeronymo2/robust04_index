			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hiroyuki Sugiyama] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun -- A Chinese source has disclosed  that, on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen  incident, the CPC issued in mid-May an internal notice for  cadres with instructions that every effort should be made to  maintain stability in their own respective units.    A strong dissatisfaction against society has been noted  among  those on low incomes such as workers at state-run enterprises  and peasants. This feeling has been considerably intensified  because of the growing disparity in incomes, inflation, and  corruption among cadres.    It is reported that while the notice frankly admits the  situation exists, it also points out that "all cadres should try  to understand the issue correctly, and at the same time be  confident it will be eventually settled by the party."    In this way, the CPC has once again called on its cadres to  trust the party. The notice can be said to indicate the current  situation in which the sense of crisis within the party has been  intensified by factors such as disparity in income, inflation,  and corruption, which have caused social instability and now  apply strong pressure on the party.</p>

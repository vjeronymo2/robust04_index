			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Khmer Rouge warned by UN THE head of the United Nations mission in Cambodia threatened yesterday to report Khmer Rouge guerrillas to the Security Council unless they allowed international peace-keepers into zones under their control, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. 'Our people are very frustrated,' Mr Yasushi Akashi told a news briefing. 'Time is running out.' Officials of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) needed to inspect Khmer Rouge zones to prepare for the gathering together and demobilisation of the rival Cambodian armies as laid down in the Paris peace accord signed last October. So far the radical guerrilla group had refused them access, Mr Akashi said. The multinational UNTAC force, eventually to number 23,000 military and civilian personnel, is to implement the accord that ended 13 years of war between the Phnom Penh government and a three-faction guerrilla alliance spearheaded by the Maoist Khmer Rouge. It will supervise the partial disbanding and disarming of the rival armies, monitor a ceasefire and virtually run the devastated country in tandem with a provisional national council uniting all factions until elections next year.</p>

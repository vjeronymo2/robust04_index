The determination to extend this grant is based on the following information: A technical evaluation of the proposed project was performed pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14 (d) and (e). The proposed project is of national interest because data from the proposed effort will contribute to the understanding of heavy-duty alternative fuels emission characteristics and to the mandated Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (AMFA) database. This project comprises a unique collection of laboratory facilities and experienced technical talent focused on heavy-duty alternative fuels transportation. The data and information brought back from the Field Operations effort is communicated to researchers assigned to the several R&amp;D Tasks who, in turn, have established excellent working relationships with engine and vehicle manufacturers. It is determined that the proposed project is meritorious in offering a unique nationwide testing service which relieves the necessity to take buses out of service for extended periods. The procedure proposed by West Virginia University will allow two mobile facilities to perform on-site tests of heavy-duty trucks and buses without removing the vehicles from service and arranging for them to be driven hundreds of miles for testing. The Environmental Protection Agency has also reviewed this concept and supports the technical feasibility of this effort. The probability of success for a second year of operation and a second test unit are excellent. The key personnel assigned to the project have excellent qualifications. DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or planning to conduct such an effort. This effort is not considered suitable for competitive financial assistance. The DOE share of funding is estimated at $3,100,000 for a one-year budget period estimated to be from April 1, 1994 through March 31, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Gaile A.

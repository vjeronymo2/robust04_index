			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Mackler] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Jan 11 (AFP) -- NATO leaders seeking to  restore the tattered credibility of their Bosnia policy Tuesday  [11 January] backed a Franco-British proposal for urgent action,  including air strikes, to free up two Serb-blocked areas.    They called on UN military officials to urgently draft plans  for the relief of a Canadian contingent trapped in the eastern  Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica and to reopen the northeastern  airport of Tuzla.    They also reaffirmed their pledge made in August to use air  power if requested by the United Nations to break the Serb siege  of Sarajevo and other Moslem communities in the former Yugoslav  republic.    The calls came in a communique issued after a two-day summit  of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation that saw the Bosnian  conflict haunt NATO's efforts to build a new European security  order.    Britain and France proposed Monday that NATO offer tactical  air support to allow Dutch UN Protection Force troops to relieve  some 300 Canadians blocked for six months by Serbs in Srebrenica.    They also called for warplanes to open the Tuzla airport, a  key access point for relief deliveries to central Bosnia that  has been blocked by Serb shelling since May 1992 and is  currently guarded by Nordic UN troops.    "We urge the UNPROFOR authorities to draw up urgently plans  to ensure that the blocked rotation of the UNPROFOR contingent  in Srebrenica can take place and to examine how the airport at  Tuzla can be opened for humanitarian relief purposes," the  communique said.    NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner confirmed that the  call included the possible use of NATO warplanes if requested by  the United Nations and reflected a desire for tougher Western  action in the 21-month-old conflict.    "I see a stronger determination to implement UN resolutions  and get rid of the obstacles," he told a news conference. "My  impression is that there is a clear determination not to just  continue the situation as it stands."    Woerner said NATO had the capacity to act effectively in  Bosnia. "The main thing is still the political will and  determination of member countries to use it."    U.S. President Bill Clinton said he backed the  Franco-British  proposal knowing full well that it could involve the use of U.S.  air power. He also reiterated his warning against NATO making  idle threats, adding "we should not say things that we do not  intend to do."    NATO military officials stressed that air power was of only  limited effectiveness against artillery and it would be  extremely difficult to keep Tuzla airport open only with  warplanes.    "These two are classic cases where over a sustained period  of  time one of the parties has not allowed UNPROFOR (the UN  Protection Force) to perform its duties," said a British  official, who asked not to be named.    A French official, who also requested anonymity, said the  credibility of the West and UNPROFOR's mission to protect relief  operations in the former Yugoslav republic was at stake.    "The 16 (NATO members) do not want to make war, but we are  not ready to let local factions do what they want," he said.  Officials said the proposal received support at a dinner  meeting of the government chiefs Monday.    Britain and other countries were opposed to air strikes  around Sarajevo, fearing they could unleash a chain of reprisals  and endanger the lives of UN troops on the ground.    The West's inability to take effective action intruded on  the  summit here aimed at opening a new chapter in NATO's 45-year  history by offering military links with the old East Bloc as a  prelude to eventual enlargement.    On Monday the summit launched a Partnership for Peace  programme that would provide for joint military planning,  training, and other activities and give the Eastern states the  right to NATO consultations in crisis.    But, in the face of strong opposition by Russia, the scheme  stops short of promising automatic membership to participants as  eagerly sought by countries such as Poland, Hungary and the  Czech Republic.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Wallenberg in call to slash state spending Mr Peter Wallenberg, Sweden's most powerful industrialist, yesterday called for deep spending cuts to tackle the country's mounting state debt, saying further deterioration could 'in the worst case' lead to pressure on Wallenberg companies to move their headquarters overseas. Mr Wallenberg's warning, in a newspaper interview, came three days before a general election in which the main issue has been the extent of spending cuts needed in the country's extensive welfare system. These are required to curb the budget deficit and control a public debt running at close to 100 per cent of gross national product. His call followed a similar intervention earlier this week by the chiefs of Volvo, Ericsson, Stora and the Swedish division of ABB, the country's four biggest exporters. They warned that new investments of up to SKr50bn (Pounds 4.2bn) a year were at risk if higher tax levels made Sweden less competitive. Ericsson, Stora and ABB all fall within the Wallenberg sphere of influence. Mr Wallenberg said if the deficit was not controlled there was a risk that Sweden's credit rating would be lowered. In that case, Swedish companies would be under pressure to relocate to secure lower interest rates on the funding they required. 'It can in the worst case make it difficult for us to stay in Sweden,' he told Expressen newspaper. He said the government needed to take 'a motor-saw' to state spending. 'I am genuinely worried for Sweden,' he added. 'If the politicians do not take the situation seriously, with substantial measures against the budget deficit, things will go badly.' The highly unusual interventions in the election campaign by the top industrialists are widely seen as being aimed at the opposition Social Democratic party, which is expected to lead the new government, although latest polls have shown a shift towards the right-centre coalition of Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister. Business leaders have criticised the SDP's emphasis on tax increases to match spending cuts as a way to cut the deficit. But it is not clear to what extent the industrialists' interventions have been responsible for the tilt towards Mr Bildt's coalition. The Social Democrats believe they the business leaders may have irritated many voters instead. Yesterday, Mr Wallenberg's advisers denied were at pains to deny that he had intended any threat to voters about how they should vote - or that he was suggesting the whole Wallenberg empire might move abroad. They protested strongly to the tabloid newspaper Expressen over a front page headline suggesting this. Mr Wallenberg's hitherto high public standing was also under unprecedented fire yesterday over remarks he made on television denigrating the abilities of black people in South Africa. 'There are a few well-educated blackies' in South Africa, he said, but blacks did not have the competence to run South Africa without help from the white minority. He later apologised fpr the remarks. Observer, Page 17</p>

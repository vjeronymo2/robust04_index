			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE RIVALRY CONTINUES  </P> <P> BRET JOHNSON  </P> <P> Neither his team nor the quarterback out of El Toro played very well in their  trouncing by Arizona at Tucson. He was intercepted twice and his 11 completions  (in 22 attempts) gained only 135 yards, his lowest output of the season. He  also, for the first time this season, failed to throw a touchdown pass.  </P> <P> SEASON STATISTICS  </P> <P> Six-game totals  </P> <P> PASSING: 95 of 159, 9 TDs, 7 INT  </P> <P> YARDS PASSING: 1,121  </P> <P> RUSHING: 21 for 34 yards, 1 TD  </P> <P> TODD MARINOVICH  </P> <P> The Capistrano Valley High product will be thrown into a pressure-packed  situation Saturday when the Trojans travel to South Bend for a meeting with  unbeaten, top-ranked Notre Dame. He goes into that game off a fine performance  against Cal-16 completions in 26 attempts for 206 yards-in which he threw for  one touchdown and ran for another.  </P> <P> SEASON STATISTICS  </P> <P> Six-game totals  </P> <P> PASSING: 104 of 169, 9TDs, 3 INT  </P> <P> YARDS PASSING: 1,220  </P> <P> RUSHING: 28 for -8 yards, 1 TD  </P></p>

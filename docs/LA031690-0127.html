			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OHIO;  </P> <P> BUZZARD WATCHERS SATED IN HINCKLEY  </P> <P> With more than 170 years of tradition under their wings, the buzzards returned  as scheduled to Hinckley, Ohio, delighting buzzard watchers from across the  country who had been waiting since before dawn. According to local folklore,  the buzzards, or turkey vultures, have returned to this small northeastern Ohio  town yearly on March 15 since 1819, when frozen carcasses from a Christmas Eve  community hunt began defrosting. About 150 people, including a dozen wearing  buzzard costumes, awaited the large black scavengers.  </P></p>

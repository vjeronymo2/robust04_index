On consulting the "Who's Who in Russia" I  ascertained that Shakhray was the sole laboratory head among  current and recent deputy chairmen. What is the significance of  this?    To be serious, no other major revelations were made at the  session. The president's guidelines were repeated in a pretty  general and vague way. The differences in objectives regarding  inflation were retained. As expected, it remained unclear how  the government intends to carry out its plans. Three months  have now passed since the elections, but no specific action has  been seen to date.    I have just returned from abroad, where I met with foreign  bankers, industrialists, and journalists. I was very curious to  learn their reaction to the "new economic course" so solemnly  discussed in Moscow. The fact is there was virtually no  reaction. There was indifference and skepticism. Virtually no  one pins great hopes on the "new course."    No matter how I tried to persuade potential investors that  the snags and deviations of Russian reforms should not be feared  -- that the general course, despite everything, remains correct  -- edginess and suspicion prevailed. Their stance may be summed  up as follows: You regularly dupe us with your reforms and  financial stabilization but still ask us to make investments and  grant credit and talk about writing off old debts....    Unfortunately this is, from a certain standpoint, true.  There are many people among our functionaries who want to go  into reverse, to isolate us from the world community, to  introduce censorship and other delights of the old system....    However, on the other hand, life serves as a good school and  personal responsibility as a whole university. It seems to me  that the key figures in executive power are drawing correct  conclusions. The last two months have shown that when it comes  to specific actions and decisions the evaluation of the  situation has substantially changed.    The premier and the Central Bank chairman are today behaving  like the most consistent "monetarists" -- they promise a lot but  they give no money. These actions, of course, have nothing to  do with real monetarism, but they are very sensible in  principle, as they counter the attempts to flood the country  with worthless money.    In this regard you can only express your respect for the  authorities: They are withstanding monstrous pressure, they are  considered by "their own people" to be the most arrant  conservatives, Skokov asks them to acknowledge honestly that the  causes of inflation lie in production and sign an agreement with  his Union of Manufacturers, yet they hold out and give no one  any money, and they have forgotten about "nonmonetary methods"  of fighting inflation and its "inertial-oscillatory" character.    The sole problem is the lack of specific reform measures. In  1993 several dozen such were implemented. In the current year,  not a single one. On the contrary, there are signs of the  reverse. Take, for example, such a masterpiece as the 23  February decree on the agrarian complex. Apart from its  patently crude nature -- it clearly cannot be carried out -- it  contains many features agreeable to the ear of lobbyists --  subsidies, grants, credits....    It is essential to move from simple "withholding" of money  and talk of bankruptcies to decisive action; it is essential  above all to establish basic order in finances and the state  apparatus and to adopt a real budget. In two to three weeks  from now, we will start analyzing the first quarter's results  and will have to face up to the facts.    The main conclusion I have drawn from the past week is that  there has been no "new" course. The government basically  remains committed, albeit not consistently, to the old course.  It is unclear why it was necessary to waste several months,  undermine the exchange rate of the ruble, and make bombastic  statements just for this.    However, the political situation is such that the government  has no political base. It is under attack from left and right.  Zyuganov demands that Chubays and Kozyrev be driven out of the  government, others demand the government's resignation and early  presidential elections, yet others demand a coalition  government, even though the coalition we have today is more than  sufficient. According to the "Itogi" TV program, only 5 percent  of Russians think that the government has real power.    I think that until the government really changes its course,  the democratic forces in the Duma should support it, since it  could be replaced by an even less experienced government with an  itch to test out experimentally their more than dubious ideas.</p>

French Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said  Paris "denies the information claiming that French soldiers have  been deployed in Bakassi Peninsula and Isengele. There is no  French soldier in the area," he said.    Nigeria's Colonel Edet Okon stated on the morning of 8 March  that "French troops have been physically deployed on the ground  in East Atabong and Isengele" located in the disputed area.    According to Mr. Duque, "France has about 50 military  advisers in Cameroon on a permanent basis in line with defense  agreements between the two countries."    About 15 of the number recently arrived in Cameroon at the  request of the Cameroonian Government," the spokesman recalled.  He also expressed the hope that "diplomatic efforts being made  by all sides for a peaceful settlement will yield positive  effects soon."</p>

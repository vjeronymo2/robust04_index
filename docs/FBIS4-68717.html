Russia also maintains its interests there. How do you, Minister,  evaluate the possibility of joint, concerted action on the part  of Moscow and Ankara in this region which might correspond to  the interests of the peoples living there?    [Cetin] I would like to emphasize first of all that Russia  is  for us an important neighbor. Both Russia and Turkey undoubtedly  perform a key role in this region, primarily from the viewpoint  of the preservation of peace there. It is for this reason that  our countries should cooperate. I believe that this is precisely  how matters stand there at the present time and I believe that  this will be the case in the future also.    There has recently been a number of meetings of the leaders  of our countries, my meetings with Mr. Andrey Kozyrev in Moscow  and Ankara included. Our president, Suleyman Demirel, and,  subsequently, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller also paid official  visits to Moscow, during which negotiations were conducted with  President Boris Yeltsin. In the course of these meetings, talks,  and negotiations we discussed our policy in respect to the newly  sovereign Turkic republics. We were persuaded that Russia, like  Turkey also, is interested in these republics being independent  and truly sovereign. For my part, I would like to mention  especially that Turkey has no intention of governing them. They  will do this themselves. But Russia and Turkey could play an  important part in their upswing. And we have the opportunity to  cooperate with Russia here.    Truly, aside from the long-standing traditional ties to  Russia, these republics have things in common that link them  with Turkey also: language and cultural, historical, and  religious traditions. For this reason we are trying to make our  contribution to their development also. But in performing this  duty of ours we are by no means competing in the region with  Russia. We are cooperating with Russia. And the events taking  place there confirm that for these countries' independence and  their economic development and political stability cooperation  with Russia is vitally necessary.    [Koritskiy] Quite recently even voices were being heard in  Turkey quite often and at quite a high level about the "threat  from the north." Do you, Minister, perceive this threat today?    [Cetin] I see no threat emanating for Turkey from the north.  There can be no question of such a threat at the present time.  An analysis of the events occurring in the Caucasus, the Near  East, the Balkans, and in other regions shows that there is an  insistent need for the close cooperation of Turkey and Russia.  In my view, our relations with Russia are distinguished by  mutual understanding. If we look at the entire 500-year history  of Russo-Turkish relations, it may be seen that there have been  wars between us, that there have been times of quite cool  relations. But the periods of mutual understanding and good  cooperation have lasted far longer. The times of the cold war  are now ended. This affords extensive opportunities for Russia  and Turkey in respect to a unification of efforts in the  struggle for peace and stability both in the region and  throughout the world. I am convinced that we have a chance to  considerably increase the efficiency of our trade and economic  relations also.    [Koritskiy] Esteemed Minister, the process of change on the  European continent has begun with a search for ways toward a  common nonbloc Europe. The military opposition on the continent  has today become a thing of the past. There is no Warsaw Pact.  NATO should leave the stage also, it would seem. Instead, we are  observing the opposite. The question of the expansion of NATO  has gradually switched from the sphere of discussion to a  practical plane. How do you assess this problem?    [Cetin] NATO was created as a defensive alliance. But the  threat against which this organization was to have defended us  has gone, it no longer exists. The cardinal changes that have  occurred indicate that NATO needs a new role, which it could  perform in a strengthening of peace and stability in the world.  For a definition of this role it is essential to restructure,  and we believe that NATO could be doing this very soon.    [Koritskiy] Esteemed Minister, how do you evaluate the  prospects of the joint actions of Russia and Turkey to settle  the conflicts surrounding Nagornyy Karabakh and on the  Afghan-Tajik border? There is, after all, a real danger of their  internationalization.    [Cetin] Armenia's armed forces occupy approximately 20  percent of Azerbaijani territory. I believe that their actions  are not in the least bit different from Iraq's aggression when  it occupied Kuwait. Armenia is ignoring the UN Security Council  and CSCE decisions on this issue. You are right in saying that  there is a danger of internationalization of the conflict. I am  convinced that the joint efforts of all countries are needed.  The pooling of the efforts of Russia and Turkey would produce  certain results. This is shown even by the difficult process of  a settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.    As far as Afghanistan and Tajikistan are concerned, I  consider that the presence and active operations of  representatives of the CSCE are essential here. The directed  intervention of the UN Security Council would be useful also.  The conflict on the Afghan-Tajik border affects the interests of  Turkey also. Turkey is prepared to join its efforts with those  of Russia to avert a negative development of events here. I am  convinced that it is in this way that we could defend and  preserve peace and stability in the region.

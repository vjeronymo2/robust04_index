			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUBPOENA TO BE SOUGHT TO MAKE PIERCE TESTIFY  </P> <P> A House subcommittee agreed Friday to seek a subpoena for the testimony of  former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. after he  failed to show up for a long-scheduled appearance in the congressional inquiry  into abuses at HUD during his tenure.  </P> <P> "While he may run, he may not hide," said Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo),  chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and  employment, which is investigating political favoritism and mismanagement  during Pierce's eight years as HUD chief.  </P> <P> Pierce, who testified voluntarily on May 25, notified the subcommittee Thursday  night that he would not appear for scheduled testimony Friday. Pierce said he  needed more time to prepare his testimony.  </P> <P> However, Lantos noted that twice before Pierce had received long postponements  so that he could prepare for the hearing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lantos Charges Betrayal  </P> <P> "I consider Mr. Pierce's decision not to appear as scheduled to be capricious,  deceitful and a betrayal of the good faith in which this subcommittee has dealt  with him," Lantos said.  </P> <P> Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens (R-Ohio), the ranking Republican on the panel,  joined in supporting a subpoena for Pierce.  </P> <P> "Not only is 'Silent Sam' silent, apparently today he's also invisible," Lukens  said, referring to the nickname used by some to describe Pierce during his  tenure at HUD.  </P> <P> To call attention to Pierce's failure to appear, the House panel assembled  before a vacant witness table, complete with microphones, pitchers of ice water  and empty chairs.  </P> <P> Three other subcommittee members joined Lantos and Lukens in supporting the  decision to subpoena Pierce for testimony at several future hearings. But,  under House rules, the subcommittee cannot vote on the subpoena action until  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "The refusal to allow me an additional two weeks' preparation time, when  numerous other witnesses have been granted even longer postponements, simply is  unfair," Pierce said Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Decisions Targeted  </P> <P> But Lantos said that the subcommittee had gone out of its way to be fair to  Pierce, agreeing to limit the scope of his scheduled testimony to two  controversial decisions during his tenure.  </P> <P> One involved HUD financing for a $15-million housing rehabilitation project in  Durham, N.C. Although Pierce said he had no direct role in funding decisions, a  former high HUD official has testified that Pierce ordered her to sign off on  the Durham project, despite objections of HUD staff aides.  </P> <P> The second issue involves Pierce's ruling to lift restrictions on DRG Funding  Corp., a mortgage broker that had been placed on probation for violating HUD  rules in the agency's coinsurance program. Since then, DRG loans totaling $538  million have gone sour, and the company is the subject of a grand jury  investigation.  </P> <P> Pierce said he needs legal counsel because the subcommittee has dropped its  "non-adversarial manner."  </P></p>

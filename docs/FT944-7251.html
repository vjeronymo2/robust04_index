			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Price of compromise: Guy de Jonquieres on the concerns of US trade partners This week's Washington compromise has relieved governments around the world, which feared that failure by the Senate to ratify the Uruguay Round this year would kill the global trade agreement stone-dead. But now that much of this uncertainty has been removed, a new concern is troubling US trade partners: could the price paid by President Bill Clinton to secure congressional approval undermine the stronger multilateral trade system the round is supposed to produce? Concern focuses on the president's acceptance of Mr Robert Dole's demand for a special commission of federal judges to review the operation of procedures for settling trade disputes in the World Trade Organisation, so as to safeguard US interests. Effective disputes procedures are widely regarded as central to the WTO's chances of gaining the international credibility needed to establish its pre-eminence as policeman of international trade rules. The Uruguay Round gives the WTO much stronger powers than those of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The biggest innovation is to require that disputes panels' reports be adopted unless there is a consensus to reject them - the reverse of Gatt practice. The mechanisms also cover new areas, such as services, and provide for a standing appeals body to hear challenges to panel findings. The US has long advocated tougher Gatt disputes settlements procedures. Indeed, it has repeatedly cited their shortcomings to justify its controversial Section 301 trade legislation, which permits the US to retaliate unilaterally against other countries in trade conflicts. But now stronger multilateral mechanisms have been agreed, the Clinton administration has been forced to appease anxieties in Congress that the new WTO will trample on US sovereignty. In one sense, the review commission will make little difference. If it decided that WTO panels had ruled against the US unjustly in three disputes in five years, that would trigger a congressional vote on whether to withdraw from the organisation. However, Congress has always been free to vote to pull out of Gatt. In either case, the president could veto such a move. More worrying is the risk that the commission could impair the disputes panels' authority. Much will depend on the precise remit handed to the judges, and how they exercise it. If they were to pronounce on the substance of disputes cases, they could simply become a pretext for the US to reject any finding with which it disagreed. If, however, they focused strictly on whether panels have followed procedures fairly and correctly, their role would be more limited. Even then, they could find themselves at the centre of political controversy. Expansion of WTO mechanisms to cover trade in services, and other activities inside national borders, will require the panels to rule on what Gatt members have hitherto considered the domain of domestic policy. Some observers also expect a stream of early cases intended to test the extent of the panels' jurisdiction and set precedents in areas where WTO rules are sketchy. These cases could hand ammunition to isolationists in Congress - and other national legislatures. Precisely for these reasons, however, some WTO supporters take a more positive view. They argue that US monitoring, if conducted objectively, will give the disputes panels an extra incentive to meet the high standards of jurisprudence needed to command respect. Furthermore, they say, if the federal judges endorsed panel findings which went against US interests, they could make them politically more acceptable in Washington - and might even help improve the poor US record of implementing adverse Gatt disputes rulings. The federal judiciary's reputation for independence from other branches of government also offers reassurance. However, such optimistic prognoses might have to be revised if the US example were widely emulated - particularly by countries less scrupulous about divisions between judicial and executive power. That could only heighten the risk that the WTO would be torpedoed by members intent on taking the law into their own hands.</p>

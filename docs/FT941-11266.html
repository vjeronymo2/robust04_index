			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / O'Reilly buys 25% stake in Independent Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers group last night appeared to gain the upper hand in the struggle for control of Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday. In a swift response to a Pounds 55.1m formal bid from a consortium backed by Mirror Group Newspapers, Mr O'Reilly's Dublin-based group bought a 24.99 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing for Pounds 18.4m, paying 350p a share to institutional investors. This compares with the MGN offer worth 261.6p a share in cash and MGN shares, or 250p a share incash. The MGN consortium holds 47.1 per cent of Newspaper Publishing's shares. It includes founders of The Independent - one of whom is Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor-in-chief, with 7.45 per cent - and the Italian and Spanish newspaper groups La Repubblica and El Pais, with 18.4 per cent each. The sharepurchase seems to leave the consortium offer with little chance of success unless it is increased. The committee of non-executives directors of Newspaper Publishing said the MGN bid was too low and it welcomed its new shareholder, which gave assurances of financial support. Journalists at The Independent and the Independent on Sunday said they were 'immensely relieved' by news of the stake taken by Mr O'Reilly, who is also chairman of food group H J Heinz. They saidit appeared to scupper the consortium's bid. The consortium said last night it would press ahead with the bid. The Spanish and Italian investors reaffirmed their commitment to the MGN-backed offer. MGN said it was too early to say whether there would be an increased bid. Last night Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of MGN, was understood to be in urgent talks with other members of the consortium. Brokers moved on behalf of Independent Newspapers soon after the MGN consortium had launched its early morning offer for the 52.9 per cent of News-paper Publishing it does not own. Brokers offered institutional investors 350pa share on 'a first come first served basis'. At 13.37pm Independent Newspapers was able to announce that it had purchased 24.99 per cent of NewspaperPublishing and asked for representation on the board. Lex, Page 22</p>

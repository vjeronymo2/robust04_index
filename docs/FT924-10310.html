			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Maastricht rebel camp still strong AS MANY AS 35 Tories were insisting yesterday that they were still likely to defy the government in next week's vote to decide whether the bill implementing the Maastricht treaty should return to the Commons for further consideration. But it was unclear how many of those rebels would go as far as to vote against the government and how many would merely abstain. That followed the publication of a meticulously crafted 140-word government motion, which was substantive as promised, but did not touch on the matter of timing or even mention the dreaded 'M' word. Reaction to the motion suggested that the rebel camp was likely to fall short of the number needed to defeat the government, but indicated that prime minister John Major was not yet home and dry. The final picture is expected to become clear only on Tuesday - one day after publication of the Labour amendment - when Tory Euro-sceptics are scheduled to meet in a bid to agree a common approach. There was speculation in Westminster that the gathering might result in a mass decision to abstain rather than exercise the ultimate sanction by voting against the government. Yesterday's tone was set by comments from Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, and Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the rightwing 92 group. Both of those arch-Euro-sceptics did not say they would definitely oppose the government, but indicated that they thought the non-confrontational phrasing of the motion represented a victory of sorts for the rebel cause. Sir George said: 'This motion is so general one wonders why it was necessary to table a substantive motion at all.' A number of Tories, including Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton North; Mr Michael Carttiss, Great Yarmouth; and Ms Teresa Gorman, Billericay, remained determined to vote against the motion. All of those were among the 22 Tories who in May opposed giving the Maastricht bill a second reading. Mr Carttiss said: 'I have to vote against that motion even though there is much in it with which I can concur.' Others not among the 22 who were still inclined to vote against the government next week included: Mr Bill Walker, MP for Tayside North; Mr Peter Griffiths, Portsmouth North; Mr John Wilkinson, Ruislip-Northwood; Mr Barry Legg, Milton Keynes South West, and Mr Peter Fry, Wellingborough. In a potentially crucial move Mr Rupert Allason, MP for Torbay, who opposed the second reading in May, said he would almost certainly be supporting the government. He said: 'I cannot imagine there is anybody who can oppose it.' However, he emphasised: 'My views on Maastricht have not changed one iota.' Some of the 22 original rebels indicated that they might abstain. Mr Nicholas Winterton, MP for Macclesfield, said: 'I shall in no circumstances support it. I think this is just a cosmetic exercise.' Mr Warren Hawksley, MP for Halesowen and Stourbridge, said he 'certainly won't be voting for' the motion. 'As I feel at the moment, I will be voting against.' Mr Hawksley was one of a group of MPs who had expected to be on the island of St Helena on a parliamentary visit for next Wednesday's vote: 'The whips have cancelled that; they may regret it.' Mr Robert Jones, MP for Hertfordshire West and another potential rebel, said he was 'unlikely to support the government' unless he was persuaded that 'what will come out of Edinburgh is a legally binding agreement on subsidiarity.' Mr Vivian Bendall, MP for Ilford North, said he would 'consult with' his constituency association. Among those who were considering not supporting the government, but who appeared to have been brought back onside were Mr Andrew Hargreaves, MP for Birmingham Hall Green; Mr Michael Fabricant, Mid Staffordshire, and Mr Geoffrey Dickens, Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth.</p>

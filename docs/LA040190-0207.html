			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WRONG CROWD COUNT  </P> <P> Regarding the letter (March 20) on "Meet Your Judges Night," the judges of  North Orange County Municipal Court want to correct a remark that only about  100 people showed up: We had more than 200 people in our Spanish-speaking  courtroom and more than 200 in our English-speaking courtroom, for a total of  more than 400 people.  </P> <P> The judges of this court were very much pleased that so many people came. We  have been asked by Loara High School to send a panel of our judges so that  those young people who could not attend March 6 could ask us questions.  </P> <P> BETTY L. ELIAS, Chairperson  </P> <P> Meet Your Judges Night  </P></p>

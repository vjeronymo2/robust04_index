As is known, Russian southern resort of Sochi competes for  the right to host the 2002 Winter Olympics.    "The successful performance of Russian national team at the  (Lillehammer) Winter Olympics was a surprize for many foreign  observers and athletes," he noted.    "The once powerful Soviet team had managed only once to win  more medals than the present-day Russian team (in the Winter  Olympics)," he remarked.    "The (1994) Winter Olympics have shown that Russia's  athletes  are in the vanguard of the world's top-level sport," President  Yeltsin emphasized.    Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Ivan Rybkin,  chairman of State Duma, Russian parliament's lower house, were  also present at the awarding ceremony.</p>

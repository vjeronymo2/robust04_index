			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Upstart airlines reach for the US skyways - Cut-price carriers are mopping up redundant labour and lost routes IT IS 11.30am at Newark Airport and Flight 7, to Atlanta, is filling up. The passengers are a motley crowd but there is coffee by the boarding gate, plus an effusive cabin attendant. And if the Boeing 727 looks a little elderly, at least it departs on time. This is Kiwi International Air Lines, one of a crop of new airlines which have started up in the US in the past few years. Kiwi flies to just a handful of cities - Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Orlando and San Juan in Puerto Rico - and its appeal is equally simple - price. The cost of a one-way ticket from Newark to Atlanta, with no advance purchase or minimum-stay requirements, is Dollars 119. Make the same 'full fare' journey on Delta Air Lines, which dominates Atlanta's Hartsfield airport, and the price is Dollars 373, although the carrier has responded with limited discount offers. At first sight, the 1990s seem an unlikely time to start up an airline business. Financial turbulence has caused two large carriers - Pan Am and Eastern - to go out of business, while losses at the remaining seven national airlines have topped Dollars 8bn over the past three years. Even now, Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest carrier, is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Despite this gloomy industry backdrop, the US Department of Transportation calculates that 15 new airlines came on stream in the year to April, one-third of which were neither charter nor cargo operations. Another 20 applications are in the pipeline, half of which involve jet aircraft. There are two compelling reasons why start-up carriers are reaching for the skies. First, there is a surplus of trained labour and cheap aircraft. Pan Am and Eastern alone employed between them almost 30,000 people immediately before their respective collapses in 1991. More recently, many of surviving US carriers - including American, Delta and United - have been contracting, shedding thousands of jobs in the process. The idea to create Kiwi came from a group of former Eastern pilots who personally committed upwards of Dollars 50,000 apiece in start-up capital. Today, Kiwi's 400-plus payroll includes former employees of Midway Airlines, a smaller Chicago-based carrier which collapsed in 1992, and Pan Am. It is not only people skills which are available. The recent airline demises  -plus the shrinking of survivors - has led to a glut of aircraft, most of which are parked in the Californian desert. Many of the new carriers use Boeing 727s or 737s, restricting their fleets to one type of aircraft to reduce maintenance costs. Lease rates are at low ebb: depending on age and model, a 727-200 can be had for under Dollars 100,000 a month. Equally important, there is a market waiting to be served. US consumers have grown accustomed to the bargain-basement fares which resulted from savage price wars in the early 1990s, and still shop fiercely for good buys. The big carriers, by contrast, are desperate to restore some profitability to their domestic operations, and have been trying to push up ticket prices. This task is achieved more easily in markets where they face limited competition. When Eastern, which had been a heavy price-cutter, collapsed, Delta became the only large operator at Atlanta and immediately raised fares. For new carriers, with lower operating costs, such situations have potential. In financial terms, the newcomers' track records are varied. Some have quickly moved into profit. Take Nevada-based Reno Air, which will celebrate its first birthday this week. It flies a dozen aircraft, principally in the south-west, and has been firmly in the black for the past two quarters - more than can be said for many of its bigger rivals. However, problems tend to surface when a successful niche operator takes the next leap forward, in terms of size and route structure. MarkAir, based in Anchorage, is good example. This carrier, which began life flying oil-drilling equipment around the Alaskan outback, became a passenger carrier in the mid-1980s. In 1991, it expanded into the Pacific north-west, angering the larger Alaska Airlines. A fierce fare war developed. MarkAir filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 1992. The MarkAir story is also indicative of the relationship between upstart carriers and established operators. New airlines tend to tread warily, knowing they can be targets of retaliation if they encroach too far into national carriers' territory. Kiwi, for example, has only four flights a day during the week, between Atlanta and Newark. The first one leaving Newark is not until 11.40am, making the service of limited use to business travellers. By contrast, when Reno tried to enter the Minneapolis market, Northwest  - which is based in the Minnesota city and had abandoned a Minneapolis-Reno route - responded by first re-entering this territory, at Reno-style prices. Worse, it announced it would undercut the upstart carrier's price on other west coast routes. The Department of Transportation weighed in on Reno's side, and both carriers backed off. Occasionally, however, the intricate world of aviation politics plays in the new carriers' favour. The giant American Airlines, for example, is trying to scale down its hub operation in San Jose, California, in the face of strong competition from its low-cost Dallas-based rival, Southwest Airlines. Two months ago, it agreed to sublease up to seven gates at San Jose to Reno, and has also offered Reno passengers the chance to earn air miles in its AAdvantage frequent flier scheme. To economists, the ready entry of new low-cost operators is precisely what competition theory prescribes. But even in the aggressive, deregulated US airline industry, not everyone is universally welcome. Plans by Mr Frank Lorenzo, former boss of both Eastern Airlines and Continental, to start a discount-fare airline operating between Boston, Washington and Orlando, have provoked a storm of protest from airline unions and members of Congress. Hearings on the issue are taking place this week. It is a delicate issue which pits the principles of deregulation against one of the industry's most controversial figures.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- On 20 May, statements were circulated from  the Statehood and Center groups at the beginning of the plenary  session of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The statement from  the Center group contains, in particular, proposals to support  Vasyl Durdynet's candidacy for the post of first deputy chairman  of Ukraine's Supreme Council and to "halt the diktat of the  left-wing forces" having agreed the candidacies of deputy  chairmen of the parliament and heads of committees.    A discussion emerged with regard to the name "committee"  instead of "commission" as it was in the previous parliament and  also with regard to leaders of groups and chairmen of committees  becoming members of the presidium of the Supreme Council. In  the view of Oleksandr Moroz the presence of 18-20 leaders of  groups and the same number of chairman of committees could cause  the presidium to become rudderless. Vyacheslav Chornovil, while  expressing disagreement with the speaker's point of view gave  assurances that since in the event of an emergence of disputed  issues conciliatory commissions will nevertheless have to be  formed each time, their role could be played namely by members  of the presidium.    Deputies were given an anonymous draft constitution of  Ukraine in accordance with which it was proposed to give the  president only representative functions and the Cabinet of  Ministers should be led by a prime minister. In the words of  Oleksandr Moroz, this draft had been agreed by Leonid Kravchuk.  "We are talking not about a constitutional conspiracy, as  People's Deputy Bohdan Boyko considers, but about introducing  elementary order into the executive structures," assured  Oleksandr Moroz.    Commenting on this provision of the draft constitution,  acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy told a UNIAN  correspondent that in a "state with a population of 52 million,  a powerful industry, a military industrial complex and an  agricultural economy the government should be subordinate to the  president."    After this, parliamentary speaker Oleksandr Moroz proposed  that all groups gather in order to agree the issues that were  mentioned at the beginning of this item (minus guests and  representatives of the media).</p>

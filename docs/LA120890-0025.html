			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEARNING THE LESSONS OF IRAN-CONTRA CONSPIRACY  </P> <P> Concerning Howard Rosenberg's Nov. 27 column, "Applying the Lessons of  Iran-Contra":  </P> <P> Thanks to Rosenberg and The Times for alerting us to watch the outstanding Bill  Moyers' TV special, "Frontline: High Crimes and Misdemeanors," broadcast Nov.  27. This program, about the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal, should be  required viewing for every voter and every student.  </P> <P> Everyone should see how President Reagan and/or key members of his  Administration conspired to establish a fascistic group that was willing to lie  to the public and to Congress; was willing to break the laws; was willing to go  to almost any extent to cover up their "high crimes and misdemeanors." These  were the men who set the tone for the country. These were the role models for  us and for our youth.  </P> <P> The lesson for us today is that when the President speaks about Iraq -- or any  other subject -- and when members of the Administration testify before  Congress, we must keep in mind the statement may or may not be true, depending  on whether it works to their personal advantage and that of the Administration.  God help us all!  </P> <P> JACK MILLER  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

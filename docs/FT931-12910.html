			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Currency dealers surprised - Sterling falls THE SCALE and timing of yesterday's base rate cut took the currency market by surprise and the pound sank more than 3 pfennigs yesterday morning, bottoming out at DM2.4200. The question on the mind of currency dealers, treasury managers and British politicians is whether the pound will sink even further against the D-Mark and the US dollar. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, believes that the pound will fall to the critical level of DM2.40 in the next week and may test the record low of DM2.3693. He believes the pound's fall will be checked if the Bundesbank cuts short-term interest rates in the next few weeks - a move that would make the German currency a less attractive short-term investment than other European currencies. There are doubts about when - and by how much - the Bundesbank will cut rates. Mr Chertkow said: 'In the absence of a German rate cut in the order of 200 basis points this year, the pound will go below its historic lows.' A perception in the currency markets that there is no clear framework to UK monetary policy may also undermine the pound in the next few weeks. Mr Mark Brett, a currency analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, said that dealers were uncertain over exactly which economic indicators were driving policy.</p>

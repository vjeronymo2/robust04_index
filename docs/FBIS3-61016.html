Velenteyenko, chief of  a routine TECh [technical-maintenance unit] operations group of  an air regiment, and Candidate of Technical Sciences Colonel  (Reserve) A. Kaulis under the rubric "For IAS Specialists": "BUR  in the Service of Diagnostics"]    [Text] The design of modern aircraft engines (AD) is  improved every year, and the amount of work to service them and  the testing and check-out gear (KPA) employed grow more complex  as well. But the number of specialists taking part in performing  that work, as in the IAS [aviation engineering service] as a  whole, is decreasing. How can the efficiency of monitoring the  reliability of aircraft engines be increased under those  conditions?    A group of staff members at the ERAT NII  [Scientific-Research  Institute] of the Air Forces took up the solution of the  problem. It is well known that improvements in operational  monitoring of the parameters of aircraft engines occur in  competition between two directions in their development--the  creation of on-board (BASK) and ground (NASK) automated systems.  Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages. The  advantages of BASK include high mobility, autonomous operation  and promptness in application. Being located on the aircraft,  however, these systems are limited in the amount of information  they can monitor (both in the range of parameters and in the  frequency of checking them) and have a quite rigid operating  program that does not, as a rule keep pace with changes in the  equipment of constantly upgraded aircraft.    NASK are by and large devoid of these shortcomings, but  appreciably reduce the mobility of the maintenance equipment and  its autonomy, as well as requiring more--and more highly  skilled--servicing personnel. Moreover, by duplicating a number  of on-board systems they markedly increase the cost of the  aviation system.    Taking this into account, the attention of specialists  turned  to the well-known "black box"--an on-board recording device  (BUR) that is used in contemporary aircraft and helicopters to  record the parameters of the flight and the principal aircraft  systems (including the engines). It is highly reliable, and has  the ability to preserve information on several hours of aircraft  systems operation that is acceptable for diagnostics through the  measurement of deviations in the parameters. This information is  used even today in the interests of determining the operability  of the aircraft engines when preparing it for a repeat sortie.  The use of BURs as a means of ground monitoring of the ADs,  however, is hindered for two reasons. The first is that a BUR,  as a consequence of its principal purpose, has a strictly  limited range of engine parameters it monitors--the engines get  from 7 to 15 percent of the information recording volume. The  second reason is caused by its discrete nature; the values of  each parameter are recorded at strictly defined time intervals  that are typified by the frequency of polling, that is, the  quantity of values recorded per unit time (per second, for  example). The polling frequency of aircraft engine parameters  used in series-produced BURs does not make it possible to obtain  reliable information on the most diagnostically informative  modes of its operation--transitional modes (for instance, the  pickup or shedding of RPM) that last for only a few seconds in  all.    The efforts of the NII specialists V. Dolgopolov, K.  Suponko,  A. Poluektov, V. Semenin and L. Yevlakhov were aimed at solving  just these problems. The key here was the fact that during the  process of ground check-out of the engine parameters, most of  the remaining aircraft systems--information on which is fed to  the BUR--are not being monitored and, consequently, the  recording channels for their parameters are temporarily not in  use. This in fact determined the later actions of the  innovators--to create a relatively simple and small piece of  ground equipment that would make it possible to switch over the  "idle" channels to the engine. The amount of information  received from it increased by 10--12 times, thanks to the  increased polling frequency of the standard parameters and the  opportunity to monitor other parameters of the ADs through the  installation of additional sensors on board the aircraft.    The gear, in interaction with the BUR units and the AL-31F  aircraft engine electrical regulator, constitutes the system of  ground monitoring of aircraft and engine parameters (SNK-SD). A  diagram is presented in Fig. 1.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-002C-05A>           Fig. 1. Diagram of the SNK-SD ground monitoring system </FIG>          The on-board part of the system consists of a unit for  formulating and coding the information of the BUR (1), the BUR  information storage (2) and the AD electronic regulator (3). It  is intended for the receipt of primary information on the  parameters that are usually recorded by the on-board equipment  and the parameters--new in relation to them--of the electronic  engine regulator, electrical feed of the SNK-SD from on-board  sources, conversion of analog information to digital and storage  of all of the data obtained with the aid of the SNK-SD in the  BUR storage unit.    The ground portion of the system includes a switching unit  (4), a control panel (5), and an arm with additional sensors (6)  intended for the formation of high-polling (frequency of 12--16  Hz) channels for the recording of parameters, varying their  selection and monitoring their progression to the BUR storage  unit in real time and the receipt of primary information on the  engine parameters being measured by the additional sensors.    The locations for connecting the SNK-SD on the aircraft are:  the BUR--the input of the standard monitored parameters to the  unit for the formulation and coding of the information (pos. A);  the electronic AD regulator--the control plugs of the regulator  used in servicing to hook up the KPA (pos. B); and, the control  points for the measurement of additional parameters of the  engine via the installation of sensors at them from the SNK-SD  kit (pos. C).    The information from the on-board sensors, electronic engine  regulator and the sensors from the SNK-SD kit goes to the  switching unit, where it is distributed in accordance with the  settings of the switches on the control panel among the channels  with a high polling frequency and transmitted to the input of  the BUR formulation and coding unit, where the analog signals  are converted to digital. The information is copied from the  storage unit to standard media (BK-2 magnetic-tape cassettes)  after the engine is disconnected, for subsequent processing in  Luch or Mayak type ground processing devices (NUO) using  specially developed control programs. An external view of the  ground units of the system and the places to connect them to the  aircraft is shown in Fig. 2.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-002C-05B>           Fig. 2. Composition of the SNK-SD system </FIG>          The SNK-SD combines the advantages of both directions in the  development of engine monitoring equipment, and makes it  possible to avoid the appearance of cumbersome and expensive KPA  in servicing that requires an increase in the number of organic  service personnel and increases labor expenditures for  operation. It has a high degree of standardization, since one  and the same ground unit of this system, differing only in the  soldering of the electrical connections, is needed to monitor  different aircraft that have the same type of BUR. The SNK-SD,  utilizing standard ground processing devices, also provides for  a uniform ideology for monitoring the status of the aircraft  hardware. Since the final information in the BUR buffer is in  digital form, the use of personal computers to process it in  real time is possible in the future, thereby eliminating the  principal inconvenience of the "black box"--the lack of results  at the time of monitoring, and the need for subsequent  processing of the data.    Experimental check-out of the SNK-SD in several air units  showed that this system increases the efficiency of monitoring,  both when it is used in the squadron in the process of making  flights or in the performance of technical maintenance  operations requiring the testing of the AD, as well as in TECh  units in routine maintenance or repair operations. The following  variations for its utilization were the most expedient:    --operational monitoring, when performing flights, to look  for failures that arose in a prior sortie, as well as to  evaluate the technical state of the engines under the conditions  of an air squadron without activating the standard KPA. Only the  switching unit and control panel are used from the ground  portion of the SNK-SD therein. The additional sensors are  installed only if necessary and, as a rule, no more than two.  The time to install and connect the SNK-SD is less than ten  minutes;    --the deeper monitoring of the technical state of the  engines  in the process of performing routine maintenance operations, as  well as operations to prolong the service life of the engines  and find and eliminate failures. The sensors from the SNK-SD kit  are installed during the ground testing. The time expenditures  to install the SNK-SD on board the aircraft are compensated for  by the substantial increase in the extent of the monitoring and,  in a case of finding and eliminating failures in the ADs, by the  determination of the causes for the disruption in operability  with precision down to the replaceable part, unit or assembly.    The operational check-out of the developed system revealed  yet another important merit--documentation of the results of the  monitoring, which none of the ground engine monitoring panels  traditionally employed as KPA possesses.    Here is an example of the use of the SNK-SD. The afterburner  mode of operation of one of the engines did not come on in  advanced aerobatic maneuvers by an Su-27 aircraft, as a result  of which the pilot was forced to curtail the performance of the  assignment. Check-outs performed on the ground of the stability  of these modes using the standard KPA brought no clarity--the  afterburner chamber ignited in all of the ground tests, which  gave grounds to doubt the reliability of the primary information  on the failure of the afterburner in flight. Then the SNK-SD  system was connected to the aircraft in the variation of deeper  monitoring of the technical state of the engine, with five  additional sensors installed on board to check the fuel pressure  in the automatic engine control system (in the area pertaining  to the feed of fuel to the afterburner chamber). The specialists  were convinced, after a ten-minute testing of the engine with  the afterburners turned on four times and decoding of the  results obtained on a LUCh type NUO, that the fuel pressure in  one of the assemblies of the afterburner loop that supported the  ignition of the afterburner chamber was below the stipulated  limit. This did not lead to engine failure when the afterburners  were turned on under ground conditions, but under the conditions  of the evolution of the aircraft when performing advanced  aerobatic maneuvers it was the reason for the failure of the  afterburner to come on. The "heart" of the Su-27 operated  reliably in flight after the replacement of the assembly.    The experience in the use of the system shows convincingly  that the SNK-SD makes it possible, during one period of engine  testing, to establish the cause of a disruption in its  operability and make decisions regarding ways of eliminating the  failure and its further operation.    The preparation and production of a series-produced lot of  these systems for conducting tests in the field is currently  underway. Techniques are being developed to utilize the SNK-SD  in order to support the servicing of aircraft engines according  to their technical state. One would like to believe that all of  this will help the specialists of the IAS make a worthy  contribution to increasing the safety of flights and maintaining  a high level of combat readiness of the aircraft hardware.

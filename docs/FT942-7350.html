			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Deutsche Telekom loses cartel case Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned German telecommunications operator, has been seriously hindering competition in Germany's liberalising telecoms market through substantial cross subsidies from its monopoly businesses. A six-month investigation by the Federal Cartel Administration in Berlin concluded that since 1989 Deutsche Telekom has channeled subsidies totalling DM1.9bn (Pounds 760m) into its data networks division. The decision has far-reaching implications for Deutsche Telekom as it faces privatisation amid growing international competition. Deutsche Telekom still has 90 per cent of Germany's data networks market; in the other liberalised telecoms sectors of satellite and mobile communications rival operators have taken nearly half of the German market. Data networks were liberalised in Germany in 1989, in accordance with European Union rules on telecoms liberalisation. But competitors have long complained that Deutsche Telekom was keeping them out of the DM800m-a-year market by subsidising data networks from its monopoly voice and leased lines businesses. The Federal Cartel Administration has broadly upheld the complaints. 'We proved how Deutsche Telekom had been hindering competition through providing hidden subsidies,' the Cartel Office said yesterday. Its report is with the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. An association of rival telecoms operators, which took the case to the cartel authority, includes British Telecommunications, AT&amp;T of the US, and Unisource, a joint venture between the Swiss, Swedish and Dutch state telecoms companies. 'This is a landmark case in German telecommunications and business,' said Mr Gerd Eickers, president of the association, saying it would send a 'strong signal and incentive to all aspirants in the liberalised European telecommunications market'. Deutsche Telekom said it had yet to see the report, but claimed to be 'confident' that significant changes to its accounting system made over the past two years, and others in train, would meet the complaints. The Economics Ministry said the findings would not delay the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom. The governing Christian Democratic coalition has secured backing for the partial privatisation of the telecoms and postal services, although a flotation is unlikely before 1996. However, the cartel report calls into question the capacity of Deutsche Telekom to meet early competition. Under existing EU rules its monopoly on basic voice traffic is protected until 1998. The cross-subsidy report also has ramifications for the Ecu1bn (Pounds 770m) joint venture between Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, the French state operator, formed last December to provide data and other advanced services to multinationals. The companies argued that the exposure of the data sector to competition justified their move to integrate their international data services. They are anxious to extend the alliance, but EU competition authorities may resist any further integration until competition is well established.</p>

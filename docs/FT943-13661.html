			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / China's growth rate slows China's economic growth rate tapered off in the six months to June from last year's unsustainable levels but inflation was high, according to official statistics yesterday, Our Beijing Correspondent writes. Real gross domestic product rose 11.6 per cent compared with the same period last year, according to the State Statistics Bureau. This compares with 12.7 per cent growth for 1993 against 1992 and 13.9 per cent for the first six months of last year compared with the same period in 1992. The slowdown reflects the Chinese government's credit restrictions and other measures to prevent overheating. The consumer price index in the 35 biggest cities was up 22.7 per cent for the six months compared with the corresponding period last year. For all of 1993 the rise was 19.6 per cent. The latest growth rate for fixed investments was 25.2 per cent, sharply down from the runaway rate of 61 per cent a year ago. Consumer spending was growing at a real rate of 4.8 per cent, according to yesterday's figures, compared with 21.6 per cent a year ago, indicating that a wave of panic buying last year has ended.</p>

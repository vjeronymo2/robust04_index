			<p>BFN     [Text] On 18 April, TRABAJADORES newspaper features an  editorial entitled: "Efficiency Assemblies: Getting Going Strong  and Right." The editorial states that in difficult and complex  times like these, the Cuban union movement approaches 1 May in a  period of growth, renovation, and a strengthened role as guide  and mobilizer. After stressing the colossal experience of the  Parliaments in the Workplace process and the willingness to root  that spirit in the life of every work center, the editorial  emphasizes the importance of the union leadership's decision to  give continuity and shape to this method through the new  Assemblies for Efficiency.    The editorial also points out that each of Cuba's 18 unions,  in a pilot program, will select two work centers in every  province to conduct these assemblies. The 570 Assemblies for  Efficiency during the second half of April will be a living  laboratory to continue down the road opened by the Parliaments  in the Workplace. The editorial adds that it is essential that  these assemblies be born strong, vigorous, and well-designed  because a good start is important to the success and development  of this concept. It will not be a matter of repeating the former  production and service assemblies under a new name.    The main difference is that the Assemblies for Efficiency  will not hear worker complaints or requests but will discuss and  reach specific accords to boost economic efficiency in every  work center. The TRABAJADORES editorial points out that this is  not a new idea but the latest economic management methods that  have resulted in heightened productivity excellence and set a  priority on worker participation, interest, and morale. The  editorial adds that the most efficient capitalists have  recognized the value of these factors and we must learn to take  advantage of them, in accordance with our system.    It is necessary to develop the workers' economic information  and knowledge and seek and evaluate efficiency on the basis of  cost-effectiveness. Along with gradual progress toward linking  production and individual and collective motivation, every union  leader must focus on the struggle for efficiency.    The TRABAJADORES editorial adds that every manager must  learn  that the men and women he leads are the primary focus of his  endeavor. The editorial adds that we are confident this  participative formula will become an integral part of a Cuban,  socialist, and efficient economic system.    The editorial points out that, as Fidel has said, economic  efficiency will be a more important result that the streamlining  of national finances; thence, the importance of adequately  setting up the Assemblies for Efficiency, which will not follow  a preconceived plan and to which the quality of management's  reports will be vital.    The editorial also points out that everything learned in the  workers assemblies helps bolster this new effort. It is  necessary to personify the Assemblies for Efficiency into what  Fidel called the "brilliant economist" -- the sum of every  workplace. The editorial closes by stressing that Cuba, the  Revolution, and our people need this without delay.</p>

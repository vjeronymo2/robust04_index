			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HUBER PUTS A HALT TO HER FALTERING, RALLIES TO WIN GIRLS' 16S TITLE  </P> <P> Ditta Huber was still four games away from a defeat in the U.S. Tennis Assn.  Girls' 16s National Championships singles final Saturday, but for all intents  and purposes, she already had lost it. Or so it seemed.  </P> <P> After winning the first set in a tiebreaker, third-seeded Huber of La Jolla  dropped the second set, 6-1, and was trailing, 2-0, with No. 4 Lisa Pugliese of  Boca Raton, Fla., serving.  </P> <P> Pugliese could sense it. The crowd of about 500 who watched at Morley Field's  stadium court sensed it. The hometown favorite, who had played nearly perfectly  for a week, wouldn't pull this one out.  </P> <P> Then Huber, 14, went from awful to awesome. She won the last six games,  breaking Pugliese's serve three times, and won, 7-6 (9-7), 1-6, 6-2.  </P> <P> Huber later teamed with Lindsay Davenport of Palos Verdes to win the doubles  championship.  </P> <P> Huber and Pugliese approached the singles final with different game plans and  never deviated. Huber attacked from the opening serve, usually sending powerful  topspin returns toward the corners. Pugliese, who beat Huber, 7-5, 6-2, in the  1990 Easter Bowl tournament, chose to be patient, rally and let Huber beat  herself.  </P> <P> As a result, it was practically Huber's match to win or lose.  </P> <P> And after winning the first set, Huber hit the skids. For eight consecutive  games, she couldn't get anything to fall. Everything was long, wide or in the  net. Twenty-two of the 30 points Pugliese scored while winning the second set  came on Huber misses. And before Huber served at love-40 in the final game of  the set, she cried out loud, "I don't know how to stop it."  </P> <P> "I lost my concentration," Huber said. "I was getting frustrated. I tried  everything. I tried to slow the ball down. I tried to hit though it. I tried to  lob. It just wasn't working.  </P> <P> "But I'm not one to worry. I just kept hitting."  </P> <P> And the errors kept coming for Huber, who opened the third set by hitting  wildly on seven of the first eight points. Then, in the third game, Huber said  she looked up at some of the other players who were watching. The thought  occured to her that she and Pugliese, by winning this tournament, were the only  ones who still had a shot a wild-card berth in the Junior U.S. Open in  September.  </P> <P> "I don't know what made me think of it, but it just went though my mind," Huber  said.  </P> <P> The thought of playing against foreign players and possibly hitting with  "someone famous" at Flushing Meadows, N.Y., sparked Huber's third-set comeback.  She hit an overhead smash to break Pugliese's second serve, then won the last  six games. She closed out the match with two backhand service returns for  winners.  </P> <P> "I have no idea what happened," Pugliese said. "She just became more confident  all of a sudden."  </P> <P> Huber led Pugliese, 4-2, in the first set but Pugliese broke back to lead, 5-4.  Huber then went ahead, 6-5, before Pugliese forced a tiebreaker. Huber led,  4-0, in the tiebreaker, then made five consecutive unforced errors to give  Pugliese a 5-4 lead. Huber won when Pugliese missed long with a return.  </P> <P> But as she did throughout the match, Huber dominated the set with 26 winners  and 28 unforced errors; Pugliese had 13 and 15.  </P> <P> Huber and Davenport, seeded No. 1 in doubles, defeated fourth-seeded Amy  Chiminello of Melrose, Mass., and Holyn Lord of Carmel, Ind., 6-0, 7-5.  </P></p>

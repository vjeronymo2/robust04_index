			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hambros hired to value Il Giorno HAMBROS, the UK merchant bank with considerable experience in privatisation business, has joined the growing list of City of London institutions winning mandates in Italy's privatisation programme. Hambros has been hired by the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group to value Il Giorno, Eni's Milan-based daily newspaper and Nuova Same, the paper's typesetting and printing affiliate. Il Giorno used to be one of Milan's most famous papers, with sales of more than 200,000. Circulation has fallen and the paper's image has been tarnished by labour disputes and controversy about editorial policy because of Eni's ownership. However, average sales last year were 170,596 a day. Eni, which hopes to float part of its Agip oil business this year, has been pursuing a piecemeal privatisation strategy for many of its other activities, based on the view that the recession has reduced the uptake for individual large disposals.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Drop in business failures reported Business failures fell by 13.4 per cent in England and Wales in the first nine months of this year, says Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, Jim Kelly writes. Figures released yesterday show that about 800 businesses failed each week in that period, a total of 31,340. This compared with 36,203 in the same period last year. Mr Philip Mellor, senior analyst with the group, said that the figures showed that the level of company liquidations was falling much faster - 17.7 per cent - than the level of bankruptcies - 10.5 per cent. He said: 'Larger companies are in a much better position to take advantage of the recovery while smaller businesses are less able to cope with the very competitive business climate.' Wales was the only area where failures increased, by 4 per cent, while the west Midlands had the largest drop in England at 26.7 per cent.</p>

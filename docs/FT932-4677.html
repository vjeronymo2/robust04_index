			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clive Smith succeeds in avoiding bankruptcy MR CLIVE SMITH, the entrepreneur once involved in two natural resource companies under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, yesterday avoided bankruptcy when a majority of creditors owed more than Pounds 20m accepted his proposals for repayment at a rate of 8.13p in the pound. However, some creditors remained sceptical about the outcome of the vote and determined to take the issue further. In a meeting lasting more than two hours Mr Smith was questioned closely about his links with some of the creditors who voted in favour. Most particularly, they sought information about his relationship with Richard Pearce and Son, a Hong Kong registered company with the same Irish address as Mr Kelvin Myles, who has manged many of Mr Smith's offshore interests. Mr Smith denied he had any connection, direct or indirect, with the Hong Kong company. Richard Pearce's proxy was voted by the meeting's chairman Mr Graham Wilson, the insolvency practitioner who arranged the creditors' meeting. Representatives also asked for details of any assets Mr Smith holds offshore and questioned the validity of allowing Newsham Investments to vote its claimed Pounds 3.8m debt. Newsham is a vehicle for the Smith family interests. One creditor leaving the meeting commented: 'We remain sceptical. We have been promised today information about Mr Smith's offshore trust fund but we have yet to receive it.' Some creditors' representatives also sought information about the nature of Mr Smith's involvement with Alpine (Double Glazing), the windows company, which ceased trading late last month.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / When honesty means sharing your bribes: Corruption investigations are threatening to unravel the Italian state. A former official tells how the system worked CORRUPTION in Italy has gone beyond the bounds of decency. So vast is the scale of rottenness now being uncovered that a whole ruling class risks being indicted. Already, the courts are being overloaded with the weight of investigation and the prosecutions have scarcely begun. For the first time, a democracy is having to confront the uncomfortable question: if the system is corrupt, to what extent should individual guilt be pursued? Roberto Mongini has had time to reflect on the question. This 46-year-old Milanese lawyer, and one-time rising star in the Christian Democrat Party, was arrested last June and spent 17 days inside the bleak walls of Milan's San Vittorio prison. He was released after confessing to exploiting his position as vice-president of the Milan Airports Authority to collect illicit funds for the party, and went immediately on a pilgrimage to Lourdes to come to terms with his fall from grace. Mongini claims to be at peace with himself now although he has lost his seat on the party's national executive and his political career is over. With the compulsiveness of a convert to honest government, he admits collecting nearly L900m (Pounds 410,000) in bribes - a sum he considers small by the standards of what was going around him. 'I willingly accepted to be part of the system and therefore cannot regard myself as a victim,' he says. 'At a personal level, I don't consider myself a criminal. Indeed, I consider myself personally honest; nevertheless, I admit I formed part of a dishonest system.' This ambivalent moral credo seems to have been shared by a great many others who either turned a blind eye to corruption or connived in creaming 'commissions' off the top of every type of economic activity. The magistrates' investigations range from road-building and ports to the Milan and Rome metros and the space agency, football stadiums and overseas aid to restructuring the chemicals industry. No European democracy has ever witnessed corruption investigated on such an all-embracing scale. Questions are being asked about the ability of the courts to cope 'We are not confronted with isolated instances of corruption: the entire system was like that, from Milan to Sicily,' says Mongini. 'Wherever you look, you will find illicit financing, it was the Italian way of doing things.' Antonio Di Pietro, the leading Milan investigative magistrate, says of the snowballing investigation: 'I don't see how it can finish. In just one day, 14 or 15 persons came wanting to confess stories of bribery to me. We can't go on like this.' He adds: 'We will proceed with the penal side . . . but some sort of political clarification is necessary which goes over and above the magistrature - otherwise, there is the daily risk of something happening with serious impact on the economic system . . . Besides, the judiciary cannot be expected to uncover everything.' The construction and general contracting business - the sector exposed most to the magistrates' enquiries - is slowing to a halt throughout Italy because businessmen fear being accused of bribery. The entire political establishment and its long-standing incestuous relationship with the business community is being called into question. Magistrates have talked of having to put 60,000 people through the courts if everybody involved in corruption is charged. More than 50 members of parliament are being investigated for corruption and two party leaders,Bettino Craxi of the Socialists and Giorgio La Malfa of the Republicans, have been forced to step down in the past two weeks. More than 400 witnesses will probably be called in the scrutiny of road contracts alone. One Milan magistrates has suggested that the city's corruption scandal - over 110 people have been arrested and more than 300 questioned - will provide the local judicial system with work for the next decade. As the complete gamut of Italy's institutions - and the people who run them  -are dragged into the magistrates' net, the country's democracy risks being weakened. A number of politicians, including Craxi have made this point. However, it is difficult for the politicians to take action without being seen as self-serving. When Milan magistrates began to expose corruption with a series of arrests a year ago, the reaction in the press was surprise: surprise not that such wrong-doing existed but that it had come to light. The Milanese even took a perverse pleasure in saying the expose was possible precisely because the city had a morality; Naples they argue could never have been the starting place for a nationwide anti-corruption drive. Now the public is both angry and taken aback by the systematic scale of the corruption. 'Corruption has always existed,' veteran television commentator Vittorio Orefice said recently. 'Like prostitution, it's destined to eternity. It's a question of containing corruption within the bounds of decency. We have descended to the level of Cambodia.' According to Mongini the 'system' being exposed dates back to the 1970s. Then the Christian Democrats and their allies were terrified that the powerful Italian Communist Party would come to power through the ballot box. Knowing that the Communists received secret funding from the Soviet bloc, they felt no compunction in seeking their own finance to supplement the small contributions by the state. The Christian Democrats, and then the smaller Socialist Party, rationalised their large organisational infrastructure (including tame newspapers and trades unions) by the need to counter the Communists' presence in the unions, the media and co-operative movement. The 'system' centred round the placement of pliant executives in state companies and municipally controlled entities who then farmed out contracts on the basis of rigged tenders and accompanying commissions. Alternatively, the parties had people specially delegated to negotiate kick-backs on contracts. With the declining threat from communism in the 1980s, the Communists were allowed to be part of the 'system'. In the case of Milan, the parties received a fixed percentage of the commissions according to their share of the electoral vote. This covered every public works contract including the metro extension, waste disposal, a new municipal theatre and the modernisation of Linate and Malpensa airports. As the party bureaucracies swelled, so the need for funds grew. By the 1990s some 129,000 jobs fed off the political system, yet the annual state subsidy differences between parties narrowed, loyalties could only be bought with favours. It was a mutually reinforcing circle that always returned to a growing appetite for funds. The real cost of running this political establishment was close to L5,000bn. Mongini claims that in the late '80s the 'system' degenerated. 'Everyone wanted to get in on the act, even the smallest bagmen. You would have people in the local health authorities demanding kick-backs on something as small as a syringe contract. It got out of hand.' People became greedy and some of the private sector companies baulked at the rising demand for bribes. The Socialists have been exposed as the most flagrant offenders, but the Christian Democrats were more subtle and seasoned players. How much did the party bosses in Rome know about what was going on? 'They knew, helped set it up and were also on the take,' says Mongini. 'The Milan operation of the party cost L2.5bn a year and they gave us L100m a year from Rome - Rome did not think we used to win the lottery every month to cover the rest]' Magistrates have paid particular attention to those running party finances. Vincenzo Balzamo, the administrative secretary of the Socialist party, died of a heart attack last November while being investigated for corruption. His opposite number in the Christian Democrats, Severino Citaristi, has been served with a record ten warrants notifying him that he is under investigation for illegal party finance. It is far from clear whether private business has been a victim or willing accomplice although companies been touched by the inquiry include Fiat, Pesenti and Ferruzzi. 'The entrepreneurs are desperately trying to demonstrate they were obliged to pay by the politicians,' Mongini claims. In Milan, he says, 'the parties had an interest in getting the money and the entrepreneurs had an interest in giving it to them. Like couples making love, it was usually by mutual consent.' The one charge Mongini denies is that of extortion. Companies paid willingly for the privilege of rigging the bidding process: excluding rival tenders and fixing the price. This relationship between business and government has been encouraged by the practice in Italy of having private tenders. On average, throughout Italy, two thirds of contracts have been by private tender or have not been subject to parliamentary scrutiny. In this way contracts are easily rigged or rewritten in mid-performance. The lack of transparency and the obligatory inclusion of 'commissions' explains why foreign contractors have, on the whole, avoided Italy and why contracts has been costly by European standards. Mongini says that, of the money he raised, L120m a year went to finance his faction of Milan's Christian Democrat Party and the rest to central funds. He denies enriching himself; but calculates that at least one third of money collected in the 'system' was for personal enrichment - 'but to prove this you will have look at Swiss bank accounts.' He says the Milan magistrates have been clever, using every weapon at their disposal. They made him feel that they were closing in but kept him guessing for two months. 'When I was eventually arrested in June it was like an act of liberation. I understand people have gone to extremes awaiting arrest.' Seven suspects have commited suicide in the past nine months and an eighth fifth was saved by chance this month after having taken an overdose in a parked car. At first Mongini was convinced that, as a lawyer, he could avoid incriminating himself under interrogation. He resisted for 14 days. Then the ordeal of prison, combined with the realisation that the magistrates had an accurate picture of how bribes were collected, convinced him to co-operate. The Milan magistrates have exploited their right to keep suspects in detention for three months, and have made a point of arresting those used to the good life either late at night or early in the morning. Release from prison has been on a direct reward basis: once suspects confess. By early this month, 105 of those arrested had confessed. Mongini observes wryly: 'The reception centre at San Vittorio prison has become like the foyer at La Scala - where you see anyone and everyone.' But members of parliament have yet to grace its cells. Under Italian law, magistrates must first ask parliament to waive the blanket immunity extended to deputies and senators. This process can take up to five months and the waiver is by no means guaranteed, especially now that parliament feels it is being challenged by the magistrature. So many politicians are already compromised in the scandal that parliament is in a weak position to take the initiative to prevent the investigations paralysing the Italian state and its institutions. One Milan magistrate, Gherardo Colombo has suggested a pardon on the condition that those who have taken or given contract commissions confess and repay the monies. Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, has suggested it is wrong to focus on those under investigation as the sole culprits. Italian society, he says, has been an accomplice in tolerating corruption. Mongini, who hopes he can avoid a full prison sentence, backs such views and adds. 'The public will not accept a simple pardon; and the best thing is for all those in power during this period to recognise that they are no longer acceptable to the Italian people. It is the end of a political class. They must leave the scene - and that includes me.'</p>

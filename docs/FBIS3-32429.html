The Information and Press Department of the Army (DIDE)  pointed out that "the current government is democratic, and it  is very difficult to accept proposals from an illegal group that  is constantly breaking the law."    Nevertheless, DIDE said the Armed Forces will adhere to any  decision made by General Commander and President Ramiro de Leon  Carpio. It also warned that any guerrilla position must remain  within the framework of their negotiations with the government.    The rebel Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG)  stated in a communique released in Mexico City that the  constitutional and institutional changes the country needs can  only be accomplished through a "Unity and National Salvation"  government.    The URNG views the approval of constitutional reforms  through  the referendum held last Sunday as a "failure" and pointed out  that the popular consultation confirmed the government's lack of  credibility and legitimacy.    The guerrilla's claims are prompted by the results of last  Sunday's popular consultation, in which only 10.75 percent of  the 3.4 million electorate voted to approve 37 constitutional  reforms.    Vinicio Hernandez, leader of the Guatemalan Workers Trade  Union, told Notimex it is impossible to establish a united  government because, to begin with, the peace negotiations are  being held in secret. "We believe that rapprochement efforts are  very positive but if the civilian, labor, Indian, or student  sectors do not participate in the dialogue we will never reach a  firm agreement," Hernandez added.    The labor leader said there has been talk of an imminent  signing of peace to end the 30-year armed conflict, but  pacification "will not be accomplished unless there is consensus  among the people who are affected."    Meanwhile, the Peasant Unity Committee (CUC) has said that  as  long as there is a shortage of land, housing, and health care in  Guatemala, a "Unity and Salvation" government will rapidly  disintegrate. CUC leader Sebastian Morales said: "as long as  there is hunger, cold, disease, and human rights violations,  peace will be very far away." The peasant organization said it  might join the URNG's initiative as long as the solutions  proposed are specific.    President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who has not commented on  the  rebel statement, claims he "won" the popular consultation by a  margin of seven to one votes.    According to the president, the referendum results are the  first step toward ending the political crisis that was unleashed  on 25 May when former president Jorge Serrano Elias, who is  exiled in Panama, disrupted constitutional order.</p>

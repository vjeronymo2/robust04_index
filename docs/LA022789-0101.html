			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> OUSTED OMAHA MAYOR TO RUN AGAIN  </P> <P> Former Mayor Mike Boyle, ousted in a 1987 recall election, announced today that  he will run again for the city's top job.  </P> <P> In announcing his candidacy, Boyle said he decided to run because he loves  politics and public service and because a surprisingly large number of people  urged him to enter the race.  </P> <P> Boyle, 45, was elected mayor in 1981 and reelected in 1985. But opponents began  gathering petition signatures shortly after his second term started. They  accused Boyle of abusing his power, meddling in police affairs, being soft on  drunken driving and being disrespectful, citing an incident in which he  allegedly threw pats of butter during a dinner-table argument.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation on the Korean peninsula is growing  tense as the UN Security Council [UNSC] studies ways to slap  sanctions against North Korea. It was learned on 17 June that  the U.S. Government has asked the Japanese Government to  cooperate in airlifting foreigners, including Americans, from  South Korea when it airlifts Japanese in South Korea back to  Japan. Upon receiving the request from the U.S. Government, the  Japanese Government plans to do its best for an early enactment  of an amendment bill to the Self- Defense Forces Law [SDFL] to  make it possible for the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] to send its  transport planes to South Korea to airlift them back to Japan.  The Japanese Government also has begun studying ways to revamp  the current customs system and the current immigration process,  and to use naval ships which can transport more people than  aircraft.    According to a 17 June disclosure by a government source,  the  U.S. Government has made the request to the Japanese Government  through diplomatic channels, and during his 14 June telephone  conversation with Prime Minister Hata, President Clinton told  Hata that the United States intended to reinforce U.S. forces in  South Korea and then asked Japan's cooperation in airlifting  foreigners, including Americans, in South Korea back to Japan.    The President is believed to have asked Japan to cooperate  in  airlifting Americans in South Korea after concluding that Japan  cannot take any military action because of its constitutional  constraints and Japan's possible contributions must be confined  to nonmilitary areas like "rear support."    About 30,000 dependents of U.S. military personnel reside in  South Korea. The situation is that they must be evacuated from  South Korea via Japan to the United States and Japan's  cooperation is indispensable for their evacuation.    The amendment bill to the SDFL is under deliberation in the  Security Committee of the House of Representatives. If the  amendment bill to the law were enacted, it would make it  possible for the SDF to use its airplanes to airlift Japanese  and foreigners in South Korea back to Japan. The prospect of  enacting the amendment bill during the current Diet session is  slim because of the failure to adjust between an amendment bill  proposed by the government and another amendment bill proposed  by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. There is a  possibility that the Diet will take up the amendment bill for  deliberation in the closing days of its current session  depending on how the UNSC handles the question of imposing  sanctions against North Korea for its suspected development of  nuclear weapons and how North Korea responds to the sanctions in  the future.    There is a strong view among experts that airports will be  targets of attacks in the event of an emergency and ships are  more efficient than aircraft in terms of transport. Neither the  current SDFL, nor the amendment bill allows the use of SDF ships  for transport of such people. The Japanese Government,  therefore, has no choice but to use civilian ships for their  transport. The government is expected to be pressed to adjust  domestic opinions on the use of civilian ships.</p>

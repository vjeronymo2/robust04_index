			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $225-MILLION TRAFFIC OVERHAUL URGED TO HELP LONG BEACH GO WITH THE FLOW  </P> <P> A consultant has recommended a $225-million program to improve traffic flow in  the city, including building overpasses at crowded intersections and either  widening major streets or prohibiting parking on them during commute hours.  </P> <P> In a finding that could come as a blow to slow-growth forces, consultant  Patrick A. Gibson of Barton-Aschman Associates Inc. of Pasadena said congestion  on Long Beach streets will increase 30% during the next 20 years -- even if new  development is virtually halted.  </P> <P> That is because many commuters use Long Beach streets on their way to Orange  County or other cities, a practice likely to increase as traffic on the San  Diego Freeway worsens, he said.  </P> <P> The recommendations were the preliminary findings of an eight-month, $343,950  study aimed at predicting how much traffic would be carried by Long Beach  streets in the year 2010.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calls for Additional Lanes  </P> <P> In presentations Monday to the Redevelopment Agency board and the city's  Citizens Transportation Task Force, Gibson called for adding new lanes in each  direction on the San Diego, Artesia, San Gabriel River and Long Beach freeways,  and doubling the size of the public transit bus fleet.  </P> <P> He recommended widening major east-west streets, including Ocean Boulevard,  Pacific Coast Highway, Broadway, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, Anaheim and Spring  streets, or converting on-street parking spaces to traffic lanes during rush  hours.  </P> <P> Similar measures are required on some north-south avenues to increase their  capacity, Gibson said. Among them are Alamitos, Martin Luther King Jr.,  Atlantic and Clark avenues and Lakewood Boulevard. He suggested the same  treatment for Los Coyotes Diagonal.  </P> <P> The only place in Long Beach where road widening would be necessary and would  require the removal of buildings would be at a bottleneck on 7th street, just  west of the intersection with Pacific Coast Highway and Bellflower Boulevard,  he said. About 10 houses would have to be razed on the north side of 7th Street  to improve traffic flow, he said.  </P> <P> That same intersection -- known to commuters as the dreaded "iron triangle" --  was one of three that Gibson believes are already overcrowded and in need of  overpasses or underpasses to move traffic faster. The other two are the Traffic  Circle and the intersection of Ocean Boulevard, Alamitos Avenue and Shoreline  Drive. Future overpasses or underpasses will be needed at the intersection of  Spring Street and Lakewood Boulevard, and Pacific Coast Highway and 2nd Street,  the report said.  </P> <P> Seventh Street would remain the city's premier east-west route. Gibson said  that little-known DeForest Avenue, just east of the Los Angeles River, should  be converted into a major link between 7th Street and Ocean Boulevard.  </P> <P> The rush-hour parking prohibitions and street widenings are among the cheapest  and most effective solutions to Long Beach's traffic woes, costing about $25  million, according to the study. Building the overpasses at major intersections  could cost $110 million, the most expensive item on Gibson's list of proposed  improvements.  </P> <P> Additional parking garages could cost $20 million and various improvements to  increase the traffic-handling capacity of streets would cost $25 million,  according to the preliminary findings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Double Bus Fleet  </P> <P> As another option, the city could spend $60 million to double the size of the  Long Beach Transit bus fleet and a shuttle system to move downtown workers from  parking lots to their offices. But even with a massive increase in carrying  capacity, Gibson estimated that only 6%, up from the current 2%, of downtown  employees would take buses to work.  </P> <P> He endorsed the idea of a downtown monorail, a concept being bandied about by  Disney Development Corp., which is thinking of building a $1-billion theme park  at the site of the Queen Mary, and a group of other major developers. "I think  a monorail or fixed guideway system in downtown is eminently practical," he  said. Besides moving people around from building to building, it could serve to  move people from remote parking lots to offices.  </P> <P> He said he will be working with Disney to consider the traffic effects of any  project the firm may build.  </P> <P> To pay for the improvements, Gibson suggested a fee on developers to offset the  congestion caused by their new buildings. The potential costs of making the  improvements in Long Beach would be in the range of those paid in sections of  Los Angeles by developers -- and the rewards would be far greater, he said.  </P> <P> None of the recommendations will be easy to follow, he said. But the city will  have to weigh its desire to conquer its traffic congestion against any  inconveniences that might be created by the suggested solutions.  </P> <P> Sid Solomon, political action chairman of the Long Beach Area Citizens  Involved, a group that supports controlled growth, said the report defies logic  when it states that limiting downtown construction will not lessen demands on  traffic.  </P> <P> Doug Otto, who is chairman of the transportation task force, said the study  appears to be a "state-of-the-art" document that will receive a lot of  consideration.  </P></p>

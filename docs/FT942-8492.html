			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Sky steps up war against pirates British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company which runs Sky Television, has switched to a new subscription card in an attempt to beat the growing threat from pirates selling unauthorised cards. The cards are used by subscribers to decode the satellite broadcaster's signals, which are scrambled for transmission. The cards were switched on Wednesday. For several weeks, in a multi-million-pound exercise, the satellite broadcaster has been distributing new cards to the 3.3m homes that pay for at least one of the its scrambled subscription services. Sky said yesterday that the new cards would 'put all existing pirates out of action'. There has been evidence of a growing number of pirate cards becoming available in the UK, many manufactured in Germany. A year's subscription to all BSkyB's services costs Pounds 240 but some of the pirate cards have been offered for as little as Pounds 40. Some pirates have promised customers that for a small additional fee they will send updated cards every time a signal or card software change is made by BSkyB - a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. One observer said that the pirates were already trying to make replicas of the new card. An indication of the potential scale of the problem came recently when a German computer student grew frustrated that he could not subscribe to Sky to watch Star Trek. He set out on an international computer bulletin board - potentially available to thousands of computer enthusiasts - details of how to break the old Sky code by linking up a PC to a television set. The student wrote: 'I don't want to cause any harm to Sky and I even asked them for a regular subscription some time ago, but they refused to sell one to Germany. So they have to live with the consequences of attracting the interest of high-tech freaks to the technical details of their access system.'</p>

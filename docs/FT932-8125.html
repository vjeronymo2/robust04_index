			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Arts: Music for the thinking man - London Jazz Festival There was a time when jazz music was easily identified by its instrumentation, syncopation or its nervy improvisation. But contemporary music has become harder to label and today's venn diagram of jazz contains a perplexing number and diversity of sets. From hiphop to hardcore and new music to world music, everybody wants a piece of jazz and jazz wants a bit of everybody else. But if the argument over whether the interchange dilutes or strengthens the jazz tradition is as long and circular as an Evan Parker soprano solo, what is certain is that festival programmers have an ever widening spectrum of possibilities from which to choose. The London Jazz Festival, which winds down this weekend, has ranged from scientific abstraction to the loping riddim of reggae via explosive fusion and the effing and blinding of rap. Yet one of the highpoints of the week has been provided by the (rare) appearance of jazz music's master of understatement, US guitarist Jim Hall. Ever the thinking musician's guitarist, Hall has achieved a modest cult following for his quiet communion with pianist Bill Evans, clarinettist Paul Desmond and the swaying reeds of Jimmy Giuffre. Joined on the altar of Islington's Union Chapel by the choice chords of pianist Larry Goldings, Hall unfolded a succession of exquisitely fragile arrangements that bound together beautifully with the minimum volume. 'This next one,' he said to the sound of pins dropping, 'is a stretched out blues with some funny notes in it.' So subdued and spacious was Hall's delivery that applause for delicacies like 'Some Day' and 'My Funny Valentine' seemed intrusive. His more swinging originals featured devastating technique and razor rhythm delivered with similar nonchalance. In stark contrast to Jim Hall's effortless enchantment of his audience, pouting Brazilian salsa queen Tania Maria put a great deal of energy into dissipating the electricity generated by an excitable crowd at The Forum in Kentish Town the following night. Somewhat exposed at the keyboards (electric and acoustic) in a trio alongside bassist Eddie Gomez and percussionist Don Alias, Maria's hamfisted attempts at crowd control were enervating. An early attempt to enjoin the party crowd in a clapalong session failed when it became clear that Maria herself was unsure of the time signature. Poor Gomez and Alias stuck doggedly to their groove as Maria splintered chords and wailed hideously into the wraparound mike. At the controls of a large and fast moving band, Maria's fiery fusion of Brazilian dance music and jazz can be exhilarating; uncut it is more like salsa hell. The four trombones (one a bass), three trumpets and various reeds of John Surman's Brass Project provide the perfect antidote to this sort of nonsense. Kicked along by a feisty rhythm section and all overseen by director John Warren, Surman's swooping bass and alto clarinets, soprano and baritone saxophones front a uniquely English and folky form of big band jazz. But Warren's compositions, most of them new and premiered at the Lilian Baylis Theatre, packed in well-sprung Ellingtonian themes, choral and classical sentiment rounded off with an extraordinary arrangement based on the music hall refrain 'My old man said follow the van . . '. Surman's own soloing goes from strength to strength. His spiralling soprano helped by a delay button was hypnotic, the dancing baritone set against ostinato brass uplifting. The concert will be broadcast on Radio 3 on June 5. Sponsors: The London Boroughs of Camden, Islington and Hackney; The London Arts Board; London Boroughs Grant Committee; City and inner London north training and enterprise council.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Carter pushes Bosnian Serb offer Mr Jimmy Carter, the US peace mediator, yesterday announced that the Bosnian Serbs had agreed an immediate ceasefire. He said after talks with their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, that they were willing to discuss the international peace plan. Before the meeting in Pale, the Bosnian Serb capital, the former US president had walked into controversy when he said that Bosnian Serbs wanted peace and that Americans 'have primarily heard one side of the story': that the Bosnian Serbs were the aggressors. The White House, which has been sceptical of Mr Carter's latest peace foray and has emphasised that it is not an official mission, immediately disputed his assertion about which side was the aggressor. 'The Bosnian Serbs are the aggressors in this war,' a White House spokeswoman said. 'I think the American people have had an opportunity to see what's happening on the ground there and to see both sides of the story.' Mr Carter said after several hours of talks with Mr Karadzic, who had invited him to undertake his mission, that he would return to Sarajevo to put the ceasefire proposal to the Moslem-led Bosnian government. Mr Carter said: 'The Bosnian Serb side agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to negotiate a lasting cessation of hostilities. While a ceasefire is in place, Bosnian Serb leaders agree to discuss peace on the basis of the contact group plan at a mutually acceptable site.' Mr Carter, said he had informed the White House of the outcome of his meeting. There was also controversy over whether the Bosnian Serbs had fulfilled the pledges they gave to Mr Carter before he agreed to meet them. Since Mr Karadzic issued his promises last week, Serb forces have attacked peacekeepers and civilian targets in Sarajevo, blocked UN convoys and expelled more civilians from Serb-held territory, UN officials reported. The Bosnian Serbs say publicly they have limited expectations from Mr Carter's visit. But officials hint privately that the leadership in Pale may be close to accepting a revised version of peace proposals first presented by the five-member contact group in the summer. The original plan, they believe, called on the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from territory before negotiations on complex issues such as agreed land swaps and links between the Bosnian Serbs and what remains of Yugoslavia. 'The contact group plan has been changed,' an official said. The latest version makes it clear that only a ceasefire and verbal commitment are needed before negotiations begin. The official said that what the Serbs wanted was 'near to independence. We are not looking for a seat at the UN. Our idea is to unite with Serbia'. Unity would not preclude close economic and administrative ties with the rest of Bosnia, he said. His remarks appeared at variance with the frequent public insistence that only full, internationally recognised sovereignty would satisfy the Bosnian Serbs.</p>

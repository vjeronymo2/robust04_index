			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Rwanda: The Arusha meeting has  failed. The representatives of the Rwandan Armed Forces did not  turn up and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] delegation left  early this afternoon. However, the UN special representative,  Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, wants to see some positive signs. Anne  Corpet got through to him in Arusha earlier today:    [Begin Booh-Booh recording] I do not think that it was the  leader... [changes thought] The RPF secretary general was  received by the prime minister and the OAU secretary general  this morning. I was received after him, and I was told that  some proposals about a possible agreement concerning the  cease-fire were made to him and that he was intending to get in  touch with the leader of his party. He will give the official  reaction of his party tomorrow. He has left for Nairobi to get  in touch with this person. In that respect, we cannot say that  it is a failure.    What concerns me is the hoax played by the representative of  the Rwandan government. We have not had any news from this  delegation. It was said that it was now in Goma, now in  Kinshasa, now in Nairobi, and their absence here is a major  handicap in the contacts we have to establish. [end recording]    [Announcer] [passage omitted] As for the fighting, it  continued all day in Kigali according to the United Nations.  [passage omitted] We have just heard from Medecins Sans  Frontieres Belgium that 170 Rwandan wounded who were in the  hospital of Butare have been slaughtered by the Rwandan  presidential guard since Saturday morning, yesterday morning.  This was reported by Medecins Sans Frontieres Belgium, which  also said that its team has had to leave the town of Butare.</p>

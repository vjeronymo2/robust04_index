			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hachette revises Matra terms HACHETTE, the heavily indebted French media group, has revised the terms of its proposed merger with Matra, the defence electronics company also controlled by the Lagardere family, and finalised plans for its own FFr900m (Dollars 165.5m) capital increase. Under the new merger terms the shareholders in Matra, which has proved more robust than the loss-making Hachette over the past year, will receive 13 of the latter's shares for every five of their existing shares. This represents a marked improvement over the original merger terms in which Matra's investors would have been given five Hachette shares for two shares in the defence electronics group. Matra's shareholders will receive a package of shares in Hachette worth just over FFr1,240 for Matra shares worth FFr973.50 Since the announcement of the original terms Hachette has continued to perform poorly. It has also discovered the extent of its exposure to La Cinq, the French television station that collapsed earlier this year, in which it was the managing shareholder with 25 per cent of the equity. A French court on Monday ruled that Hachette had to inject FFr100m into La Cinq. Hachette has already made provisions of FFr3.54bn to cover its liabilities on the station. Mr Philippe Camus, chairman of MMB, Hachette's main shareholder, said yesterday that these provisions were 'more than adequate'. Mr Camus also disclosed the final terms of Hachette's proposed capital increase. The company plans to raise FFr900m by issuing 11.8m shares at FFr76.30 each. The price of the issue compares with Hachette's suspended share price of FFr95.40. Hachette's shares are expected to resume trading on the Paris stock market today after being suspended on Monday pending yesterday's announcement. The shares of Matra and MMB were also suspended on Monday at FFr194.70 and FFr82 respectively.</p>

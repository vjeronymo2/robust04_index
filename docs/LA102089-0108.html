			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: THE LASER BIN;  </P> <P> BOTH 'LITTLE SHOP,' 'TIME' OFFER GOOD BITS  </P> <P> "Little Shop of Horrors." (Warner, Extended Play CLV, $35) and "Time After  Time" (Warner, Extended Play CLV, $35).  </P> <P> Both of these films are available on videotape and both provide good home video  value: Parts of them are worth seeing repeatedly. But the laser video discs  offer the kind of home viewing experience that videotape just cannot duplicate.  Not only is the picture sharper and the digitally processed sound track  clearer, but there's the laser's Chapter Index feature. Chapter stops are  placed before highlights in each film, enabling the viewer to find, for  example, favorite dramatic scenes ("Chasing Jack the Ripper through San  Francisco" in the time-travel horror/thriller "Time After Time") or musical  numbers (the Steve Martin-sung "Dentist!" in this 1986 version of "Little Shop  of Horrors"). "Time After Time" offers 15 chapter stop numbers; "Little Shop of  Horrors," 14. BARBARA SALTZMAN  </P></p>

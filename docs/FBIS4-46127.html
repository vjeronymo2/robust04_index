			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Lt. Gen. Ehud Baraq, chief of staff, and </F> Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, chief of the Intelligence Branch, with  domestic correspondents at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv --  live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A considerable number of  weapons were found in the building [unspecified], including a  loaded gun at Mustafa al-Dirani's bedside, which he had no time  to use, just as others had no such opportunity as a result of  the element of surprise. Numerous documents of all kinds -- not  just written ones -- were found. [passage omitted]    The objectives of the operation were fully attained.  Al-Dirani is in our hands, and we believe his interrogation  will contribute to shedding light on the situation with regard  to Ron Arad's whereabouts and perhaps to understanding what must  be done to deal with Ron Arad's case in the future. [passage  omitted]    Sagi: Mustafa al-Dirani is the head of the  Believers Resistance, a splinter group of the Amal organization.  He headed Amal's terrorist apparatus until 1988 and, as part of  his duties, was responsible for a large number of attacks on IDF  soldiers, from the time of the Peace for Galilee Operation and  until he retired from Amal in 1988. He is the founder of the  Believers Resistance, an independent faction which has now  merged with Hizballah. While it was an independent body,  however, it carried out numerous attacks against IDF and SLA  [South Lebanese Army] soldiers in south Lebanon. His  involvement in holding Ron Arad hostage has long been known, at  least to the intelligence community. We possess reliable  information -- which applied prior to the operation and has been  largely confirmed with al-Dirani's transfer to Israel -- to the  effect that Ron Arad was taken prisoner and held by Mustafa  al-Dirani for a period of over two years and that he even  conducted negotiations about him which may give us a lead as to  the future and perhaps even the fate of Ron Arad. [passage  omitted]    Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1's Alon  Ben-David: Mr. Chief of Staff, the prime minister said a  few minutes ago that al-Dirani's abduction was not meant to  provide us with a bargaining chip for Ron Arad's release.  Before we set out on this operation, did we have any  information to the effect that this abduction will bring Ron  Arad's return to Israel somewhat closer?    Baraq: In my opinion, the main thing to be  obtained is a better understanding on our part -- as a result of  what will emerge from the investigation and of a thorough  analysis of the papers and other documents we seized there -- as  to what exactly happened to Ron Arad. It is the confirmed end  of a thread leading to somebody who held him in his hands and  apparently handed him over to the Iranians. Information and a  better understanding may surface later as to how to act in the  future in order to secure Ron Arad's return to Israel.    Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Roni Daniyel:  Mr. Chief of Staff, could you be more specific about the method  of operation in the village last night?    Baraq: I think it would not be right to detail  the methods of operation on television. I cannot swear to you  that this will be the last time we will have to use these  operational tools, which are very important and sensitive and  contribute a great deal to the IDF's abilities. I cannot tell  you that this is the last time we will use them. Therefore, the  better we manage to conceal and cloud the details of the  operation, the better it will be. [passage omitted]</p>

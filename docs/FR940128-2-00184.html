			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> *Model  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The development of a training model that would include a methodology which may innovatively address the needs of the hardest to serve farmworkers while at the same time imparting employability skills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant should include an identification of the geographic area selected and the rationale for the site selection. It should also include a description of the following: How participants would be identified and recruited, the instructional methodology to be employed and how this would be tied into skill instruction (either in skill areas outside of agricultural employment or leading to upgraded positions within agriculture). Included would be a description of the manner in which farmworker organizations within the designated demonstration service area would be utilized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grantee shall select or develop a methodology or technique that is reflective of addressing the unique needs of the farmworker clientele of the section 402 programs who have been identified as the hardest to serve_those being individuals with the disadvantage of having limited skills, limited English and limited reading and cognitive abilities; shall demonstrate how this methodology may prove to be more effective_in terms of outcomes_than previously used practices; shall identify, recruit and enroll farmworkers who satisfy the afore-stated barriers for participation in the demonstration model; shall provide the Department with progress assessments of the participants at agreed upon periods during the grant; and shall establish measurable benchmarks to determine the success and effectiveness of the model. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> *Model  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. The development of a training model that sets out a technical approach to link farmworker service delivery agents in order to share clientele information, and the establishment of a related data base. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal should identify the geographic region selected and the rationale for it. It should include a description of the methodology to be used and those organizations selected to participate. It should describe the data to be collected, how it will be used and how it will benefit the farmworkers_either directly or indirectly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the development and submission of a grant application to this SGA, applicants must demonstrate an understanding of the farmworker population_including socio-economic conditions and prevailing regional and ethnic cultures of the people whom the Department is mandated to serve; a knowledge and understanding of the migratory streams which farmworkers travel in search of employment in agriculture and the living and working conditions which prevail in migrant farmworker streams; a knowledge and understanding of the methods of providing employment and training activities and services in behalf of migrant and seasonal farmworkers; a knowledge and understanding of the current agricultural recruitment and employment system; a knowledge and understanding of demonstrated expertise in the proffered activities under the proposed effort; and finally, demonstrated support of the community and knowledge of the labor market for which the project is proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Perhaps one of the more important goals of this initiative is focusing attention on the unique employment and training needs of migrant and seasonal farmworkers and bringing to bear upon this challenge a creative and innovative approach. With this in mind, these demonstration grants are intended to lay the foundation for a new approach in serving farmworkers and/or providing an augmentation to existing employment and training efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grantee shall establish cooperative arrangements with all organizations serving farmworkers within the designated geographic region of this demonstration model; shall develop a data base for the collection of relevant information; shall demonstrate how this data will be beneficial to the participating farmworker organizations, the U.S. Department of Labor, and to the farmworkers; shall provide the Department with periodic status reports on the progress toward the goals of this model demonstration; shall establish a methodology for linking all farmworker programs in the designated area so that they may access, contribute to, and benefit from the data base. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

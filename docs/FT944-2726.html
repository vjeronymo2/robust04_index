			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Cazenove plans India fund Cazenove is hoping to raise Dollars 50m from investors in London and the Gulf for a new closed-end Indian investment fund, to be managed by Chescor. The Oryx fund will concentrate on medium-sized and smaller companies, with more than 70 per cent in listed companies and about a quarter in unlisted investments. The fund will be based in Guernsey, but listed on the London Stock Exchange. Investments will be made through Mauritius, to take advantage of its double taxation treaty with India. The fund aims to be 90 per cent invested within six months of launch. Chescor is a small London-based investment house which has already been involved in setting up an India fund for Martin Currie.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Book Review: Cowboys in the wild, wild east The Theft of the Second Russian Revolution By Stephen Handelman Michael Joseph, Pounds 16.99, 360 pages After a year spearheading the Russian government's crackdown on organised crime, Inspector Vladimir Kalinichenko decided it was a Sisyphean struggle. 'In this sort of environment, the people who were in official posts can still do whatever they want,' a dejected Mr Kalinichenko explained, after discovering yet another link between the gangsters he was meant to fight and the government officials he was meant to serve. Mr Kalinichenko is one of hundreds of Russians whose adventures in the new wild east convinced Stephen Handelman that gangster-bureaucrats have become the ruling figures in the new Russia. A bitter assertion - made timely by allegations that government insiders may have profited from this week's crash of the rouble - this is the subject of Comrade Criminal, Handelman's great, but depressing new book. Mr Handelman, who was Moscow bureau chief for Canada's Toronto Star for five years, contends that the promise held out by the collapse of communism exists no more. Instead of capitalism, Russia has turned to 'frenzied profiteering'; instead of fairly applied laws and contracts, Russia has corrupt officials and business deals enforced through the barrel of a gun; and instead of democracy, Russia's future will be one of authoritarian rule or criminal chaos. His book is based on travels through the arms bazaars of the embattled Chechen republic in the Caucasus, the bustling ports of tiny Estonia - which, on the strength of metal smuggled in from Russia, became the world's sixth largest exporter of ferrous metal in 1992 - and the large defence plants of the Urals. Gripping and lively, it is an account of mafia machinations and the generally fruitless efforts of honest cops and outnumbered democratic politicians to thwart them. The democrats' struggle is a fight against history, suggests Handelman. The Bolshevik revolution of 1917 established a state ruled by communist comrades, who, faced with impossible production targets, used corruption to grease the creaky wheels of central planning. The shadow of this state, revealed in fascinating detail by Handelman, was a Vorovsky Mir, a criminal world, of gangsters who provided Soviet citizens with the consumer goods their ruling comrades considered inessential. Handelman's account of the cementing of an alliance between the comrades and the criminals adds up to one of the most comprehensive and convincing representations of what has happened in Russia since 1991. But the book describes a system, rather than a government. The author offers a compelling vision of how Russia is run, but the identities of these new rulers, and how they are making their money, are subjects he skirts around. Who is using Russia's thriving stock market to take control of the country? What is happening in the oil and gas fields of Siberia? And who is controlling Russia's buoyant metals trade? It may be that no western reporter can penetrate the labyrinth of Russian capitalism and live to tell the tale. But Handelman's book is like a vivid account of the wild capitalists of 19th century America that fails to mention the Rockefellers. This is a serious failing. The restriction of Handelman's account to shadowy, often unnamed figures on the margins of Russia's criminalised political economy does nothing to prove many of his most powerful assertions. After rousing descriptions of the code of honour between Russia's gangsters, and the corruption of its apparatchiks, Mr Handelman reveals his hand, without support, in the third and concluding section of the book. The comrade criminal has become 'the dominant political figure of Russia', he charges. The second Russian revolution has already been 'stolen', he argues, and the comrade criminals - 'the former nomenklatura and their allies' - already dominate President Boris Yeltsin's cabinet. Handelman takes a shot at Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the litigious mayor of Moscow, who has been accused of corruption in the sale of the city's real estate. Such charges against Mr Luzhkov have never been proved. But the author only allusively and tentatively connects his faceless comrade criminals with real men in Yeltsin's cabinet, with specific provincial government leaders still in office or with Russia's leading industrialists and financiers. There are a few other, minor quibbles. Handelman's assertion that 'Russia's post-communist uncertainty has been duplicated in other countries of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe' paints with too broad a brush. In Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and Estonia, many former communists have transformed themselves into capitalists but, unlike their Russian comrades described by Handelman, they are rapidly and willingly learning to play by the relatively genteel western rules of the game. Moreover, Handelman was rash to predict that 'there are already signs of an exodus of western investors'. On the contrary, this year more than Dollars 3bn of western investments have already gone into Russia. Growing investment does not disprove Handelman's argument about the basically deformed nature of Russia's new economy; in other emerging markets, and sometimes at home, western businessmen have shown no overpowering aversion to working with crooks. But western investors' rapid acquisition of the skills necessary to deal with comrade capitalists renders improbable Handelman's concluding hope that, alerted to the theft of the second Russian revolution, the west will somehow come to the rescue.</p>

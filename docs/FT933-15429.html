			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Reprieved Sharif faces new perils: Farhan Bokhari interviews the beleaguered Pakistani prime minister MR Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, is battling to survive in office six weeks after his remarkable political comeback. Sacked by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on April 18 and re-instated by the supreme court on May 26, Mr Sharif is trying to rebuild his relationship with the president, one of his political mentors. They became foes as Mr Sharif tried to reduce the president's powers. Mr Khan's attempt to dismiss him on grounds of corruption and mismanagement was ruled illegal by the court. 'I have never allowed considerations of personal ego or personal preferences to guide my relations with other office holders such as the president,' says Mr Sharif in an interview. 'It is now up to the other side to adjust accordingly to the situation that has emerged after the restoration of the national assembly and my government.' In recent weeks, the leaders have had two meetings, their first for two and a half months. Mr Sharif's hope that they will lead to an improved working relationship is already being put to the test. Last week the president demanded an explanation from Mr Sharif for his declaration of federal rule in Punjab province. The provincial governor, loyal to the president, had dissolved the Punjab assembly. A similar power struggle is taking place in North Western Frontier Province. Fears of intervention by the army were raised last week when General Abdul Waheed, chief of army staff, advised Mr Sharif either to end the deadlock or call fresh elections. However, most western diplomats and senior officials discount the possibility of direct army rule or martial law. Mr Sharif says: 'On account of past experiences, many people often express unholy fears and needless concerns regarding the role of the army, although the army has played a most commendable role of remaining neutral during the recent political crisis. 'I have no doubt that in the future, the army will continue to remain above the political fray and pursue a role of neutrality and not taking of sides in national politics.' Mr Sharif has been trying to woo the opposition parties, saying that a better understanding between them is necessary to avoid any possibility of another military coup. 'Our politics has suffered in the past due to confrontation,' says Mr Sharif. 'In the ultimate analysis, it is the anti-democratic forces who benefit. . . .' Mr Sharif has failed to find common ground with the opposition People's Democratic Alliance, led by Ms Benazir Bhutto. Ms Bhutto, in a meeting with Mr Khan yesterday, urged the president to dissolve the lower house of parliament, the national assembly, sack Mr Sharif's government and hold fresh elections. 'A call for fresh elections is premature since at this point in time, such a call will aggravate political instability and political uncertainty,' says Mr Sharif. Some ministers say privately that he will be open to calls for elections once the president has reached the end of his term in November. (Mr Khan has not yet made clear whether he intends to stand for re-election.) While political stability is top of Mr Sharif's agenda, he also recognises the need to make further progress with economic reforms. The budget deficit for 1992-93 was a record Rs95bn (Pounds 2.4bn), compared with a target set last year of Rs65bn. Part of the problem is the size of the defence budget and the cost of debt servicing, which together accounted for Rs189bn of the total budget of Rs305bn for 1992-93. Mr Sharif's future will depend on how he tackles the hard political choices and economic realities. His performance at home could determine the course of democracy in a country gradually overcoming its bitter legacy of military rule. He is hopeful: 'I will try and to put the country back on its democratic path. There are certain difficulties, there are certain problems in our way, but I hope these difficulties and problems will be overcome very soon.'</p>

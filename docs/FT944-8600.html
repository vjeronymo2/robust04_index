			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: The route of the suit - The man's suit today may seem impervious to fashion's whims, but it has taken two centuries of nipping and tucking to shape. James Ferguson traces its evolution When the Concise History of 20th Century Costume comes to be written, the chapter on men could be distilled into one word. Suit. What the doublet and hose were to the 16th century, the periwig to the 17th, cocked hat to the 18th and frock coat to the 19th, so the business suit will be to the 20th: a symbol for its age. The first office suit - the 'lounge' or 'suit of dittoes' of the 1880s - was originally tweedy country wear for the man of means. This was an adaptation of the workwear that the lowly bumpkin had been toiling in for a good hundred years. Slowly it started sneaking into town, mingling with the frock coat, and by 1900 every clerk was wearing one. It was as drab a costume as there had ever been. Fashioned from sagging, sweaty serge, the jacket was fastened so high that the shirt to be seen at all - required a throat-slicing, four-inch-high, starched linen cylinder of a collar, jamming the head into the era's equally uncompromising black bowler hat. Men's fashion is rarely a sprint - it's a long-distance event, and the lounge suit was no slouch. Having developed from the sporting and military garb of the early 19th century, it turned out to have hidden stamina. It just needed getting into shape. The legs in particular had to be worked on. Trousers, or pantaloons, had replaced kneebreeches in the years after Waterloo and had settled into the 19th century foot-strapped and braced, harnessing a man like a horse. But in about 1880, spats on shoes appeared and creases were introduced on to the sides of trousers. Then turn-ups came in, inspired by sport - ever the R&amp;D department of men's fashion - where men were rolling up their hems to avoid the mud on race tracks. And, finally, the invention of the trouser press in the 1890s allowed full-length front and back creases and turn-ups proper. So, by 1910, modern trousers were up and running. Next, the jacket, which had too much flab round its middle. In 1912 a post-Edwardian Scissorhands discovered that two vertical darts, one above each hip pocket, did what the horizontal waist seam had been doing for the frock coat and morning coat - that is, gave it shape. Now, bespoke tailors could render the jacket elegant enough for their top-drawer clients, whom everybody else would surely follow. The lounge suit was in business. It soon shouldered aside the morning coat, which had already jostled the frock coat on to the sidelines of posh weddings, horse races and pompous state occasions. (The frock coat has since been reduced to funeral wear, while the morning coat turns out gamely for Ascot and costumey weddings.) Even the star of evening events, the tail coat, found itself elbowed into head waiterdom by that lounge for lounge lizards: the dinner jacket. By the 1920s pleats had been developed in trousers, giving the front crease somewhere to go and enabling quantities of cloth to be folded under the waistband. Consequently, Oxord bags were invented in 1924. They helped blow away the fust of the 19th century, and their width influenced fashion for the next 30 years. The English drape, which had an acreage of material 'draping' from the new, broader-shouldered jacket, arrived early in the 1930s. Peaked lapels, narrow hips and wide, tapering trousers in confident chalkstripes or Glenurquhart check contrived against nature to bless the wearer with a V-shaped manliness to help defy the Depression. Edward VIII, then the Prince of Wales, wore it to perfection, and where the prince led, Hollywood dandies - Astaire, Gable, Cooper, Grant - followed. So powerful was the influence of the celluloid celebrities that the English drape had become the American drape by the end of the decade. Then came the second world war. The US emerged in winning form. Confident as hell, the all-American male swaggered out of it even more manly, rolling his super-wide, extra-padded gaberdine shoulders, rubbing his hands together and looking forward to an endless summer of profitable world domination. But a few icy gusts from the cold war in the 1950s put paid to that idea. He withdrew into a Brooks Brothers grey flannel suit - a buttoned-up, button-down, Ivy League corporate man. In the UK in the post-war ration years, only two sections of society could afford to dress up: toffs and spivs. The spivs went directly for the Technicolor American look, a strictly new money concoction of wide-boy shoulders, big lapels, lots of drape, hand-painted ties and Al Capone two-tone shoes. It was flash, brash and bought for cash at Cecil Gee's shop on the Charing Cross Road. At the opposite, less colourful end of the social spectrum, former Guards officers went to Savile Row for a long, narrow, nipped and tucked interpretation of Edwardiana, complete with bowlers, carnations and canes. Both styles faded away when rationing was stopped, but they revealed the beginnings of two enduring influences: a love affair with the US and the first stirrings of nostalgia. The most significant style of the 1950s, however, looked only forward. It emerged from Italy's post-war ricostruzione, which grabbed the attention of the young. This was the Italy of coffee bars, Lambrettas and sharp haircuts. Suits, as pioneered by the Roman tailor Gaetano Savini Brioni, were edited to the limit: shortish jackets, sloping natural shoulders, narrow trousers without pleats or turn-ups and horizontal pockets, like jeans. All very novel, but, more importantly, made in lightweight materials: silk shantung or mohair. From now on the heavyweights would struggle. The Italians had burst on to the men's fashion scene, and they have since been front-runners. In the late 1950s, the French designer Pierre Cardin set about replacing the squatness of the Italian suit with a longer, cylindrical, fitted look, and it was this that became the standard silhouette of the 1960s. Lapels all but disappeared from vented jackets; skimpy, low-hipped trousers hung shy of shoes. In the age of youth, grown men were letting their hair down and wearing boys' suits. Worse was to come: by the early 1970s, beneath artfully teased feather cuts, they were wearing girls' suits. The exaggeratedly waisted jacket with deep vents, no shoulders to speak of, aircraft carrier lapels and dangerously tight trousers flaring out over a pair of brown and cream platform boots, looked as laughable as it reads. Back in the office, there was a particular black and pale grey mohair Tonik cloth which looked snappy on a 17-year-old in 1967, but seemed like greasy, overcooked Bacofoil by 1978, on a 40-year-old. The Hirondelle-bottle silhouette of the 1970s was discarded amid the infighting between preppies, punks, rockabillies, Sloane rangers and a dozen other clans. But of all these factions it is perhaps the yuppies who most summed up the spirit of the 1980s - with an aggressive, inverted wedge-shape silhouette, small slicked head, big shoulders (new money again), big chests, no vents, loose pleated trousers, with turn-ups and let's-get-to-work braces. Something Italian, like Armani, something bossy, like BOSS. There was no messing with the American loafers or the Brooks Brothers shirt, but the Hermes tie with the witty motif showed, hey, a sense of irony. There is no doubt that the suit will see the century out, and probably the next one, too. Reviled, revered, revived, revamped, unstructured, deconstructed, oversized and understated, it is currently being slimmed down and softened up in the Edwardian manner: archaic but evocative in blackish Cheviot. Whatever fashion dictates, it will have said it all before. Nevertheless, if you want to look your best and remain totally invisible at the same time, wear a suit.</p>

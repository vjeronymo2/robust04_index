			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / BAT to increase payout by 25% under FID plan: Move to new scheme set to save Pounds 90m in advance corporation tax BAT Industries yesterday became the first company to say it would definitely use the foreign income dividend (FID) scheme introduced in last year's two budgets. The move will put pressure on other companies to make similar moves. One finance director said he was glad to see another company move first, so that market reaction could be judged. BAT shares fell 5p to 454p, in line with the fall in the stock market. BAT, which has worldwide interests ranging from tobacco to insurance, said it would lift its final dividend for 1993 by 25 per cent, from the 12.2p it announced earlier this month, to 15.25p, so that non-taxpaying shareholders would not be disadvantaged by the payment of a FID. It will delay paying the dividend from June until July as the scheme comes into effect on July 1. The payment of a FID will save BAT around Pounds 90m in advance corporation tax (ACT), which will be passed on to shareholders through the higher payout. The FID scheme was introduced to help companies with a structural surplus ACT problem. Companies such as BAT, which earns around 70 per cent of its profits outside the UK, suffer under the UK tax regime when their mainstream corporation tax liability is insufficient to offset their ACT liability on dividends. Under the scheme, first proposed in the March budget and detailed in the November budget, companies can opt to pay a dividend out of foreign income, which they must remit to the UK, and in effect avoid paying ACT on the dividend. The idea has met some opposition. Companies say the scheme is complex, and the requirement to remit foreign income could make them liable for withholding tax in other territories. Non-taxpaying shareholders, such as pension funds, have also expressed concern about FIDs as they can reclaim ACT paid on ordinary dividends. As ACT would not be payable on FIDs, non-taxpayers could not reclaim it, and their total income would be cut. BAT said the extra 25 per cent would compensate non-taxpayers, who hold about 40 per cent of its shares. Tax-paying investors would be better off under the FID scheme as they are deemed to have paid tax at 20 per cent on the dividend even though no ACT would have been paid. One institutional shareholder said that FIDs could change a company's shareholder base. BAT said its interim dividend for 1994 would not be a FID, but would be delayed by 2 1/2 months to January 1995, to maximise ACT savings in 1994. Thereafter it would review the pattern of dividend payments. Lex, Page 20</p>

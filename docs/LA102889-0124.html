			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE KEY TO TUSTIN'S 24-7 VICTORY  </P> <P> Four weeks ago, El Toro High School quarterback Steve Stenstrom, Orange  County's passing leader, had his way with Tustin's secondary in a 44-25  victory. Tustin Coach Marion Ancich knew then that his pass rush needed an  overhaul.  </P> <P> Tustin showed the task was complete Friday night in a 24-7 victory over  defending Southern Section Division VI champion Corona del Mar (5-3, 1-2) in  front of 450 at Northrup Field.  </P> <P> Ancich credited his defensive front line with putting the pressure on Corona  del Mar and taking it off the Tustin secondary.  </P> <P> The Tiller defense limited Corona del Mar to 135 yards, holding quarterback  Todd Kehrli to 64 yards passing on 9 of 19 completions. Thirty-four of those  yards came on one play, a completion to Weston Johnson, late in the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> Tustin (5-3, 2-1) had 320 yards, with quarterback Andy Borza accounting for 183  of those yards on 11 of 14 completions with two touchdowns.  </P> <P> The Tillers had a 17-point, second quarter with some big plays. After a 39-yard  field goal by David Basurto put Tustin ahead, 3-0, the Tillers' Josh Beldon  recovered Jerrott Willard's fumble at the Sea King 44. Two plays later, Borza  found wide receiver Frank Mercuri 10 yards beyond the Corona del Mar secondary  and hit him with a 43-yard touchdown pass.  </P> <P> On its next possession, Tustin went 73 yards in seven plays and again the big  play was a pass from Borza to Mercuri, this time for 30 yards and a touchdown.  Mercuri caught only three passes, but he made the most of them, totaling 99  yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> "We played probably our most complete football game this year," Ancich said. "I  don't know if it is good enough to compete against Estancia (7-0, 2-0) . . .  but (Corona del Mar) is a tough physical team.  </P> <P> "Kelvin Love began to run tonight, our wide receivers began to catch a few  passes, and Borza had a fine game." Love gained 77 yards in 11 carries while  sharing the rushing duties with three other backs.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar was without standout wide receiver/defensive back Warren  Johnson, who has five interceptions. He missed the game with a leg injury.  </P></p>

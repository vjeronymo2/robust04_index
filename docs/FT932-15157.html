			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Shark tank scrapped PLANS FOR a shark tank at London's Planet Hollywood restaurant have been scrapped after architects found the fish too unreliable, Rhodri Davies writes. The theme restaurant (shown left in design and under construction) is due to open in the West End on May 17. It will have exhibits from films Terminator 2 and Rocky and the handcuffs from 9 1/2 Weeks, but architects Blair Eastwick abandoned plans for a live shark exhibit. Partner Michael Eastwick said: 'Baby sharks cost a small fortune and you have no guarantee of an extended lifetime with those fish.' Diners will enter the James Bond room through a gun barrel.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Compensation payments offered LONDON Electricity will pay compensation to customers if staff are more than two hours late for home visits, the company announced yesterday. It already makes automatic compensation payments ranging from Pounds 10 to Pounds 50 for service failures under a customer charter launched last July. These include a payment of Pounds 10 for failing to turn up on the agreed day to read the meter or to do work requested by London Electricity. From February 24 the company will make appointments which specify visits in the morning or afternoon - with the same compensation if the appointment is not kept. From November appointments will be guaranteed within a two-hour time band.</p>

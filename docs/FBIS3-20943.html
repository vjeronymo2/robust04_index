In October, production was down 35  percent! In November, it will be down only 10 percent. In spite  of successful sales, Renault is hard hit by the automobile  market crisis. But that is nothing compared with the drop in  truck sales: minus 50 percent in France in four years! As a  result, RVI (Renault Industrial Vehicles) must eliminate 1,423  jobs out of a total of 15,500. All plants will be affected,  except Limoges.</p>

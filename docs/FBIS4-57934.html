			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 25 May, technical difficulties in  generator units at the Antonio Guiteras electric power plant in  Matanzas and the Antonio Maceo electric power plant in Santiago  de Cuba have resulted in a deficit of approximately 400  megawatts in the nation's generation of electricity. Electric  power sector officials in Matanzas announced that in the case of  the Antonio Guiteras plant, the problem was due to tears in the  boiler's heat-exchange surfaces. Damage assessment and repairs  will begin at noon today. Specialists have stated that if the  needed repairs are found to be minor, they could be done in two  or three days of intense work, bearing in mind that the  temperature of the boiler must drop before repair work can begin.    The breakdown of the 330-megawatt generating unit caused a  deficit of 70 megawatts during the morning and afternoon; and in  the evening, the peak demand period, the deficit was of 90  megawatts.    Specialists are making great efforts -- particularly since  the sugarcane harvest is in the final phase and in light of  other important economic activities -- to ready a schedule of  outages for when power is available. The outage schedule will  also guarantee an equitable supply of water to the residential  sector.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The state has already submitted a SIP for the South Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating attainment of the CO NAAQS by the year 2000. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration relies primarily on existing state programs for clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels and vehicles, supplemented by an enhanced motor vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. Since the state has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yet developed and submitted legislation and regulations to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement an enhanced I/M program, EPA is proposing to complete the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state's attainment demonstration with a single federal measure:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the contractor-run I/M program discussed in section III.D.2.c. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above, EPA believes that an I/M program is a necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the ozone FIPs as well. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See earlier discussion on I/M. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Specific Control Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Stationary/area source measures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With few exceptions, industrial and commercial sources in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP areas are already subject to air pollution controls that match  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or exceed the stringency of rules applied elsewhere in the country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Sacramento FIP area, however, EPA was able to identify four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major industrial facilities (Michigan-California Lumber Company;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Formica Corporation; SierraPine Limited; and Reynold's Metals) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the applicable local regulations do not reflect the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of control required nationally. The state and local air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> districts remain under an obligation to adopt and submit ``RACT''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations for these sources. Since these agencies (specifically,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Placer County and El Dorado County Air Pollution Control Districts)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have not yet acted, EPA is today proposing detailed provisions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will contribute to attainment in the Sacramento area by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplementing the applicable regulations to match available control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology. See section III.C.2, and proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(p)&hyph;(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA selected a second set of proposed FIP controls by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparing existing air pollution regulations in each FIP area with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the best existing state or local regulation, on a category-by-category basis. Where a more effective control measure that could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide significant reductions already existed (either as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted or draft rule), EPA has adapted and proposed the rule for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal administration in the applicable FIP areas. Since existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Coast controls are generally the most stringent in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country, many of these proposed rules were based on existing SCAQMD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and are proposed for the Sacramento and Ventura areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some cases, the proposed FIP rules newly regulate sources in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area (e.g., commercial bakeries and municipal landfills in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento FIP area). In other cases, the proposed rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly strengthen existing regulatory provisions (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tighter coatings and solvents limits in Sacramento and Ventura).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The costs, regulatory strategy, and technical basis of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures are discussed individually in section III.C.3. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations themselves appear in proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(a)&hyph;(o)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (t)&hyph;(v).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to enforce on a statewide basis a group of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four area source rules. EPA proposes that they be administered on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a statewide basis primarily because ensuring compliance only within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP areas would be relatively ineffective. EPA's rationale for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statewide control appears in section III.C.4.a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first of these controls simply proposes CARB's existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer product regulations, which regulate products such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detergents, floor finishes and deodorants, and are enforced against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. While the CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations have been adopted and enforced by the state for several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, California has not yet submitted them to EPA for inclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the SIP. The proposed FIP measure would make the measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federally enforceable, and is discussed in sections II.B.1. and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.C.4.c. The proposed regulation is 40 CFR 52.2957.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second proposed statewide control is based on a draft CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer product rule for the aerosol spray paint category, as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as rules developed by SCAQMD and the Bay Area Air Quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management District. Proposed rule 40 CFR 52.2958 would limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC content of spray paints that could be sold or used within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third proposed statewide control deals with one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> largest nonmobile sources of VOC: architectural and industrial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance (AIM) coatings, including most primers, paints,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lacquers, stains, and specialty coatings used for residential,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial, and industrial purposes. The proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progressively tightens restrictions on VOC content in three phases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of reduction through the year 2003 in order to allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of additional VOC reduction strategies. The FIP rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be amended if appropriate, in the event that EPA issues a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national AIM coatings rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese State Councillor  Song Jian has urged local governments in the Huaihe River Valley  to take effective measures to curb pollution which has severely  affected this river in east China.    The river water must become clean again by the end of this  century so that the river can again benefit local people living  along its banks, he said today at a meeting to check on the  environmental protection of the Huaihe River Valley.    Local enterprises that run at low economic efficiency and  cause serious pollution but lack efficient measures to curb  pollution must be closed or switch to other products with less  pollution, he said. Those enterprises that bring heavy pollution  but are able to harness pollution must do it within a limited  period.    In addition, urban sewage treatment facilities must be built  in a group of cities, the state councillor said. The Huaihe  River Water Resources Protection Organization, formed by  departments of the four provinces concerned and departments of  the State Council, should be further improved and a supervising  network on the pollution of the Huaihe River be established.    The third largest river in China, the Huaihe River runs  across four provinces -- Henan, Anhui, Shandong and Jiangsu --  its drainage area covering 269,000 sq km, with population  topping 150 million.    Since the beginning of the 1980s, the main tributaries of  the  river and the river proper became increasingly contaminated  owing to a fast-growing local economy and urbanization.    Song, also minister in charge of the State Science and  Technology Commission, inspected many parts along the river to  investigate the state of pollution. He also visited local  farmers' families that have suffered from the pollution.    He urged local officials to cooperate with each other in  taking comprehensive measures to ease the pollution so that a  better environmental condition can be created for the valley in  the 21st century.</p>

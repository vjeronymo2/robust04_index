			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT LINKED TO OTHER KIDNAPINGS  </P> <P> The suspected kidnaper of a homeless Orange County girl may have attempted to  abduct at least 10 other children in the Los Angeles area by luring them into  his pickup truck, police said Monday.  </P> <P> "Some things match and some things don't," said Manhattan Beach Police Sgt.  Jack Zea. "We are going to look . . . at his background to see where he has  been the last couple of weeks."  </P> <P> Eduardo Uzcanga, 48, who is on parole after a conviction in Santa Ana for  attempted murder, was arrested Sunday afternoon, a day after a 6-year-old Santa  Ana girl was kidnaped.  </P> <P> The girl was found wandering a few hours after she disappeared. Tests were  being made to determine whether she had been sexually assaulted.  </P> <P> The kidnaping of the 6-year-old was the 11th reported abduction involving a man  in a dark blue pickup. Police impounded Uzcanga's blue pickup, but noted that  it was larger than the truck described in some of the abductions. They said  Uzcanga was also older than the man described by witnesses in most of the  incidents.  </P></p>

Granic felt the Serbian side should accept two  preconditions:  Withdrawal from the occupied territories and permitting trials  of suspected war criminals. The Serbs should be obliged by the  international community to start negotiations, the  vice-president said. Slobodan Milosevic's rule over Serbia is  not strong enough to resist the world's will for ever, he  believed.    Granic ruled out a politically restored federal Yugoslavia  yet felt successor states might grow closer again economically  in a few years' time.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / US considers big cuts in land and sea missiles THE US is considering deep new cuts in multiple-warhead missiles based on land and at sea, in an effort to prompt similar reductions by the four nuclear-armed former Soviet republics, led by Russia. President George Bush may announce his plan to cut the core of the US nuclear force in his State of the Union address to Congress next week, the launch-pad for his re-election campaign this year, US officials yesterday. The latest US proposals reflect rising concern over the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the risks of nuclear proliferation, and the desire to encourage the republics to preserve central command and control of their arsenal of 27,000 nuclear warheads. The New York Times reported yesterday that the White House and the Defence Department are drawing up plans to cut or eliminate multi-warhead long-range missiles, including the land-based MX and the older Minuteman. Some of the cuts would be unilateral; others would depend on the response of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, the nuclear-armed republics. It was unclear yesterday whether Mr Bush intends to make concessions on sea-based multi-warhead strategic missiles, an area where the US has jealously guarded its technological superiority. One complicating factor is that a US offer could put pressure on the British and French governments to place their own nuclear systems on the bargaining table. If Mr Bush agrees to cut the Trident I and newer Trident II missiles, 'it would be a dramatic move,' said one US official yesterday. Last September, Mr Bush announced a combination of unilateral reductions and proposals for negotiated reductions in the air, sea and land-based US nuclear arsenal. Hailed at the time as dramatic, the US offer risks being overtaken by the collapse of Soviet military power and the virtual disappearance of the Soviet threat. In testimony to Congress this week, two top intelligence officials, including Mr Robert Gates, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, said Russia was drastically cutting defence spending and posed virtually no threat to the US. Russian military procurement in the first quarter was expected to drop by 80 per cent, the officials said. The nuclear cuts under consideration were first mooted by Mr James Baker, US Secretary of State, during a visit to the former Soviet Union at the end of last year. He is due to visit Moscow early next week, when Mr Bush is to give his State of the Union address.</p>

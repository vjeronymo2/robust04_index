			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, chairman of the </F> Polish National Bank, by Jan Kreft; place and date not given]    [Text] [Kreft] Six months ago you were reporting to Hanna  Suchocka's government on the difficult situation of the Polish  banking system. How do you assess the present condition of our  banks?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The situation is largely unchanged.  Several new banks were set up, and they are now in bad shape,  too. In addition, those that were in trouble six months ago have  failed to ameliorate their condition.    [Kreft] So far, the Polish National Bank [NBP] is almost the  only one prepared to come to the assistance of other banks when  they find themselves in difficulties. The parliamentary debate  on this year's budget contained charges that the NBP was too  involved in "pumping" money into private banks. What is the  government's position on this problem?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Naturally, both the government and  parliament demur at taking on tasks of such nature. After all,  such tasks are not part of any supervisory bodies' brief. The  NBP should merely recommend the appropriate steps to be taken;  it cannot take upon itself the entire burden of the remedial  operations. The involvement of the NBP and the Bank of Economic  Initiatives in the rescue operation in aid of the Development  Bank of Lodz and the takeover of the Prosper Bank and the First  Commercial Bank of Lublin (set up by Bogatin) was necessary  because the threatened collapse and liquidation of those banks  would have put an intolerable burden on NBP finances. Although  we still have not set up a deposit insurance society, we would  be inclined to protect our clients' interests up to a certain  limit, remembering that, when one bank collapses, as happened in  the Coastal Region, a decidedly dubious climate soon develops  around all of the other ones.    I will not deny that I found it rather difficult to persuade  the previous government to embark on the process of restoring  our banks to health. I trust that I will have an easier job of  it with the current government.    [Kreft] Did the divergence of views between you and the  previous government concern some specific cases, or did it rest  on a range of general phenomena common to the whole banking  system in Poland?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] It concerned institutional solutions,  notably five fundamental instruments of the system of restoring  banks to sound health applied universally throughout the world,  whose application in the Polish banking system was recommended  by the NBP.    [Kreft] Immediately after the parliamentary election,  without knowing the new government's makeup, you advised the  left to spread the realization of its election promises over  several years, did you not?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] More and more people from the very core  of the left-wing orientation are now talking about the need to  spread these promises over a longer period of time.    [Kreft] You also stipulated at the same time that the post  of finance minister should be given to a person ready for  compromise and...for a fight against inflation. Did Minister  Borowski [who resigned after the interview] fulfill these  expectations?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Minister Borowski is a rather determined  person, but he has not pressed for an unjustified monetary  supply. Such pressure was exerted by members of relevant Sejm  commissions.    [Kreft] During the Sejm debate on this year's budget, the  NBP became a target for intense attacks. The Union of Labor  charged it with not allowing a sufficient flow of funds to the  economy, did it not?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I am quite immune to such pressures.  The present Sejm is, as a whole, oriented toward a loosening of  monetary policy. When we compare the attitudes of the budget  commissions in the previous and the current Sejms, we must  conclude that, in the former case, the coalition members  demonstrated greater coalition discipline. However, I still  remember the statement made by Jerzy Osiatynski shortly after he  was made finance minister. He said that the "hole" in the  budget would come up to 100 trillion zlotys [Z]. That  frightened me quite considerably. Of course, we soon came to an  agreement over that question.    The present parliament is characterized by a greater  differentiation of positions even within individual parties.    Pressure to print more money has always taken place and will  continue to take place everywhere under the sun. In 1992, I was  there when the German deputy finance minister launched an attack  on the Bundesbank's financial policy, and that, after all, is  something that does not happen all that often.    [Kreft] How do you assess this year's planned budget  deficit?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] It is contained within fairly decent  limits, although even this could be the subject of a lengthy  debate. The beginning of the year has been promising. I do not  remember another year with such a substantial prevalence of  revenues over expenditure.    [Kreft] The NBP will finance the budget to the tune of  Z30-35 trillion. But the parliamentary act on the NBP lowers  the ceiling of the central bank's involvement in the budget to a  much lower level.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The relevant article of that act was  routinely suspended for a great many years in the past. During  the life of the Olszewski and Suchocka governments, the level  defined by the act was very seriously exceeded. Such extensive  involvement on the part of the NBP has its roots in the  insufficiently developed money market.    [Kreft] Do you share the opinion that, in the present  economic situation, devaluation of the zloty would create more  problems than it would solve?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I believe that devaluation always causes  more damage. Decisions to introduce abrupt devaluation are  usually made when something is very amiss with the state  monetary reserves. On the other hand, a lack of equilibrium in  the trade balance is a natural phenomenon in a country  experiencing an economic recovery process. As a result of the  latest, 8-percent currency devaluation, we gained an increase of  only 1 percent in our export figures. I believe that  encouraging results can be achieved only through applying such  government measures as, for example, an imports tax. No one has  ever managed to improve a national economy permanently by a  drastic devaluation of the currency rate.    [Kreft] But your views on this matter are not shared by a  sizeable group of politicians, are they?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Nevertheless, my views are presented  more and more often in the public forum. And they are certainly  more popular today than when I assumed office as NBP chairman.    [Kreft] To go back to your "wish list": Two years ago you  wished to see an increase in the level of economic education  available to the public that would bring it to the level of  economic knowledge displayed by the German public. Over there,  the main thing the population expects is the lowest possible  level of inflation.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] My adviser at the Bundesbank insists  that the Germans have always remembered the massive inflation in  the 1920's, as well as the inflation of the postwar years. I  believe that we should just remember our own inflation in the  1980's.    [Kreft] But we are, on the contrary, all too ready to forget  it....    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] During the election campaign, inflation  was not too painful. Recent violent reactions to the November  inflation should make advocates of a greater "loosening" of our  monetary policy aware that inflation threatens their voters'  interests.    [Kreft] You have an excellent opportunity to make  comparisons: Is the present Sejm's level of economic education  higher than that exhibited by the last one?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Naturally, I will refuse to answer  this question. I can only refer you to statements made by  representatives of the present Budget Commission, who maintain  that theirs is the best budget commission ever....    [Kreft] Recent opinions quoted in NBP circles indicate that  it is perfectly feasible to accelerate the rate of inflation.    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] You are talking about the so-called  press-generated facts, which create their own reality and  reinforce public expectations of continually increasing  inflation as if a proportion of the press believes in the  principle that the worse things look for the present government,  the better for them. I believe that, regardless of our  individual sense of financial ease and comfort, we should all be  interested in stabilizing inflation at a reasonably low level.    [Kreft] But press commentators suggest that this is  positively the last moment to increase the rate of inflation....    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We must stay cool and watch the  developments calmly. I can only say that we hold constant  discussions on precisely that subject.    [Kreft] It is hardly reasonable to expect that inflation  will be stemmed without the need for sacrifices and without  lowering the level of social benefits expenditure. Don't  believe that we have again arrived at a moment when it will be  necessary to tighten our belts?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The problem lies not so much in being  forced to lower the social benefits expenditure but in changing  the entire concept of budgetary expenditure as such. I am, of  course, speaking here of the huge sums allocated to social  benefits funds in the past budgets. Over the past few years, we  have not been able to bring about a reform of the social  insurance system, and this has made a vital difference to the  independence of decisions in the sphere of public finance. We  cannot begin to hope for a decrease in inflation to a level  below 20 percent without some radical cuts. In this sense,  Poland is very much like Hungary, where they now have inflation  on the order of 23 percent, and where they cannot even begin to  reduce it because they also have been unsuccessful in dealing  with the basic underlying difficulties.    [Kreft] Do you agree with the claim that our greatest  financial threat comes from the need to service the internal  debt? The only noninflationary way to reduce the deficit would  be teh purchase of our treasury bonds by foreign banks. But the  latter are not at all keen to buy them....    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Because, among other things, they are  afraid of devaluation. It is true that the servicing of our  internal debt does present great difficulties at the moment. We  are facing a whole range of so-called inflexible expenses, which  seriously hamper our ability to maneuver within the budget  framework. On the other hand, I am pleased that that problem  has now, at long last, been noticed and acknowledged.    [Kreft] How do you assess the development of the Stock  Exchange?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] So far, our Stock Exchange has enjoyed  the opinion of being the best in the countries of the former  socialist bloc, as well as enjoying a high--maybe even too  high--degree of public confidence. The Stock Exchange is an  institution of the market economy system, and the latter is only  now beginning to expand in our country--hence, a number of  anomalies that are perfectly natural at this stage. However, it  would be dangerous to overestimate it and place excessive  emphasis on stock exchange operations at this stage. That is  why it is vitally necessary that the Stock Exchange be expanded  and that many more companies enter it soon. This will make it  much more stable. I believe that this is exactly what will  happen. Minister Kaczmarek is determined to privatize further  enterprises as soon as possible.    [Kreft] You are very protective of the watertight quality of  our banking system. How, then, do you assess the unrestricted  freedom of draining stock exchange profits away from our country  by foreign investors?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Without them, the stock exchange would  not be able to develop at all.    [Kreft] The stock exchange and the banks are seen as good  places for laundering dirty money. How much truth is there in  that belief?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I believe that we have very good and  very precise legislative regulations protecting our banking  system against that danger. We are able to check up on our bank  investors, and we have a good system of verifying their agents'  credentials. There have been instances in which, at our  insistence that they disclose the identity of the true  investors, such agents withdrew their offers to invest their  capital in our banks. Among other things, this is also one of  the reasons behind our decision to engage the NBP in the  operation of restoring Prosper Bank and the First Commercial  Bank of Lublin to financial health: The provenance of the money  that was originally supposed to shore up these two banks proved  on closer inspection not to be satisfactorily explained.    There is no doubt that the practice of laundering dirty  money should be prosecuted by the law. It will not be much good  if the only course of action open to us is mere monitoring of  financial transactions. There must be statutory legal sanctions,  too.    [Kreft] Where does the NBP chairman invest her savings?    [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] In the bank. I also bought some state  treasury bonds in order to be able to claim personal tax  allowance on them.    [Kreft] Thank you for talking to us.</p>

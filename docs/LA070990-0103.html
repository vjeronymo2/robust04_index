			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RESTRUCTURED POLITBURO SEEN AS GORBACHEV VICTORY  </P> <P> The Soviet Communist Party voted today to change its leadership structure in a  clear victory for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the crucial party congress.  </P> <P> Delegates voted by a large margin to bring the party chiefs from the 15  republics into an expanded Politburo -- a move that will almost certainly stop  conservative hard-liners from forming a bloc against Gorbachev on the body.  </P> <P> Diplomats said the new setup favored the reformist Gorbachev, who would have  much less difficulty controlling the republican party chiefs than contending  with Moscow-based politicians.  </P> <P> The Politburo now numbers 12 full members, most of them with Moscow power  bases. Gorbachev himself suggested that the total membership could be 23 or 24  after inclusion of specialist secretaries nominated by the Central Committee.  </P> <P> Delegates voted by a big margin to retain the post of party general secretary  rather than create the new title of party chairman at the head of a presidium.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, 59, who is general secretary as well as state president, has been  assured by both left and right in the party that he will be reelected party  leader later this week.  </P> <P> The changes also provided for the new post of a deputy to the general secretary  who would be a full Politburo member and, like the party chief, be elected  directly by the congress.  </P> <P> The 28th Communist Party Congress, which opened July 2, has been the scene of  bitter feuding between Gorbachev and his reform-minded allies on the one hand  and conservative hard-liners opposed to his radical reforms on the other.  </P> <P> The atmosphere sharpened further today when a close ally of Gorbachev,  Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev, said he was the target of a slander  campaign.  </P> <P> The congress approved an investigation by the party after Yakovlev said  documents falsifying recent comments he had made to political meetings were  being circulated on the fringes of the congress.  </P> <P> "I want to tell those who are behind this campaign that they may shorten my  life, but they will never manage to silence me," the 66-year-old Yakovlev said.  </P> <P> Yakovlev, architect of Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, said the  documents contained "distortions" of comments he had recently made to young  Communists and members of the Democratic Platform and Marxist Platform  factions.  </P> <P> The falsified documents said he had encouraged them to quit the party.  </P> <P> But a 15-page document circulated later setting out what he said was the  correct version of his remarks made clear he had urged them to stay in the  party and cooperate in a renewal of its ranks.  </P></p>

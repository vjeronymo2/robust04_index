			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] After four days of negotiations between the  Azaouads and the Malian Government in Tamanrasset, which were  initially marked by optimism by the parties to the dispute, on  the implementation of the Bamako agreement and the reintegration  of the Azaouads in various aspects of life in their country of  origin, the dialogue between the two sides has been postponed  until a later date. We review the reasons for this postponement  with our correspondent from Hoggar.    [Correspondent] We reviewed the contents of the latest talks  held last night with (Abderrahmane Guella), general coordinator  of the Azaouad movement.    [Begin (Guella) recording] Thanks to the efforts of the  mediator, we reached an agreement on holding another meeting in  Algeria in the next few days. By then the [Malian] government  side will have discussed the fronts' points of view and made a  final decision regarding them, because the government delegation  has asked for consultations with its government, and God  willing, the minutes of the meeting could be signed. [end  recording]    [Correspondent] Talks were marked by intransigence in some  positions, despite the Algerian mediator's efforts. The last  phase lasted until late last night and was marked by differences  in principle regarding the implementation of the agreement on  integration as a main point in the final solution to the crisis.    The Malian Government delegation raised several problems  which its government was facing and which would not allow the  total acceptance of the demands of the Azaouads regarding the  number of those to be integrated in various economic, political,  and military sectors. The delegation justified this by the  reforms currently under way in Mali within the framework of its  program with the International Monetary Fund. [passage omitted]</p>

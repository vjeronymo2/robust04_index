			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMI MUSIC'S NET PROFIT MORE THAN DOUBLES IN YEAR  </P> <P> Aided by booming sales at its record labels, EMI Music's profit more than  doubled from $73.5 million to a record $150.2 million for the year ended March  31.  </P> <P> The London-based music concern, a unit of the British electronics and music  conglomerate Thorn EMI PLC, said sales rose from $1.3 billion to a record $1.7  billion.  </P> <P> The better-than-expected results came amid an overall slowing in music industry  sales in the United States last year.  </P> <P> But EMI, which formed a joint venture with SBK last year and paid $79.1 million  for a 50% interest in Chrysalis, has enjoyed surprising success domestically  with Sinead O'Connor, whose Chrysalis album went to No. 1 in 16 countries, and  with M. C. Hammer, a rap artist with EMI's Los Angeles-based Capitol Records  label. Hammer's "Please Don't Hurt 'Em" album ranks No. 2 on the Billboard list  of top 100 albums.  </P> <P> Besides O'Connor and Hammer, EMI's roster of artists includes Bonnie Raitt,  Freddie Jackson, Richard Marx, Paul McCartney and Tina Turner. The company now  claims a 12% share of the worldwide music market. JUBE SHIVER  </P></p>

The Ambassador replied: "According to the decision of the  U.S. State Department the reconstruction of all U.S. embassies  in the territory of the former USSR is done by the engineering  department of the U.S. Army. The main office of this agency in  the region is in Ankara. This office is collaborating with a  number of private Turkish companies and when the reconstruction  of the American Embassy in Yerevan started, the American side  invited the experienced Turkish building specialists. Currently  about 20 Turkish builders are working at the embassy. I  personally made quite a lot of efforts for the Turkish  specialists to come to Armenia since I thought this would be a  sort of Armenian-Turkish collaboration on the individual level".  The ambassador also reported that he is trying to use the  Armenian builders as much as possible in the reconstruction, and  to use Armenian materials when possible. "I would like to  especially stress that Armenian builders are very experienced  and I saw myself the Turkish-Armenian collaboration", Harry  Gilmore added.</p>

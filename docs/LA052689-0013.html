			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Traffic statistics released by the San Diego Police Department for the first  four months of 1989 show a 24.4% decrease in fatalities.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Bill Robinson said Thursday that, of the 31 fatalities  reported through April, 14 involved only vehicles, 12 involved pedestrians, 4  involved motorcycles and 1 involved a bicycle.  </P> <P> Forty-one fatalities were reported during the same period in 1988. There were  12 fatalities from vehicle accidents, 15 involving pedestrians, 11 involving  motorcycles and 3 involving bicycles.  </P> <P> "It's probably a combination of things that results in the decrease, like  awareness of the other person's right of way, awareness of the penalties for  drunk driving, signals being posted and not speeding," Robinson said.  </P> <P> From 40% to 50% of the vehicle accidents were related to drunk driving, he  said.  </P> <P> Because of the number of pedestrian fatalities, police have implemented a  pedestrian education program, Robinson said.  </P></p>

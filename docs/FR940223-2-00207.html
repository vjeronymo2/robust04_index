			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The implementing regulations for Title VI provide that a recipient of Federal financial assistance that has previously discriminated in violation of the statute or regulations must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of the past discrimination. 34 CFR 100.3(b)(6)(i). Thus, a college that has been found to have discriminated against students on the basis of race or national origin must take steps to remedy that discrimination. That remedial action may include the awarding of financial aid to students from the racial or national origin groups that have been discriminated against. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed policy guidance provided that a finding of past discrimination could be made by a court or by an administrative agency, such as the Department's Office for Civil Rights. It also could be made by a State or local legislative body, as long as the legislature requiring the affirmative action had a strong basis in evidence identifying discrimination within its jurisdiction for which that remedial action is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters argued that colleges should be able to take remedial action without waiting for a formal finding by a court, administrative agency, or legislature. The Department agrees. The final policy guidance provides that, even in the absence of a finding by a court, legislature, or administrative agency, a college_in order to remedy its past discrimination_may implement a remedial race-targeted financial aid program. It may do so if it has a strong basis in evidence for concluding that this affirmative action is necessary to remedy the effects of its past discrimination and its financial aid program is narrowly tailored to remedy that discrimination. Permitting colleges to remedy the effects of their past discrimination without waiting for a formal finding is consistent with the approach taken by the Supreme Court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wygant <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Jackson Board of Education, supra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wygant, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Court clarified that a school district's race-conscious voluntary affirmative action plan could be upheld based on subsequent judicial findings of past discrimination by the district.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wygant <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Jackson Board of Education, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  476 U.S. at 277. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wygant <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  case, teachers challenged their school board's adoption, through a collective bargaining agreement, of a layoff plan that included provisions protecting employees from layoffs on the basis of their race. The school board contended, among other things, that the plan's race-conscious layoff provisions were constitutional because they were adopted to remedy the school board's own prior discrimination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 276, 277. Justice Powell, in a plurality opinion, stated that a public employer must have ``convincing evidence'' that an affirmative action plan is warranted by past discrimination before undertaking that plan.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 277. If the plan is challenged by employees who are harmed by the plan, the court must then make a determination that the employer had a ``strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a concurring opinion, Justice O'Connor agreed that a ``contemporaneous or antecedent finding of past discrimination by a court was not a constitutional prerequisite to a public employer's voluntary agreement to an affirmative action plan.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 289. She explained that contemporaneous or antecedent findings were not necessary because ``A violation of Federal statutory or constitutional requirements does not arise with the making of findings; it arises when the wrong is committed.'' Moreover, she explained that important values would be sacrificed if contemporaneous findings were required because ``a requirement that public employers make findings that they engaged in illegal discrimination before they engage in affirmative action programs would severely undermine public employers' incentive to meet voluntarily their civil rights obligations.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 289, 290 (citations omitted). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Richmond <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.A. Croson, supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Court again emphasized that remedial race-conscious action must be based on strong evidence of discrimination. That case involved the constitutionality of a city ordinance establishing a plan to remedy past discrimination by requiring prime contractors awarded city construction contracts to subcontract at least 30% of the dollar amount of each contract to minority-controlled businesses. The Court found that the city council had failed to make sufficient factual findings to demonstrate a ``strong basis in evidence'' of racial discrimination ``by anyone in the Richmond construction industry.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Richmond <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.A. Croson, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  488 U.S. at 500. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evidence of past discrimination may, but need not, include documentation of specific incidents of intentional discrimination. Instead, evidence of a statistically significant disparity between the percentage of minority students in a college's student body and the percentage of qualified minorities in the relevant pool of college-bound high school graduates may be sufficient. Such an approach is analogous to cases of employment discrimination where the courts accept statistical evidence to infer intentional discrimination against minority job applicants. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hazelwood School District <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  433 U.S. 299 (1977). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this case law, Principle 3 provides that a college may award race-targeted scholarships to remedy discrimination as found by a court or by an administrative agency, such as the Department's Office for Civil Rights. OCR often has approved race-targeted financial aid programs as part of a Title VI remedial plan to eliminate the vestiges of prior discrimination within a State higher education system that previously was operated as a racially segregated dual system. As indicated by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Croson <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision, a finding of past discrimination also may be made by a State or local legislative body, as long as the legislature has a strong basis in evidence identifying discrimination within its jurisdiction. The remedial use of race-targeted financial aid must be narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of the discrimination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

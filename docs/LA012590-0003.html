			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURANCE BILL  </P> <P> Assemblyman Patrick Johnston's (D-Stockton) low-cost, no-frills, auto insurance  bill for inner-city residents was killed (Part A, Jan. 18).  </P> <P> Pity the person who is a victim of high grocery prices, an emergency trauma  network with gaping holes and crime. Add to that some trial lawyers and  politicians who are ostensibly their champions, but instead turn their backs on  these poor folks at the call of self-interest.  </P> <P> We can only hope for a miracle. Maybe the impoverished will become informed,  will communicate and their anger will not lapse into apathy, but will be  channeled in such a way to challenge those responsible for this unfortunate  development.  </P> <P> D. MICHAEL BUSH  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

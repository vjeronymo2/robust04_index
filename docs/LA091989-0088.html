			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISAPPEARING ACTS;  </P> <P> AUTHOR JONATHAN COLEMAN DRAWS A BEAD ON WHY PEOPLE CHOKED BY THEIR LIVES SIMPLY  DECIDE TO DROP OUT OF SIGHT  </P> <P> In fiction and our fantasies, we run away to sea, the circus and the Foreign  Legion. Or build a raft to ride the Mississippi and just go somewhere.  </P> <P> In reality, stifled and stressed modern man opts for anonymity in more prosaic  surrounds -- a community college in El Paso, a computer company in Houston --  usually settling for much less than they left.  </P> <P> Clearly, says Jonathan Coleman, author of "Exit the Rainmaker," a new book on  one man's disappearance from his thoroughly successful and completely  conventional life, the grass is no greener on the other side of our dreams.  </P> <P> Yet, he added, as society, careers and relationships continue to squeeze, we  continue to fancy some clean and healing escape from what Henry David Thoreau  described as the mass of men who "lead lives of quiet desperation."  </P> <P> Coleman sees the stay-leave dilemma in himself and in all of us: "At the very  least, we want everything to go on hold for a while because there is this  feeling that we're heading down a path in a way that we never, ever intended  when we were 18 and dreaming of what life would be like."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Male Factor  </P> <P> He doesn't think it is a phenomenon restricted to men: "It's a myth that it is  only a male factor. Women take off but they often come back because of  children. There is a sense that women are more anchored than men in our  society."  </P> <P> He suspects adults skipping to new starts forms the majority of current  National Crime Information Center statistics that list 60,000 regular Americans  as absent without logical explanation. And those are only the reported missing.  </P> <P> Coleman certainly subscribes to estimates of Charles Sutherland, head of Search  Inc., a private missing persons bureau in New Jersey, who believes the total of  adult Americans chucking it all for a period, or permanently, to be closer to  100,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Case Histories  </P> <P> It is nothing new. In 1930, New York Superior Court Judge Joseph Crater left  his chambers and told an assistant: "Don't forget to turn out the lights,  Johnson." He hasn't been seen since, said Coleman, and could well have  disappeared for a better, anonymous life.  </P> <P> Agatha Christie took off for a while and the late mystery writer's quick exit  remains something of a mystery. Gauguin left his wife and family for Tahiti. In  1926, at the height of her Bible-thumping visibility, salvationist Aimee Semple  McPherson was believed drowned while swimming near Venice Beach and showed up  five weeks later in a town on the Arizona-Mexico border.  </P> <P> The extensions are endless.  </P> <P> Eight years ago, Ed Greer, 33, a successful and rising engineer with Hughes  Aircraft Co. of El Segundo, left work and never came back. He was discovered  this year in Houston working under an assumed name for a computer software  company.  </P> <P> His wife has remarried and has denied his request to visit with their two sons,  now 9 and 16.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Might Be Back for Lunch  </P> <P> And seven years ago, Julian Nance (Jay) Carsey, the 47-year-old president of  Charles County Community College, Md., married the owner of a 23-room Georgian  house close to hunt country, left home and told his wife he might be back for  lunch.  </P> <P> He didn't show.  </P> <P> But he did cancel a dental appointment, withdrew $28,000 from a joint bank  account, drove here and mailed five farewell letters and one postcard to family  and friends.  </P> <P> Jay Carsey, still using his own name, eventually surfaced in West Texas where  he has remarried and is a program director at El Paso Community College.  </P> <P> Carsey did not flee to avoid criminal prosecution. There were no financial  difficulties at home or at the college. He had community authority, status,  respect, a secure job, a fine home and a stunning wife. There was no other  woman involved.  </P> <P> But in subsequent interviews, Carsey said: "I felt as if I was dying inside. I  didn't know whether (wife) Nancy was driving me harder or I was driving myself  against some concept of what I should be, or both.  </P> <P> "I decided I wanted to do something else with my life and I didn't want to go  through the wrenching session I would have if I had left in a conventional way.  </P> <P> "I was not going to talk to anybody about what I was planning because it was a  very clean-cut decision in my mind, a perfect decision, actually. I did what I  wanted to do the only way I, Julian Nance Carsey, could see of getting it  done."  </P> <P> So Julian Nance Carsey was outta here.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Turning Into a Sleuth  </P> <P> Intrigued by newspaper reports of Carsey's disappearance, Jonathan Coleman -- a  book editor turned broadcast journalist turned author and English teacher at  the University of Virginia -- began investigating.  </P> <P> Coleman's primary curiosity has always been for human behavior, particularly  the clouded, complex motivations behind all that we do.  </P> <P> That obsession was displayed in Coleman's 1985 book, "At Mother's Request,"  about a Utah woman who persuaded her teen-age son to murder her father. It  shows in his admiration for the depth of human study displayed by Truman  Capote's "In Cold Blood" and Robert Lindsey's "The Falcon and the Snowman." In  Carsey, he believed, the analysis would be more mainstream.  </P> <P> "After hours of talking with him, I realized there are a lot of people like  Carsey," he said. "Because his is a story about expectations and dreams and  what happens when you achieve them and they turn out not to be what you thought  they would be."  </P> <P> So he has written a vehicle by which to measure ourselves?  </P> <P> "Absolutely. I think the book is a very threatening book. I think what people  least like doing is being introspective because that is very painful."  </P> <P> Through months of interviews that took him from Greece to West Texas, from  endless talks with Carsey, his former wife and some 150 friends and business  and college associates, Coleman, 37, traced one man's anguish to its beginning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Child of the Depression  </P> <P> Carsey was a child of the Depression who grew up in Bryan, Tex. Homer Carsey,  his father, was trumpet player in a circus, a Linotype operator and tamed  vagabond. Bea Carsey, his mother, was of higher graces, played bridge, sought  status and placed her son on an enormous pedestal.  </P> <P> Floating on those expectations, Carsey attended Texas A&amp;M, earned degrees  in chemical engineering and business administration, and went to Washington. He  drove a red Corvette, dated a campaign worker for John F. Kennedy, was a  Polaris missile manager at the Naval Ordnance Station -- and tagged along  behind carefully selected dates to Washington's social functions.  </P> <P> Jay Carsey was on his way.  </P> <P> At 30, he had earned a doctorate in public administration from George  Washington University and was president of Charles County Community College. He  had married Nancy and her social status. Their mansion, "Green's Inheritance,"  was stuffed with enough souvenirs from world vacations that it was known  locally as Smithsonian South.  </P> <P> Jay Carsey, clearly, had it made.  </P> <P> Then he dropped it and became a drop-out husband.  </P> <P> The post card he mailed to close colleague John Sine, the college dean who  would succeed him as president, contained a single message: "Exit the  Rainmaker. Good luck. Jay."  </P> <P> It was a reference to N. Richard Nash's "The Rainmaker," the venerable play  that tells of an itinerant who charms a dusty community into believing he can  create rain.  </P> <P> He eventually deserts the community and the woman who loved him. Sine once  directed Carsey in a local production of the "The Rainmaker." And so Carsey  wrote his farewell that became the title of his biography.  </P> <P> Early reviews of "Exit the Rainmaker" have ranged from adulation to  first-degree murder. USA Today called the book "riveting." New York magazine  brutalized it for "ridiculous, trite analogies." The Washington Post talked of  Coleman's work as "a glamorous mystery (that) ends with two irredeemably  shallow sociopaths (the Carseys) squabbling over the division of goods."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Missing Person Resurfaces  </P> <P> After he resurfaced some months after leaving Maryland, Carsey and his wife  began a year of long, complex legal wrangling that eventually resulted in  divorce and disposition of their joint property.  </P> <P> Thus, added the review, "What the book in fact has to tell is the story of a  long and rancorous divorce case, spiced briefly by the disappearance of one of  the principals. Mystery dispelled. What 'Exit the Rainmaker' finally  illuminates is how utterly banal the act of desertion is."  </P> <P> To Coleman -- interviewed here at the start of a national book promotion tour  that Thursday sees him in Los Angeles -- dismissal of his book as overpadding a  simple domestic dispute is the reflection of a reviewer skipping the multiple  directions and nuances of his analysis.  </P> <P> "I don't think I have made a mountain out of a molehill," he said. "This (book)  isn't about a guy who walked out on his wife. This is a book about a guy who  walked out on his whole life."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Examines Base Meaning  </P> <P> His attempt, said Coleman, was to get beneath the myth of success and examine  its base meaning. His fascination was Carsey's transition from early years of  searching for material and social gain, the standard currency of America, to  his final years in Maryland when "all he wanted to do was go home and be by  himself and watch 'Monday Night Football.' "  </P> <P> Coleman says he can see many areas of common ground between Carsey and Ed  Greer, California's most recent disappearing act.  </P> <P> "I think there was a similarity that both realized that it was not wise to be  good at something you didn't like," Coleman continued. "Because then you might  find yourself doing it for the rest of your life.  </P> <P> "The other (similarity) is that, having spoken to Kit Clark (Greer's former  wife, now living in Northern California) I know that Greer was a  non-confrontational person and, just like Carsey, did not reveal much of  himself."  </P> <P> The author believes he knows Carsey better than Coleman knows himself. He sees  a man once cowed by his mother's shrill anger, who married a woman whose temper  was equally intimidating. Coleman believes Carsey was pushed into seeking  personal achievement by his mother's elevated expectations. When, all the  while, his true character leaned more toward that of his restless father.  </P> <P> Nor could he be straightforward, "preferring to circle the building a few times  before entering . . . and he's a great one for answering a question with a  question.  </P> <P> "Anomie," Coleman continued. "That's what Carsey believes is the root of what  he has done." Or as Carsey explained to the author in a partial denial of the  first reference of anomie: "Total rootlessness. That what you're dealing with  as much as anything.  </P> <P> "As I've said before," Carsey said, "I have no sense of links. It's funny, but  I used to be slightly suspicious when I would look at someone's resume and see  14 jobs in 14 years. Now I understand."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Self-Analysis  </P> <P> In a later self-analysis, said Coleman, Carsey referred to a passage in Walter  Lippmann's "A Preface to Morals." He said it spoke for him. Coleman thinks it  may speak for many men in today's frantic crush of marriage and career and the  telescoping of satisfactions.  </P> <P> "At the heart of (modern man's discontent) there are likely to be moments of  blank misgiving in which he finds that the civilization of which he is a part  leaves a dusty taste in his mouth.  </P> <P>  "He may be very busy with many things, but he discovers one day that he is no  longer sure they are worth doing."  </P> <P>  It is suggested to Coleman that a person simply might resign formally from the  job, call an attorney, organize a divorce settlement and seek a new life and  spouse in freedom and with peer approval.  </P> <P> "I believe I understand why Carsey did what he did," Coleman said. "For one  thing, he would have been awfully susceptible to other people talking him out  of it. He was weak in ways like that.  </P> <P> "He wouldn't tell his wife because he was afraid of Nancy in the same way he  was afraid of his mother. He had seen her rage with him as he had seen his  mother's rage with his sister and he was frightened by rage."  </P> <P> Coleman's book is no mystery story of tracking a man who doesn't want to be  found. Neither is it a condoning, nor condemning the act of running away.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'People Hurting Each Other'  </P> <P> "It is a story about how people keep hurting each other from a distance . . .  </P> <P> "It is about getting into relationships for all the wrong reasons. He married  her because she (Nancy Carsey) was polishing him, this shirttail-out,  rough-hewn kid from Texas, on the way up. She married him because she saw  somebody clearly going places . . .  </P> <P> "It is about how we do not have the desire to right wrongs because we're always  trying to please. Carsey is a man who always looks for smiles because he is  destroyed by frowns . . . "  </P> <P> Although, Coleman agreed, there is a piece of all of us and all of some of us  in Jay Carsey, his is not a path to be followed if children are involved in the  marriage. Nor should it be a choice for those persons who do not have Carsey's  flair "for landing on his feet . . . things always turn up for Julian Nance  Carsey."  </P> <P> But for this one man it was worth it.  </P> <P> "I'm really sympathetic to what he did. I wished he could have done it  differently. But I can't blame Carsey for trying to save himself. Rightly or  wrongly, he was going down fast.  </P> <P> Yet returning to his roots, by remarrying, by settling for less money,  attention and position than he had, has Carsey indeed saved himself? Is he  happier now than then?  </P> <P> "What he didn't have and what he never had in Nancy was being loved for who he  is," Coleman said. "He was loved for what he represented, his status, money,  all the accouterments.  </P> <P> "Dawn (his current wife) loves him for what he is. Warts and all. And that is  the pivotal point in the book."  </P> <P> Exit the marriage maker.  </P></p>

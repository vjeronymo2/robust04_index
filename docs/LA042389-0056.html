			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST BANK BODY COUNTS RISING EVEN AS WORLD PROSPECTS IMPROVE  </P> <P> The Middle East holds more hope and more menace than it has for years.  Important positive signs add touches of light. Yet bitter defense of the status  quo, everyday violence and implacable suspicion make the outlook dark. A  visitor this spring senses a witching hour in which events could move either  way.  </P> <P> The engine of change remains the intifada, the Palestinian uprising against  Israeli occupation. After 16 months, the conflict is, if anything, more  intense. On the Palestinian side, about 450 dead, many more injured, thousands  in field prisons no better than concentration camps and curfews. Immobilizing  villages has not broken resistance. The stone-throwing continues and all the  heavy-handed measures of Israel's so-called civil administration (military  personnel from top to bottom) only seem to compound the problem.  </P> <P> The school system is shut down on the West Bank and children wander around with  nothing to do except taunt the Israeli military patrols with stones and  slingshots. (A 9-year-old can send a one-inch stone 100 yards and can really  hurt someone at 60 feet.)  </P> <P> The men and women of the United Nations' Relief and Works Agency, offering  educational and health support to more than 800,000 refugees in the occupied  territories, try to sustain local institutions. Yet Israeli authorities assert  that schools are hotbeds of nationalism and violent opposition. They have also  refused to allow children in the first three grades, just learning to read and  write, to be taught at home by their parents under the guidance of visiting  teachers. The Palestinians, hungry for learning, see this as a deliberate  policy to condemn their children to illiteracy and they respond with  incandescent hate.  </P> <P> Economic pressure, harassment and humiliation are all-pervasive. A father  wanting a birth certificate for a child must first apply at seven  administrative offices for such things as a good conduct clearance. Exit fees  for those permitted to travel abroad have gone up. The limit on money that may  be brought into the capital-starved territories has gone down. Emergency  regulations amount to martial law. A new ordinance restricts freedom of  movement, requiring people to carry special identity cards.  </P> <P> Since 1967, Israel has managed the economy of the occupied territories in the  traditional mercantilist manner of a colonial power. In addition, it has seized  much of the land and, more important, the water resources for its settlements.  The West Bank and Gaza have been a captive market for Israeli consumer goods, a  source of cheap labor and no competition.  </P> <P> Until the intifada, occupation was a profitable enterprise for Israel. Now,  Palestinians aim for a separate economy as a matter of liberation. The uprising  has a Boston Tea Party aspect, along with the building of economic  infrastructure and social self-help institutions. There is already a rather  remarkable political cohesion. A revolving leadership withstands the Israeli  security services' efforts to suppress it. And it appears to work by a popular  consensus that the clumsy authorities are unable to co-opt.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for "democratic elections" is  dismissed, even by Israelis in the peace camp, as a transparent play for time.  Mohammed Milhem, one of the mayors elected in the last free election of 1976  and then expelled by Israeli occupation forces in 1980, calls Shamir's  suggestion a trick to identify and then expel Palestinian leaders. "A man will  not be bitten twice by the same snake," he says. But he would consider a  referendum, internationally supervised, on whether the people want the  Palestine Liberation Organization to represent them.  </P> <P> The intifada is a phenomenon. After erupting spontaneously, it has developed a  program to justify the depth of the struggle -- a Palestinian state living in  peace with Israel, arrived at through political settlement. The intifada has  imposed this program on laggard leaders outside, specifically the PLO and Arab  regimes that have spent decades ineffectually juggling the hot potato of  Palestinian nationalism.  </P> <P> Astonishingly, official Israel appears unaffected. The tired leaders of Labor  and the jingoists of Likud have found no better common ground than Defense  Minister Yitzhak Rabin's declared policy of "force, might and beatings." The  casuality rate is as high as ever and one of the worst incidents occurred less  than two weeks ago. Elias Freij, the Christian mayor of Bethlehem called it an  unprovoked massacre -- at least five dead and dozens injured in one village.  Chief among the perpetrators were Druze border police, known for brutality  toward Palestinians and now employed in larger numbers at places previously  patrolled by the Israeli army.  </P> <P> Particularly ominous was an incident earlier in April when a man in Israeli  army uniform turned a submachine gun on a group of Palestinians near the Jaffa  Gate of old Jerusalem, killing one and wounding two. Telephone callers claimed  responsibility in the name of the Sicarii. Sicarii, alluding to a dagger, was  the name used by Zealot guerrillas who fought the Roman occupation in the time  of Christ. In recent months, the modern Sicarii has been linked to acts of  vandalism, fire bombing and vicious intimidation against men and women in the  Israeli peace movement or deemed to be pro-Arab. Now observers think Sicarii  may be setting out to kill Palestinians in a sort of counter-intifada.  </P> <P> Israelis as well as Arabs think the binary tragedy, occupation-intifada, can  continue for years despite the human and material costs.  </P> <P> Yet the big political picture has improved in one essential aspect. Middle East  battles are no longer amplified or exploited in the tensions and polarization  of the Cold War.  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union urge compromise, a peace with Israel's  security and Palestinian political rights in stable balance. As Washington has  made contact with the PLO, Moscow has reached out to Israel (also to Egypt and  Saudi Arabia). The Kremlin is telling Syria that there can be no military  solution and no further deliveries of offensive weapons to pursue one. Syria's  recent attack on a Soviet ship in the Mediterranean may be a kick in the shin  for this, but Damascus has nowhere else to turn.  </P> <P> At the same time, the tone if not the substance of the U.S.-Israeli  relationship has changed. Impatience with the Likud government's inflexibility  shows. Shamir's security argument, that once trumped all criticism, is less  credible now. The threat has shrunk. Egypt has long since made peace with  Israel; Jordan seeks it.  </P> <P> Prospects for peaceful adjustment to new realities are not hopeless; but given  the explosive alternative, the sooner the better.  </P></p>

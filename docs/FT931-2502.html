			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Budget package will help only 'one in 30' on dole THE GOVERNMENT will spend less than Pounds 1 extra a week on each of Britain's unemployed as a result of the new measures in Tuesday's Budget, Labour said yesterday. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, told MPs the new package would help just one in 30 of those in Britain's dole queues. He said that since Mr John Major's only Budget three years ago unemployment had risen by 87 per cent and 9.5m people had experienced the pain of being out of work. Unemployment was 'ruining the lives of 3m people and their families and shattering the economy'. In a wide-ranging dissection of the government's new proposals, Mr Dobson nonetheless welcomed 'without reservation' yesterday's 22,000 fall in the seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment figures. Though the decline could be a freak, it was 'undoubtedly the only piece of good news on unemployment for three years. 'If this is the start of a trend, it had better be an accelerating one because at 22,000 a month it will take eleven years before all people out of work are in work.' On the specific steps outlined on Tuesday, Mr Dobson gave a guarded welcome to the four Workstart pilot areas. These represent the government's first acceptance of the principle of job subsidies to employers who take on the unemployed. But he said the great danger of the proposition was that employers might simply substitute existing workers with those carrying the subsidy. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, who opened yesterday's debate, was challenged by one of her own backbenchers on why Workstart - which will initially involve 1,000 of those unemployed for more than two years at a cost of Pounds 2.6m - did not go further. Questioned by Labour on why the subsidy to employers had been pegged at Pounds 60 a week, Mrs Shephard said a flat rate was easier to administer. She said Tuesday's measures, costed at a net Pounds 125m, should be seen in the context of the proposals announced in last year's Autumn Statement. Welcoming the fall in the unemployment figures, she said it would help to stimulate business confidence, especially as it had come so early in the recovery cycle. The number of unemployed people placed into new jobs by the Employment Service was up on last year, while the number of people becoming newly unemployed was down.</p>

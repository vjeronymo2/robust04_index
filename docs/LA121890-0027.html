			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Dressing Down: For the second year in a row, the International Assn. of Custom  Tailors &amp; Designers has omitted Donald Trump from its "best-dressed" list,  although apparently the slight has nothing to do with wardrobe. Don Case, a  spokesman for the tailors' group, said Trump's own tailor has pointedly told  the besieged tycoon that he needs a haircut.  </P> <P> "A pile of hair in back of his neck is not conducive to a gentlemanly  appearance," Case said.  </P> <P> * Dressing Up: Those who did make the list include Britain's Prince Charles,  Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and  former President Ronald Reagan. Among the rest: Vito Pascucci, president of the  Leblanc musical instrument company, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.  </P> <P> * A Princely Sum: U.S. District Judge Hugh Robinson has ordered the auctioning  of the Atlanta mansion owned by Saudi Prince Faisal Mohamed Al-Saud Al Kabir.  The judge ruled Friday that Faisal had abused the judicial process by  transferring the mansion, its furnishings and a gun collection to a holding  corporation to protect it from bankruptcy. One of the prince's chief creditors  is the CJS Corp., which is headed by former Georgia Gov. Carl Sanders, who says  the prince owes CJS $11 million. The prince reportedly is in Saudi Arabia  seeking financing.  </P> <P> * Street Talkers: Neighborhood volunteers trying to discourage prostitution are  posing as hookers and handing "johns" literature about AIDS in the Uptown area  of Chicago. Wearing heavy makeup, furs and other streetwalker garb, residents  have been flagging down men in the middle of the night to spread the word about  the risk of disease. Police Sgt. Robert Sarnowski says the program could be  dangerous for the activists. "Once a john is in a car with a girl, I don't  think he's going to be inclined to read any literature," he said.  </P></p>

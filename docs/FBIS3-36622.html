In an interview with the Vilnius-based Russian-language  newspaper ECHO LITVY, the ambassador said a Baltic-Black Sea  alliance should be created, but "must not be narrowed only to a  political notion."    Bilodid said considerable work needs to be done in terms of  economic cooperation because the present volume of trade between  Lithuania and Ukraine cannot satisfy either of the sides.    The ambassador said Ukraine can become a major market for  Lithuanian goods, but Lithuania concentrates on economic ties  with the West, the North and the East, while the South slips  past without being seen. "My task is to direct Lithuania's  attention in the southern direction," he said.    In Bilodid's view, mutual settlements are a major problem in  economic relations between Lithuania and Ukraine. The  ambassador said the increasing rate of inflation in his country  creates additional difficulties. Among other problems, he also  mentioned the imperfectness of banking systems in both  countries. "All these problems are already discussed by experts.  I think, the presidents will also utter their weighty  arguments."</p>

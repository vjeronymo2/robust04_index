			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: GLITZY GREETINGS ARE IN THE CARDS FOR THE WEALTHY  </P> <P> They're the Rolls-Royces of holiday greeting cards, missives that say "Merry  Christmas" with panache and a snooty price tag.  </P> <P> Some sport imported French ribbon. Some a string of silver bells. Some a stream  of glittering Mylar. And some a family picture taken by Orange County's  photographer to the (social) stars, Greg Figge of Newport Beach.  </P> <P> All sell for a minimum of $12 apiece, several for as much as $30. It's not  unusual, says Figge -- whose clients include L.A. Rams Coach John Robinson,  Forbes 400 developer George Argyros and Allergan's top gun, Gavin Herbert --  for the rich to spend from $5,000 to $10,000 for a holiday mailing. Eileen Saul  of William Ernest Brown stationers in Costa Mesa agrees.  </P> <P> "There's no limit to what a client can spend on a custom card," she says.  </P> <P> Why spend a fortune on an item that will probably be glanced at, then tossed  into the circular file? Image, of course. And tradition.  </P> <P> "People keep my Christmas cards," says Deeann Baldwin of Emerald Bay. Deeann  and her husband, developer Al Baldwin, have been sending out family photographs  taken by Figge for 15 years.  </P> <P> "I put a lot of work into it," says Deeann Baldwin. "It's one of my passions, a  special way of keeping in touch. Every year, I try to come up with something  different, surprise family and friends with a new theme. People have really  enjoyed watching our children grow up."  </P> <P> Sittings have included a formal portrait -- the Baldwins in black tie -- taken  in the couple's living room. A casual portrait -- the Baldwins in blue jeans --  was taken on the beach. Last year, the couple sent out a photograph taken by a  fellow tourist during a visit to Rwanda (yes, there was a gorilla in the  background). Then there was the time the Baldwins flew Figge to their ranch in  Wyoming for a sitting.  </P> <P> "It may have been extravagant," says Figge, "but we sure got some great shots.  Deeann doesn't hold back on quality or imagination. Even I can't wait to get  her card each year."  </P> <P> There was also the time the Baldwins wanted everybody to think their holiday  photograph was shot in Colorado. "We couldn't get everybody to Aspen," says  Deeann Baldwin, laughing. So, they did the next best thing -- posed next to a  Newport Beach restaurant that looked like it was located in the village at the  popular ski resort.  </P> <P> "It was hysterical," she says. "Figge brought Styrofoam for snow and we brought  our ski clothes. There I was in leather and a fur coat and it's 90 degrees and  Balboa is packed. We're posing and people are beginning to look at us like  we're nuts. One of my sons was so embarrassed he told them: 'This is an ad for  GQ; we don't even know each other!' " But the trick photography worked. "It  really looked like we were in Aspen in December. Nobody believes me when I tell  them it was California in October."  </P> <P> The Baldwins aren't alone when it comes to snowing friends with Styrofoam. This  year, Figge says, a woman spent about $1,000 on snowmen balloons and trees at a  local florist, then posed with them in a storm of the faux snow. Another couple  hauled their family to the parking lot near Figge's studio and posed in crushed  Styrofoam next to a brick building trailing with ivy. A nearby tree blazed with  crimson leaves the size of saucers, Figge says. Who's to know the photograph  was taken in a mall parking lot and not next to some Ivy League enclave?  </P> <P> Gary Hunt, right arm to billionaire Donald Bren, recently posed with his family  in a hammock for his holiday greeting card. Figge scouted the Hunt residence  for the perfect spot, found the oversize hammock and told Hunt to hop in with  family. During the $400 sitting ($150 if a client comes to the studio) the  hammock flipped and the Hunts found themselves face-down on the lawn. That shot  won't be mailed, of course. But the comedy of it won't be lost. While Figge was  shooting, one of his co-workers was taking a video of the Hunts.  </P> <P> "I get such a kick out of that. People posing for pictures and videos at the  same time," says Saul of William Ernest Brown stationers, who, with partner  Cindy Van Zandt, dreams up the cards that set off Figge's popular photographs.  </P> <P> Videos have become another hot item to send during the holidays, Figge says.  "We do some clever editing and add a little music. Usually, they're sent as  gifts, not cards."  </P> <P> When Gavin Herbert and his family posed for Figge recently, they stood,  knee-deep in the tulips that dot Herbert's famous garden at his Casa Pacifica  mansion. Last year, Judie and George Argyros posed for Figge on their boat  wearing floppy reindeer-antler hats. The year before, the Argyroses sent out  large cards from William Ernest Brown that were custom-painted, each with a  different abstract design.  </P> <P> This year, the Baldwin family will be in "red" but the locale and theme of the  400 cards they will mail are under wraps. "The theme is top secret until Dec.  10," Deeann says.  </P> <P> We'll be waiting.  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / The bamboozle that burst the Bombay bubble: The scandal that threatens to turn a stock market slide into a crash Like any bubble the Bombay stock market boom had to burst one day. But as the Central Bureau of Investigation launched an inquiry into what seems to be India's worst-ever financial scandal, the fears are that a can of worms could be opened which will turn the market's two-week slide into a crash. After the Bombay Stock Exchange index tumbled yesterday a further 10 per cent to 3,086, the most sanguine expectation was that the market would bottom out at 2,500 - or 43 per cent down on its peak in April. The second concern is that both the extent of the abuses and the market's fall could deal a savage blow to the government's efforts to develop the fledgling capital market as an instrument to tap public savings for both private sector and public sector investment. One of the immediate results could be that fresh public issues will be more difficult to launch or could be postponed. The market had been expecting Rs40bn (Pounds 800m) of new issues - including a big issue from the Grasim (Aditya Birla) group to finance new refinery at Mangalore in southern India  -in the coming month. Reliance, the petrochemicals group had also been hoping to raise Dollars 100m in a Euro-issue at a tentative price of Dollars 10 a share. But this will be much trickier with Reliance's own share price dropping yesterday to Rs260 on the Bombay market. Faced with disarray not only on the stockmarket, but in the bond and money markets, the government's hope in calling in the CBI is of a surgical strike to remove the offenders and to clean up the market. It would welcome a fall in the index - which at its peak had been trading at unrealistically high average price-earnings ratios of more than 45 - but wants to prevent a disorderly tumble. A revival of private sector investment through capital market funding is crucial to the government's strategy for restructuring industry and boosting exports. After a dizzy trippling of prices over the last year in response to the government's liberalisation plans, the market has dived 30 per cent over the last fortnight. This followed the disclosure that large funds - as much as Rs30bn - had been illegally syphoned out of the interbank market in government securities to fuel the share price boom. The difficulty in limiting the damage is that those who have so far been implicated in the scandal are no minor players. Mr Harshad Mehta, the first-generation Bombay broker who had to repay Rs6.2bn to the State Bank of India, the largest state-owned commercial bank, because of irregular securities trading, was more than anyone the architect of the bull run this year. He proclaimed not only the dramatic rise in the market but publicly announced which shares he was backing. Those he chose have since taken the hardest tumble with Associated Cement (ACC) dropping a further Rs1,100 on Monday to Rs4,400 after reaching a peak of Rs10,500 on April 2. Mr M J Pherwani, who has resigned as head of the National Housing Bank, headed the Unit Trust of India, a state-owned - and the country's largest - mutual fund for 10 years. He was also the chairman of a government-appointed committee that recently recommended a revamped national stock exchange. As chairman of UTI, he was a lead player in the bull market of the late 1980s. He was forced to step down from that position because of his allegedly links to the Ambani family who control Reliance and who were accused of market manipulation. Both Mr Mehta and Mr Pherwani are well connected both in the Bombay financial market and among politicians and the top civil servants in Delhi. Other senior banking executives including Mr K. Margabandhu, chairman of the Calcutta-based United Commercial Bank, and Mr C L Khemani, deputy managing director of the State Bank of India were asked to take immediate leave. The diversion of funds was possible because of the chaotic securities market in which bankers receipts are traded. Bankers receipts are promissory notes issued by banks to each other in trading on government bonds. The Reserve Bank of India (the central bank), which acts as a bond depositary for banks, had fallen badly behind in registering security transfers because this part of its operations is still not computerised. 'There was a systems failure,' Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, told parliament on Monday. But the inadequate supervision that is now seen to have characterised the bond market is also true of the stock market where insider trading and the rigging of prices is known to flourish. 'Entry, holding and exit are all hazards in this market,' Mr G V Ramakrishna, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India said six months ago. Not much has changed. The diversion of funds from the bankers receipt market occured through the issue of false paper and the illegal use of securities as collateral to raise fresh funds. The abuses were due to both the bull market of the last year and to the archaic trading system. Brokers seemed to have won the confidence or connivance of bankers dealing in bonds. The suspicion of fraud surfaced in mid-April but came to public notice a fortnight later as commercial banks started to reconcile accounts for the accounting year ending March. It was at this point that the State Bank of India realised it was owed Rs6.2bn by Mr Mehta and forced him to settle. As a fall-out from this Mr Mehta was unable to meet other obligations - including payments to the National Housing Bank. Mr Pherwani attributes National Housing Bank's inability to deliver on cash or security payments of Rs3.4bn to Canara Bank on Mr Mehta defaulting on his obligations to him. These transactions occurred within the framework of the bankers receipt  - a normally narrow interbank market trading in government and public sector bonds. Banks' investment in the market none the less exceeds Rs1,400bn. Until recently the market has focused on banks purchasing some Rs10bn a month of bonds to meet statutory liquidity requirements set by the Reserve Bank. But the market became active in February anticipating a fall in bond prices, especially long-dated securities, on reports of a possible interest rate rise on new bonds the government was to issue in March. Banks entered futures swap deals promising deliveries after the coupon rise. This occured on March 17 with long-dated bonds rising 0.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent. Some banks had already sold short. Bond market players used the bankers receipt to register transactions which require immediate cash payment but leave delivery of the security to later. With the Reserve Bank unable to police a fast expanding market because its own registering of transactions fell behind, the opportunities and temptation for fraud grew. In the coming days the government will use the weight of the state-owned institutions to prevent an uncontrolled fall in the market - hoping that foreign portfolio investment will emerge to provide a safety net. However small investors will already have been frightened by the market's sharp descent and could go on selling.</p>

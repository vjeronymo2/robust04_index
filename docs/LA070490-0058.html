			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FIZZLING FIREWORKS;  </P> <P> FILLMORE: BOOTHS IN THE ONLY COUNTY CITY TO ALLOW 'SAFE AND SANE' DEVICES SAY  BUSINESS IS SLOW, PERHAPS BECAUSE OF RECENT BLAZES.  </P> <P> The sales of fireworks in Fillmore were reportedly far below normal on Tuesday,  the day before the Fourth of July.  </P> <P> Some of the fireworks booths that line California 126 were abandoned at midday.  Workers at others said their sales were just limping along.  </P> <P> George Kutbach, president of the Fillmore Jaycees, said he began the day at 6  a.m. trying to drum up business by waving a large American flag at motorists  and truck drivers.  </P> <P> "Nobody wants to be stuck with all these fireworks," Kutbach said. Workers at  several of the 19 booths lining California 126 said sales had fallen by 10% to  25% contrasted with last year's. The service clubs that sell the fireworks have  previously reported earning $10,000 to $40,000 during the week of legal sales.  </P> <P> Dorothy Haase, fireworks chairwoman for the Fillmore Historical Society, said  sales were among the slowest in a long time, down by as much as a third for her  group.  </P> <P> "I think the Santa Barbara and the Glendale fires have had some impacts," Haase  said. "Although they weren't caused by fireworks, I think people are more  aware."  </P> <P> Other workers said the midweek holiday means fewer travelers were passing  through Fillmore just before the Fourth.  </P> <P> Fillmore permits the sale by nonprofit groups and the use of so-called "safe  and sane" fireworks. It is the only Ventura County city to do so.  </P> <P> Safe and sane fireworks, by definition, sparkle and whistle but do not leave  the ground.  </P> <P> Despite the name, firefighters say the fireworks are not entirely safe. Last  year, the devices were blamed for 14 of 29 fires between June 17 and July 17 in  Ventura County, fire officials said.  </P> <P> Although service clubs bemoaned the drop in business, one county fire official  said it may lighten today's workload for firefighters.  </P> <P> "Whatever the reason is, fireworks sales are down, and we're pleased," said  Deputy Chief Bob Holaway of the Ventura County Fire Department.  </P> <P> "It's a good thing for the citizens if sales are down. It means that there are  going to be that much fewer fireworks out there."  </P> <P> Fillmore Fire Chief Pat Askren attributed the drop to a Fire Department  campaign focusing on the hazard fireworks pose to the drought-parched hills of  Ventura County.  </P> <P> Askren said he has also made an attempt this year to crack down on people who  purchase or parents who allow their children to possess illegal fireworks.  </P> <P> Truck driver Richard Cox, 31, of Tracy stopped to buy $11 worth of fireworks in  Fillmore while hauling aluminum to Valencia. Cox said hillsides in the San  Joaquin Valley county where he lives are as dry and vulnerable to fire as those  around Ventura County.  </P> <P> "Down here, things are so dry it surprises me that they're still selling  fireworks," Cox said. "I'm buying them because we don't have them up there."  </P> <P> Alfonso Cardenas, 24, of Oxnard said he plans to have a large July Fourth  gathering during which relatives will light the $70 worth of fireworks his  family chipped in to buy.  </P> <P> "The intention is not to harm anybody," Cardenas said. However, the ban on  fireworks in his home city did not deter him from buying.  </P> <P> "If it's illegal, it's illegal," Cardenas said. "I guess I'll go to jail."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALERT  </P> <P> Police and fire officials are conducting stepped-up patrols looking for people  using illegal fireworks. B3  </P></p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / TV service 'did not cover costs' Accountancy Television, the defunct training service for accountants, was never even able to cover its on-going production and marketing costs, the receivers said yesterday. The service generated accumulated losses of Pounds 2.2m, according to details of the draft management accounts for the year to December 31 last year. Workhouse Productions, one of the largest unsecured creditors to the company, expressed concerns yesterday at a creditors' meeting about the way it was treated. It is owed about Pounds 150,000.</p>

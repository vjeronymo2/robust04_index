			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BUSH STARTS ASIA TRIP, SEES IT AS WAY TO BOOST U.S. ROLE  </P> <P> President Bush began a six-day Asian journey Wednesday to demonstrate that "we  intend to stay a Pacific power" at a time of increased Soviet activity and  shifting diplomatic currents throughout the region.  </P> <P> But even as he stressed the strength of U.S. ties in Asia, he gently prodded  Japan to play a greater role in the common defense of the Far East, and  pointedly ignored a celebration of U.S.-Soviet neighborliness taking place in  Alaska.  </P> <P> The trip to Japan, China and South Korea was planned around the funeral Friday  morning of Emperor Hirohito, the last of the World War II leaders, whose rites  and burial are bringing representatives of 159 nations, including about 60  heads of government or state, to Tokyo.  </P> <P> But it also provides the President Bush an opportunity in the early days of his  administration "to reaffirm that the United States plans to play a strong and  affirmative role as an Asian power," and that its influence in the region is  not declining, said Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser.  </P> <P> Bush, speaking to Alaskans assembled in a massive hangar at Elmendorf Air Force  Base in Anchorage while Air Force One was refueled nearby, said that even as  the United States reviews its relations with the Soviets, in the Middle East  and in Latin America, "We don't ever want to take our friends for granted, be  they China, be they Japan, be they Korea."  </P> <P> "Yes, things in the Pacific seem to be going reasonably well," said the  president, who is being accompanied on the journey by his wife, Barbara. "But  we are a Pacific power and this visit will demonstrate that we intend to stay a  Pacific power."  </P> <P> In the U.S.-Chinese relationship, he said, "There is something more than  symbolism. That relationship is fundamental in any foreign policy equation of  the United States."  </P> <P> "Alaskans understand that America is as much a Pacific nation as it is an  Atlantic one -- and that the Pacific region is of great and growing importance  in international affairs," he said.  </P> <P> Saluting the strength of the U.S. relationship with all three countries he will  visit before returning to Washington Monday, Bush said he seeks by his trip to  Tokyo to show his respect for Japan as "a valued ally and a fellow democracy."  </P> <P> However, in other remarks, there was a hint of the undercurrent of tension that  often marks U.S.-Japanese relations.  </P> <P> In written answers provided to questions submitted by the Kyodo News Service of  Japan, the president acknowledged "Japan's continued and steady progress in  improving its defense capability," long a point of prodding by the United  States. But he offered the reminder that "there is still room for greater  improvement, especially in the area of sustainability" -- the crucial military  ability to maintain long supply lines from home bases to units operating in the  field, or in the case of Japan, at sea.  </P> <P> Scowcroft told reporters Tuesday that in the meetings with Prime Minister  Noboru Takeshita, Bush would raise the question of how Japan can increase its  contribution, "whether it's through their own defense expenditures, whether  it's through helping mutual allies with security."  </P> <P> The new national security adviser accompanied the President, along with  Secretary of State James A. Baker III.  </P> <P> In his Anchorage remarks, Bush said that in China, he hoped "to build on the  friendly, stable and enduring relationship that now exists."  </P> <P> He described South Korea as a nation "where democratic institutions are gaining  strength each day."  </P> <P> "At each stop, I aim to strengthen key relationships with our friends and  partners in the Pacific region," the president said.  </P> <P> In at least one respect, however, the Bush administration has been moving  slowly to develop its ties to the region: The president has yet to formally  send to the Senate his nominations of U.S. ambassadors to Japan, China and  South Korea.  </P> <P> In his speech, Bush made no reference to the evolving Soviet interest in the  Pacific, or to the emerging contacts between Alaskans and residents of the  Soviet Far East across the narrow Bering Strait.  </P> <P> Rather, in a message directed to the sizable contingent of U.S. military forces  personnel stationed in the far north, he said:  </P> <P> "Make no mistake about it -- the importance of your task. Alaska's strategic  position -- at the point where the Far East, the Western Hemisphere and the  arctic meet, is proof enough that the missions you perform here are vital to  our national security."  </P> <P> "You are the forward edge, the cutting edge, if you will, of our national  defense. We rely on you to keep the watch, to hold the line," he said. As a  sentry along the polar approach to the rest of the United States, Alaska is  home to Air Force, Navy and Army Bases, whose missions include continental  defenses against bombers, anti-submarine warfare, and intercepting Soviet and  Chinese communications.  </P> <P> Even as Bush paid his 90-minute visit to Alaska at the mid-point of his  15-hour, 7,050-mile journey from Washington to Tokyo, 90 Soviet visitors were  paying a week-long visit, staying in local homes, fielding questions at public  schools, and celebrating the more open borders in a region of the world where  distrust and hostility had reigned.  </P> <P> White House officials said the center of the activities was too far away to  allow Bush to take part during his brief stop.  </P> <P> For more than two years, U.S. officials have been watching with interest as the  Soviets have paid ever greater attention to the Pacific, beginning with a  speech Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev delivered in July, 1986, in  Vladivostok. At that time, he touted the "considerable opportunities . . . in  the Far East and in the Pacific" for "peaceful, good-neighborly relations and  for mutually beneficial cooperation."  </P> <P> Since then, the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and efforts to pull  Vietnamese troops out of Cambodia have led to a sharp improvement in  Sino-Soviet relations and the announcement in early February that Gorbachev  would visit Beijing, probably in mid-May.  </P> <P> The prospects of the Sino-Soviet summit loom large in the politics of the  region, just as the start of the Bush Administration has left Asians curious  about the future of U.S. policies.  </P> <P> The President's decision to visit China before Gorbachev gets there, said one  U.S. official, demonstrates to the Chinese "that the American commitment is  real."  </P> <P> "They're trying to feel Bush out. The Chinese don't have a very good feel for  these (new) people," said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ECOLOGICAL ERA COULD ADD SHINE TO PLATINUM'S FUTURE  </P> <P> The Green Revolution spells big business for South Africa's platinum industry,  as the metal is a key weapon in the fight against smog and acid rain.  </P> <P> South Africa provides 80% of supplies to the Western world and will increase  production of the metal, which is more valuable than gold, to meet rising  demand in the 1990s.  </P> <P> Mining houses here are reluctant to detail their expansion plans, but some  platinum analysts see output rising as much as 60% by the end of the century.  </P> <P> Several platinum producers said the higher output reflects rising demand from  jewelers in Italy and especially in Japan, where the metal is preferred to gold  as an ornament.  </P> <P> Platinum is also used in petroleum refining, in the production of high-octane,  lead-free gasoline and in airliner air purifiers.  </P> <P> But producers say most of the sales growth will come from platinum's use in  catalytic converters -- devices that reduce pollutants in automobile exhausts.  The auto industry is the biggest user of the metal.  </P> <P> Some analysts worry about what they see as the metal's over-reliance on the  cyclic auto industry, but the overall mood is optimistic.  </P> <P> "There is strong demand and we expect that to prevail for the next few years,"  said Don Ireland, managing director of Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., South  Africa's second-biggest producer.  </P> <P> Legislation to control auto-exhaust pollutants "is geographically spreading --  Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Australia. It's tending to spread worldwide," he  said.  </P> <P> The price of platinum has fluctuated between $420 and $620 an ounce in the past  three years. But it is sold to industrial users on long-term contracts to  protect them against sharp price hikes.  </P> <P> New York metals dealer Ronald Tauber said at a platinum conference in  Johannesburg in October that by the end of the century, the auto industry's use  of platinum may double.  </P> <P> "Politicians around the world now understand: They either will be actively  promoting pollution restrictions, or they will be opposed by the majority of  their electorates. . . . All of this is critical to the platinum market,"  Tauber said.  </P> <P> Consumption by the car industry is expected to be reported at 9% higher for  1989 than in the year before, with 43% of the supply going to the West,  according to estimates published by London-based precious metals traders  Johnson Matthey.  </P> <P> The report estimates that demand for platinum from the European car industry  surged more than 20% last year, spurred by European Community legislation to  match U.S. laws to restrict small car emissions by 1993.  </P></p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE STRENGTH of the stock index futures sector was tested yesterday when the outcome of the auction in the UK gilt-edged market briefly cast a cloud over equities, writes Terry Byland. Traders admitted that there was some selling of both equities and the December contract on the Footsie, although both sectors rallied before the close of business. Some good-sized buying was reported in the first half-hour of trading but confidence was soon undermined when bonds turned down. The December contract bounced against its fair value several times before rallying to close at a premium of 32 against the cash market. This showed a premium of around 8 points above fair value, the estimated premium which allows for dividend and financing flows. Trading volume was down to 9,026 contracts, which traders considered a satisfactory level for the penultimate trading session of the third quarter of the year. Activity in traded options was around one-third lower at 23,364 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option, at 9,354 lots, recorded a sharp fall from Tuesday's total of just above 18,000. The Euro FT-SE option was fairly busy at 3,436 contracts, while BP headed the list of individual stock options, turning over 2,110 deals as the market continued to track the Opec meeting. Also attracting interest was Tesco (1,103 contracts).</p>

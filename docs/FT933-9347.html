			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: ScotMet plans Pounds 47m disposal SCOTTISH Metropolitan, Scotland's biggest property investment company, is putting on the market Saltire Court, a prestige office development in Edinburgh which is the company's largest single asset. Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyors, are to seek offers in the region of Pounds 46.8m for Saltire Court. ScotMet said the proposed sale 'will create a platform for the company to return to making selective investment acquisitions in the north' (of Britain). Saltire Court is an imposing stone-faced building containing 175,000 sq ft of office space below Edinburgh Castle. It has succeeded in attracting firms of solicitors and accountants to relocate from their traditional base in Georgian buildings in Charlotte Square. But it was only completed in late 1991 after the property boom had ended and was initially slow to find tenants. However, it is now 92 per cent let with tenants at headline rents in the region of Pounds 22-Pounds 23 per sq ft. ScotMet plunged heavily into loss in 1991 mainly because of the collapse of property values in the south and Mr Gordon Milne, managing director, who had championed the Saltire Court project, resigned in early 1992, to be replaced by Mr Scott Cairns. Since then ScotMet has sold off Pounds 90m of assets to reduce borrowings, which had been cut to Pounds 150m in April when the company announced a return to profitability with pre-tax profits of Pounds 532,000 for the half year to February 15 1993. Banking facilities were extended from October 1993 to October 1995. Mr Cairns said that Saltire Court represented 15-20 per cent of ScotMet's net assets of Pounds 285m as of last August which was too large a percentage to have in one building. He said the sale of Saltire Court was not required for the purpose of reducing debt, although it would reduce the company's debts below its target level. 'I always felt that Saltire Court formed too large a part of our assets,' Mr Cairns said. He added that ScotMet would now be investing in properties worth about Pounds 5m each.</p>

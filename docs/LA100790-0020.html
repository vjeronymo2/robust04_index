			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A  CLASSIC).  </P> <P> *** 1/2 THE WATERBOYS "Room to Roam" Ensign/Chrysalis  </P> <P> Here's a perfect album if you're in love. Mike Scott certainly is -- with a  woman (he giddily recounts his discovery in "A Man Is in Love") and with his  adopted rural Irish home (whose music and inspiration fill this collection).  </P> <P> And Scott the Scotsman is also still in love with the spiritual quest that has  fueled the four previous Waterboys albums.  </P> <P> In some ways, though, the earthy music and the contented tone make this seem a  bit of a retreat. Historically, a seeker's art is more compelling when he still  hasn't found what he's looking for -- and this album suggests that's true in  Scott's case. With the acoustic mix of reels and Van Morrison-influenced  explorations on 1988's "Fisherman's Blues," Scott and crew struck a balance  between the light and the heavy. Only in a few places here do they leave the  pub jam session and get back to the hunt for meaning.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the pure existential joy of these 17 songs and fragments  makes this far and away Scott's least pompous outing -- unless you think a  Scotsman's guileless romance with Ireland falls into the latter category. If  you're a romantic yourself, it would be hard to pass through this ceilidh  without catching its spirit. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

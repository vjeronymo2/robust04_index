			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. STATION TO DUMP SELECTV, DIMMING PROSPECTS FOR PIONEER  </P> <P> SelecTV has lost its contract with the channel that broadcasts the pioneering  subscription TV service to 20,000 homes in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> KWHY-TV Channel 22 has decided to broadcast Spanish-language programming April  1 instead of the movies and sports offered by SelecTV. And while SelecTV  executives are putting the best face on KWHY's move, some experts predict that  it could spell the demise of the long-struggling service.  </P> <P> "It's probably the end of the road for them, certainly at Channel 22," said  KWHY President Burt Harris Jr. "Right now they owe us a lot of money, but we're  keeping them on in return for a minimum daily payment because subscribers are  still expecting a service."  </P> <P> "SelecTV will be on tonight," Harris said Friday, adding "but only if they pay  me by 5 o'clock today." SelecTV leases air time from KWHY.  </P> <P> However, a spokesman for SelecTV countered that "we're definitely going to be  on tonight and tomorrow night and the night after that." A spokesman for KWHY  confirmed late Friday that the station had been paid and SelecTV "would be on  through the weekend."  </P> <P> KWHY will continue to broadcast the Business Channel from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. on  weekdays, followed by Spanish-language programming from Univisa Inc.  </P> <P> SelecTV President Thomas C. Hunt denied that the loss of the KWHY contract  would mean the end of the service. According to Hunt, SelecTV is merely in a  period of transition, converting from broadcast delivery to microwave  distribution -- what is known in the industry as a multichannel, multipoint  distribution service, or MMDS.  </P> <P> The change will require the installation of new equipment in subscriber homes,  he said, and will take several months. The equipment will be provided free to  SelecTV by the manufacturer in exchange for a percentage of subscriber fees.  </P> <P> "We've informed our subscribers that we are offering a new service that we're  calling SuperselecTV," Hunt said. "We are beginning conversions this month. We  feel this is a very positive thing for us. MMDS is a growth industry, the wave  of the future in wireless cable."  </P> <P> Hunt said the company expects to have 2,000 subscribers converted to the new  service by the time SelecTV's contract with KWHY is up at the end of the month.  He acknowledged that "we may lose some subscribers" during the transition, "but  we're highly confident that some of those people will take a new and better  service back. We'll take a dip and then go back up again," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Struggle to the End'  </P> <P> Larry Gerbrandt, a senior analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, a media research  firm in Carmel, was less upbeat about SelecTV's prospects. "I don't want to  predict anyone's demise, but obviously this is a crisis situation."  </P> <P> "Their job is to minimize the loss of subscribers," Gerbrandt said of SelecTV  management statements. "They have to try. You have to struggle to the very end  and try to keep the business alive. As long as you have subscribers you can  probably patch together some sort of service. Then it becomes a question of  overhead and how many subscribers you lose."  </P> <P> "Multichannel MDS could give them a new lease on life," he said. "It's doable  and feasible, but it will require additional capital from somewhere. When you  are day-to-day with all your (supplier) accounts, as I understand they are,  anything incremental can be very serious."  </P> <P> "They are valiantly trying to save themselves at the 11th hour, but my feeling  is they are going out of business," said KWHY's Harris. "This isn't a surprise  to anyone; they've been losing subscribers for years."  </P> <P> Indeed, when SelecTV merged with its rival pay TV service, On-TV, in 1984, the  combined company boasted nearly 300,000 subscribers in the Los Angeles area.  </P></p>

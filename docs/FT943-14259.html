			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Arts: Several cheers for San Francisco - Ballet The San Francisco Ballet is America's oldest classical troupe, and it has marked its 61st year by playing a season at the Opera Garnier. Several cheers, say I, for a company that has been much improved by Helgi Tomasson - whom we remember as a leading dancer with Balanchine - its director since 1985. The ensemble, as I saw it in Paris at the weekend, looks serious, skilled. (I hereby abandon my suspicion that America had declared a secret but vicious war on the EU by sending such awful and subversive troupes to Europe as the Washington Ballet and Bill T Jones and his ghastly crew). Nothing quite lived up to quality of the first work on view, Mark Morris's Maelstrom, made for SFB this year, but the impression given by two programmes was eminently satisfying. The Morris piece is daring - who but a madman, or Mark Morris, would make a ballet to Beethoven's Ghost trio? - and, against all odds, utterly persuasive. Three good San Francisco musicians play the trio in the pit. The stage is sublimely lit by James Ingalls, so that the dancers glow in Martin Pakledinaz's claret-coloured outfits against a cloudy back-drop, and Morris allows himself to be led by Beethoven. Unlike most choreographers who take on 'great' scores and bring to them preconceived ideas worthy of an axe-muderer, Morris finds ways of showing us what he hears Beethoven saying. So the dance flows over the stage, ideas are transferred between dancers, formal devices match step and musical phrase. At times one thinks, as Morris makes a point yet again, 'Beethoven does that with much less fuss', but the sum effect is unemphatically noble and apt. For the haunted largo assai, Morris pulls off his most skilled effect, using a complex step, the gargouillade, as a signature movement. Extending it, or hinting at it, he matches what the music is doing. His way with balletic language throughout is easy, unforced. The piece is a joy. The company danced admirably in Maelstrom, which was as well, since there followed an attack by Helgi Tomasson on Kurt Weill songs which turned its cast into zombies. The idea behind Nanna's Lied was, I surmise, to bring back the dear old days of UFA films and the Berlin of Georg Grosz. The result is novelettish, Dr Caligari paying a house call on Mills and Boone. Gloomy sets - dark, mad sloping walls, of course - and An Innocent Girl falling for a bit of rough, then being driven to prostitution (that usual jaunt of the period). She has, things being what they are, to loose her all, apparently to Nosferatu. Fatuous as drama, the ballet offers sub-MacMillan couplings to the sound of Weill songs in performance slack, unidiomatic. (Surabaya Johnny done over by an hysterical yodeller). Better forgotten. Better still, abandoned on the nearest tip. The Balanchine works were Bugaku and Who Cares?. Neither is very important; both were done with understanding and given an individual flavour - though not so strong as to smother the real taste of Balanchine. Bugaku's eroticism, the happy Gershwin bounce of Who Cares?, were well served, and I greatly admired Elizabeth Loscavio as she sailed through Embraceable You and My One and Only, her dancing fresh, classically true, floating sweetly on the music. Tomasson's real creative identity is that of a dance-maker in Balanchine fashion. (I recall early pieces in New York as featly made). His Quattro Stagioni uses Vivaldi's interminable scratchings and twitterings (surely more like eight seasons?) for an academic divertissement which shows off his dancers well. Pretty set and Empire costuming from Santo Loquasto. Pretty dances. Pretty performances from the girls; light-footed leapings from the men. The piece is craftsman-like, agreeable, slightly anonymous, a happy display of the company's good dance manners. Quite what Agnes de Mille's Rodeo is nowadays I am not sure. It completed the repertory for Paris - the token bit of ethnic charm, perhaps? - but it looks more than ever like Oklahokum. The cowboys, the cowgirl, the friends from Kansas City: all so jovial, all so open-air, all so likely to be found in dear old Quaintsville. I don't think Rodeo can be danced today. The San Francisco cast is careful, as one should be when handling an antique, but the piece is actually a fake.</p>

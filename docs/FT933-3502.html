			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Old soldier in front line for peace MR BENJAMIN Ben-Eliezer, Israel's minister of housing, has seen the worst side of Arab-Israeli wars. Now, after 27 years as a combat soldier in all of Israel's main post-independence conflicts, he is one of Israel's most ardent supporters of peace. 'Its a very, very special day for me,' he said in an interview yesterday. 'A day which could end years of fighting and offer new hope, new opportunities and new challenges.' Apart from Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, Mr Ben-Eliezer - known in Israel by his Arabic name Fouad - is the only general in the Israeli cabinet. His support for the peace agreement springs directly from his long career as a military man which began in 1954 when, at age 18, he joined the elite Golani brigade of the Israel Defence Force. 'I owed some answers to my five children,' said the 58-year-old minister, who was born in the Iraqi town of Basra and speaks, reads and writes fluent Arabic. 'I wanted to make sure that after they completed their military service if they were ever called again to fight another war with Arabs they should know that my generation - the generation that fought for the country across all those painful decades - had taken all the risks to change the future and the destiny of our country.' It is a remarkable statement for a man who has been at the cutting edge of the battle against the Palestine Liberation Organisation. During the 1967 Six Day War he served as a commander of an elite reconnaissance battalion making raids across enemy lines, in 1969 he was wounded during an airborne raid on a PLO camp in Jordan and throughout the 1970s he fought the PLO in Lebanon - becoming, in 1976, the first Israeli military officer to enter Beirut when he slipped into the country from a missile boat to help build up the Lebanese Christian Phalange militia, then fighting the PLO on the streets of Beirut. Later he was commander of southern Lebanon, military governor of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and co-ordinator of government activities in all the occupied territories. 'For years we thought there was no alternative but to fight and fight and fight. That is why this is such a historical change - hopefully to bring an end to wars and battles and to bring something new - a new Middle East,' he said. In 1984 'Fouad' left the army, joined the Labour party and entered Israel's parliament. He quickly earned the disapproval of many MPs when, in a now-famous speech made a year before the eruption of the intifada (Palestinian uprising) - he warned that the territories were heading for 'a rebellion or mass civil disobedience. The process has begun and within three to five years we will have a full-scale revolt on our hands'. He said a whole generation of Palestinians had grown up knowing nothing but military occupation and he urged Israel to seize the moment, make a drastic change of direction, and give the Palestinians autonomy over their own affairs. Nobody listened then. Six years later the Israeli nation agreed. And the man tipped one day to be prime minister is looking like a visionary. The agreement, Mr Ben-Eliezer says, is not without risks but they are calculated risks. The greatest risks, he says, are the possibility of a change in the leaderships of neighbouring Arabic states and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. The greatest opportunities, he adds, are in a new Middle East of economic co-operation, and he believes his ministry will be in the forefront of building new roads and ports to service the Middle East. Much will depend, he stresses, on whether the experimental trial period of interim Palestinian self-rule works out and builds confidence on both sides. And in a symbolic gesture, the minister yesterday opened a new housing project for Israeli Arabs in Lod, right next to a Jewish neighbourhood. 'For centuries Arabs and Jews lived together. We are both Semitic peoples, after all. I hope we can live in peace again, separately, but with mutual respect, understanding and co-operation. We need to live together but also separately because everyone has to live with something that belongs just to him.'</p>

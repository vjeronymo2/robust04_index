			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Participants  of the Bonn meeting on Bosnia will concentrate on how to achieve  a lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina quickly, according to the  press guidelines for the meeting today.    Urging the warring parties in bosnia to grasp the chance for  peace now, diplomats from the European Union, Canada, the  Russian Federation and the United States as well as a U.N.  representative decided to use the current momentum deriving from  the success in Sarajevo to work closely together to promote an  early negotiated settlement between them, said the guidelines  released here.    "The participants proceed from the basis that the parties  have already agreed to the quantitative territorial aspects of a  settlement, as outlined in the European Union action plan, but  that the quality and viability of territory for the Bosnian  Government needs to be improved," the guidelines said.    In Sarajevo, efforts will be made to stabilize the ceasefire  by effective disengagement of forces, ensure free access to  Sarajevo by land for humanitarian aid convoys and restore normal  life to the city with the assistance of the United Nations, said  the guidelines.    To create necessary conditions to facilitate a peaceful  solution and to alleviate the suffering of the civilians until a  settlement is achieved, efforts also include rapid rotation of  U.N. forces into Srebrenica and Zepa and rapid opening of the  Tuzla airport for humanitarian aid deliveries, the guidelines  added.    The participants in the one-day meeting welcomed the recent  developments in and around Sarajevo as an important step towards  ending the war throughout the former Yugoslav republic.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Crude logic The flaws in Enterprise's industrial case for acquiring Lasmo have not been removed by its latest document. The weakest argument is that there would be savings from joint use of infrastructure. Enterprise argues that the profitability of future developments would be enhanced by cheap access to Lasmo's pipelines in Liverpool Bay and elsewhere. The snag is not simply that access on non-commercial terms would be impossible given that other companies also own stakes in the infrastructure. Even if it were possible, enhanced profitability of Enterprise's developments would merely be matched by reduced profitability of Lasmo's infrastructure. Another Enterprise argument - that its expertise in three-dimensional surveys could be applied to Lasmo - is hardly better. Lasmo has been using 3-D technology for over a decade. That leaves Enterprise's criticism of Lasmo's slow development of its Indonesian interests as the company's most persuasive argument. But even here, the case is not clear-cut. Lasmo's Sanga Sanga concession is fairly mature and so unlikely to yield vast new treasures. Enterprise should reconsider its strategy of trying to join the big boys' game. An alternative would be to return to its roots as an exploration company by splitting itself into two. One half could contain most of its current production assets as well as group debt. This company would pay investors handsome dividends and gradually liquidate itself. The other half would focus on exploration and would offer investors the hope of capital gains. Enterprise once toyed with this idea. When reminded of it today, the company said it was only joking.</p>

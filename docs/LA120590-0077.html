			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> THOMAS KEEPING EMOTIONS IN CHECK;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: TALENTED JUNIOR RUNNING BACK SAVING LAST DANCE FOR WHAT HE HOPES WILL  BE A WALTZ BY QUARTZ HILL TO THE DIVISION I TITLE.  </P> <P> See Erik Thomas run. See Erik Thomas score. See Erik Thomas jog back to the  sideline, nothing more.  </P> <P> A touchdown by Thomas, the lead mustang in Quartz Hill High's Three Horsemen  backfield, apparently is no cause for celebration.  </P> <P> Twice last week in a Southern Section Division I semifinal against Mater Dei at  Orange Coast College, Thomas burst through the middle for 49-yard touchdown  runs. Twice he placed the ball in the end zone and trotted lightly back to his  teammates.  </P> <P> He gained 178 yards in 18 carries in Quartz Hill's 37-7 pasting of Mater Dei.  He gained 140 in the second half, maintaining a Rebel reign after intermission  that has been a hallmark of this year's team.  </P> <P> But don't expect Thomas to get worked up about all the fuss over a junior who  has gained 1,394 yards and scored 17 touchdowns in only 193 carries.  </P> <P> After all, there is work to be done.  </P> <P> "We can't celebrate," Thomas said. "Not yet."  </P> <P> Not yet? Not after the best record (11-2) in school history, a Golden League  title and a showdown with Loyola at Anaheim Stadium on Friday night for the  Division I championship?  </P> <P> A berth in the championship game is not enough for Thomas and the Rebels. They  want to win it.  </P> <P> There will be no pregame rallies for the Rebels. No school assemblies honoring  the players. Just the way Thomas won't bother with a touchdown dance.  </P> <P> Thomas' first touchdown run was impressive considering that the score was 17-7  at the time. After taking a pitch in the team's power I backfield early in the  third quarter, Thomas broke through a hole and found a corps of linebackers  waiting.  </P> <P> No problem. Head down, he bulled into one, shaking him off about 15 yards past  the line of scrimmage. One safety to beat. With a shift of the feet, Thomas  blew past him. Touchdown.  </P> <P> The second run required less strength but showcased his speed. Thomas has  clocked 4.3 seconds in the 40-yard dash. After taking a handoff, he ran right  past Mater Dei's team.  </P> <P> "Yeah, he's really coming around, isn't he?" Quartz Hill Coach John Albee said.  "If he has a big game Friday night, he could be up for All-CIF honors."  </P> <P> Usually, the Southern Section honors running backs with much more yardage. But  Thomas has gained nearly 1,400 yards among a trio that has amassed 2,857.  Thomas shares the ball with fellow running backs David Nelson (917 yards) and  Selves Smith (546 yards). Each is averaging more than seven yards a carry.  </P> <P> Thomas does not mind carving up the carries. In fact, the backs like to count  on one another for big plays.  </P> <P> "We admire each other," he said. "We say, 'Go Selves. It's your turn.' Or we  say, 'All right, David. Bust it. It's your turn.' "  </P> <P> This is one effective mutual admiration society: The trio has rushed for 39  touchdowns. Next year, Thomas will be the lone remaining star. Smith and  Nelson, both seniors, are being recruited by Division I colleges.  </P> <P> Thomas, who has moved out of a group foster home into the home of foster  parents Leonard and Sarah Thornton, expects to be getting bundles of mail from  schools himself.  </P> <P> Thomas has been spending time in the weight room, bulking up from 182 to 188  pounds this season. Instead of just blowing by tacklers, he is bowling them  over.  </P> <P> "He won't let just one guy bring him down," Albee said.  </P> <P> Nor will he let any kind of celebratory dance bog down his post-touchdown jog  to the sidelines.  </P> <P> At least not until after Friday night. One can assume that if Quartz Hill  claims the Division I title, Thomas and his teammates will allow themselves a  bit of a victory jig.  </P></p>

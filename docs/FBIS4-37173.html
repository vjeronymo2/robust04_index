			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] JANA's local affairs editor has said that the  African consensus expressed by the OAU was a clear and frank  support to the Great Jamahiriyah from 53 African countries.  [passage omitted]    These stances could then be considered as a consensus of the  majority of world countries in support of the Great  Jamahiriyah's position regarding a solution to its crisis with  Western states. These stances express the real will of the  international community and expose Western countries' stance  which use their domination of the UN Security Council to [word  indistinct] international resolutions and claim they express the  will of the international community.    The editor said that this international consensus, in  support  of the great Jamahiriyah and which calls for the lifting of the  unjust measures imposed on it by Western countries in the name  of the UN Security Council, once again exposed the truth of this  council and revealed the isolation in which these countries now  find themselves against the voices of the world's countries,  people, organizations, as well as political, cultural, and  prominent social figures who expressed their true stances in  support of the Great Jamahiriyah, not the stances fabricated in  their names in the so-called Security Council under threats and  blackmail from Western countries which dominate this Council.    Furthermore, the international community, embodied in these  countries and organizations, demand that the UN Security Council  acts with respect to the crisis between the Great Jamahiriyah  and Western countries, according to the provisions of the sixth  chapter of the UN Charter, because this is the right direction  toward finding a solution to this crisis and toward an end to be  put to the fallacy and the dilemma in which the council had  fallen when it acted according to Article 7 of the UN Charter,  an act that was a breach of this charter and an insult to the  conscience and values of the international community and a  falsification of its will.</p>

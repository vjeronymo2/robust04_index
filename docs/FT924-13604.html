			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Alcan turns in loss amid depressed prices ALCAN Aluminium reported a loss of USDollars 14m, or 6 cents a share, in the third quarter because of depressed ingot and fabricated products prices. A year earlier Alcan just about broke even after a 14 cents a share provision for restructuring charges. Until the persistent oversupply in primary metal is corrected, said Mr David Morton, chairman, 'there is not much room for any near-term improvement in prices'. The spot price for primary aluminium yesterday equalled about 52.7 US cents per lb or below Alcan's breakeven point. The price has fallen steadily from a summer peak of about 60 US cents. Third quarter revenues were USDollars 1.97bn, about unchanged from a year earlier. For the first nine months, Alcan's loss was USDollars 63m or 28 cents a share, against a loss of USDollars 15m, or 7 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of USDollars 5.8bn against USDollars 5.97bn. Fabricated products were 66 per cent of total third-quarter volume, up from 62 per cent a year earlier. Ingot shipments were lower. However Alcan was on target with cost-cutting at its primary smelters. Ingot production costs were USDollars 100 a tonne lower, year on year.</p>

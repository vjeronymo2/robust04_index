The defense minister, who was released from the Shaio clinic  yesterday, said Venezuela's decision to reinforce  counterinsurgency operations in the border area is appropriate.  The senior Colombian official said: "We agree with those  decisions and it seems to us very appropriate that they have  taken strong measures to control their side of the border area."  He reiterated that "there is absolutely no problem with the  Armed Forces. There is permanent coordination and communication  and we consult with each other on many of the decisions that  affect security along the border. There is total harmony in  this regard."    The minister said coordination also exists with the  Ecuadoran  authorities to stop violent actions.    The minister made his remarks after learning about the  Venezuelan Government decision to create a rural security  committee to reactivate the specific commando units and  vigorously deal with the activities of the Colombian guerrillas  in the border area, where 200 Venezuelan cattle ranchers have  been kidnapped.    Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda said that 1993 has been  a  good year for the Armed Forces and the National Police, because  results were achieved in many fields. The minister announced he  will return to work in three weeks and he has already begun to  keep abreast of the issues being handled by his office.</p>

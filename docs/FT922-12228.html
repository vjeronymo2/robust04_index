			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Russia eases monetary policy: State industry sector to be restructured as reforms enter new phase RUSSIAN economic reform is entering a new stage which will determine whether or not the country succeeds in creating a market economy. Monetary discipline will be relaxed in favour of an attempt to restructure the massive state industrial sector, and to allow the economy to grow again next year after four years of decline. Key ministers said in interviews with the FT that they are encouraged by what they see as a victory over attempts by the Russian Congress of Peoples' Deputies to destroy the reform process. But they have been constrained to modify their tight monetary policy, to expand credits and to loosen their targets on inflation. Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister in charge of reform, said: 'We cannot stand three more years of negative growth: one more year is possible, this year. In the longer term, the structural agony of this economy will create an impossible situation - and so we must start economic growth rather fast. We must get growth.' Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, met leaders of groups in the Congress yesterday and reportedly told them he would step down as head of the government and put forward the name of a new prime minister in three months. A senior government official said he expected the name to be that of Mr Gaidar. The specific elements of the second stage of reforms, after a first quarter dominated by efforts to squeeze spending and bring down the budget deficit, are: An acceptance that inflation will remain high. Mr Gaidar said that 'we hope to get it down to a rate of 3 per cent a month by the end of the year' - that is, about 40 per cent on an annual basis. However, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, chairman of the Russian Central Bank, said yesterday he would be content to see inflation coming down to 5 or 6 per cent a month from its present estimated level of some 30-40 per cent. A rejection of the aim to determine a new fixed exchange rate for the rouble in favour of a 'crawling peg' strategy. This would allow the rouble to decline against hard currencies in line with inflation differentials, starting from a range against the dollar which Mr Gaidar has suggested could be about 40-50. The Central Bank rate is presently 110 to the dollar, with the free market rate about 150. This would accommodate inflationary pressures, leaving the fight against inflation to domestic monetary instruments. The use of a mixture of the stick and carrot to restructure industry, where production has fallen in the first quarter by more than 13 per cent, according to government figures, and where inter-enterprise debt has ballooned to near Rbs900bn. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, said the Central Bank would make available Rbs200bn to the commercial banks for soft credits to industry. He would, however, also expect a Decree on Bankruptcy to be signed soon by Mr Yeltsin, and that 'if we had 10 or 15 bankruptcies, that would give a good possibility to change enterprise behaviour'. Mr Nechayev also said Rbs42bn will go in soft credits to help the conversion of defence enterprises, with a further Rbs40bn to pay social costs to workers of those enterprises where state orders for arms have been stopped. A continued determination to raise energy prices by the middle of this year, and to achieve parity with world energy prices - especially oil prices - by the end of 1993. The government said it had raised the price of petrol at the pumps from between Rbs1 and Rbs1.3 a litre to between Rbs5 and Rbs7 a litre. Both Mr Gaidar and Mr Nechayev said the intention to raise the price per tonne of oil to between Rbs2,000 and Rbs2,600 by the middle of this year was still on track. Mr Nechayev said the government was considering imposing high rates of tax - up to 95 per cent - on producers who increased prices above Rbs2,600. The target of zero budget deficit has been dropped in favour of an attempt to keep it below 5 per cent of gross national product over the rest of this year. Export quotas, increased because of the slump in domestic demand following the liberalisation of prices in January, are soon to be replaced by export tariffs. The quotas will be phased out by the end of the year, according to Mr Pyotr Aven, chairman of the Committee on Foreign External Relations. An import tax of 5-10 per cent is likely to be imposed this year. The tense relations between the government and the Russian Central Bank have been replaced by an uneasy consensus. This has seen the bank limit easy credits and raise its discount rate to 50 per cent. The government has also increasingly recognised the need, as Mr Gaidar put it, to 'remonetise' an economy in which many workers have not been paid for lack of cash. Admitting that the government had earlier hoped to replace the bank leadership, Mr Nechayev said: 'We don't fully believe in the top managers of the Central Bank, but if they resign now, it won't necessarily be better than if they stay.' Mr Yeltsin has prepared a resolution which may come before the Congress today, proposing that he, rather than the Russian parliament, appoint the Central Bank chairman 'with the agreement of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian federation'.

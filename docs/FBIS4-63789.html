			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sokhbet Mamedov report: "Baku Police Disperses Opposition </F> Rally and Arrests IZVESTIYA Correspondent"]    [Text] Baku -- According to various figures, between 200  and 500 participants in a rally in Baku received injuries of  varying degrees of seriousness and were taken to police stations.    This incident took place on the day of "Kurban Bayrama"  ("Festival of the Sacrifice"), observed throughout the Muslim  world. At the time when President Geydar Aliyev was greeting  people on the occasion of the holiday, the capital's arm of the  law was dispersing crowds of people trying to get onto the  central square. The police did not particularly stand on  ceremony -- citizens and even deputies were crammed into buses  and dispatched to interim detention centers.    The catalyst in the exacerbation of the already complex  relations between the authorities and the opposition forces in  Azerbaijan was the fact that Baku has agreed to the terms of a  truce in Karabakh and to having peacekeeping troops brought into  the republic. The republic's parliament refused to discuss this  problem. Deputies who demanded that this question be included  on the agenda were accused of trying to destabilize the  situation in the republic so as, subsequently, to take  advtantage of that in order to take power into their own hands.  Then the opposition adopted a decision to hold a rally.    The authorities ignored their opponents' opinions and  organized a persecution campaign against the leaders of the  People's Front and the "Musavat" and National Independence of  Azerbaijan parties. Extensive powers were given to the police,  who then more than justified the hopes pinned on them.    Having been a witness to the police beating one of the  participants in the rally, your IZVESTIYA correspondent turned  to an officer standing nearby. This proved to be enough for  them to put me in the bus and take me to the rayon police  station, keeping me there for over three hours. Since the  leadership of the police station was unable to give me an  intelligible answer as to why a journalist was arrested, and  consequently deprived of the possibility of carrying out his  professional duty, this question has been re-addressed to the  prosecutor's office of Nasiminskiy Rayon.</p>

The Gambian foreign minister, who brought the  mediation request from Gambian President Dawda Jawara, presented  the message to President Meles today. Foreign Minister Omar Sey  noted that President Jawara has asked President Meles, who is  popular with the countries' leaders, to convince Senegalese  leader Abdou Diouf to resolve the conflict between the two  countries.    It is said that Gambia is faced with an abrupt economic  crisis due to Senegal's recent closure of its three border  posts, blocking Gambian goods from entering Senegal. [passage  omitted]</p>

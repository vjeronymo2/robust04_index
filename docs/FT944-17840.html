			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Technology: Phone users box clever - A device that offers UK long-distance callers new choice and new services When Energis, the new UK long-distance phone company, launched its network last week it gave pride of place to two small boxes, one for residential consumers and the other for small businesses. These will make it easier for BT customers to switch to an alternative supplier as well as offering a range of services that Energis claims are new to the market. For residential customers there is an Energis Box, 14cm by 8.5cm. Like a personal computer modem, the cable from the box fits into a standard BT phone socket at one end and a standard telephone at the other. All long-distance calls made from the phone are automatically routed across the Energis network, while local calls continue to travel via BT. This makes Energis simpler to access than Mercury, although the new company concedes that Mercury remains cheaper for some calls. With Mercury, the standard modes of access for residential customers are a blue button phone or prefixing long-distance numbers with the code 132. The Energis box, however, can be fitted in seconds. For small businesses, Energis has a multiline box for customers taking at least four lines. This routes all national calls over the Energis network and records all telephone use. Customers receive a monthly report that lists not only outgoing calls, but also the time taken to answer the phone by hourly averages, and the number of calls lost. The multiline box is fitted by an Energis engineer. For customers with a branch exchange it will probably take the form of some software fitted directly on to the exchange. The telephone management report facility made available by the multiline box is a first as a standard phone service for the small business. It is likely to be of great value to organisations as they plan their phone management. A recent report by the Audit Commission, the public sector watchdog, indicated that local authorities had reduced the unanswered calls to less than half as a result of telephone monitoring reports. Many small businesses probably have no idea how many calls they are missing, let alone how long it takes them to answer the phone.</p>

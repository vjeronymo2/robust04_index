			<p>BFN     [Text] The Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, warned  yesterday that Australia would be expected to make further trade  concessions as the price of developing a possible formal trade  link with South-East Asia.    He said it was inevitable that there would be an entry price  if the Federal Government pursued a link between the Closer  Economic Relations [CER] agreement and the ASEAN Free Trade Area  [AFTA], even though Australia's general level of tariffs was  much lower than the ASEAN average.    "If we are to get some sort of agreement about an open  trading arrangement between ourselves, we can't expect that can  take place without Australia having to make any changes."    He said Australia would come to the negotiating table in a  strong position because of the tariff reductions and economic  opening that had taken place in Australia in the past decade,  but "we can't expect there would be no price".    Senator McMullan was launching a report by the Department of  Foreign Affairs and Trade [DFAT] East Asia Analytical Unit on  AFTA where he also announced that Australia would be discussing  a possible link with New Zealand officials next week.    The DFAT report, AFTA: Trading Bloc or Building  Block suggests ASEAN countries "would be keen to tap" the  politically sensitive textiles, clothing and footwear market.    A CER-AFTA link would provide the opportunity for ASEAN to  "influence and secure (tariff) reductions in areas like  textiles, clothing and footwear and motor vehicles."    The report notes that Australia's anti-dumping regime  "irritates" ASEAN countries.    Yesterday, Senator McMullan warned against moving too fast  towards a formal trade link and suggested that Australia and New  Zealand could first establish a dialogue with the AFTA countries  to exchange information. The ASEAN secretariat Economic  Research Bureau director, Dr Suthat Setbunsang, also said there  would be benefits in the AFTA countries learning more about CER  because it could provide a model for resolving many AFTA trade  issues.    The DFAT report also suggests CER "dialogue" with ASEAN as a  first step and ongoing encouragement for further trade  liberalisation within AFTA.</p>

The sixth party congress set forth the renovation policy and  created a turning point in socialist construction in our  country. The seventh congress evaluated the results of five  years of the renovation process for socioeconomic development  platform and strategy. It also put forth the orientations and  measures for conducting renovation in a far-reaching and uniform  manner.    The international situation has developed quickly and become  complicated since the seventh congress. Socialist regimes in  the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have collapsed. The  independence and sovereignty of a number of countries have been  challenged by policies based on power and imposition. Hostile  forces are stepping up activities in a bid to undermine our  people's national construction and defense. Once again, our  revolutionary undertaking is facing harsh challenges.    The international situation presents new opportunities,  however. The strength and determination to struggle for national  independence and sovereignty have been consolidated. The trends  of cooperation and development have prevailed in the world  community. Revolutionary forces have learned valuable lessons  from temporary setbacks. The success of our renovation policy  has further consolidated our people's strength and position,  thus creating conditions for us to overcome difficulties and  take advantage of good opportunities to serve national  construction.    Faced with new challenges and opportunities, our party and  people have adopted a firm political stance. The resolutions of  the party Central Committee's Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth  Plenums have concretized and further developed the line set  forth by the seventh congress, resolving a series of practical  problems on the domestic and diplomatic fronts based on actual  international developments and situations. We have persisted in  renovation, accelerated socioeconomic development, broadened  the process of democratization, firmly maintained political  stability, consolidated national defense and security  capabilities, diversified our diplomacy, and gradually overcome  the impact of a blockade and an embargo.    The National Party Conference has the duty to assess  implementation of the seventh party congress resolution and  evaluate the actual results of renovation since the sixth  congress. The objectives of this are to clarify further a  number of issues relating to socialist construction in our  country and define major policies and measures to implement the  seventh party congress resolution successfully and lead the  revolution in our country forward.  <H6>  PART ONE </H6>   The Situation on Implementing the Seventh Party  Congress Resolution.  I. Achievements  1. The great achievement of primary importance is our  success in overcoming the socioeconomic crisis to a very  important extent.    The crisis began in the late 1970's and early 1980's. It  lasted for many years and became most serious during 1986-88,  when inflation ran at a gallop. Another menacing challenge  occurred in 1991. Thanks, however, to the great efforts of our  party, state, and people, our economy not only held fast but  recorded outstanding achievements and tided us over sluggishness  and recession. Economic growth has remained very high and steady  for the past three years.    The inflation rate was cut from 67 percent in 1991 to 17.5  in 1992, and then to 5.2 in 1993. The GDP shows an average  annual increase of 7.2 percent, compared with the target of 5.5  to 6 percent set for the five-year period from 1991 to 1995.    Agricultural production has developed relatively  comprehensively. The food grain issue has been resolved  satisfactorily. Output of food grain in 1993 amounted to nearly  25 million tons, exceeding the target set for 1995. Industrial  production is growing at an average annual rate of 13 percent,  higher than the 8 to 10 percent target set in the five-year plan  for 1991-95. Productivity in a number of important sectors and  products -- electricity, crude oil, steel, and cement -- has  increased. The communications and liaison system has expanded  rapidly using new equipment and technology. Many sectors --  building, transport, trade, travel, and other services -- have  developed. The economy is undergoing structural changes. A  number of production and business sectors have emerged.    Foreign economic relations have expanded, becoming more  diversified and multilateral. We have overcome the unexpected  drop in trade with our traditional market, broadened our  exchanges with newer trade partners, and increased our annual  export volume by nearly 20 percent.    By the end of 1993, some 836 foreign investment projects had  been licensed, with a registered capital of $7.5 billion. We  have begun to attract more development aid and preferential  capital loans from various governments, and have normalized  relations with international financial and monetary institutions.    The economy has achieved some initial capital accumulation.  Although this is still small, a broad section of the population  has seen their lives improve. A multisector economy is taking  shape. State firms are beginning to be rearranged and  re-registered. Those with long histories of operational losses  have been reduced in large numbers, while the number of state  firms with effective operations has increased.    In general, the state economic sector is continuing to  develop. It controls key activities and is playing an essential  role in the economy. The sector's share of GDP increased from  34 percent in 1990 to 39.9 in 1992.    Agricultural cooperatives have developed much clearer  orientations for renovation since the party Central Committee's  fifth plenum. The autonomy of peasant households has been  affirmed. A number of new formats for economic cooperation have  emerged. The Land Act officially gave peasants rights to  long-term and stable use of land. This has helped the peasant  household-based economy gain momentum. Individual economies and  private capitalist economies have developed remarkably.  Share-holding and partnership enterprises, which are attracting  capital from various forms of ownership, have emerged in  increasingly large numbers.    The market system, under state management along socialist  lines, is becoming a driving mechanism in the economy.    The amendment of laws and continued renovation of various  systems and policies on planning, pricing, exchange rates,  finance, banking, labor, wages, and land have created a more  favorable environment for various firms to develop dynamism,  self-motivation, and a sense of responsibility in production and  business. The state has accumulated more experience and made  progress in the macromanagement of the economy.    Parallel to economic development, resolution of various  social issues and implementation of social welfare policies have  been given more attention.    Thanks to an increase in production and services, market  prices have become relatively stable and the lives of people in  various urban and rural areas have been improved. The number of  rich households has increased while the number of needy  households -- especially the number of underfed households --  has been reduced. Basic needs for food and clothing have been  met in a more satisfactory way. Construction of houses, roads,  electrical facilities, and health establishments has developed  in various rural and urban areas. Democratic rights --  especially economic democracy -- have developed gradually. The  people are free to work according to the law. They feel more  secure about putting their money into production and business,  and this has created more jobs.    Various policies -- tackling employment, eliminating hunger  and poverty, war invalids, families of fallen heroes, and people  who have performed meritorious deeds for the revolution;  providing assistance to disabled, helpless, and homeless people;  and the policy of helping needy students return to school --  have been carried out satisfactorily.    Educational activities have made some progress in fighting  degradation, diversifying various educational formats,  rearranging the school network, consolidating the system of  specialized schools and selective classes, and building general  education schools for ethnic minority students. The  popularization of education has begun to develop satisfactorily.  Vocational training and the study of foreign languages and  computer technology have developed in various cities.    Science and technology have started to develop as a driving  force. Scientific and technological studies have been linked  with social requirements. Many research and application projects  -- especially in agriculture, fisheries, consumer goods, and  export goods -- have developed practical value. They have  helped increase economic results and improve technological  knowledge. State-level scientific study programs have become  more centralized, and for the first time include programs on  social science and the humanities.    Cultural activities have become more lively. Exchanges with  foreign countries have expanded. Literary and artistic works  have become more copious in content and theme, and more  diversified in form, category, and means of expression. The  information system has developed with the expansion of radio and  television coverage to various districts throughout the country,  including a number of mountain areas and distant offshore  islands.    Health care activities have shown great progress in various  fields, such as preliminary care, expanded immunizations, and  the control of epidemics and social diseases. The requirements  for essential medicine have been partially met. Physical  education and sports have achieved encouraging results.    Population and family planning work has been carried out  correctly, leading to an increase in voluntary registrations for  the birth control program.    2. The second important achievement is the  continuation of political maintenance and consolidation.  Because of our success in many areas of renovation --  especially socioeconomic achievements, the party's skillful  leadership, and political awareness of the country's people and  soldiers -- we have survived the recent international political  shock. The party's leadership role has been strengthened, the  state's management efficiency has been heightened, democracy has  been broadened, and national defense and security have been  guaranteed. The people's confidence in the party, state, and  renovation undertaking has increased and public movements for  socioeconomic improvement have developed.    After the seventh congress, our party -- especially the  Central Committee, Political Bureau, and Secretariat --  accelerated party building, considering this to be of crucial  importance to the entire revolutionary cause in our country and  to our party. The third party plenum confirmed that economic  development is the central duty and party building is the  fundamental duty. It clarified conceptions on party building  when the party is a ruling party, and defined principles for  party organization and activities. It outlined the duties for  consolidating the unity and unification of the entire party. It  renovated and strengthened logical and ideological work and  consolidated the party organization.    After more than a year of party building, we have improved  and heightened our knowledge and responsibility toward party  committees and members. We have rearranged the party  organization and reestablished cadre committees to oversee party  committees and youth unions in state organs and mass  organizations. The function and role of grassroots party  organizations, together with their procedures and personnel  management regulations, have been established. Party principles  -- especially democratic centralism for the restoration of order  and principles -- have been executed. Party management and work  attitudes have been revamped in a more democratic, collective,  and appropriate manner to ensure close and efficient party  leadership and expand the positive role of state organs and mass  organizations.    We have concentrated more on training and admitting new  party  members. In 1992, admission of new members increased by 39  percent over 1991. In 1993, it increased by 30.7 percent over  1992.    The party has continuously renovated its thinking and paid  more attention to logical and ideological work. It has  clarified conceptions and principles for guiding renovation and  has gained more leadership experience. Party cadre have become  more mature and active, and have gradually grown accustomed to  leadership and management work in renovation.    Our social democracy has made significant strides over the  past two years, together with the construction of a law-governed  state of, by, and for the people. Most prominent was the  promulgation of the 1992 Constitution. That helped to  institutionalize rapidly the party's line on national  construction along socialist lines. Implementation of  constitutional stipulations in politics, the economy, culture,  education, industry, security and national defense, and the  citizen's fundamental rights and obligations -- together with  introducing many new legal documents and regulations -- have  further accelerated democratization in our social activities.    The fatherland fronts and mass organizations have  diversified  activities to broaden the national great unity, motivate the  public to carry out its political duties, accelerate social  activities, provide good care for the people, and protect their  interests.    Mass motivation has been given more attention by party  committees at different levels. Coordination between state  organs and the fatherland front and mass organizations has been  strengthened more than ever in motivating the public to take  part in law-building; planning national policy; formation of  local authorities; and the policy implementation relating to  socioeconomy, security, and national defense.    The armed forces, together with the public, have made many  efforts to accelerate renovation in national defense and  security, and in developing their own strengths. They have  executed their duty to protect the socialist fatherland;  guarantee political stabilization; and safeguard national  independence, sovereignty, and integrity satisfactorily.    We have successfully implemented the great strategic  adjustment in national defense, reduction in military personnel,  and the strengthening of universal defense. We have built  regional defense networks in provinces and cities, adjusted the  strategy for national security, revamped our military activities  in the new situation, gained better knowledge regarding the  current situation, and become more efficient in fighting the  activities of hostile forces.    3. The third achievement involves our diplomatic  activities. Vietnam's relations with foreign countries  have expanded and its prestige and position in the international  arena has been enhanced. This creates a favorable international  situation in which to build and defend the fatherland.    The seventh congress asserted Vietnam's foreign policy of  firmly maintaining peace, expanding relations of friendship and  cooperation, creating favorable international conditions for  national construction and defense, and positively contributing  to the world people's common struggle for peace, national  independence, democracy, and social progress.    The congress stressed Vietnam's broad-minded foreign policy  of befriending all countries in the world and struggling for  peace, independence, and progress.    The Central Committee's third plenum concretized and  seriously implemented this policy against the background of new  changes in the region and the world and following the seventh  national party congress.    We positively expanded diplomatic activities and recorded  very significant achievements. We restored normal relations  with the People's Republic of China and further developed  friendship and cooperation with them. We strengthened and  enhanced the special solidarity with the Lao People's Democratic  Republic. We cosigned the Paris Accord on Cambodia. We  struggled for its serious implementation, established friendly  and neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia, and  promoted and opened up a new stage of cooperation and friendship  with ASEAN and its organizations. We also expanded relations  with others in the Asia-Pacific Region and maintained and  developed existing relations of cooperation with the Russian  Federation, the states of the former Soviet Union, and East  Europe. We preserved and developed our traditional relations  with Cuba, India, and the DPRK; continued to support the  legitimate causes of Palestinians, Asians, and South Africans;  and expanded relations with developing countries in the Middle  East, Africa, and Latin America. We positively contributed to  consolidation and development of the Nonaligned Movement's role  in the new situation, and also improved relations with Western  and Northern European countries, the EC, Japan, Canada,  Australia, New Zealand, and a number of the newly  industrialized. We restored normal relations with international  financial and monetary organizations, and made progress in the  struggle to lift the U.S. embargo and for normalizing relations  with the United States.    II. Shortcomings and New Problems    1. Our economy still depends on agriculture, which is still  backward. Our industries are small, infrastructure is poorly  developed, material-technical bases are very few, accumulation  from the internal economy are minimal, and investment and  development are not great enough. Productivity and economic  results are low, although growth is acceptable. Our production  capability, developing for mobilization in the days ahead, is  not up to par. This will affect adversely economic growth in  the years to come. Our capability to curb inflation is not  consistent, while the budget deficit continues. Budget  overdrafts are high and foreign debt payments, which are due,  are too immense to be settled because our annual exports are  still minimal. Meanwhile, many sectors, localities, units, and  leading and managerial cadres are not firmly maintaining  awareness in practicing thrift and diligence, thereby causing  great losses to public property, while lavish spending is  prevalent.    It is necessary to say that our national and cooperative  economies slowly have developed and strengthened. Our national  economy has not satisfactorily assumed its active role in  production and circulation. The state-run business sector has  missed good chances to develop many important domains and areas,  and this has allowed a group of private traders to exploit these  opportunities and cause difficulties for both our producers and  consumers. We have not completely overcome obstacles in the  private economy. We have difficulties in production development  and experience a lack of good management and guidance.  Moreover, illegal trade is still prevalent.    We realize that our economic mechanism is at a nascent stage  with many spontaneously arising factors; our state management  capability is still low and optimally cannot develop the  strength of the market economic mechanism nor contain its many  negative sides. Our legal system is not complete, while its  implementation is not seriously carried out. Planning and  activities for financial and banking sectors are still poor and  are fraught with negative practices. The goods distribution  system is irrational and it is carried out in an arbitrary  fashion. The principle of distributing incomes in accordance  with labor has not been strictly observed.    2. In the cultural and social domains, many great and urgent  issues are still not resolved, although we have recorded some  achievements in these domains. Unemployment, especially for  youth of working age, is still the pressing issue and is one of  the fundamental factors causing negative practices in our  society.    Social policy is not implemented justly. Many people  legally amass wealth, but many others get rich quickly through  illegal business activities. At the same time, many families  who rendered meritorious service to the nation, sacrificed  lives, and suffered great loss during the wars are still facing  great hardship. The number of poor and starving people still  accounts for a significant part of the population. The people's  lives in many areas -- specially the highland, isolated, and  ethnic-inhabited areas -- are still destitute.    Education is inadequate in both quality and efficiency. Many  issues relating to curriculum and training methods have not been  defined to suit development requirements. Many schools are  degrading seriously. Laboratory and scientific research  equipment is scarce and outdated. Pedagogical schools and  teachers provide poor training and education service, which is  causing great public concern. Education management cadres at  all levels hardly are given proper training. Individual  education expenses are too high, which affects the education of  children from poor families.    Funding for scientific and technological research is higher  than before, but still too low to meet the demand. It is only  about 1 percent of the total state budget. Therefore, it must  be thinly spread to different areas. The result of this level  of funding is limited returns. Measures and regulations have  not been introduced to encourage economic enterprises to invest  in this field.    Different scientific groups have not been formed. The  organic relationship among scientific research establishments,  training institutions, and production units has not been  established. The import of foreign technologies has been poorly  managed and has led to the import of outdated technologies and  equipment at high prices. This causes long-term negative  effects for the nation.    The situation relating to culture and arts is causing great  concern. Running after money, unhealthy interests, bad habits,  and superstitions is on the increase. Poisonous and dangerous  cultural products are readily available in the market.  Incorrect tendencies -- such as the rejection of our  revolution's achievements and our revolutionary culture and  arts, the detachment of arts from the party's political line,  the tendency to commercialize the arts, and the spread of bad  foreign-influenced arts and debauched lifestyles -- are  appearing in creative, logical, and critical works. These  mistakes and incorrect conceptions were mentioned by the fourth  plenum of the seventh party Central Committee, but they are  slowly being rectified. Guidance by party organs and the state  management over the cultural and arts work is weak.    Our public health service is not meeting minimum  requirements  of society. Grassroots health care is weak. Hospitals are  ill-equipped and provide low standards of service and care. The  increase in population is still higher than 2.2 percent. This  obstructs socioeconomic development and improvements to life,  and affects the development of our race.    Despite many efforts to contain them, social vices are  tending to increase -- especially drug addiction, gambling,  prostitution, and robbery. Corruption and smuggling are  prevalent, raising public indignation, and greatly affecting the  people's confidence in the party and state.    3. The political situation is stable, but many complicated  factors which must not be overlooked still exist. Many party  and state organs have not been clean and strong. Political  security is not really firm. Social order and safety are not  safeguarded. The renovation line on party building has not been  satisfactorily implemented. The party mechanism is heavy and  bulky and its management and work attitudes slowly are being  renovated. Leadership quality and performance of many party  committees are still low. They are even sidestepping the party  line in some places.    Cadre-related work is a weak link. Cadres, generally  speaking, are not up to duties or requirements. In many places,  difficulties and embarrassment are experienced when able cadres  are needed for appointment to key leading positions. There are  not enough qualified cadres and leading specialists to take care  of party work, state management, production and business,  external economic relations, religion, ethnic communities, and  women-related work.    Planning, training, fostering, and assigment of cadres are  not performed well. Party committees are not giving proper  attention to checking the observation of party regulations,  lines, and policies. The reform of the state mechanism is slow  and lacks efficiency. Evil practices of authoritarianism,  oppression, vindictiveness, bureaucracy, and indiscipline are  prevalent in many places.    The fatherland fronts and mass organizations are still  facing  difficulties in work and methods. The number of cadres working  in mass organizations is not stable. They lack enthusiasm are  not given appropriate care, training, and benefits.    Confusion and lack of vigilance are still prevalent among  party cadres and people. They still have a low level of  awareness regarding sabotage plots and activities by hostile  forces, who always wish to scrap our party and socialism. Some  party cadres remain unconcerned in the face of wrong viewpoints  or activities aimed at stirring up social disorder. Others have  deviated seriously from the socialist path, or are even inclined  to choose another.    Ideological and theoretical work is still slow, not sharp  enough, lacks militancy, and is not able to respond convincingly  to newly emerging issues. Many party cadres, including core  leaders, are still sluggish in self-education. They do not try  to improve their character and understanding. Disunity among  cadres at some party organizations is also very serious.    III. Generalizations    Despite shortcomings we need to overcome, our past important  achievements are creating favorable conditions for the  country to advance gradually to a new development stage -- the  stage of industrialization and modernization. These  conditions consist of many elements of stature and trend,  material and spiritual, economic, political, social and  cultural, and domestic and foreign. The reality of past years  allows us to assert that the lines and main policies of our  party on renovation were correct and the steps taken  appropriate. The resolutions of the sixth and seventh party  congresses are being absorbed into the life of our people.    Reviewing the reality of renovation brings up many useful  lessons. It is necessary to determine that the first  experiences learned through the renovation process and pointed  out by the seventh party congress need to be developed and  applied to our current reality. Those were the lessons of  maintaining firmly the socialist path during renovation,  combining the determination of revolutionary principles and  strategies with flexibility in policies and sensibility to the  changes. There were also the lessons of the necessity to  renovate comprehensively and harmoniously, and to apply  appropriate steps, contents, and methodologies. Other lessons  learned were to safeguard firmly the party leadership role and  the state management in developing a multisector merchandise  economy and socialist democracy as well as the need for the  timely exposure and handling of problems, which arise during  renovation. We also need to pay appropriate attention to the  task of reviewing reality and continuously completing and  perfecting theories to build the socialist path.    Renovation is a difficult process, and one which is  unprecedented, but we have been bravely searching and learning,  and achieving important progress. The most basic, decisive  factor was the determination of our party to retain its  leadership position; to reject pluralism and a multiparty  system; to honor the spirit of independence, self-determination,  and innovation; and to follow correct lines and policies, which  are in good accordance with the rules and reality of Vietnam.  Our party has also been able to develop the total strength of  the great all-people solidarity block and expand international  cooperation.    The seventh party congress outlined six characteristics for  the socialist society our people are building. The congress  also pointed out seven basic directions to make these  characteristics a reality. This is the socialist direction that  the conferences of the seventh Central Committee materialized  into practical directives.    The building of socialism, however, is still new to us. It  requires from us massive energy to research, study, and  discover. We will be able to figure out more clearly the  socialist path for our country by continuously reviewing our  work and studying ideological theory. We will also be able to  figure out the concrete model for each domain of the economic,  political, and social and cultural fields. We have to encourage  innovation and development of Marxism-Leninism-Ho Chi Minh  Thought, especially Leninist thoughts, on a new economic policy  and the state-managed capitalism. This will help invent new  forms of transition and diversified intermediary steps suitable  for our concrete historical circumstances and which will help  our country advance firmly on the socialist path.  <H6>  PART TWO  Essential tasks to be carried out in the period ahead. </H6>   Lying ahead of our people are major challenges and  opportunities. These are:    -- The danger of being further left behind economically,  compared with many countries in the region and the world,  because we started from the lowest point and our growth rate is  not high and steady enough; we have also had to struggle upward  in a fiercely competitive environment.    -- The danger of straying from socialism if we fail to  abide by the implementation guidelines.    -- The scourge of corruption and other social ills.    -- The peaceful evolution-related schemes and actions of  hostile forces.    Yet, we also enjoy many fundamental advantages:    -- Our party has a correct policy line and is united and  single-minded.    -- Our people are diligent, intelligent, and patriotic.  They have good abilities and firm revolutionary willpower and  believe in the party leadership.    -- Our armed forces are absolutely loyal to the  revolutionary cause of our party and people.    -- The successes obtained in renovation are creating our  new posture and strengths.    -- The development of the scientific and technological  revolution and the trend toward broadening global and regional  ties of cooperation and development have brought us  opportunities for obtaining more important resources.    The general targets set forth by the Seventh Party Congress  up to 1995 will be to overcome difficulties and ordeals,  stabilize and develop socioeconomic activities, strengthen  political stability, dispel negativism and social injustices,  and basically tiding the country over the current crisis.    Over the past two and a half years, we have achieved a  significant part of that target, especially the economic ones.  For the remaining years of our office, we must motivate the  entire party, people, and army to be of the same heart and mind;  to exert extraordinary efforts; to uphold a sense of  independence, sovereignty, and self reliance; to broaden  international relations; to practice the motto of industry,  thrift, integrity and righteousness; to strive to exploit our  advantages; to dispel dangers; to overcome ordeals; and to  successfully achieve the general targets cited above. We must  quicken our pace to achieve the various aims of the strategy for  socioeconomic stability and development to the year 2000 to  build a powerful country, a prosperous people, and an equal and  civilized society.    The following are essential:    1. To press for changes in the economic structure  toward industrialization and modernization.    Socioeconomic improvements, together with the expansion and  strengthening of development cooperation with various countries  and international organizations, have allowed us to press ahead  with our national industrialization and modernization to create  more jobs, speed up economic growth, and further renovate the  people's material and spiritual life. This is a central task of  foremost importance for the period ahead.    Industrialization and modernization are the ways to avoid  the  danger of being further left behind compared with nearby  countries; to maintain political and social stability; and to  protect independence and sovereignty as well as the course of  socialist development.    At present, we have not followed the old pattern of  industrialization. We will not repeat the mistakes, hastiness,  and subjectiveness that the Sixth Party Congress has criticized.  Industrialization is in fact to build the material-technical  bases of socialism. This is not a simple question of increasing  the pace and proportion of industrial production in the economy.  Rather, it is a process of structural change linked with  radical technological renovation to build a foundation for rapid  growth and high and long-lasting efficiency for the entire  economy.    Industrialization must be accompanied by modernization and  this requires the combination of gradual steps of industrial  development with efforts to seize opportunities to shorten our  process and to form spearheads of development to catch up with  scientific and technological progress in the world.    The orientation, scale, and steps of industrialization and  modernization must be carefully thought out through a complete  understanding of the following important points:    -- The firm maintenance of independence and sovereignty must  go along with the broadening of international cooperation,  building an open-door economy both at home and abroad,  multilateral and diverse relations with other countries,  combining economic activities with national defense and  security, and linking economic growth with social progress and  social justice, and with cultural development and environmental  protection.    -- Persisting on the strategy of directing vigorous  efforts at exports while replacing imports that can be produced  locally.    -- Developing the comparative advantages of the entire  country as well as each area, sector, and domain in a given  period.    -- Constantly improving competitiveness in local,  regional, and international markets.    -- Taking socioeconomic results as a fundamental standard  for determining the course of development and for selecting  investment and technological projects.    -- Rapidly exploiting the strengths of the entire country,  of each region, and sector; appropriately gathering resources  for various fields of activity and key areas to promptly produce  high results while paying attention to meeting essential  requirements; working out practical policies, systems, and  measures for localities which have difficulties; stepping up  development cooperation; and ensuring that various regions and  strata of people can benefit from economic growth.    -- Attention must be paid to small- and medium-size  projects requiring small capital investments and capital that  can be recovered quickly in accordance with the motto of using  short-term projects to finance long-term ones.    -- Building a number of necessary, large-scale projects.    -- Making intensive capital investments to exploit to the  fullest our productivity and our existing technologies with an  emphasis on projects that affect product competitiveness.    -- Combining traditional technologies with modern  technologies, ensuring the advanced nature of imported equipment  and technologies, giving priority to technologies that need  small capital but which directly or indirectly create more jobs.    -- Until the end of this decade, great attention must be  paid to agricultural industrialization and to the rural economy.  We must carry out comprehensive agricultural, forestry, and  fishery development in conjunction with efforts to develop  processing industries for agricultural, forestry, and marine  products and for consumer goods manufacturing and exports.    -- Expanding trade, travel, and services in both urban and  rural areas and stepping up other overseas economic activities.    -- Renovating, expanding, upgrading, and selectively  building infrastructure facilities in the most difficult areas  where development is being hindered.    -- Selectively building heavy industry establishments in  important sectors where there are pressing requirements and in  which we have the capital, technologies, and marketplace to  achieve rapid development and high results.    -- Developing scientific and technological studies and  application, education and training, public health, and  environmental protection to meet immediate and long-term  development requirements.    While exploiting comparative advantages such as cheap labor,  resources, and a convenient location, we must study and read  regional and world development trends, the strategies and  policies of trading partners and rivals, and attempt to discover  new opportunities and comparative advantages. We must foster  and develop to the fullest our most decisive resource, namely,  the Vietnamese population, for long-term development and to  prepare the necessary conditions for development along this  course.    To carry out industrialization and modernization, we must  mobilize various sources of capital in conjunction with  effective efforts to manage our capital, with the domestic  source of capital being regarded as crucial and the foreign  source as important.    To ensure an average annual growth rate of not less than  eight percent, we must promptly increase the total amount of  investment to over 20 percent of the GDP within the next few  years. This must be higher in the ensuing years along with  efforts to improve efficiency of capital management. This  requires great efforts and appropriate policies to encourage the  entire society to practice thrift in production and consumption  and to concentrate on investing in production, especially in  material production.    Concentrated investment earmarked from the state budget is  decisive for the growth of the entire economy. It is necessary  to increase the sources of investment capital in targeted  projects by allocating a greater part of the GDP to the state  budget and by attracting all sources of aid and low interest  loans from various governments and international financial and  monetary organizations. We must audit, inspect, closely manage,  distribute and effectively use public assets, and must guard  against losses and wasteful spending.    The state's capital investment is designed mainly for  building the socioeconomic infrastructure and a number of key,  spearhead industrial establishments, and processing industries  for agricultural, forestry, and marine products, for the  manufacture of export goods, and to cater to export services.  Part of this must also be reserved for financing employment  projects and projects to reforest wastelands and bare hills and  expand aquaculture and deep sea fishing activities.    The state will only allocate capital to socioeconomic  infrastructure projects and to areas where capital is not likely  to be recovered. Credit loans invested by the government must  be returned by users.    We must renovate the managerial mechanism for capital  construction to prevent negativism, waste, and misappropriation  of state-owed capital, especially in project planning,  construction price estimates, and the assessment of work  performance. In this area, highly credible local and foreign  companies must be used to verify the quality and price of  imported equipment and materials and audit construction  projects. Every project must have a concrete owner. If it is a  project where capital must be recovered, it must be fully  recovered by the state on schedule.    We must fully exploit the savings and investment potential  of  the public as well as businesses in different economic sectors.  This must be done in different forms to ensure that all  potentialities are mobilized and that every cent invested yields  profit. We must gradually increase the proportion of this  source of capital within society's total capital investment.    In order to broaden the scope and improve the efficiency of  investment, we must supplement and perfect the necessary  macroeconomic policies.    First of all:    -- We must stabilize the macroeconomic environment,  consistently implement the policy on the multisectorial economy,  protect all forms of legal possession and business freedom, and  introduce an internal investment law and other necessary laws  and regulations to encourage and support efforts to develop  investment.    -- We must renew the national finance policy, satisfactorily  resolve the relationship between state finance and private  finance, and correctly balance the demand for increasing budget  revenues with the demand for self-investment by each business  sector and residential region to guarantee profits for investors  and create momentum for broadening business and production.    -- We must form and develop capital markets that consist  mainly of investment banks, commercial banks, finance and  insurance companies. We must continue to reform the banking  system according to the principles of the market mechanism and  international practice in order to mobilize sufficient capital,  provide credit efficiently, and meet the high demand for  development in the national economy. We must develop joint  stock companies; gradually broaden the issuance and circulation  of shares, credit notes, and bonds; and create conditions for a  stock market.    -- We must supplement and amend structures and policies to  observe strict regulations concerning the practice of frugality  in developing investment in all activities of the party,  government, Army, public security force, mass organizations,  business, and people.    -- We must create favorable conditions to attract additional  foreign capital and technology while simultaneously exploiting  internal resources. We must widely apply policies to attract  more foreign investment and set up regulations to define  responsibilities in obtaining and repaying foreign loans,  ensuring their proper use, and avoiding financial overcommitment.    We must start planning for different regions, beginning with  key areas, processing zones, special economic zones, and  industrial areas. We must outline investment projects and set  priorities for projects that need foreign investment. We must  ensure the scientific soundness of the deployment of important  projects, avoiding mistakes that might cause long-term effects.  And we must continue to improve the investment environment,  including laws, regulations, and working and living conditions  for foreign investors.    Encouragement of direct foreign investment must be part of a  uniform development strategy and management structure to ensure  state authority, control, and guidance over the socioeconomic  development process. State management structures must be  established over projects with foreign investment and those  completed and in operation. Together with increasing of  investment in different forms, we must increase our capital  contributions toward joint ventures with foreign countries.    The science and technology sector must concentrate its  research on quickly applying new findings to production and  business in order to serve industrialization and modernization.  It must meet the demands of new equipment in the national  economy, improve existing technologies, modernize traditional  technologies, and correctly adapt new ones. It must also help  to manage and closely assess imported technologies and pay  attention to the development of electronics, informatics,  biology, and new materials. Through practical renovation, it  must get close to real life, quickly discover and improve upon  the public's inventions, accelerate its studies, and clarify  issues relating to the strategy for industrialization and  modernization.    2. We must strive to implement the policy on  developing the multisectoral economy consistently and give  various economic components and business establishments more  headway to develop quickly and attain strong results.  Efforts must be made to strengthen and improve state-run  establishments to help them work effectively be active in the  economy. This is very important and urgent because it will help  encourage and support other economic sectors in their  development while accelerating rapid and long- lasting growth.  It is an apparatus with material strength that will help the  state regulate and lead the market economy to develop further in  accordance with the socialist orientation.    It is necessary for us to be able to distinguish the nature  of state ownership from that of state-run businesses. We must  realize that state assets and capital are used in various forms  to ensure strong socioeconomic results and enhance the state's  ability to accelerate and control economic activities.  Investment in state-run businesses should include those set up  with a 100-percent state capital and those with the majority of  shares held by the state, so as to allow the state to control  them effectively.    Efforts must be made to allocate land and forest areas to  the  people on a long-term basis, to give leases or provide  concessions for exploiting mines, to enter into joint ventures,  and to buy shares from enterprises in other sectors. We must  integrate efforts to strengthen state-run businesses in various  sectors, areas, and socioeconomic infrastructure projects; in  the financial, banking, and insurance establishments; and in a  number of key production and service units so as to help the  economy develop strongly. It is necessary to encourage other  economic components to participate in different forms and  degrees.    In carrying out these tasks, we can reduce the number of  inessential state-run businesses while consolidating, expanding,  and building new and essential state-run enterprises. We must  strive to strengthen and develop state-run businesses in  agriculture, forestry, and fishery to cooperate with other  business branches to build industrial and service centers,  especially for the processing industry; scientific-technological  centers; and cultural and social centers in localities  throughout the country.    We must strive to strengthen and improve the state-run trade  system; to control firmly the export-import business and the  trading of essential materials; to regulate wholesale and retail  trade; and, together with other sectors, to stabilize and  develop local markets. Efforts must be made to ensure smooth  transportation of goods, to serve and accelerate production  development, to protect the interests of producers and  consumers, and to make fundamental changes in organization and  management of state-run businesses to ensure autonomous  operation of businesses in the market economy while ensuring  effective state control.    Fundamental factors leading to ineffective operations,  negative practices, and waste at many state-run business  establishments are caused by our not having certain people who  act as direct owners of state assets and who take responsibility  for and protect the interests of state properties. We have no  attractive and firm motives to encourage personnel at state-run  enterprises to devote their energies to the development of their  establishments. We still lack the material and organizational  strength to define decisively various methods to curb corruption  and acts that inflict losses on public properties. We must find  ways to overcome these shortcomings.    To attract more capital, create a driving force to curb  negativism, and accelerate the profitability of state-run  businesses, we must introduce various forms of shareholding  enterprises in line with our production and business system and  with the majority of shares held by the state. Step by step, we  must apply the method of selling shares to enterprise personnel.  Efforts must be made to distribute profits to personnel based  on their base salary and their number of shares. We should  conduct a pilot project to sell a number of shares in state-run  businesses to private organizations and individuals.    On introducing a shareholding enterprise system, we will  stipulate the organization of management boards comprising  representatives of state shareholders, worker shareholders, and  other shareholders. Regulations and selection criteria to help  management boards select managing directors should be set up.  Various forms of work contracts with workers should be applied  in a widespread manner and be perfected continuously within  state enterprises. The state will support and encourage -- in  accordance with the development needs of the economy --  implementation and renovation of enterprise unions and general  corporations into the organization of business conglomerates,  thus avoiding intermediary authorities. The system of managing  ministries, managing authorities, and distinctions between  centrally- and locally-managed enterprises will be gradually  discarded.    State authorities at all levels and sectors should take care  of and assist state enterprises in their businesses, especially  in matters relating to capital, technology, marketing, and cadre  training and deployment. For enterprises that serve the  public's socioeconomic benefit but suffer low incomes or losses,  the state will have a reasonable relief policy that discourages  reliability. The state will have clear regulations on the  state's inspection authority and stop as hoc inspection and  control work, which is inconvenient to businesses. For state  enterprises that do business in inessential areas, suffer  extended losses, and lack the capacity to overcome these losses,  the resolute measures pointed out at the second plenum of the  seventh Central Committee should be applied.    We will continue to renovate the economic establishment of  cooperatives and develop the independent role of cooperative  members. The state supports, assists, and guides the  development of all cooperative economic establishments in  various economic sectors on a voluntary and mutually beneficial  basis. Management of cooperatives should be democratic and  should encourage combining the strength of the cooperative with  the strength of each household member.    The renovation of cooperatives and other cooperative  economic  establishments should be carried out in all sectors of  agriculture, forestry, and fishery in accordance with the  resolutions of the seventh Central Committee's fifth plenum.  Strict measures will be applied in handling the sluggish  cooperatives. Experimental renovation should continue in all  forms of cooperative economic establishments in handicrafts,  financial credit, trading, and services. Cooperatives can  function on a larger scale, can perform various types of  business, and are not restricted within any administrative  boundaries. Besides the capital contributed by members and the  assets of the cooperatives, capital and labor from outsiders  should be motivated. Members of cooperatives receive incomes  that are subject to contributed labor and shares. Cooperatives  can exercise any of the various levels of collectivity of  production supplies in accordance with the business necessity,  aspirations, and benefit of the members.    The individual and small business economic sector -- which  comprises mostly family business establishments -- is speedily  growing and possesses tremendous potential to become an  important element of the economy. We must have a policy to help  this sector in terms of capital, technology, market information,  and so forth in order to help their businesses become effective,  thus creating more employment and more opportunities for  individuals to contribute to national construction. We must  also guide and encourage individual business establishments to  join cooperative economic establishments gradually and on a  voluntary basis.    The private capital economic sector, both overseas and  domestic, is growing fast and making positive contributions to  national construction. The state continues to encourage private  capital economic activities in those sectors and areas allowed  by law. The state also protects the legal rights and benefits  of private businessmen, joins development and investment funds  with these businessmen on a consensus basis, and encourages them  to sell prioritized shares to their workers. The state helps  and guides them to overcome difficulties and do business  according to state laws and regulations. Concrete regulations  will be promulgated to stipulate the state's management role  toward business establishments with capital invested directly by  outsiders.    In combination with the state's inspection and control  functions, we need to develop grassroots organizations in the  party, trade unions, and politico-social mass organizations  within the private business enterprises and joint business  enterprises, either domestically or with overseas partners.  These grassroots organizations will contribute to productivity,  protect the legal benefits of workers, and prevent illegal  deeds. We should create conditions and a legal environment for  lawful competition activities and for developing collective  businesses on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis,  regardless of the disparity between these businesses in a sector  or locality.    Using the major state enterprises as the bases, we will form  business corporations with a significant ability to compete in  the domestic as well as the international market.    3. We must build a uniform market mechanism under  state management and in accordance with socialist  orientations.    Continued efforts must be made to build a new economic  structure, bearing in mind the need to persist in the transition  to the market mechanism while at the same time increasing the  efficiency of state management. Steps must be taken to perfect  apparatuses and policies to create the necessary conditions for  the market mechanism to operate effectively. It is necessary to  guarantee the right of autonomy of businessmen. Prices should  be set mainly by the market. Market indicators are very  important factors for allocating resources to production and  business establishments. It is important to adopt incentive  measures to encourage everyone to compete in a legitimate and  wholesome manner. Steps must be taken to limit monopoly.  Business people have the right to earn profits in a legitimate  way. The state only sets the prices of a small number of goods  and services bearing a particularly important socioeconomic  significance or having a highly exclusive nature. In any case,  prices must all be set within the limits of the market  mechanism. It is necessary to stabilize transportation costs  and the prices of electricity, water, fuel, and oil. Steps must  be taken to eliminate the system of providing subsidies for  losses. It is important to regulate income distribution in a  rational way and create conditions for expanding production  facilities and for reducing waste of resources. It is necessary  to abide by the principle of positive [laix duwowng] interests,  closely monitor the rate of inflation, and create favorable  conditions for both savings and loans. It is important to  regulate currency exchange rates in a satisfactory manner,  bearing in mind the need to see to it that the actual rates  remain relatively stable but not rigid and henceforth, help  promote exports and control imports. Plans must be worked out  to determine fees and wages in a rational manner. It is  necessary to formulate a selective subsidy policy for  agricultural and export products. Appropriate measures must be  taken to protect local products and the interests of both  producers and consumers. Uniform steps must be taken to form  various types of markets, products, services, labor resources,  capital, technology, real estate, and so forth.    It is necessary to step up state macromanagement to direct  and guide the overall performance of the national economy.  Efforts must be made to create an economic environment and  legal boundaries for production and business activities.  Measures must be taken to develop positive factors, prevent or  contain the adverse impact of spontaneous or negative actions,  and overcome the inherent shortcomings of the market mechanism.  Henceforth, these will cause the latter to become a really  important instrument for distributing and making better use of  all sources of strength as well as for distributing or  redistributing the national income to guarantee equilibrium  between revenue and spending, regulating the interests of the  various economic sectors and people of all walks of life,  meeting the growing demands of development, and ensuring social  justice.    The state macromanagement system must cover all areas of the  national economy and economic sectors instead of the state  business sector only. It is necessary to strengthen the  concentration and uniformity of government agencies when it  comes to exercising macroeconomic management. At the same, it  is necessary to increase the responsibilities and power of  sectors and localities in case they can work out better  solutions to the various problems involved.    It is necessary to guarantee the right to autonomy of  business establishments. Special ministerial agencies should  devote efforts to carry out their functions as development  project planners for economic and technological sectors under  their charge satisfactorily. They should also provide  direction, assistance, and supervision for operations of  business establishments belonging to different economic sectors  and in different areas of activity as specified under their  state management functions. It is important to strengthen the  role of interministerial agencies in overseeing the overall  performance of all sectors and areas of operations, thus putting  all socioeconomic activities under the state's effective  macromanagement system.    Administrative organs at all levels should perform their  state management functions in areas under their charge by  overseeing the operations of business establishments belonging  to different economic sectors, bearing in mind the need not to  distinguish between central and local economic organizations.    Steps must be taken to perfect the legal system to ensure  strict observance of rules and regulations. Efforts must be  made to consolidate and strengthen the advisory role of planning  agencies so the latter can formulate good plans and projects to  serve development goals, calculate and maintain a balanced  macromanagement system, adjust investment structures, effect  economic restructuring, and serve as a venue for coordinating  efforts to tap all sources of strength at home and abroad and  make effective use of them to realize socioeconomic development  goals.    We must continue to reform the financial and monetary  system fundamentally and comprehensively, while satisfactorily  promoting economic activities to increase investment and  development. We must strive to ensure uniform management of the  national financial system, savings, and expenditure; and improve  the financial work of the state, enterprises, and population.  Efforts should be made to improve budget management at the  central and local levels to ensure sufficient allotments for  normal expenditure, investment development, and national  defense. We must mobilize capital at home and abroad, strive to  meet immediate requirements, practice thrift, and promote  investment development for long-term interest.    We must encourage state-run enterprises to carry out  autonomous financial management under the close supervision and  control of the state.    We must strive to keep the budget deficit at less than 5  percent of GDP, make great efforts to increase state revenue to  pay for expenditures, refrain from issuing banknotes to resolve  the budget deficit, and strive to balance income and  expenditures. Efforts must be made to reform the accounting  system and improve auditing in the state and private sectors.    The central state bank must formulate and implement the  monetary policy to ensure the effective allotment, transfer, and  remittance of money; curb inflation; coordinate with financial,  trade, and price agencies to maintain an average annual price  increase in the single digits only; and strive to balance  international debt while increasing foreign currency reserves.  The financial and banking sectors must satisfactorily carry out  their functions of establishing funds, effectively use and  provide credits, and strive to meet the requirements of economic  development. This is to maintain their role as a center for the  settlement and circulation of money within society. They must  strive to improve the foreign currency management mechanism to  create conditions for the Vietnamese dong to be effectively  circulated and become the sole currency for the settlement of  debt nationwide.    4. Measures to resolve cultural and social issues.    Our party and state's guiding thought in carrying out  cultural and social work is to care for, foster, and develop the  human factor to create a driving force for revolutionary  objectives. Efforts must be made to resolve various current  issues and ensure social justice, enhance the people's  intellect, promote a healthy atmosphere in society, and protect  and develop our national cultural traits. In order to create  sufficient jobs for workers in an effective way, the state and  people must save money for investment development while  satisfactorily implementing the socioeconomic strategy. They  must encourage all economic components, citizens, and investors  at home and abroad to expand branches and occupations to create  more jobs for the laborers and reduce the number of unemployed  workers, expand foreign trade, and promote the export of  laborers. Efforts must be made to organize vocational training  for youths to enhance their professional skills. For personnel  and workers laid off by administrative agencies and economic  units, we must reorganize them and provide vocational training  as well as loans to help them become involved in production and  business or find other jobs, while striving to set up  consultative agencies to introduce new jobs.    We must formulate laws to protect the legitimate interests  of  both employees and employers at private capitalist business  establishments. The laws on labor, wages, insurance, and taxes  have been and will be promulgated in accordance with investment  promotion, the elimination of social injustice, and opposition  to illegal businesses. The statutes, regulations, and  discipline for workers formulated by business establishments  must not violate state laws.    It is necessary to say that the economic growth rate should  be parallel to social progress and justice at each stage of  development. Social justice should cover areas such as the  distribution of the means of production, income in accordance  with results in production, and equal opportunity for each  member of the production force to develop his ability. We must  implement the principle of distributing more income to those who  work and contribute more and vice versa, while striving to  oppose mediocrity and dependence on others. We must ensure that  income is distributed in accordance with labor. We must  encourage and treat competent and capable workers appropriately,  and ensure a fair income for investment projects, especially in  production and business. We should encourage the people to  amass wealth through honest means, while fighting poverty and  hunger; motivate the rich to participate in economic  development; formulate rational policies to promote credit,  taxation, and vocational training in order to create conditions  for the poor to be able to progress and earn enough to become  rich. Various former wealthy areas should, together with the  state, assist poor and underdeveloped areas. We must mobilize  rich people to contribute to helping the poor by providing  loans, equipment, and materials and transferring experience and  work methods. We should set up funds to repay those who have  rendered meritorious service to the state; formulate appropriate  policies for the rich; and mobilize business enterprises and  private organizations to participate in humanitarian and  charitable activities to help the victims of war and natural  calamities, as well as the disabled, the elderly, and the  homeless who can no longer work.    The responsibility of each citizen in solving individual  and family problems should be heightened. At the same time, the  common sharing of responsibilities in society in general should  be intensified to develop our people's humanitarian tradition.    The goals and measures set forth in the resolution of the  seventh party Central Committee's fourth plenum regarding  education and training, culture, the arts, public health care,  and population and family planning work must be continued, so  that in a few years significant achievements can be recorded in  our education service, thereby helping the education service  fulfill its role in upgrading the people's mental abilities,  creating the people's labor force, and improving the people's  skills.    First, compulsory elementary education must be implemented.  If possible, universal secondary education should be introduced  in some localities. Policies to exempt and reduce school fees  and provide suitable financial assistance must be applied to  guarantee the education of children from poor families,  especially those living in isolated, high altitude, and former  revolutionary base areas.    Existing ethnic boarding schools must be consolidated and  additional ones must be built. We must reorganize the  vocational training system, upgrade the service provided by  teachers' colleges, and rearrange the tertiary education system  by linking academic training with vocational skills, study with  practice, and training and research with production.    National university centers must be built with improved  goals, curricula, and education methods to meet national  development requirements. Planning for fostering and retraining  the contingent of teachers must be established, policies to  grant appropriate rewards to teachers must be introduced, and  state management of the education and training service must be  strengthened.    Steps must be taken to build a modern culture, but one that  is imbued with national traits. Educational activities must be  organized to make everyone aware of the need to adopt a morally  correct lifestyle and culturally appropriate behavior. Efforts  to develop national culture must be linked with endeavors to  promote cultural exchanges with foreign countries, bearing in  mind the need to preserve and develop national traits while  simultaneously learning from the cultural quintessence of other  countries. Resolute measures must be taken against all acts of  violence and miscellaneous cultural practices that are immoral  or culturally unfit and contrary to human nature. Along with  inheriting and carrying on the traditions of human compassion,  mutual love and assistance, and other fine customs, efforts must  be made to eliminate outdated practices, superstitions, and  other social vices.    Steps must be taken to improve the quality of and guarantee  democracy and freedom for cultural and artistic activities. At  the same time, it is necessary to uphold the sense of  responsibility of writers and artists toward the nation and  people. Plans must be worked out to cultivate talent and  encourage writers and artists to produce wholesome works with a  high ideological and artistic value. Efforts must be made to  turn out fine works to serve the goals of national renovation.  It is necessary to take positive factors into account while  simultaneously adopting resolute measures to deal with negative  phenomena, erratic tendencies, and hostile arguments or  maneuvers. It is important to promote nonprofessional cultural  activities and accelerate the mass movement for cultural  activities at the grassroots level. Steps must be taken to  strengthen the mass media to disseminate lines, policies, and  laws in a timely manner so as to make everyone understand  cultural, literary, and artistic values and appreciate things  that are genuine, good, and beautiful. Plans must be worked out  to contain the venom of bad cultural practices and reactionary  or decadent printed materials.    It is important to strengthen the party's leadership; revamp  the state management mechanism and enhance the efficiency of its  control over cultural and artistic activities; and supplement  necessary policies and laws and see that they are strictly  enforced.    Due efforts must be made to look after the people's health,  bearing in mind the need to give first priority to primary  health care and take positive measures to fight disease. Plans  must be worked out to restore, consolidate, and expand  grassroots medical facilities in populated areas as well as set  up mobile medical teams in those localities where dispensaries  are nonexistent. Steps must be taken to upgrade hospitals and  provide them with better equipment. Plans must be worked out to  build a number of major medical centers and special medical  facilities. Adequate measures are needed to implement the  medical insurance program and apply the policy on hospital fee  exemptions or reductions to social welfare recipients and needy  people. It is necessary to stop malnutrition, malaria, goiter,  and leprosy in children. It is imperative to try every possible  means to contain drug addiction, prostitution, and AIDS.  Effective measures must be adopted to ensure that within the  next few years we will be able to reduce the country's average  population growth rate to less than 2 percent, with first  priority being given to localities with high population growth  rates.    Efforts must be made to develop a large-scale movement for  physical education and sports activities among people  nationwide, especially among youths and students, and take steps  to form special physical education and sports organizations and  encourage athletes to break their own records.    The struggle against corruption constitutes a burning and  pressing current task. Resolute and full measures must be taken  to launch an anticorruption campaign in the entire working  apparatus, at all echelons, and in all sectors from the central  down to the grassroots organizations. The following key  measures must be applied uniformly:    -- It is necessary to review, amend, or supplement  mechanisms, policies, laws, and procedures governing the  activities of state agencies and government employees. It is  important to try every means to overcome loopholes in the  management system and clearly define the responsibilities of  those in charge of state property protection, utilization, and  development. This will help to discover and deal with  corruption cases quickly.    Efforts must be made to renovate and consolidate financial  management and bookkeeping. It is necessary to make full use of  consultancy, assessment, and auditing services.    It is important to streamline the mechanism, cut unnecessary  expenditures, and guarantee sufficient salaries for wage earners.    -- Consolidate education and training for cadres and party  members to heighten their revolutionary morality. Leaders of  sectors, localities, and agencies have to bear the  responsibility for corruption within their respective areas.  The responsibility of leaders in grassroots party organizations  should be enhanced, and party members and the masses should be  actively motivated to fight corruption.    -- Strictly carry out inspection, investigation, and  supervision by agencies in charge and by mass organizations, so  that corruption can be detected early. Defendants in corruption  cases, especially in serious ones, should be handled in a timely  and strict manner in accordance with state laws, regardless of  the defendant's position or rank.    In the fight against social ills, coordination between the  suppression and prevention of crimes must be heightened. The  focus should always be on prevention, and a national program on  crime prevention should be set up with an adequate budget.  Sanctions and punishment stipulated by state laws should be  strictly followed in association with an active education  program, including both occupational training and production  labor, coupled with improvement of detention and re-education  facilities, in order to rebuild the defendants and give them  opportunities to rebuild an honest life. We should prevent and  punish all forms of mistreatment of prison inmates.    5. National defense and security.    While carrying out national construction, we must never  neglect the important task of safeguarding our fatherland,  independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, national  security, socio-political stability, and our determination to  protect socialism.    We need to thoroughly understand and properly carry out our  national defense and security duties and stick firmly to the  guiding viewpoint set up by the party Central Committee's third  plenum. We have to motivate a comprehensive and universal  movement to defeat all "peaceful evolution" schemes and  activities and subversive violence.    In the next few years, we have to carry out following  successfully:    -- Heighten revolutionary vigilance, intensify political and  national defense movements, and cohesively combine the people's  security task with the national defense task.    -- Build steadfast defense areas and the people's  security; and intensify defense forces in major areas in order  to safeguard firmly territorial integrity, sovereignty, and  national security.    -- Safeguard firmly internal security, the party, and the  state; and quickly detect and suppress all sabotage activities.    -- Strengthen state management in social order and  suppression of crimes; build up a people's movement to safeguard  national security, social safety, and order.    -- Build the people's army and the people's security  forces politically, ideologically, and organizationally.  Maintain all technical equipment well and make an effort to  attain the gradual modernization of major equipment. Increase  investment in national defense industries. Improve the cultural  and physical life of the troops to ensure a strong people's  armed force that can fulfill its tasks effectively.    -- Strengthen the party's leadership role and the state's  management role in national defense and security; bring into  reality all state lines and policies regarding national defense  and security; and quickly organize, consolidate, or improve the  quality of agencies and cadres in charge of helping other  sectors and echelons carry out national defense and security  tasks. The Ministries of National Defense and the Interior  should perform their management role in national defense and  security well in accordance with their assigned authority and  responsibilities.    -- Perfect legal documents regarding national defense  (laws on national defense and security, borders, and the sea;  the supplementary law on military service; and other laws and  regulations), and ensure the effective implementation of these  laws.    6. Continuing to broaden external relations.    To expand our foreign affairs achievements even further, we  must continue our policy of independence, self-determination,  open doors, diversification, and multilateralization. We must  strive to increase unanimity; limit disagreement; create  favorable conditions for our national construction and  protection; and contribute to the common struggle of the world  population for peace, national independence, democracy, and  social progress.    We must broaden our friendship and cooperation with all  nations on the principle of equality; mutual benefit; peaceful  coexistence; respect for one another's independence,  sovereignty, and national integrity; and settlement of  disagreements through negotiations to ensure stability,  security, and development.    We must increase relations with international organizations  and positively partake in world activities to protect the  environment, fight dangerous diseases, eliminate poverty and  starvation...    The external activities of the party and people must be  broadened to win the wide support of world organizations and  people for our national construction and protection undertaking.    We must clearly realize our difficulties and challenges as  well as advantages and opportunities, and closely follow  complicated changes in the world in order to apply suitable  policies. These must be in conformity with our principles but  also be flexible and active. We must strengthen party  leadership and state management and sufficiently coordinate with  all sectors in our external relations. We must pay attention to  providing education and training for more cadres with good  qualification and abilities.    7. Building a Vietnamese Government of, by, and for the  people.    We must build and gradually perfect a Vietnamese Government  that is governed by law; that is, a government of, by, and for  the people. It should govern all aspects of social life  according to law and lead the country toward development under  the socialist direction. A law-governed Vietnamese Government  should be built on the foundations of strengthening and  broadening the people's unity and based on the  worker-peasant-intellectual alliance under the party's  leadership.    Implementing a socialist democracy and expanding the  people's  right to mastery are the first duties and the fine nature of our  government. We must follow President Ho Chi Minh's instruction:  "Government organs from the central level down to the villages  should serve the people. That means carrying out the people's  common work, not oppressing the people." The government must be  closely linked with the people, must respect and listen to their  opinions, and must be under their supervision. It must  resolutely fight against bureaucratism, authoritarianism,  corruption, waste, and special privileges and benefits.    We must protect the people's rights and the basic rights of  citizens as stipulated in the Constitution, such as the right to  possessions, the right to use production equipment, the right to  legal trading, the right to freedom of discussion and expression  of opinions for national construction, and the right to freedom  of religion and non-religion.    We must promptly examine and settle complaints and  accusations lodged by the public. We must create opportunities  for the people to contribute to the national work and offer  opinions regarding construction of the party's lines and  policies and the state's important bills. We must improve  elections, and through elections, we must elect able people with  good morals as people's deputies as well as place them in state  mechanisms.    We must restore social order and discipline, oppose any  manifestations of extreme democracy, and implement dictatorship  over elements who carry out activities against the fatherland  and the people's interests.    We must accelerate and heighten the quality of law-building  work to build a uniform legal system and institutionalize the  party's renovation line in all aspects of social life.  Education on the law must be strengthened to improve legal  knowledge, law-abiding consciousness, and the people's respect  for the Constitution and law in their work and social lives. We  must ensure that the law is carried out in a correct, uniform,  and just manner.    We must continue to improve and reform the state mechanism  and ensure the unity of power. We must clearly define and  expand the power of the administration, legislature, and  judiciary. And we must work according to the principle of  democratic centralism.    The National Assembly's work quality must be heightened so  that it can perform its legislation and supervision functions  better. The number of National Assembly deputies working in  specialized areas must be increased.    We must reform and strengthen the administrative system's  organization, personnel, and working structure. The  administration's management role must be developed. The role  and responsibilities of local authorities must be defined on the  basis of the law and the guidance of the central government.    We must continue to strengthen and reform the judicial  system. The power of different judicial organs must be correctly  defined. We must gradually establish new judicial organs to meet  new demands arising from socioeconomic development and ensure  fair trials for all law violations.    We must set up civil service regulations and public work  responsibilities and retrain government cadres and officials to  ensure uniformity in the administration.    8. Renovating and reorganizing the party and  strengthening the relationship between it and the people.    We must continue to understand concepts thoroughly and  implement the lines and measures set forth by the party third  plenum. We must concentrate on political and ideological work  to ensure political and ideological unity in the entire party.  Cadres and party members must be given regular training on the  party's concepts and lines to upgrade their knowledge; confirm  their commitment in the socialist path; and help them creatively  apply and develop Maxism-Lenininsm, Ho Chi Minh Thought, and the  advanced ideas of our times and grasp the new thinking to  resolve problems that arise from real situations correctly.    Ideological work must first concentrate on pressing problems  that need to be dealt with quickly. Through practical research  and review, problems arising from the renovation process must be  scientifically clarified together with measures to solve them.  Mistaken concepts and vague and unsure ideologies must be  corrected. We must fight all opportunistic, rightist, dogmatic,  and conservative manifestations.    Party cadres and members must strictly observe party  resolutions and directives and state laws. They must not  disseminate concepts that contradict the party's line.    Party unity and unification must be strengthened. Principles  related to party organization and activity -- foremost, the  principle of democratic centralism and the principle of  collective leadership and individual responsibility -- must be  implemented.    Revolutionary morality and healthy lifestyles must be  maintained to fight waste, corruption, and illegal businesses.  We must fight personalism, lack of discipline, arbitrariness,  authoritarianism, parochialism, and clannishness.    Party protection work and the work to ensure internal and  national secrecy must be given particular attention. All  conspiracies and tricks to degenerate party cadres must be  eliminated. Control over the implementation of the party's  lines, policies, and regulations must be strengthened.    The national unity block must be broadened, and the close  relationship between the party and the public must be  consolidated. Uncle Ho's thoughts must be promulgated to broadly  unite the Vietnamese people in supporting the renovation cause  for national independence and striving to extricate ourselves  from poverty and backwardness in order to surge forward toward  the goal of a rich population, a strong nation, and a just and  civilized society.    We must consider the national interests as our common goal.  At the same time, we accept different viewpoints as long as  they do not run counter to the national interests. We should  eliminate obsessions and hatreds and look forward to the future.  The ideology of unity must be manifested in all state guidance,  policies, and laws.    We must perfect policies to guarantee the interests and  roles  of the workers, peasants, and intelligencia. Women and youth  must be fostered and developed. The party and state policies  regarding ethnic and religious people, industrialists,  businessmen, and the overseas Vietnamese community must be  supplemented and satisfactorily implemented.    Party echelons and committees must hold study workshops  before implementing party Central Committee and Political Bureau  resolutions on work relating to fatherland fronts and mass  organizations. We have to set up mechanisms to coordinate the  activities of state organs and mass organizations. The work  content, method, and attitude of the fatherland fronts and mass  organizations must be revamped.    We have to reform cadre-related work. First, we must renew  the concepts and methods of our cadre-related work in assessing,  selecting, employing, and deploying; especially key cadres.  Gifted people must be trained, fostered, and employed. We have  to create favorable conditions for good people -- both inside  and outside of the party and inside and outside of the country  -- to contribute their best efforts for the nation.    The contingent of cadres must be rejuvenated. Woman and  ethnic cadres must be given special attention. We must fight  narrow-mindedness, parochialism, prejudice, and discrimination.  The evaluation, choice, and assignment of leading cadres at all  levels must follow fundamental standards outlined in the third  Central Committee plenum resolution. We must pay particular  attention to their political knowledge, determination regarding  the party's goals and ideals, and morality and lifestyle to  ensure that they always exercise diligence, practice frugality,  instill honesty, and uphold righteousness. They must not be  corrupt; they must be determined to fight corruption. They must  be aware of organization and discipline, stay close to the  masses, and obtain a capacity and quality on par with their  duties.    We will bring about the democratization of party member  work. Evaluation of cadres must be done collectively by the  party committee directly managing the cadres, together with  relevant agencies. It must be done in accordance with the  proper process in a democratic, conscientious, and fair manner.  Every cadre has the right to be informed and to give opinions  on their evaluation by the party committee and agency leaders.    All party organizations will reorganize and reevaluate the  existing contingent of cadres. Based on this evaluation, they  will make plans for party member work from now until the year  2000. This will correspond to the requirements for the  quantity, quality, and structure of cadres.    We will provide training to cadres according to plan. The  training content must be specific for each task and requirement  of each position concerned. Renovation must be carried out in  both teaching and studying methods, while adequate funds must be  provided for the training. Party members -- especially cadres  at all levels -- must regularly study, enrich their knowledge,  heighten their level of understanding, and improve their  revolutionary characteristics.    We must urgently prepare the human force for the eighth  party  congress and subsequent years. We have to improve the policies  and awards for cadres, renovate our thinking, heighten the  scientific characteristic of the organization task, and continue  to overhaul the organization system to guarantee a light and  effective party mechanism with high efficiency.    We have to boost research on organizational models and  discern the party's function, duty, and leadership style in  every sector and echelon. From there, we must set up plans to  perfect the organization and rationalize the mechanisms of the  party, state, and other organizations.    We will renovate the party's leadership model. Our party is  a ruling party that sets policies and lines for national  construction and protection. The successful implementation of  party policies and lines requires us to grasp firmly the  organization and cadre work. The party takes the lead in  applying the principle of democratic centralism and the  principle of collective leadership with individual  responsibility. The leadership task is fulfilled through the  party organization, not through individual party cadres. The  leader executes collective decisions, follows up on and guides  the implementation, encourages good deeds, and corrects  deviations to develop the role and efficacy of the state, not  replace it.    We must heighten the militancy of party members regarding  the  consolidation of grassroots party organizations. Political  determination and loyalty to the party's ideals, the working  people's interests, and the interests of the people as a whole  are essential characteristics for a party member. Party  regulations clearly stipulate the criteria and duties of a party  member. Every member must abide by these regulations and serve  as a model in striving to become an excellent worker, cadre, or  manager who fulfills all assigned tasks, studies regularly to  improve their knowledge and work ability, respects  organizational discipline, fosters party unity, and strictly  obeys state laws.    We have to handle degenerate and deviant party members in a  timely and strict manner, as well as those who breach party  discipline and state laws. We will continue to expel from our  party those who are no longer eligible for membership. We must  perform the party development task well, especially among youth  and women and in organizations where grassroots party  organizations do not exist or have few members.    We will rejuvenate the party contingent. On the occasions of  the party's 65th anniversary and other important festivities in  1994, we will launch education and training campaigns regarding  party development -- with particular attention focused on youth  -- in preparation for the eighth party congress.    A new era is before us, full of promising potential,  challenges that we are determined to overcome, and favorable  opportunities we must exploit. Our entire party, Army, and  people must stick together, remain unified in the struggle to  implement the seventh party congress resolution successfully,  and bring the renovation undertaking forward with ever greater  victories.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa keeps up improvement with 51% rise Lufthansa, the German national airline, continued its much improved financial performance this year, lifting pre-tax profits by 51 per cent in the third quarter to DM220m (Dollars 143.79m). The airline said it expected to break even in the fourth quarter. For the whole year, it expects to make a profit and pay a dividend for the first time in five years. Shareholders last received a DM4 payment per share in 1989. The company said that in the first nine months, it made a pre-tax profit of DM325m, compared with a loss of DM76m in the same period of 1993. Group cash flow would total DM2.2bn this year, it added, with total investments at DM1.8bn. It gave no comparative figures. Revenues from flight operations were 8 per cent higher in the first nine months at DM10.6bn, with total revenues 7.5 per cent higher at nearly DM12bn. Passenger numbers were 28.4m, a rise of 4.7 per cent, with sales in terms of tonne-kilometres 8.8 per cent higher. Cargo business in the nine months rose by 20 per cent and the overall load factor by 1.8 percentage points to 70.4 per cent. The airline, which recently signed a partnership deal with Thai Airways International covering both cargo and passengers, had posted its first profit for five years in the first half of this year; pre-tax profits totalled DM105m, against a DM221m loss in the corresponding period of 1993. Last month, the government yielded control of the airline by not taking up its entitlement in a rights issue. The shares were sold to investors in Germany and abroad to raise more than DM1bn. It has also decided to spin off its cargo, maintenance and information technology services into independent profit centres to continue the streamlining begun several years ago.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (25): Art for art's sake ART &amp; BUSINESS by Marjory Jacobson Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 32 224 pages 330 illustrations A visitor to the First Bank of Minneapolis in the 1980s might have found himself (or herself) in Controversy Corridor. This is where the art from the corporate collection was exiled if six or more of the staff found it distasteful. But, to stimulate thought, the iconoclasts had to justify its removal from their area. Dennis Evans took over as president of the Bank just when de-regulation was churning up the US banking industry. He bought pictures not as an investment but as a management tool. He believed that an environment of challenging contemporary art would help his staff abandon past practices and cope better with new concepts. For a few short years the Bank was one of the main collectors in the field, amassing 3,000 works by such avant-garde names as Anselm Kiefer, George Baselitz, and Gilbert and George. It ended in tears. In 1988 the Bank made a loss of Dollars 310m; Evans resigned; and the collection was sold. The experience of the First Bank of Minneapolis can be paralleled throughout the world. Corporate art is invariably the passion of one senior executive who is in a position to win over dubious colleagues. The workforce is usually apathetic; the collections concentrate on the contemporary but soon become locked in a time warp; initial enthusiasm lapses. It should not be so. The case for companies to buy art is unassailable. Redecoration is inevitable when moving to new offices so art can be tax deductible. In theory it could well prove a good investment. It brightens up the building and can motivate staff, persuading them that they work for a go-ahead organisation. It allows the company to glow as the modern patron, the friend of budding artists. And yet for every convinced corporate collector, such as Unilever, ICI, Arthur Andersen, and Fleming's Bank, there are a thousand unaware businesses surviving in an art-free environment. They might allow themselves a philistine grin when companies, from Polly Peck to BP, sell off their art and antiques at a loss. The fact is that hanging the walls with canvases by Sol LeWitt, and placing a sculpture by Elizabeth Frink in the reception area, will not automatically improve productivity or profits. All it does is make a statement about the company, or rather the view of the company taken by an art-loving director. And this is how it should be: art for art's sake, not to change the world. It is sad that few companies have maintained a sufficiently coherent corporate philosophy to buy art for more than a generation, but that is the reality that artists must earn to live with. In Art &amp; Business Marjory Jacobson has travelled the world talking to companies that do take art seriously. This is not an impartial investigation, but a polemic. Jacobson is an adviser on art programmes to companies like AT&amp;T and IBM. Her book is beautifully illustrated and in its way inspiring. How bold of BOC to scatter the gardens of its new Surrey HQ with sculptures by Tony Cragg and Richard Deacon; what a positive statement the installations of Anish Kapoor in the premises of Starkmann Library Services in London make about the company. It would be wonderful if more companies had the confidence to join the club. But their convictions must be genuine and embrace more than a director or two. Forcing art into the office environment can be little more than a gesture. Art &amp; Business wisely avoids examining art as an investment, or corporate art collections which favour Old Masters and antique furniture. It is interesting about the corporate museums of Japan and the use of art in public places. It tells the story of how business should be - sophisticated, artistically aware, visionary. It should be catalogued under fiction rather than fact.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Misys cash call for software acquisition Misys, the computer services and application software group, yesterday announced plans to acquire Kapiti, a leading packaged banking software supplier, through a recommended cash and shares offer which values the unquoted group at Pounds 40m. The Pounds 25m cash element of the proposed acquisition is to be funded by way of a 2-for-13 rights issue at 425p a share which is fully underwritten by Baring Brothers. Misys shares closed up 2p at 513p yesterday. Kapiti, which reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 1m) on sales of Pounds 29.5m (Pounds 24.9m) last year, claims to be the second largest banking software supplier in the world and has a well established customer base. The group, which has developed following the merger of Kapiti and Aregon in December 1989, has a strong and growing overseas business and a product development strategy which embraces the increasingly popular client/server computer network design. Its products, which include Equation and Equinox banking software, are installed in more than 600 locations in 70 countries including a growing number of emerging markets. The market for licensed banking software products is currently estimated to be worth about Pounds 200m a year. Kapiti's products should complement Misys' existing portfolio of software products which are aimed mainly at specialist vertical markets including the insurance broking, construction, hotels and higher education. In particular, the acquisition, which is subject to shareholder approval at an extraordinary meeting on April 14, will broaden Misys' geographic base. At present only 3 per cent of Misys' Pounds 100m turnover is generated overseas. About 25 per cent of the combined group's sales will come from overseas. Mr Kevin Lomax, Misys chairman, said: 'The Kapiti acquisition represents an excellent opportunity for Misys to expand its business in terms of product mix, customer base and the geographic markets it serves.' Misys has received irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer from holders of more than 90 per cent of Kapiti's share capital.</p>

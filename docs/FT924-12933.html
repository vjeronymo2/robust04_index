			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Time running out Britain's spiralling descent into impotence and despair so wrecked my week that I resorted to reading advertisements as a way of escaping through the looking glass into a secure and prosperous world of cheerfulness and optimism. But the shock I got was twice as traumatic as anything being recounted in the news columns or bulletins. I like advertisements. I am chic enough to call them adverts. And I like the glossy folk who work in advertising agencies. In the past, many a shot-riddled grouse did I knife into while lunching with the chairmen or the creative directors of London's hottest agencies. (I avoided the media directors, who purchase time and space; they are sweaty and aggressive and are often sick on the carpet). The advert that sent my spirits plunging was a newspaper ad for Mercedes. There was a headline: 'One day you will own a Mercedes. Why wait?' And it was written in those short, zingy, hairy-chested paragraphs that are deceptively easy to imitate but which require - take my word - the skills of a punk-tonsured, bejewelled and ear-ringed copywriter who lives in an Elizabethan watermill, owns a helicopter and is attended, at every twist and turn of his 28-year-old life, by flunkies and catwalk creatures of unsurpassed exoticness. It started: Some of you out there have told us you want a Mercedes. But not just now. 'Chance would be a fine thing,' you mutter. Or, more to the point, 'I can't afford one at the moment. You might even remark, 'I'm not old enough yet.' What have we done to deserve such back-handed compliments? Has our reputation for the highest quality also given us a reputation for the highest prices? There was more in like vein, with all the right trigger-words: reliability, durability, high resale value, safety, crumple zones, ABS brakes, unique. We were told there are 36 models of Mercedes to choose from, and that current UK prices range from Pounds 16,830 to Pounds 88,300 (plus delivery). But then the advert got serious. Its cleverness overflowed. I was plunged into melancholy. It doesn't take much to plunge me into melancholy. What did it this time were these three paragraphs: No wonder that over 80 per cent of people who buy a Mercedes go on to buy another. They understand the difference between price and value. So if you want a Mercedes, wait no more. Our cars can last for such a long time (there's one in the Guinness Book of Records with a million miles on the clock) that if you wait too long, you may never get the chance to enjoy your second one. At present, I drive a Rover 216S. The Rover is a British-built car. I like my Rover. Because it has 2,127 of the recognised 2,128 design faults expected in a British car, I have promised it to the Science Museum, which is understandably thrilled. The reason I bought a Rover in the first place is because I am one of those people who imagined, wistfully, that whatever Laurel and Hardy did to wreck the economy, their efforts would be thwarted, or at any rate delayed, by those of us eccentric enough to buy British products. A year ago, however, I decided that when the time was ripe and the Rover had gone to the Science Museum, I would sell a painting or two, cash in some options, denude my portfolio of several of its Premium Bonds, instruct Miss Lee, my executive assistant, to stop buying bloody Chanel and purchase a Merc. Only a little one, though I imagined it would have a telephone. Then I read Mercedes' advert, and that boracic reference to people who may never enjoy a second one. They were talking about me. I will never enjoy a second one. Then a worse thought occured: I may never enjoy a first one, for times are truly dire. I do not mean Laurel and Hardy. I mean everything around. In the view of Alan Greenspan, most of the world is confronting a bout of severe asset deflation which policymakers have little or no chance of correcting, heralding a recession whose like we have not known and whose possible duration means I will never own a Mercedes. Time is whizzing by. If I live to 65, I will see 18 more springs - an unbearably finite number - 18 more autumns, 18 more Epsom Derbies and 18 more Christmas trees decorated by Miss Lee from her beautiful collection of trimmings and lights. Ashes to ashes. What an amazing piece of copywriting.</p>

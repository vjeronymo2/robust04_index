			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZULU LEADER PLEADS FOR END TO BLOODSHED IN S. AFRICA;  </P> <P> ETHNIC VIOLENCE: XHOSA CHIEF JOINS IN ON THE UNUSUAL APPEAL. RALLIES OCCUR IN  THE MIDST OF A POLICE CRACKDOWN.  </P> <P> The traditional leader of the Zulus, King Goodwill Zwelithini, traveled far  from the center of his kingdom Sunday to urge thousands of his followers at  rallies to "put out the fires of violence."  </P> <P> "I have come to tell my father's people . . . that I, as king of the Zulus,  will not tolerate violence perpetrated in the name of" the Zulu nation, said  Zwelithini, a highly respected figure among South Africa"s 7 million Zulus.  </P> <P> "Everybody must lay down their arms and take their brother's hand in  friendship," he said.  </P> <P> Zwelithini was joined by Xhosa paramount chief Tutor Ndamase in the unusual  appeal at rallies in Soweto and Tokoza, south of Johannesburg.  </P> <P> A month of fighting in those and other area townships, which has killed nearly  800, has been primarily between Zulu supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party  and Xhosa and other followers of the African National Congress.  </P> <P> Ndamase appealed to the crowds to look behind their differences, which he said  were being stoked by unknown people out to upset the country's peace process.  </P> <P> "Freedom is your goal, not bloodshed," he said. "Unity is your goal, not  division. Power is your goal, not this bloody weakness." He added: "We must  refuse to be used. Enough is enough."  </P> <P> However, attendance at the rallies was overwhelmingly Zulu. Thousands armed  with homemade spears and shields arrived under police escort. No efforts were  made to disarm them. Police said later that they had agreed to allow  "traditional weapons," but no machetes or axes. Some more dangerous weapons  were seen, however.  </P> <P> Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok visited the Tokoza rally and later spoke  with residents at the nearby Phola Park squatter camp, where 800 shacks have  been burned down and dozens have died in six attacks by Zulus. Militant ANC  supporters in Phola Park have driven Zulus out of a migrant worker hostel,  which has now closed, and they also have attacked and killed passers-by whom  they suspect of being Zulus.  </P> <P> The rallies occurred in the midst of a police crackdown on the violence.  Roadblocks were set up at township entrances, police helicopters circled  overhead, and a heavy police presence was evident.  </P> <P> The authorities reported no serious incidents. Two burned bodies were found in  Tokoza on Sunday morning and a man in Soweto was stabbed and burned to death on  Saturday by a mob of ANC supporters.  </P> <P> The show of Zulu force and the king's remarks worried some township residents.  Although Zwelithini said the "killing talk" must end, he drew cheers when he  added that the Zulu nation "will not, I repeat not, be forced out of  existence."  </P> <P> Zwelithini added, however, that "any tendency for Zulus to strike out at Xhosas  and Xhosas to do likewise must be eliminated now."  </P> <P> Inkatha, led by Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, is the ANC's main political rival.  The ANC has support among most ethnic groups, including Zulus, but Xhosas hold  many important leadership positions. Zulu supporters of the two groups have  been locked in a three-year battle in Natal Province that has killed nearly  4,000.  </P></p>

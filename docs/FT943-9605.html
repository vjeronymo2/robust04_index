			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: PolyGram Forget Four Weddings and a Funeral. The real story of PolyGram's film business in the first half was Four Flops and a Hit. The cost of the turkeys almost swamped the profits from Four Weddings, the low-budget British comedy that has already grossed Dollars 128m, and there was only a modest reduction in losses from its non-music interests. By not breaking out the numbers PolyGram allowed some analysts to assume that profits from the core music business actually fell. Although this notion was quickly scotched, the 8 per cent rise in group earnings per share was pedestrian by PolyGram's standards. To be fair, income was depressed by other start-up losses while the rights issue-funded acquisition of Motown diluted earnings. All record companies are becoming more weighted towards the second half and, after a very quiet first half, PolyGram has a strong release schedule coming up. Of course, there is no guarantee they will all be hits, though at least the performance of albums tends to be more predictable than films. The response to Four Weddings only underlines how difficult these are to judge and chairman Mr Alain Levy insists the success has not gone to the corporate head. The fact that one of the songs from the film is topping the UK charts shows there is value combining music and movies under one roof even if, like Mr Levy, one does not buy all the multimedia hype. While he is coming round to the idea that movie-makers may need to have interests in television broadcasters, shareholders should not be too alarmed. He is not one to throw money around in a hurry.</p>

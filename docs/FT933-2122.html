			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Joint rail insurance plan after sell-off COMPANIES awarded fran-chises to provide rail services as part of the privatisation of British Rail are likely to be required to join an industry-wide scheme for dealing with claims for injury or damage. One of the results will be to keep the cost of insurance down for franchise holders, the government says. The proposals are designed to meet concerns about how claims arising from accidents such as the Clapham rail disaster would be handled. The government says that the proposed arrangements should ensure that there will be no undue delays in settling claims. Under proposals published yesterday by the transport department, rail passengers will claim against train operators for injury or damage incurred on rail journeys. For claims at stations not involving trains the station operator would bear the liability in the first instance. These rules would apply even where liability was disputed or shared with other organisations such as RailTrack, the organisation responsible for the rail infrastructure. The new railway regulator will be responsible for ensuring that operators have adequate third-party insurance to cover claims from people other than passengers or employees. The regulator will also require operators to participate in an industry-wide scheme to adjudicate on claims from passengers and other customers where the amount claimed is more than Pounds 5,000 but less than Pounds 5m. The committee will apportion fault between the various parties, including the operator and RailTrack. For claims of more than Pounds 5m operators will be expected to pay into a centrally negotiated insurance policy, with the insurer handling the claim. Larger operators might be allowed to cover claims up to a higher level, such as Pounds 15m, in return for lower premiums. Most claims by passengers will be handled directly by the operators, in the same way that BR handles them now. The transport department proposes that this low-value claims process should apply to claims of up to Pounds 5,000 - about 95 per cent of all claims currently made against BR. Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said: 'We aim to ensure that passengers and others who wish to make a claim know precisely against whom claims should be made and that the railway industry does not face heavier burdens of liability than at present.' Operators and insurers will be urged to make advance payments in cases of hardship, as BR does at present.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lulama Luti] </F>   [Text] Hundreds of refugees fleeing civil wars and famine  in most African countries are streaming into South Africa,  penniless, and many are roaming the streets without any place to  stay.    The Department of Home Affairs is presently processing  application from more than 2,000 refugees seeking political  asylum in the country.    The flood of refugees is causing serious problems for the  South African authorities, who are still grappling with the  issue of displaced people from violence-ravaged areas such as  Natal and the East Rand.    There has been a steady increase in the number of people  seeking refuge from wars and famine in Africa in the past few  months.    Some have found their way to centres for the homeless such  as  the Welcome Home Centre in Doornfontein, Johannesburg.    The centre, which is home to about 300 homeless people, also  houses about 70 refugees from countries such as Somalia,  Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique  and Tanzania.    The refugees included five Ethiopian dissident boxers who  fled from a Mauritius-bound aircraft at Jan Smuts Airport on May  15 while en route to a boxing tournament in Mauritius.    Most of the asylum seekers had letters from the United  Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Department of Home  Affairs, identifying them as people applying for refugee status.    The director of the centre, Mrs Imelda Damane, said the  UNHCR  [UN High Commission for Refugees] sent refugees to the centre  without providing them with money for food and shelter.    "How do they expect us to cope with this flood of people  when  we can't provide for local people who have fled their homes  because of violence"? Damane said.    A spokesman for the UNHCR denied that the organisation  referred people to the centre. He said the name of the centre  was one of several appearing on a list supplied to refugees to  help them find food and shelter.    According to an agreement with the Government, asylum  seekers  are allowed to look for employment while their applications are  being processed. He said the UNHCR did not have any direct  assistance programme for refugees.    The Department of Home Affairs said a total of 2,146 persons  from various countries had applied at its Johannesburg office  for asylum on the grounds that they were refugees.    Such applicants were issued with temporary permits pending  the outcome of their applications. If successful, the refugees  were granted temporary residence.    The department said it was impossible to give exact figures  of refugees because many entered the country clandestinely.</p>

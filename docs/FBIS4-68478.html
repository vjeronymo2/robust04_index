			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Romualdas Ozolas, chairman of the Center </F> Union, by Arturas Racas; place and date not given: "The Center  Union is Focused on Not Yet Existent Individual-Oriented  Entities and Does Not Intend to Represent the Large  Capitalists"]    [Text] In a week's time, it will be exactly two years since  the establishment of a centrist-oriented party in Lithuania was  publicly declared. Exactly three months after that declaration,  the constituent assembly of the Center movement took place on 22  July 1992, and on 5 June 1993, the constituent conference of a  political party, the Lithuanian Center Union. On 27 October  1993, the Center Union was registered at the Ministry of Justice.    At present, there are over 400 members in the Center Union,  which is represented in the Seimas by R. Ozolas and E.  Bickauskas.    LIETUVOS RYTAS presents an interview with Romualdas Ozolas,  Chairman of the Lithuanian Center Union.    [Racas] Of the political forces that currently exist and  have  representatives in the Seimas, the Center Union is the newest  organization, and in addition, an organization which does not  have a historical past. Why did Lithuania need the Center Union?    [Ozolas] The Center Union is a political organization that  came into being and now operates on the basis of liberalistic  viewpoints. On the whole, liberalism in Lithuania is quite a  recent phenomenon and lacks deeper traditions here. In a country  where the tradition of conservatism is fundamental, basic, and  oriented towards far in the future, parties with liberalistic  viewpoints and their adherents truly are choosing a very  difficult path. We understood this from the outset, but we made  up our minds to take this step nevertheless. We believe that we  had to decide to take this step for Lithuania's future: whether  Lithuania will be democratic or autocratic depends on whether  the political viewpoint of liberalism--consolidated to at least  some significant extent--exists here.    The right with its national conservatism and the left with  its cosmopolitan conservatism automatically orient Lithuania  towards a single party, and the battle between these two forces  may determine the development of Lithuania for a long time.  Since the left is--in terms of history--condemned, and the right  is the position of future parties, we believe that it is  improper and dangerous to repeat the political route taken by  Lithuania up to 1940. So if we, understanding the prerogatives  granted us by history and the necessity of resisting the pull  towards repeating what was done in the past, do not carry out  our duty, we, as political leaders, will not, on the whole, have  justified our purpose, and as people we will not be able to rest  in peace even after we are dead.    I believe that in rising as a third force, liberalism can  guarantee the development of a third political force in  Lithuania. I find it very unfortunate that the Liberal Union of  Lithuania, by responding in such a strange fashion to the  economic situation, has heretofore identified persistently with  the right, even though the complex of issues associated with the  left and the right in Lithuania has not yet become sufficiently  clear.    [Racas] You are emphasizing the third, or the so-called  middle way. What is it like, how does it differ from the ways  that the left and the right are proposing?    [Ozolas] The right as well as the left are offering  guarantees to aggregate wholes. We are offering guarantees to  individuals--to individual-oriented entities. Through these  guarantees offered to individuals, we are trying to provide  guarantees for those aggregate constituencies that could then  join together and be the leading forces for Lithuania as it  moved toward openness, toward the world, towards the  ability--through openness--to keep in step with a dynamic world  that is on the verge of the 21st century. Despite the pull  towards autocracy, that world will be democratic. This is also  demonstrated by the fact that the great empires have collapsed,  as we had predicted. The Soviet Union and its autocratism is  already gone, and after some time, a similar fate, it seems,  will befall China and its imperial structure, and still later,  the United States, although, to be sure, on a different basis.    [Racas] You maintain that the Center Union is oriented  towards individual-oriented entities. Keeping in mind that in  the past elections you were unable to overcome the 4 percent  hurdle, is it possible to assert that these individual-oriented  entities do not yet exist in Lithuania?    [Ozolas] That's absolutely correct. Lithuania is for the  time  being still not prepared to live through the life of the  individual person. For now, group life has to be guaranteed for  Lithuania: guarantees for pensioneers, guarantees for the  unemployed, guarantees for students and so on. The individual  person with his willingness to take a risk, his intelligence,  determination, and tenacity still has so few opportunities, that  even the most determined are overtaxed by what they experience.    The Center Union represents that softened version of  liberalism which could correspond to the self-consciousness of  those who are the most daring and to their interests, as people  who are determined to lead life as an individual, in growing,  joining into groups or classes, and assuming a certain position  in the structure of the society, in which the majority will  nevertheless be comprised of those conglomerates that require  collective guarantees.    [Racas] Why, despite accentuation of the idea of liberalism,  has the Lithuanian Center Union been unable to find common  ground with the Lithuanian Liberal Union?    [Ozolas] I believe that this is a question of time. The  difficulties are sufficiently comprehensible in the sense that  here in Lithuania everything begins with ideological viewpoints,  and any difference whatsoever in these repels people from the  possibility of joining forces or working together. There is a  certain degree of hypertrophied seeking of identity in all the  parties, so it goes without saying that this might be especially  characteristic of the Liberals, who defend the freedom of the  individual. And that is indeed the case.    We said a very long time ago, back when the Center movement  was still forming and when positions were being deliberated with  the Liberals, that despite everything our paths were the same,  and that sooner or later we would find a way to cooperate. We  will also find a way to cooperate with other centrist or  moderately oriented forces.    Until all the rich and powerful people who wish to  participate in political life come together, the Liberal Union  will be able to represent liberalism in Lithuania more as an  idea than as a concrete political effect. However, even then  they will not be able to collect enough votes, and the moderate  echelons of liberalism will be able to be suitable  representatives for those too who will share the belief that the  defense of their private life and initiative, as well as the  defense and increase of their personal wealth is their life's  purpose and meaning. This is why we characterize ourselves not  as the representatives of the large capitalists, but rather as  the representatives of the person who has wealth, as  representatives of the individual, as representatives of the  person who understands that wealth is not absolute, that it is  only a means to live and to exist, and that it is the engine of  society's becoming free.    [Racas] Could you give concrete expression to who these  "people who have wealth" are whom you would like to represent?    [Ozolas] The structures of wealth in Lithuania have not yet  manifested themselves completely and it is uncertain what they  will eventually be like. We believe that we could represent  people both in rural areas--large- and medium-size farmers--and  in urban areas--financiers, factory owners, large stockholders,  as well as the entire strata of workers in private  infrastructure. In short, for that group of owners which  requires a guarantee of free trade and assistance as well as  defense at times when there is instability in the country. What  will be especially difficult and crucial will be the  reconciliation of the guaranteeing of interests of large- and  medium-size capital.    [Racas] When the Center movement was being founded, its  ranks  included many people who were well-known then: K. Motieka, S.  Kasauskas, M. Laurinkus, A. Januska, etc. How would you explain  the fact that now they either do not participate at all in the  activities of the Center Union or have suspended their work in  this organization?    [Ozolas] I believe that this is related to the fact that  participation in politics is a very difficult duty. Moreover,  everybody has a lot of individual interests, everybody today is  accumulationg starting capital for themselves, and some of the  people mentioned are doing so as well. This is why I fully  understand Mr. Kasauskas, who is concerned with the development  of his personal business, I understand Mr. Motieka, who wants to  put the activities of his firm in order so that he can be  independent. Sometimes I think that when I leave politics it  will be as a completely poor man, whereas my friends and many  people in Lithuania will have in reality achieved the ideal for  which I am working in politics. That is a paradox, but working  in politics is what I have decided to do.    [Racas] Members of the Center Union work in various  government structures and frequently express differing opinions  and so politicians sometime say that a multipartite structure  has developed within the Center Union itself. Isn't there a  danger that your party will split up?    [Ozolas] Even parties that are less democratic than ours are  threatened by divisions and differences of opinion. The way in  which diversity of opinion is formulated in our party and the  way in which we manage to act on this diversity as we coordinate  differences of opinion is very satisfying. In surmounting the  differences of opinion that we indeed do have, we manage to  coordinate them not with respect to the sole category of current  economic needs, but rather with regard to what will happen in  the distant future. When difficulties arise, we work on the  principal question: does our general line correspond to this or  not? If it corresponds, then we don't argue about the details.  This is why a split is truly not a threat to us for the time  being, even though to our critics, the details usually seem to  be especially significant.    I want to emphasize where our threshhold of confidence lies:  working individually and on one's own responsibility up to the  point where it is clear to everyone that the person might be in  a position to go outside the viewpoints of the party. If the  party believes that the person has nevertheless crossed this  threshhold and that his viewpoints no longer correspond to the  viewpoints of the party, then we raise the issue whether this  can continue to be reconciled with the norms of the general work  of the party.    [Racas] Elections to local government may take place this  year already. How is the Center Union preparing for these  elections and with which political forces does it foresee  forming a coalition?    [Ozolas] We have always believed and will continue to hold  to  the viewpoint that no advance indications on this topic are  needed. We let our sections operate freely in choosing election  partners for themselves. Some sections will participate in the  elections together with the Liberals, while others will join  with the Liberals and the Social Democrats. They will, of  course, not coordinate their programs but perhaps they will  succeed in agreeing on how to act together on individual issues.    [Racas] How does the Center Union view early elections to  the  Seimas?    [Ozolas] We have a very clear opinion on this issue: for the  time being, we can not support this idea, because we believe  that if the elections took place this fall, they would not in  the main change anything, and could possibly even make the  situation in the Seimas and the country worse. This was also my  opinion in 1992, when I proposed that elections not be held but  rather that we work as hard as possible.    [Racas] Do you expect to overcome the 4 percent hurdle in  the  next elections and will you try to do so alone?    [Ozolas] Without a doubt. We will go into the elections on  the basis of what is there and will also look for who can agree  with us on the principal issues. Even if such agreement would  only happen in the distant future, and even if for tactical  reasons certain distinctions were to remain. If our positions  coincide and if the other party can take part in joint political  activity and can assume the task of taking care of a certain  domain, that party will be our friend and participate alongside  us. We see possibilities for cooperation with the Social  Democrats, Nationalists, Democrats, and this does not even  mention the Liberals. The question is whether the politicians of  today will be able to overcome their mentality, step beyond  their personal interests, and join and unite for the benefit of  our country.</p>

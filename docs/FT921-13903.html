			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Write a letter to your wife MY WIFE and I own our house as joint tenants, under a deed of gift set up when we were married. As we get older, it will become more advantageous to own the property as tenants-in-common. Do we need to get a solicitor to draw up formal deeds to alter the method of ownership or will a simple statement, suitably witnessed, be sufficient? Do I need to lodge such a statement with the Land Registry, and with the building society which holds the deeds as security for the mortgage? You do not need a witnessed document, or a solicitor. One of you should write a letter to the other stating 'I hereby give you notice of severance of the joint tenancy under which we hold the property (description) to the intent that we shall henceforth hold that property on trust for ourselves as tenants in common in equity'. You should apply to the Land Registry to enter a restriction to reflect this, supplying a photocopy of the letter. It is wise for the recipient to sign an acknowledgement of receipt of the letter. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

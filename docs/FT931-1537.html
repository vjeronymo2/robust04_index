			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: Navy admits dumping nuclear reactors at sea RUSSIA has admitted the Soviet navy sank nuclear submarines and radioactive materials in its northern seas. An official report seen by the Financial Times paints a chilling picture of secret pollution which began in 1959. The report, drawing on KGB and military documents declassified on the orders of President Boris Yeltsin, was drawn up after a ship from Greenpeace, the environmentalist organisation, was seized by the Russian navy for trying to measure the radioactivity last October. Between 1959 and 1992, 18 reactors from nuclear submarines were dumped at sea after accidents or decommissioning, as well as a reactor from the nuclear-powered ice-breaker Lenin which was simply put on to a barge and sunk. Seven of the reactors, complete with their submarines and dangerous nuclear fuel, were dumped into the northern Kara and Barents seas after on-board accidents made them too dangerous to handle. The report says that 2.3m curies of radioactive material - 50m curies was released by the world's worst nuclear accident, at Chernobyl - was dumped into the sea over this period. It specifies where and when the dumping was carried out. But Professor Alexei Yablokov, the presidential adviser who led the commission which produced the report, said research was now needed to determine the harm done to the environment and draw up steps to repair the damage. 'We don't know the extent of the danger because there is no data on what radioactivity seeped into the ecosystem. Maybe nothing terrible happened. But maybe it did get into fish and will then go on to human beings.' Mr Yeltsin has ordered the government to draw up a programme to deal with the issue. He has also instructed Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, to circulate the report among the international community. Greenpeace has urged the Group of Seven industrialised companies to consider urgent assistance for Russia to deal with what it describes as the Russian navy's 'deadly cold war legacy'. Russian nuclear submarines are continuing to dump liquid radioactive waste at sea for lack of on-shore storage and reprocessing facilities. Britain, France and the US, the other countries to operating nuclear submarines, as a rule return the waste back to land. Despite signing in 1976 the London Convention banning disposal of highly radioactive materials at sea the Soviet Union ignored the ban.</p>

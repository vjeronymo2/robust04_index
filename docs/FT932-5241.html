			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Canadian Airlines in offer to clear American deal CANADIAN Airlines Inter-national is offering CDollars 20m (USDollars 15.7m) cash and CDollars 1.5m in transition costs to leave the Gemini reservations system it now jointly owns with rival Air Canada and a smaller airline. Canadian must switch from Gemini to American Airlines' Sabre system as part of a deal in which American would invest CDollars 246m in Canadian for a 25 per cent voting stake. The National Transportation Agency has cleared the equity infusion and Canadian's exit from Gemini is the only remaining hurdle for Canadian's deal with American. However, Air Canada is appealing the NTA approval for the federal cabinet, saying both Canadian airlines should be merged. It continues to hold Canadian to its original Gemini agreement, and has taken the issue to the courts. Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman of Canadian and its parent PWA, said agreement on its exit from Gemini should be reached on a commercial basis and he himself was ready to negotiate a solution directly with Mr Hollis Harris, chairman of Air Canada, to finalise details.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Gardening: 'Yes' to discrimination, 'no' to floral apartheid  -Planning a border from scratch has its attractions WHILE THESE amazing rains pour down, I have been looking to next season's potential and pondering on a gap in every gardener's library. Many books exist, but nobody has ever written the ideal book on how to design a garden: what is the reason and what can be said meanwhile? One reason is the variety of taste which changes in fashion soon complicate, another is the extreme difficulty of being specific when readers have so many different sites, soils and settings in their background. There is also the problem of the illustration. Drawings and plans cannot do justice to the changes of light and shade during a day or a season. Photographs lie, although we have all been inspired by them. They fix a particular light or a particular moment; they cast a glamorous focus on one good feature. Editors tend to print only those photographs which look seductive. Design is also a difficult subject to describe. Books can be grand and lofty or woolly and vague. The late Russell Page was a remarkable example of the former style, rivalled by Sylvia Crowe in the latter. Matters were not much better in the great age of Capability Brown and his successors. I find that their historic writings suffer the same problems. Without writing a book, I will try to avoid extremes and offer a few guiding thoughts. Before me stretches a newly-cleared border, blank like the human mind, in the 17th century's imagery of one. How do I start thinking about it? I always try to picture the final result in context. Will the design fit in? Will it suit that phrase from the 18th century, 'the genius of the place', and look good in its surroundings? This habit of thought discourages pure borrowing. The wrong way to begin is with something 'as seen at Sissinghurst' or in a photo of Tintinhull, to be copied exactly in east Essex. Unlike foxgloves, other people's bright ideas do not transplant anywhere. Straight plagiarism looks scrappy and unconvincing, although photographs sometimes encourage it. I will limit myself to some clear thoughts about borders. In a border, I would always go mixed. Herbaceous borders and beds of nothing but roses are too limited in form, season and texture: why not have some pale blue ceanothus among musk roses or mock orange blossom in a bed of civilised phloxes? Shrubs give backbone, especially if they are evergreens, repeated at wide intervals. My favourite hardy evergreen for this purpose is the white-flowered osmarea burkwoodii, as nurseries describe it. In mild districts, I would also use waxy green pittosporum. Several groups of each divide a bigger border into sections which are much easier to visualise. Even in a small garden, start with thoughts of backbone and then span the boundaries by reading and plundering several chapters of sections in a catalogue. You might even like to grow scarlet runner beans on tall stakes for height in the back row. Books and plans still encourage you to plant in blocks at a density of five plants or more to a square yard. The density is impossibly expensive and I would always prefer to buy one big plant for nearer Pounds 3 and split it myself into pieces, growing them on carefully during their first year. I am also against blocks. The shrewd Miss Jekyll preferred the thinner shape of drifts which are longer than broad. She felt, quite rightly, that drifts were less obtrusive when out of season. This preference is evident in most of her border plans, printed in her books or visible in facsimile in a garden shed at Hestercombe, near Taunton in Somerset. I also like to scatter and repeat. After the backbone, my thoughts always begin with a plant which I want to be the main feature down a border or round a garden in any one fortnight. I then repeat individual bits of it often enough to lead the eye in search of it. Designers and their books underestimate this trick. Their schemes are cluttered up with subtle theories of colour and heights. Meanwhile, the eye will jump over a mass of stems out of season and head for something which is directly in season. You can test this principle on any garden-watchers who come to visit. They like to be able to say that the sweet rocket is looking wonderful in early June or that the single pink rose complicata is amazing in July. The eye must be drawn to something and then led on by repetition so that it overlooks weaknesses and retains one instant impression. What about colour? My rule here is discrimination, but not floral apartheid. I do not go for single coloured borders, all white or all purple. In very large gardens, they can still be an amusing enclosure, but otherwise they limit choice. Blues, yellows, pale pinks and whites form one group in my mind's eye; all or some of them will combine very happily, provided that the yellows are not too strong. Reds, whites, oranges and purples are another group which need greater care but could still allow harmony or contrast. If you are stuck at any point, turn to silver-leaved plants to help you out of the problem. They combine with almost anything and take the edge off a hard colour. As a general rule, strong colour is better near the back of a wide bed. In the foreground, it arrests the eye and diminishes depth. Like all rules, this one is all the better for being broken occasionally. But if you break it too often and put all the ghostly colours at the back, you will foreshorten the border's scale. What, lastly, are the overriding values? For me, they are scent, season and amiable elements of scattiness. If you are looking for scent, use a specialised book, of which Scent in Your Garden by Stephen Lacey is a helpful guide. Always use plants which have a longer season than a week or so: as yet, there is no fully reliable guide in the UK, least of all the nursery catalogues which imply that their plants will flower for many more months than most of them do. Whenever I descend to detail, it is this value of season which preoccupies me.  You can have three or more different borders if you cultivate a sense of season and think of the space as a stage on which different acts in succession will take the limelight. As for scattiness, you already have the drift of it. Be formal, but not too formal when planting and distributing flowers. You should cultivate an artful air of wilderness and aim for that moment when gardens look as if they are just about to run out of control. You see why good design is the subject with so few classics: I know this quality when I see it, but I cannot quite describe it specifically. Perhaps it is like theology. The Unauthorised Border: there, perhaps, is the title which might have the properly scatty scope.</p>

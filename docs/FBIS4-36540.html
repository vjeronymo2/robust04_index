			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>   [Text] Commenting on [U.S. Secretary of State]  Christopher's expected return to the region within the framework  of the U.S. Administration resuming its efforts to invigorate  the Syrian-Israeli track, informed Syrian sources emphasize that  since the Madrid conference -- not to mention the Geneva summit,  where Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton reached  understanding and agreement on activating the process for  comprehensive peace -- Syria has welcomed every U.S. effort to  invigorate the peace process.    The sources told Radio Monte Carlo that Israeli statements  after Christopher left the region, particularly Rabin's  statements that the negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese  tracks are frozen, mean that Israel does not welcome the U.S.  secretary of state's return to the region, and that Israel,  through its statements, appears to be dictating to the U.S.  sponsor how to act and move in the peace process.    The sources held Israel responsible for the delay and the  stagnation in the peace process, and said that during his recent  visit to the region Christopher had communicated to Israel the  Syrian concept of the peace process, after which he directly  left Israel for Washington. This shows he sensed a negative  response from Israel on the Syrian peace concepts, which are  within the framework of the realization of international  legitimacy and the UN resolutions.</p>

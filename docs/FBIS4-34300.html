			<p>BFN     [Text] Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Napoleon  Santos Aguilar, announced yesterday that the Senior Council of  the Armed Forces, during an extraordinary session, decided to  make routine changes in the positions of the Armed Forces  hierarchy to energize the Armed Forces.    According to Santos Aguilar's announcement, Colonel Mario  Raul Hung Pacheco, formerly the commander general of the Public  Security Force (FSP), is now commander general of the Army.    Meanwhile, former Army commander General Guillermo Paredes  is  now inspector general of the Armed Forces, replacing Filander  Armijo Ucles, who will now be an adviser to the  commander-in-chief.    At the head of the FSP is Colonel Roberto Lazarus Lozano,  who  was formerly chief of the Armed Forces General Staff, a post  that will now be filled by Colonel Luis Alonso Villatoro Villeda.    Also promoted was General Hector Castro Cabus, general  commander of the Honduran Air Force (FAH), who will now be an  adviser to the commander-in-chief. Currently at the head of the  FAH is Air Force Colonel Oscar Servellon Moradel.    It has also been announced that Police Colonel Julio Cesar  Chavez is now chief of the FSP General Staff.    The Directorate of the National Defense College is now  headed  by Artillery Colonel Jose Luis Nunez Bennet, who was formerly  the director of the Armed Forces Command and Staff School which,  as of today, will be directed by Colonel Jose Francisco Davila  Nolasco, who was formerly the chief of Armed Forces General  Staff operations.    Colonel Julio Armando Pavon Rodriguez, who until yesterday  was director of the National Defense College, is now assistant  joint chief of staff, replacing Colonel Claudio Lainez Coello,  who is now an adviser to the commander-in-chief.    Colonels Jose Santos Ortez Pena, Luis Alberto Soto Ponce,  Inocente Borjas Santos and Alberto Urcira Reyes, are now the  respective heads of: the Office of Joint Chief of Staff  Operations C-3, the General Staff Directorate of Civilian  Affairs C-5, the Directorate of Recruitment C-7, and the General  Secretaryship of the General Staff.    Colonel Guillermo Pinel Calix, who was Armed Forces director  of operations and maintenance until yesterday, is now director  of Military Intelligence C-2.    Military Spokesman Napoleon Santos Aguilar pointed out that  Joint Chief of Staff General Lazaro Melanio Avila Soleno was  confirmed in the post by Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso  Discua Elvir.    Col. Santos explained that certain departments of the  different branches of the Armed Forces can now be changed  because the new chiefs and commanders have been authorized to do  so.    He pointed out that certain officers were appointed to  advisory positions because their experience renders them more  useful to the commander-in-chief.    Col. Santos explained that this was not the case on this  occasion, but certain officers who have reached retirement age  must retire from the Army. "At this time, however, the officers  of the Sixth Graduating Class have simply been appointed to  advisory positions," he said.    [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2137 GMT on 15 June  publishes a similar a 300-word report on the changes within the  Honduran Armed Forces hierarchy. The report says the changes  are indicative of "difficulties" within the Armed Forces, and  adds that "the Armed Forces have begun to get rid of certain  officers who have been publicly accused of illicit enrichment."]</p>

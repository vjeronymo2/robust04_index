			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Societies hit BES trail - John Authers prepares for a flood of new tax shelter schemes BUILDING societies jumped on the business expansion scheme bandwagon this week. The result should be a flood of new tax shelter schemes which allow access to money within five years. Until now, societies have been unable to take advantage of the BES because rules could not be agreed with their regulator, the Building Societies Commission. Several banks have sold their repossessed housing to BES companies in return for guarantees of loans after a short period, but building societies cannot do this. The solution, first hit on by Bristol &amp; West in conjunction with the sponsor, Close Brothers, is to establish a separate company, funded by the society, to sell the repossessed properties to a BES company. This 'middle man' company then provides the guarantees. Another scheme was produced quickly by National &amp; Provincial, and sponsored by Johnson Fry. More seem certain to follow. Bessa Bristol and West, with a capacity of Pounds 45m, will buy repossessed B &amp; W properties from Residential Property Reversions. After five years, RPR will pay Pounds 1.05 for every Pounds 1 invested now. This has been underwritten with a sterling certificate of deposit from B &amp; W, which also will make non-recourse loans to investors after six months at a rate of 73p for every Pounds 1 invested. Anthony Yadgaroff, of the Allenbridge Group, suggests that this scheme is appropriate only for those who want to take the money after six months. N &amp; P Multiple Choice Growth Scheme, with a capacity of Pounds 50m, is more of an oddity. There is no guaranteed exit after five years but non-recourse loans are available at several points - of 74p after six months, 78.3p after a year, 87.7p after two years and 98.2p after three. Maximum investment is Pounds 25,000 and only one loan will be made available to each investor. The building society schemes are likely to hog investors' money. The other new BES schemes launched this week, which are not to be confused with those above, include: Aegis II. Sponsored by Matrix Securities, this will buy properties for Leicester university which, after five years, will pay Pounds 1.13 1/2 for every Pounds 1 paid now. This has been underwritten by Barclays bank. There is no non-recourse loan facility. Cavendish Geared. Sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson and Matrix-Securities, this is an unguaranteed scheme which will try to exploit low prices in the London residential property market. Its extra twist comes from the gearing it can obtain from fixed or capped mortgages of up to 60 per cent of the value after refurbishing the properties it buys. It aims to cover mortgage interest payments from its rental yield; this allows greater profits if the housing market recovers. Hunter II. Sponsored by Property Enterprise Managers, this will look for bargains in the London residential property market. It has no 'guaranteed' level of pay-back after five years but is aiming to profit as much as possible. Once the BES qualifying period is over, the company intends to liquidate and pay cash to shareholders by April 5 1999. Jerry's Home Store. This is definitely not to be confused with the others as it invests in a trading company, not residential property. The company, founded by a team of former Marks &amp; Spencer directors, will start a North American-style home furnishings shop in the Sloane Square area of west London. It is sponsored by London broker Townsley, and there are no guarantees or early exit options. The week also saw an innovative application of the BES from Fairclough Homes, part of the AMEC group. Its Activator programme allows potential house-buyers to rent their homes for four years at a fixed price, and then convert to a mortgage. The price at which they buy in 1997 is fixed at its present market level - which could be of great advantage if the market takes off - and the rent level is low. The weekly rent on a property valued at Pounds 40,000 is Pounds 30.69, according to Fairclough, while interest payments on a mortgage for this amount, at 7.99 per cent, would be Pounds 49.94. A Pounds 125,000 house would have a rent of Pounds 95.91. Tenants would have to get clearance for a mortgage - from the Royal Bank of Scotland - before taking up their tenancy. They would then have to buy the property in 1997, whatever their circumstances. But the mortgage is guaranteed, even if the tenant loses income during the four years, and the options to buy the house are transferable if necessary (although this might involve a lot of paperwork). The finance for this comes from the Flexit BES companies, launched two weeks ago. Their low guarantee to shareholders after five years (Flexit will pay only Pounds 1.05 for every Pounds 1 invested this year) has allowed Fairclough finance cheap enough to make the Activator offer. The scheme is offering 750 new properties in 40 locations. If one of them seems appropriate, then it is hard to see how purchasing it could be made much cheaper.</p>

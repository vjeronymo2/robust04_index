			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Basin features a clutch of new record highs A FALL in bond yields and lower short-term rates in the afternoon prompted late index-linked buying, and share prices firmed on purchases by arbitrageurs and investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 70.31 at 20,591.76 after a day's high of 20,594.56 and low of 20,482.95. The index moved within a narrow range on light profit-taking and technical buying, as most investors waited for the auction results for East Japan Railway, announced after the close. Volume, on the last trading day for August delivery, shrank to 190m shares from 213m. Advances outscored declines by 597 to 341, with 213 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 5.09 at 1,654.36 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.17 to 1,262.85. The yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark fell 6.5 basis points to 4.075 per cent. Traders said equity prices were supported by underlying speculation of a cut in the official discount rate next month. On the other hand, the bleak outlook for imminent economic prospects and an upturn in corporate profits was preventing investors from committing their funds. In the oil sector, Cosmo Oil forged ahead Y41 to Y940. The government's new policy to promote the use of solar power generators among domestic households pushed up Daido Hoxan, a solar battery manufacturer, by Y17 to Y742. Drug issues were firm, led by Tanabe Seiyaku which gained Y70 at Y1,130 on recommendations from a Japanese broker. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical and Sankyo both rose Y20 to Y2,400 and Y2,450 respectively. Hopes of government deregulation of the transportation industry supported warehouses: Mitsubishi Warehouse and Transportation appreciated Y60 to Y1,890 while Mitusi Soko advanced Y15 to Y950. Telecommunications-related issues posted further gains on hopes of government assistance for the country's telecom infrastructure. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone climbed Y5,000 to Y943,000 and Fujitsu, the day's most active stock, rose Y6 to Y797. Insurers were subjected to profit-taking: Tokio Marine &amp; Fire dipped Y10 to Y1,340. In Osaka, the OSE average added 50.29 at 22,509.56 in volume of 55.6m shares. Roundup THREE NEW highs, and a recovery in Hong Kong, adorned a strong region. HONG KONG's turnover was still thin, down from HKDollars 3.73bn to HKDollars 3.36bn, as the Hang Seng index improved 183.50 to 7,449.08 after a fall of some 300 points from its record close a week earlier. HSBC, weakened in recent days by disappointing results from its Hang Seng Bank subsidiary, topped the actives list and recovered HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 83.50. Hang Seng Bank rose HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 55.50. After the close, Swire Pacific reported a drop in interim profits. This took the market down about 70 points in London, but it ended only 25 lower after news of a land reclamation project. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index finished 34.10 up at a record high of 2,010.19, driven by institutional buying of index-linked stocks. Volume here rose from 263.06m to 277.28m shares. KUALA LUMPUR peaked for the same reason, the KLSE composite index closing 6.06 ahead at 811.78 for its second consecutive 1993 high. JAKARTA soared to a new peak, the JKSE index ending 7.07 stronger at 405.56. Astra International led the rise, climbing Rp1,500 to Rp17,500 in moderate volume on bullish speculation about its results, and on rights issue rumours. AUSTRALIA decided that it liked Wednesday's News Corp results after all, and the shares rose 33 cents to ADollars 9.65 as the All Ordinaries index advanced 18.9 to 1,941.5. Turnover was ADollars 478.2m. Market leader BHP moved up 20 cents to ADollars 15.78. BANGKOK saw active buying of banks as interest shifted from speculative towards fundamental attractions. The SET index put on 9.44 at 961.77 in turnover of just under BT8bn. KARACHI declined on news of US sanctions against Pakistan and China over alleged arms-control violations, the KSE index finishing 10.39 lower at 1,315.65, after touching 1,308.81. SEOUL moved against the trend with its fourth consecutive loss, the composite index weakening 9.36 to 695.74 in an atmosphere of depressed inertia. Turnover dropped from Won252.8bn to Won212.2bn.</p>

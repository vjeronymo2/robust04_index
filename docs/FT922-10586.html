			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (11): Royal Armouries will move to Leeds: There are strong economic arguments for moving historic treasures from the Tower of Londo - The Royal Armouries found the Leeds case unbeatable THE Royal Armouries, the treasure trove which includes Henry VIII's battledress and an entire suit of armour for an Indian elephant, have been in the Tower of London for 900 years, so the relocation of part of the collection was hardly likely to have been characterised by haste. The story of the armouries began, along with schoolboy history, in 1066. The search for a new home for part of the collection began 15 years ago, in response to acute space problems, and is now moving rapidly towards the planned opening of a new Pounds 35m museum at Clarence Dock, Leeds, in 1996. The armouries are to follow the trend set by the Tate Gallery, the V&amp;A, the Imperial War Museum, the Science Museum, and the National Portrait Gallery, all of which have established provincial 'outstations.' The relocation of a large part of the 40,000 items in the armouries is the result of complex push-and-pull factors, the seeds of which were laid in 1489 when a German visitor asked to be shown round the legendary armouries: the Tower's first tourist. By the end of the 16th century, curious visitors were part of the life of the Tower. Guy Wilson, Master of the Royal Armouries, says that without a move, the Tower was heading for serious problems by the mid-1990s because of over-crowding. The armouries is the biggest single organisation housed in the Tower. Some 73 per cent of the collection is usually in store because of lack of space and the Crown Jewels are not reaping their full potential because of the cramped conditions. While the lack of space dictated 15 years ago that 'outstations' be found for the collection, government policy, requiring museums to maximise their earning potential, added momentum for radical change. Changing esthetic standards meant that building within the Tower had to stop to preserve the original fabric. Modern expectations in tourist presentation, requiring audio-visual techniques, could not be used in the context of the ancient buildings of the Tower. Originally, a small outstation was set up at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth, to house artillery but it was found that plans to found another for hunting and sporting weapons were not viable. It became clear that a large part of the collection needed to move to provide the critical mass for a major tourist attraction. Economic arguments were also powerful. The Royal Armouries could not charge for admission inside the Tower and its commercial activities were restricted within a Royal Palace and by competing retail outlets. A strategic study concluded that earnings at the Tower could be boosted by Pounds 4m per annum if the arms and armour collection was moved out. Benefits included extra space for catering facilities and better presentation of the Crown Jewels. MORI, the research organisation, was taken on to evaluate the market for a major new museum which would allow 80 per cent of the collection to be shown to the public at the two existing sites and the new location. MORI found that the public was 10 per cent more likely to visit a museum based in the north. It was expected that such a museum could attract 1.3m visitors a year The Royal Armouries felt that the new museum should be part of an urban tourist development. The government's efforts to bring about inner city regeneration could also be harnessed by finding a site covered by a development corporation. Finally, MORI had indicated that a site beside water: like Liverpool's Albert Dock, was most likely to maximise visitor numbers. While most of the major conurbations in England tried to woo the Royal Armouries, the clear winner appeared to be Sheffield, which had a strong added advantage in its historical associations with cutlery and canon production. The fact that Leeds won the race proves that swift action by a local community can swing a major location decision. Leeds Development Corporation spotted a newspaper article indicating that Sheffield was going to get the Royal Armouries. Stuart Kenny, director of development and marketing, telephoned the Tower - and the Leeds' bid was underway. Leeds felt it was vital to present a united front on the bid as a significant financial input had to be secured to get the armouries to abandon Sheffield. Under the umbrella of the existing Leeds Initiative, which includes the LDC, City Council, Chamber of Commerce, Leeds University and Polytechnic and government bodies, a financial package was put in place. The LDC believes it can provide up to Pounds 5m for the relocation: either through grant or land. The private sector may contribute Pounds 5m - not as charity - but to secure a foothold in the Clarence Dock development. And Leeds City Council hopes to provide between Pounds 2m-Pounds 4.5m. Perhaps more than the proposed financial package, the united front from local government, business, and the city, secured the trust of the Royal Armouries. Lord Eden, chairman of the trustees, said: 'We chose Leeds because of a combination of factors - its central position in the UK; its excellent communications by road, rail, and air; the unrivalled attractions of the Clarence Dock site, close to the city centre with its extensive water-frontage; and the evident commitment and enthusiasm of the various authorities, educational establishments and business representatives.' The trustees of the Royal Armouries, and ultimately the government, found the Leeds case unbeatable. A creative team has been appointed to design the new museum, which will include an outside area for jousting and falconry.</p>

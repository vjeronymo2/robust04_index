			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: ST. MARK'S: 'RESTAURANT FIRST AND A JAZZ CLUB AFTER'  </P> <P> The patron saint of Venice, Italy, is San Marco -- Saint Mark. Who knows who's  the patron saint of L.A.'s Venice, but an extravagant restaurant and jazz club,  scheduled to open here in mid-September, has borrowed the good saint's name.  </P> <P> St. Mark's is the work of Francois Petit (former manager of Venice's West Beach  Cafe and Rebecca's) and two partners, Mike Quinn and Warner Scharf. Architect  Osvaldo Maiozzi (designer of Pazzia on La Cienega) has been hired to create a  dramatic 200-seat interior done up with black granite, stainless steel and  cobalt-blue suede booths. Roughly $300,000 has been spent on sound, video and  lighting systems. And to cook? French chef Gil Saulnier (Le St. Germain's last  chef before it closed) assisted by former Spago chef Lisa Stalvy.  </P> <P> "The food is very important," Petit stresses. "This is a restaurant first and a  jazz club after." The style of cooking, he says, will be part northern Italian,  part southern French and part California nouvelle. "Pas de heavy sauce, pas de  stuff like that," he says. "It will be tres light." Dinner will be served seven  nights a week from 6 to 10 p.m. and supper nightly from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., with  brunch on weekends but no weekday lunch. Petit estimates dinner prices at $6-12  for appetizers, $16-$22 for main courses, $5-$8 for desserts.  </P> <P> Among the acts already booked for St. Mark's are Spencer Davis, Billy Preston,  Freddie Hubbard, Tito Puente, Joe Pass, Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Jon  Hendrix, Larry Coryell, and Kenny Rankin -- and, says Petit: "I am trying,  trying, trying to get Ray Charles." Maybe he should pray to you-know-who.  </P> <P> THE MEDITERRANEAN IS THE MESSAGE: Alberto Liano wants to make sure people  understand him correctly. His corporation, which also owns Il Giardino in  Beverly Hills and Pane Caldo in West Hollywood, has just purchased 1000  Wilshire in Santa Monica, and renamed it 1000 Wilshire Ristorante. But the menu  will not be exclusively Italian, he says. It will be based instead on the  so-called Mediterranean Diet, lately acclaimed by nutritional experts for its  various health-saving characteristics. But, he adds -- and this is what he  wants to make sure that people understand -- "This is not a diet with diet  food." It's a diet in the sense of a style of eating, common to peoples all  over the Mediterranean region -- a style that concentrates on seafood, pasta,  grains, fresh vegetables, olive oil, and wine, and goes easy on saturated fats  and other dietary nasties. Sort of like, oh, Italian food, I guess.  </P> <P> FRONTIERS IN FOOD SERVICE: Rod Gardiner, president of the Gardiner Group, which  owns Hy's in Century City, the Kobe Japanese Steak House in Palm Springs, and a  branch of each of the two in Hawaii, has opened a new place in Honolulu. Called  Banditos Cantina Hawaii, it is said to feature "Hawaiian NuMex" cuisine. For  instance? For instance, a tofu burrito and chicken satay with  coconut-mint-chipotle chile peanut sauce. Banditos also offers "tequila-shot  gals armed with shot-glass belts and tequila-holding holsters."  </P> <P> A SPOT MORE PIZZA?: Imagine Spago with plenty of room, no waits for tables, and  pizzas in the $4 to $6 range -- oh, and no celebrities. Sound impossible? Well,  it isn't. It's just English. According to the latest issue of the  Santa-Barbara-based Entree newsletter, there is a small but popular trattoria  called Spago in London. The owner, Roman-born Angelo Felici, told Entree that  he has never heard of Spago in Los Angeles and that he calls his place that  "because we do spaghetti -- spago is short for spaghetti." (Well, actually,  spago means string or cord and the word spaghetti, which means little strings  or cords, is derived from it -- but never mind.)  </P> <P> Wolfgang Puck, proprietor of L.A.'s own Spago, notes that he doesn't think  there's much that he can do about the London restaurant -- and that, anyway, it  sounds like a small place, probably not worth worrying about. "It's funny,  though," he adds. "Somebody from London, not this same man, tried so hard to  get me to open a Spago there a little while ago, and he bothered and bothered  me about it. I said I didn't think the timing was right and that, anyway, I had  too many restaurants in California already. Then he came over here to see me  and to go to Spago for the first time, and he didn't like it. He walked out. He  said it was too noisy, and he had to go someplace more quiet for dinner."  </P> <P> STARS A LA CARTE: Pee-wee Herman and Adam Ant like Cafe Mambo. Shirley MacLaine  gets soul food (for her well-traveled soul) at Aunt Kizzy's Back Porch. Tony  Danza, Rob Lowe and Sean Penn hang out at Twenty/20. (Wow! Party time!) The  casts of "General Hospital" and "Days of Our Lives" may frequently be seen at  Ocean Avenue Seafood. . . . That's the kind of information, anyway, that we get  from a new little pamphlet-sized restaurant guide called "Celebrity Hideaways."  The guide lists about 50 restaurants and clubs around L.A. -- but instead of  cataloguing dishes served, it tells us who (supposedly) eats where. It is a  guide not for the hungry so much as for the star-crazed. New Yorkers, who  generally believe that L.A. restaurant patrons care about seeing and being seen  more than about what's on their plate, will probably love it. And they can get  a copy, too, by sending $2 to Celebrity Hideaways, P.O. Box 241823, Los Angeles  90024.  </P> <P> ROLL-PLAYING: One of the more popular items served at sushi bars in the L.A.  area is the so-called California Roll made with crabmeat and avocado -- two  products for which California is well-known. So what do you suppose you might  find if you sat down at a Japanese restaurant called Sakura, in Huntsville,  Ala.? Why, Alabama Roll, of course. Made with catfish and pork cracklings?  Peanuts? Corn? Nope. Made with those good old Alabama specialties: smoked  salmon, caviar, and, er, avocado.  </P> <P> ON TODAY'S MENU: Old West chow is on the fire at two Silverlake-Los Feliz area  restaurants today. Broiled rattlesnake, cold cactus and pan-fried brook trout  are just some of the "hip cowboy food" fixin's on L.A. Nicola's five-course  dinner, which will be served with a tasting of seven beers ($40 per person). At  Duplex, it's a Cinderblock Buster with barbecued beef and pork ribs, hot links  and chicken, complete with cole slaw made from a recipe handed down to chef  Mark Carter by his own Granny Cohen. . . . And Gilliland's in Santa Monica  presents a "Pacific Flavors" dinner today from 6 p.m., pairing wines from the  top Alsatian producer Hugel &amp; Fils with recipes from Asian food expert Hugh  Carpenter. Sample combination: Thai fried dumplings with coconut milk and basil  plus 1986 Gewurztraminer.  </P> <P> RESTAURANT MISCELLANY: Coffee expert Tim Castle will offer a one-day course at  UCLA Extension, Sept. 16, called "Understanding, Tasting, and Appreciating  Coffee" -- a course I would highly recommend, incidentally, to a great number  of restaurateurs hereabouts. Call (213) 206-8120 for details. . . . Alice  Waters of Chez Panisse and Cafe Fanny in Berkeley, who might genuinely be  called the mother of contemporary American cooking (with Julia Child, I  suppose, being the grandmother), teaches and prepares special meals Oct. 7-8  for the Great Chefs at the Robert Mondavi Winery program. Cost is $595 per  person, not including lodging or transportation. For further informationcall  (707) 944-2866.  </P></p>

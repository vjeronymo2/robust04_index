			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at One" program] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The Trade Development Council  [TDC] Executive Director Francis Lo says business in the region  will benefit from the lifting of the embargo, and the profile of  Hong Kong will be raised.    [Begin Francis Lo recording] I think that, with the  international business community now focusing more and more on  Asia, I think the normalization of trade relationship between  United States and Vietnam will give this focus even further  emphasis, and I think that would certainly be very good for Asia  as a whole and very good for Hong Kong in particular, because  Hong Kong is the operational base for a lot of international  companies. It is the ideal marketing headquarters for these  companies, and it is also a sourcing [as heard] center for any  company wishing to buy products from this part of the world. I  think it will actually reinforce Hong Kong's position as Asia's  trade capital. [end recording] [passage omitted]    The refugee coordinator, Brian Bresnahan, said the move by  President Clinton would help Hong Kong solve the problem of  Vietnamese boat people more quickly.    [Begin recording] [Bresnahan] I think that the lifting of  the American trade embargo on Vietnam is good news for this  particular problem. It will dash hopes amongst those screened  out in our camps--and that is most of the population--that they  might end up one day in America, they will then see more clearly  that their only future is in Vietnam, and it will encourage them  to go home. Certainly it is good news; it certainly enhances  our chances of meeting a late 95-early 96 target of emptying our  camps in Hong Kong.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you also think that it will have  the effect of encouraging people who are now in Vietnam and  might be considering coming to Hong Kong to stay there?    [Bresnahan] Absolutely, because of course, I mean, we have  already said that the root of the boat people problem has always  been in Vietnam and of course, many of the people who came here  came because Vietnam was so poor. The lifting of the embargo  will enhance economic activity in Vietnam and thus encourage  people to stay where they are. [end recording]</p>

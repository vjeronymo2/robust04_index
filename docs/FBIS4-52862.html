			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking at Sukarno-Hatta International Airport  after concluding his visit to Europe, Switzerland and South  Africa, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said all Indonesian Embassy  staff and their family members are safe in Sana'a, Yemen. He  stressed that the wives and children of the Indonesian Embassy  staff would be evacuated first if the situation worsens. The  evacuation process will be coordinated with the other foreign  missions. Since the recent outbreak of civil war between North  and South Yemen, a steady stream of refugees has been seen  leaving the affected zones daily.    Touching on the issue concerning a group of New Zealand  parliamentarians feeling agitated over the East Timor issue,  Alatas stressed that they were not given complete and true  information with regard to the East Timor issue.    According to the minister, the attitude of the  parliamentarians stems from the concern of a minor group of  people who were ill-informed about the East Timor issue.</p>

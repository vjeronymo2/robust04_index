The group has convened in Addis Ababa for the past  three days and has decided to intensify the armed struggle to, I  quote, overthrow the dictatorship. This latest move represents  a shift in strategy since these opponents had advocated a  dialogue with the authorities during their last meetings.  Ghislaine Dupont asked Mohamed Ahmed Issa, president of the  Opposition Front, the reasons for this shift.    [Begin Issa recording] All of the proposals we made to  Hassan  Gouled's government led to nothing. We, and our FRUD [Front for  the Restoration of Unity and Decocracy] allies, have come here  to discuss the new strategy to be adopted. Since Hassan  Gouled's will not understand and rejects all proposals and  solutions for a dialogue, we have decided to spread the struggle  throughout the entire national territory. We have decided to  adopt this solution. Therefore, the intensification of the armed  struggle will be carried out by the [word indistinct] wing, that  is by (?FRUD) and the (?FFD). As far as we are concerned, we  are the political wing; we will join the other opposition to  carry out our political action within the country, so we did not  come here to take refuge in (?Addis Ababa).</p>

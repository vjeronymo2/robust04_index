			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / People: BTR board becomes increasingly cosmopolitan As the next generation of BTR high-fliers gets promoted into the top jobs, the main board of Britain's ninth biggest company becomes increasingly international in its composition. The latest recruit is Roberto Quarta, 44-year-old chief executive of BTR's sealing and control systems group. Quarta, a US citizen, joined Worcester Controls in 1973 and first made his mark in BTR's valve group in the US and UK. In 1989 he took on his present job. BTR says that he has, through acquisition, rationalisation and innovation, achieved good growth in the automotive and associated industries. Quarta's promotion to the main BTR board comes less than three months after the appointment of Graeme Pearson, the 53-year-old Australian managing director of BTR Nylex, and reinforces the international complexion of BTR's executive team. Out of the seven executive directors, two are Australian, two are Americans, and Bob Faircloth, the chief operating officer, is a Canadian who has taken US nationality. The latest promotion to the board has done nothing to stem the growing speculation about who will take over from Sir Owen Green. BTR's chairman confirmed again yesterday that he intends to retire this year and said that there would be an 'election' to find his successor. He said that he would have no say in the choice of that successor. The latest appointment increases the size of the BTR board to 12 directors and a chairman. The average age of the seven executive directors is 51; on average they have been with BTR for 18 years. The average age of the other five directors is 62.</p>

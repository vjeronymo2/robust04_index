			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Revlon to sell 20m shares in move to pay down debts REVLON, the US cosmetics and consumer products company taken over by Mr Ronald Perelman, the corporate raider, after a bruising bid battle in 1985, is coming back to the stock market. The New York-based company announced yesterday that it planned to transfer its cosmetics, skin care, fragrance and personal care operations to a new subsidiary company, 'New Revlon'. It will then sell 20m shares in this subsidiary to investors, via an initial public offering. Shares sold to investors via the flotation will account for just under one-fifth of New Revlon's equity. Revlon Inc, the parent company, will own the remaining 82.2 per cent, and will continue to be controlled by Mr Perelman. Revlon said that funds raised via the flotation would go towards paying down debts, Revlon said that the maximum offering price in the IPO filing was Dollars 19 a share, which would raise Dollars 380m before expenses. Yesterday, Moody's, the Wall Street rating agency, said it had placed Revlon's existing publicly-traded debt securities under review for a possible upgrade. Moody's said it was 'focusing on the extent proceeds from the new equity issue will be used to reduce debt levels, the resulting financial flexibility at Revlon and the ability of the remaining Revlon businesses to generate cash to service debt going forward in a very competitive operating environment'. Revlon was founded in 1932 by the eccentric Mr Charles Revson. The Dollars 1.8bn takeover by Mr Perelman was a quintessential 1980s deal, heavily dependent on junk bond financing and borrowed money. Since then, however, a good deal of debt has been paid down via the flotation on a minority interest in National Health Care Group, another subsidiary, and via the sale of Max Factor and Betrix cosmetics to Procter &amp; Gamble for Dollars 1.14bn. According to recent analysts' reports, Revlon's debt had fallen from Dollars 2.38bn at December 1990, to Dollars 754m (on a pro forma basis) at year-end 1991. The Equitable Life Assurance Society, the US life insurer which is converting from mutual status to a shareholder-owned company, announced yesterday that it plans to sell 43.5m shares to investors. It estimates that the initial public offering price will be between Dollars 11 and Dollars 14 a share, raising up to Dollars 600m. In addition to shares being sold in the IPO, The Equitable is distributing shares to its policyholders and to Axa, the French insurer which injected Dollars 1bn into the ailing US company last year. At the end of the process, Axa will hold between 40 and 49 per cent of The Equitable's shares.</p>

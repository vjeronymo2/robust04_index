The seven metric-ton cargo of cocaine  was seized on 5 June in Tocantins State. It was on its way to  Santos Port.    Federal Police had been patrolling a 750-hectare area in  Tocantins State for some time. The drug traffickers established  a post to receive and pack the drug sent by the Cali cartel that  entered the country through Rondonia State.    On 5 June, Federal Police stopped the trucks along the  Belem-Brasilia highway. They were heading for Santos Port, from  where the drug was going to be shipped to the United States. The  drug packages were hidden among tobacco leaves. The chemical  tests conducted on the spot immediately confirmed that the cargo  consisted of pure cocaine. During the operation, police arrested  seven drug traffickers. [begin recording]    Federal Police Director Wilson Romao: This is the  largest connection we have ever seen here in Brazil. We are  surprised at the system they were using: They had established a  real shuttle service. One plane landed after the other to unload  this cocaine. The sort of packing you have seen is very  carefully done. [end recording]    Thirty police agents participated in this cocaine seizure in  Tocantins State. There was a shootout during the operation.  According to the Antinarcotics Division, the drug traffickers  had U.S.-made arms, including grenades. One drug trafficker was  injured and has been hospitalized. Three other drug traffickers  escaped but Federal Police reported that one of them has been  found and arrested.</p>

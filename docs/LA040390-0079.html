			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SALK COMPANY FILES FOR FIRST STOCK OFFERING  </P> <P> Immune Response Corp., the San Diego biotechnology company co-founded by Jonas  Salk that is trying to develop an AIDS vaccine, has filed for permission to  hold an 2.2-million share initial public stock offering that could raise as  much as $19.8 million.  </P> <P> The company is developing an immunotherapeutic drug for patients who have  already contracted the HIV virus, the precursor to AIDS. Now in advanced  clinical trials at several medical centers, the drug would stimulate those  patients' immune response systems to prevent the disease from progressing to  full-blown AIDS, the company said.  </P> <P> The company now has no products on the market, and its AIDS immunotherapeutic  drug still faces at least three years of clinical tests before it is eligible  for federal Food and Drug Administration approval. Immune Response Corp.'s $3.3  million in 1989 revenue came from contract research payments.  </P> <P> Immune Response Corp. was founded in 1987 by Salk, James Glavin, who is now the  company's chief executive, and Dennis Carlo who is chief operating officer.  Board chairman is William Sullivan, who in 1986 retired as chairman of  Burroughs Wellcome, a pharmaceutical manufacturer.  </P> <P> In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, the company  said it plans to sell the shares at $7.50 to $9 each. All shares would be newly  issued stock sold by the company. None of the offering's shares would be sold  by existing shareholders.  </P> <P> Immune Response Corp. had planned to go public last fall, announcing an initial  stock offering of 3.3 million shares priced at $11 to $13 each. But the  $40-million public stock sale subsequently was called off after the stock  market soured.  </P> <P> The reduced size of the public offering as now planned is an admission by the  company and its underwriters that current stock market conditions cannot  support "a higher priced initial public offering at this time," said Charles  Cashion, vice president of finance.  </P> <P> A sale of 2.2 million shares would bring the total Immune Response Corp.  outstanding shares to 11.1 million. At the median price of $8.25 a share, the  offering would thus give the entire company a stock market value of about $91  million. Before the offering, the company had raised a total of $28 million  through the private sale of equity to investors.  </P> <P> The company has been busy in recent months raising money by selling equity to  institutional investors and by signing marketing and licensing deals with  outside companies. Most recently, the company sold 1.4 million shares of its  stock for $10 million to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance. After the  stock offering, State Farm's shares will represent a 12.9% stake in Immune  Response Corp.  </P> <P> In August, 1988, the company sold a chunk of its stock to Rorer Group, a Ft.  Washington, Pa.-based pharmaceutical company, for $10 million. The company's  largest shareholder, Rorer will own a 13.3% stake in Immune Response Corp.  after the offering. Rorer is also Immune Response Corp.'s joint venture partner  in its efforts to develop the AIDS vaccine.  </P> <P> Also in 1988, Immune Response Corp. sold an 8.1% interest in the company to  Colgate-Palmolive for $5 million.  </P> <P> In February of this year, the company signed a manufacturing and marketing deal  with Pasteur Vaccins and its parent Institut Merieux of France that will be  worth at least $7.5 million over three years. The French firms will also pay  the Immune Response Corp.-Rorer joint venture a total of $15 million if it  successfully introduces the AIDS vaccine.  </P> <P> In exchange for its investment, the French companies received the right to  market the AIDS vaccine in Europe, Africa and Latin America. The French  companies will also be the worldwide manufacturer of the Immune Response Corp.  drug, Cashion said.  </P> <P> Salk, 75, sits on the company's scientific advisory board, its board of  directors and is a consultant. He is "in regular contact with the company,"  Cashion said.  </P> <P> The company now has 31 employees at its plant on Nancy Ridge Drive in the  Sorrento Mesa area of San Diego. The company plans to move later this year to  larger facilities in Carlsbad. Underwriters for the stock offering are Dillon,  Read &amp; Co., Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Smith Barney, Harris Upham  &amp; Co.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Joao Lourenco, secretary of the Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA], has said there was a  positive development in Lusaka. He was referring to the  conclusion of discussions on housing. Joao Lourenco said,  however, that we cannot expect the peace talks to conclude  anytime soon. Regarding mediators and observers who approached  South African President Nelson Mandela for assistance, Joao  Lourenco said all this can be summed in one sentence: Things  are complicated in Lusaka.    [Begin Lourenco recording] I interpret the decision to  approach South African President Nelson Mandela for assistance  as a sign that things in Lusaka are complicated. Things are  complicated. Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative  of the UN secretary general in Angola, feels that talks are  dragging on. An agreement should have been reached long ago.    Before being sworn in as the president of South Africa, Dr.  Nelson Mandela expressed interest in assisting the Angolan  people in the best way possible. I believe it was on the basis  of that interest that Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye approached  President Mandela in order to help reach a successful conclusion  of the Angolan peace talks as soon as possible. [end recording]    Nelson Mandela is a well-known figure worldwide, and South  Africa is a regional power. Joao Lourenco said these two  factors can help to pressure Jonas Savimbi to lay down arms.  President Nelson Mandela agreed to cooperate. He will not come  in with new diplomatic initiatives. He will only reinforce the  ongoing process. The ruling party is happy with Nelson Mandela's  readiness. His readiness was welcomed by the MPLA.    [Begin Lourenco recording] We welcomed his readiness to  assist. We think -- we have always said this -- every form of  assistance, every step that can truly contribute to the Angolan  people finding a lasting peace as soon as possible is welcome.  [end recording]    Speaking about the Lusaka peace talks, Joao Lourenco said  that at present there is a positive sign. He said there is no  information about the accord at the present, however.

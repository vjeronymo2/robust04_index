			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Yarrow warship yard closes SHIPYARD worker Bobby Graham gazes at the strike-bound Yarrow shipyard on the river Clyde in Glasgow. He and 1,300 others are on strike for the first time in years, seeking a 'substantial' pay rise. Next door is Leyland Daf's plant where 550 workers are waiting to hear their fate, while nearby is a Nestle biscuit factory where up to 550 workers could lose their jobs when production moves south. The Yarrow warship yard has been closed since Friday in one of the biggest pay disputes in Britain for several years. The strikers want a substantial increase on their basic weekly rate of Pounds 218 for a skilled worker. The company has offered a Pounds 300 lump sum for the year to July followed by a 3.8 per cent rise for the following 12 months. Meanwhile Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday rebuffed fresh calls for the government to intervene to help rescue Daf vehicle plants. His comments provoked an angry reaction from Labour MPs in the Commons and came after Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said Britain should follow the example of the Netherlands and offer financial support.</p>

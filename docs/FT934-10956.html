			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Jubilee Line contracts awarded LONDON UNDERGROUND yesterday awarded a further Pounds 400m of contracts for construction of the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Line extension, bringing to Pounds 800m the total value of contracts awarded in the past five days, Andrew Baxter writes. Mr Hugh Doherty, project director, said about 60 per cent of civil contracts and more than 80 per cent of electrical and mechanical contracts would go to UK companies. Additional civil contracts would go to UK and overseas joint ventures. Further awards are expected in the next week. 'Even when contracts are with overseas firms, it is important to realise that the vast majority of the money - in excess of 90 per cent  - will still be spent in the UK, contributing to the national economy,' he said. Yesterday's contracts cover everything from tunnelling to ticket machines. Many of the construction-related contracts were already known. These include two station and tunnelling contracts worth a total of Pounds 130m for the Aoki-Soletanche joint venture, which includes Japan's Aoki Corporation. John Mowlem, Wimpey and John Laing won other station and depot contracts as expected. On the equipment side, GPT, the UK joint venture between GEC and Siemens, has won a Pounds 60m communications contract, while German-owned O&amp;K Escalators will supply lifts and escalators worth more than Pounds 50m. A Pounds 50m contract for power, cabling and conductor rail was won by GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group which last week clinched a Pounds 250m deal to supply 59 six-car train sets for the project. The orders are a boost for the Anglo-French group after last month's defeat in the race to supply equipment to British Rail under a special Pounds 150m leasing facility granted by the government. The order went to ABB Transportation, which will supply trains for Network SouthEast.</p>

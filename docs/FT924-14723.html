			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Austin Reed slips into red and cuts dividend AUSTIN REED, the upmarket clothing retailer, yesterday reported its first-ever loss and a one-third cut in its interim dividend. The pre-tax deficit of Pounds 430,000 for the 28 weeks to August 8 compared with profits last time of Pounds 639,000. Mr Chris Thomson, finance director, said: 'Clearly, in the face of such difficult circumstances, it is only prudent to trim the interim dividend.' The pay-out is being cut from 3p to 2p. Losses of 1p compared with earnings of 1.5p The company's shares fell 5p to 193p despite an improving stock market. Mr Thomson said Reed was confident of reporting a profit for the full year due to the seasonal nature of the business. Following disposals and closures, Reed was more than ever weighted towards the second half, he said. Turnover for the six months fell from Pounds 35.6m to Pounds 28.7m. Some Pounds 5m of the decline was due to the sale at the end of last year of Robertson, a Scottish knitwear company. A 10 per cent decline in exports also hit sales. The disposal accounted for about half of the 11 per cent sales decline in the manufacturing division. Retail, which accounts for 75 per cent of turnover, fell 3 per cent on a like-for-like basis. Mr Thomson said that despite the sales decline, the company had managed to maintain margins in both manufacturing and retail. The company's flagship store on London's Regent Street increased sales by 3 per cent, partly due to a higher number of tourists. Regent Street accounts for a fifth of the company's sales. The south-east of England accounts for about 60 per cent of sales in the company's 38 shops. Mr Thomson said the company had strengthened its balance sheet, with debt as a percentage of shareholders' funds down from 34 to 24 per cent. Net debt had been cut through the Robertson disposal from Pounds 18m to Pounds 12.5m.</p>

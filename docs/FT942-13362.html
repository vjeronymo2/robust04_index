			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / MEPs seek to tear down curtain of secrecy: A new bout of muscle-flexing by a strengthened European parliament The European Parliament is likely to decide today to take legal action against the member states of the European Union, adding its weight to Dutch efforts to overturn a move to limit public access to information on EU decisions. The Dutch government in February started action in the European Court of Justice against the Council of Ministers contesting the legality of a catch-all clause on confidentiality inserted into the new code of conduct on access to information. The parliament's legal affairs committee - meeting, paradoxically, in secret in Brussels today - is expected to associate itself with the Dutch action. This latest show of muscle by the Euro-assembly follows last week's threats to delay expansion of the EU to include four new members, and to withhold assent for the new European Commission due to be nominated by governments later this year, unless parliament's committees can hold US Senate-style confirmation hearings with each of its members. After receiving assurances from Council and Commission on the outcome of last month's row on EU voting rights between Britain and its partners, the parliament last week agreed to proceed with its mandatory vote on enlargement next month. But it has lost no time returning to the developing power battle with Brussels and member states, and seems determined to show that its new powers under the Maastricht treaty make it a force to be reckoned with. It has chosen an easy target in the Twelve's 'openness' policy, which has not lived up to the claims made for it at successive EU summits. The policy originally proclaimed right of access to all EU information except when national security, monetary stability, commercial confidentiality, privacy, or relations with non-EU countries could be endangered. But a majority of member states last December slipped in extra grounds for refusing access to documents, 'in order to protect the confidentiality of the Council's proceedings'. This clause is already being used to withhold official records of Council meetings. Parliament is likely to back the Dutch legal argument, which objects to the code of conduct on information being put through by majority vote, under Article 151 of the EU treaty, governing internal regulations. The Netherlands says a reiterated policy to enhance the rights of European citizens cannot be dealt with as an 'internal' matter, and should have required unanimous assent. EU leaders said they would opt for a freedom of information regime along US and Scandinavian lines after the fright of Danish voters' initial rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June 1992. But a clear majority of states - chief among them Belgium, Germany, Britain, France and Portugal - argue that ministers would be inhibited from taking decisions if deliberations were made public. The secrecy issue is bound to reverberate through the campaigns for and against EU entry in Sweden, Finland and Norway, which, along with Austria, aim to join the Union next year but must first win referenda on membership. The Scandinavians affixed a joint declaration to their accession treaty underlining their determination to continue with their traditions of open government, and wide public access to official documents. But the EU countered with a declaration which, while stressing its respect for these traditions and constitutional requirements, underlines that Union law and regulations will be paramount in the event of any conflict.</p>

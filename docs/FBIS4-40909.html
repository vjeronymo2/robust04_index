			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 21 ITAR-TASS -- The Russian Federation  Council today met behind closed doors to debate the sending of  Russian troops to Abkhazia to police the zone of conflict  between Georgia and its break-away autonomy. The upper house  eventually approved the move.    Defence Minister Pavel Grachev told journalists that the  absolute majority in the upper chamber voted for conducting the  peace-keeping operation in the region".    "To me, this is an order to act," Grachev said. "As soon as  the mine-clearing operation is reported over, we will get down  to the peace-keeping operation proper, including posting  sentries and setting up checkpoints," he said.    The defence minister said that the operation will begin with  the relocation of two battalions from Batumi and paratroopers  from Gudauta. Later, two more battalions will be airlifted from  the Leningrad and Privolzhskiy (Volga) Military Districts to  reinforce the group. A total of 3000 men will take part in the  peace-keeping mission in Abkhazia.    Grachev said preparatory work was done over the past few  days, particularly as concerns the mine-clearing operation which  defused a great amount of explosives and bombs in the area.  Control points were set up, communication lines laid and  material and other resources were stocked.    Asked about the funding of the peace-keeping operation in  Abkhazia, the defence minister expressed the hope that the  deputies would soon adopt a decision on funding the mission from  sources other than the ministry's budget. He said the mission  would require the outlay of 10 to 11 billion roubles until the  end of this year.    It is not yet clear whether other Commonwealth member states  will take part in the mission, Grachev said. But the question  about it will be raised at the Commonwealth summit in September,  the minister said.</p>

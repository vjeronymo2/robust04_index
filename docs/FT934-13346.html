			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Clinton survives attempts to limit deployment of troops PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is able to breathe a little easier after the almost complete collapse of congressional attempts to limit his authority to send troops to Haiti and Bosnia. The Senate was yesterday still debating  - and defeating  - a handful of right-wing amendments on Haiti. But the die was cast the night before when Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, accepted drastic modifications to his proposal requiring prior congressional approval for any such missions. Then the full chamber voted 99-1 in favour of a simple non-binding resolution merely requesting that the President seek such approval for any Bosnian deployment. Mr Clinton had survived a similar challenge over Somalia last week and on Tuesday the Senate voted down a proposal requiring that US forces serving in UN peacekeeping operations always be subject to US military command. Yesterday Ms Dee Dee Myers, the president's press secretary, reported that he was 'very pleased' that his authority had been sustained on all fronts. The White House also released a letter sent by Mr Clinton to Congress on Wednesday justifying the naval cordon around Haiti under the terms of the 1973 War Powers Act. This mandates congressional approval within 90 days of the dispatch of US troops to 'actual or imminent' hostile situations. Mr Dole continued to insist that he was not simply playing political games over Haiti and Bosnia, though this is the prevalent view in Washington. The Senator, who had earlier admitted he would oppose his own original amendment if he were president, said he only wanted to construct 'a political flak jacket,' not 'a straight jacket', for the commander-in-chief. Mr Clinton, with an eye on big domestic battles ahead tactfully praised Mr Dole for his co-operation. The protracted political debate, however, had given full airing to reservations about the current conduct of US foreign policy. Some opinions were predictably extreme. Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican from North Carolina whose backing of right-wing nationalist causes overseas has always been staunch, took to the Senate floor to brand Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted Haitian president, as a 'psychopath.' More reasoned debate concerned exactly what the US was trying to do to effect Mr Aristide's return, scheduled for the end of this month under the terms of a United Nations-brokered peace plan, but now clearly in grave doubt. The White House was, for example, obliged to deny that a proposal put to Mr Robert Malval, the pre-democracy prime minister, for an expanded cabinet was intended to give the Haitian military and police a share in power in a resumed Aristide presidency. The proposal, put over the weekend by Mr Dante Caputo, the UN mediator, upset both Mr Malval and Mr Aristide. US spokesmen insisted that the idea was to get on board the business and landowning classes that have supported the military, but that 'it will absolutely not include' military and police officials nor known backers of Haiti's earlier Duvalier regimes.</p>

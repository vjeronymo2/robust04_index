			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Emilija Geleva commentary: "Greek Embargo or a `Military </F> Act'?"]    [Text] Washington, March -- During the past few weeks U.S.  President Bill Clinton has made several important foreign  political decisions: the recognition of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM],  the resolute action for stopping the war violence in Bosnia, the  Bosnian-Croat agreement, nonetheless he did not leave out the  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which became critical after  the massacre in Hebron. In the meantime, he continued with his  pressure over Japan because of the large U.S. trade deficit and  opened North Korea's doors for the international inspection of  nuclear plants.    Therefore, it is no wonder that the majority of Americans  are  concerned about the President's foreign policy, and our people,  on their side, are worried about Macedonia's position in all  that, aware that the events in the Balkans are far from a happy  ending. Namely, after Greece's latest blockade, it looks as if  Greece is once again in the offensive in relation to the  Republic of Macedonia, although the West strongly condemned this  act.    While the majority of Americans seem to be mainly content  with the way Clinton is conducting the foreign policy, the  majority of foreign political experts, diplomats, and observers,  criticize it for lack of concept, for insecurity of power, for  naivete, and for delayed foreign political decisionmaking. What  is U.S. policy in the Balkans, naive or thoughtful, timely or  tedious?    Many of those following the events in the Balkans, experts  and journalists, have for some time warned about the increased  danger of the war spreading to the south. Some reporters go so  far, for instance the one from the BBC, who explained to his  viewers the reason why he left Sarajevo and moved to Skopje from  Sarajevo, saying he was now waiting for the war to start in  Macedonia. After such statements we cannot but ask ourselves  whether it is the journalists who sometimes create events in  order to make exclusive reports. Talking about sensitive zones  such as ours, or as was in the Gulf, it is known in Washington  that sometimes even the U.S. State Department is informed of  journalists' reports. Therefore, it is possible to push the  events violently and create an image that is totally opposite to  reality. Although many such events, terrifying for us, are  based on the exclusivity of some journalists at any cost, one  should not underestimate the persistent warnings of some experts  about spreading the war. However, they are wrong in one thing,  in their claims that the war is threatening from the north,  totally leaving out Greece, whose present act of a full embargo  against Macedonia represents the greatest war threat.    The U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, at the  so-called interrogation in the Congress Subcommittee for outside  operations on 1 March, said: "As far as Macedonia is concerned,  we have a strong feeling for maintaining the territorial  integrity of that country. We have 300 soldiers there and we  urged all the countries in the region to be concerned about  Macedonia. I think its future is of importance for the United  States," Christopher emphasized and also added: "We put it  clearly to Serbia that if they harmed the independence of  Macedonia in any way, it would generate a sound reaction from  the United States." This stance was the answer to the question  of Congressman Allver, who asked the secretary of state to  explain why Macedonia was not mentioned on page six of his  statement, where it said that the United States was directing  its efforts to the south, to Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania.  According to the aforementioned explanation given by Warren  Christopher, it seems that the document was prepared preceding  the recognition of the Republic of Macedonia, and it is totally  clear that the United States attaches extreme importance to  Macedonia on its list.    According to some State Department announcements the  situation is cautiously monitored and, if necessary, they are  ready to react, which is nothing new, if we recall that last May  the Pentagon announced that, in case of a threat to Macedonia,  U.S. planes will directly attack Belgrade. Nevertheless,  despite such mental acrobatics, there still remains the question  of how real the danger for Macedonia from Serbia is, and whether  the threat from Greece is not greater. In other words, as a  U.S. colleague said, trying to explain the Greek act, when Egypt  blocked the Suez Canal in 1967 for Tehran, it was considered to  be a war act. Therefore, if there actually is a threat to peace  in the south of the Balkans, like he said, it certainly is  because of the Greek chauvinism.    The U.S. Administration has, in this context, admonished the  Greek act and this was explicitly stated to the Greek ambassador  in Washington, Tsilas, at his meeting with the deputy Secretary  of State Oxman and Tarrioff [name as transliterated]. Despite  all that, the embargo has been carried out for more than three  weeks. Therefore, instead of forcing the threat of a war  situation from the north, it might be preferable if the West,  and even the United States, were more direct toward Greece,  because it is not only Serbia's best ally, but with the present  embargo against Macedonia, it is clearly generating damage that  can push it and the Balkans into an abyss. For the United  States there is no dilemma that it would be fatal for the region  and that it would provoke conflict within NATO.    The West should ultimately bring its "spoiled child" to its  senses and explain to it that there is no more cold war. That  is why Greece can no longer write history as it suits it, and  claim that Macedonia is an artificial product, forgetting that  it was thanks to the interests of the big powers that it once  got a part of Macedonia, guaranteed to it with all possible  international acts, to which Macedonia has added and continues  to offer additional guarantees. Greece should at last stop its  hostile propaganda against the Republic of Macedonia, stop  claiming that the Macedonian people does not exist, and of  course, it should stop interfering in internal affairs by  putting forward thousands of conditions. Only the West can  awaken it from that dream, before the dream turns into a coma.    Macedonia is not only in the U.S. zone of interest, but also  in the Russian, because Russia will not cede the full world's  leadership to the United States, especially after it apparently  stood on the side of Serbia in the Bosnian war, which implies  that its position in the Macedonian-Greek dialogue would be more  significant.</p>

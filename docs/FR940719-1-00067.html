			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the proposed change to paragraph (b)(3) requiring a preshift examination on any section that is not scheduled to operate but is capable of producing coal by simply energizing equipment, proposed paragraph (c) would require the preshift examination to include air measurements in these areas. Adequate ventilation is the primary means for assuring that methane does not accumulate in these areas, and therefore it is necessary to determine that an adequate volume of air is present. As stated previously, because there is a reasonable likelihood that miners will enter sections that are set up to mine coal at some point during a working shift, the Agency is proposing that these sections be preshift examined and that this examination include the air measurements described in proposed paragraph (c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirements for the posting of hazardous conditions found during the preshift examination are specified in existing paragraph (e) of &sect;75.360. They would be transferred to &sect;75.363. Additionally, under the requirements of proposed &sect;75.363(a), hazardous conditions found by the preshift examiner or the pumper would have to be corrected immediately. Also, if these conditions create an imminent danger, everyone except those persons referred to in section 104(c) of The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Act) must be withdrawn from the area affected to a safe area until the hazardous condition is corrected. Only persons designated by the operator to correct or evaluate the conditions would be permitted to enter the posted area. The requirement that the hazardous condition be corrected immediately is not intended to require correction by the preshift examiner. To do so would delay the completion of the preshift examination. Rather, it is intended that the condition be corrected immediately following its reporting by the preshift examiner. Under the proposal the area would be posted and would remain posted until the hazardous condition is corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing paragraph (g) that addresses the record that must be made of the preshift examination would be redesignated as paragraph (f). Commenters felt that the requirement left no latitude for recording findings of the examiner other than those listed. The preamble to the existing rule states that the reason for revising recordkeeping requirements was to ``*&blank;*&blank;* lessen paperwork burden without lessening the protection provided miners.'' This has not changed. However, commenters indicated that by not permitting examiners to record the results of their examinations, the protection afforded miners could be lessened. In response to these comments, the Agency is proposing to modify existing paragraph (g) by reinstating a previous requirement that examiners record the results of the examination. This would include hazardous conditions and their locations and the results and locations of air and methane measurements. This is intended to require the preshift examiner to record noncompliance with mandatory standards that could result in a hazard and observations made during the examination, such as changes in water levels, which, if left unattended, could block ventilation, resulting in a hazard to miners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal would also clarify that the examiner must record the results of methane tests in terms of the percentage of methane found, as opposed to being characterized by terms such as ``trace.'' Recording a percentage would provide more precise information for the reviewing officials. The Agency solicits comments on this approach to recording the results of preshift examinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, proposed paragraph (f) would require that a record be made of the action taken to correct hazardous conditions found during the preshift examination. Knowledge by mine management of the action necessary to correct a hazardous condition is important for the proper evaluation of the effectiveness of various actions. For example, if a hazardous condition occurs repeatedly and the action taken to correct it is the same each time, management should consider the effectiveness of the corrective action being taken. This requirement is consistent with recordkeeping requirements found in &sect;75.363 and &sect;75.364.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following publication of the final ventilation rule in May 1992, comments received by the Agency indicated that a change was perceived in the requirement for ``prompt'' countersigning by the mine foreman or, in the absence of the mine foreman, by the person designated to perform the duties of the mine foreman. The final rule did not include the previous requirement that the mine foreman must countersign the report ``promptly.'' Although no change was intended by the Agency, MSHA is proposing in paragraph (f) that the preshift examination report be countersigned by the mine foreman by the end of the mine foreman's next scheduled working shift. The Agency intends that the mine foreman, the person most responsible for the day-to-day operation of the mine, be notified of the information contained in the reports. Allowing until the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift to countersign the report would assure that the mine foreman is aware of the results of all preshift examinations and can implement necessary corrective actions in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal would also require that within two scheduled production days after the mine foreman has countersigned, the record of the examination be countersigned by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. This would be similar to the requirement of the previous regulation that the superintendent countersign records of the preshift examination. The preamble to the existing standard discusses removing the countersigning requirement by the superintendent on the basis that the superintendent, in many cases, is not a certified person and the mine foreman is given responsibility for countersigning because the mine foreman is the person most knowledgeable of the day-to-day operation of the mine. Countersigning by the mine foreman was retained. However, as indicated during informational meetings and subsequent discussion, the mine foreman is not necessarily the person in a position to redirect resources to address the safety concern. After reconsidering the existing language, the Agency is proposing to require countersigning by the mine foreman and by the superintendent, mine manager, or other official to whom the mine foreman is accountable, to assure that a higher level official, empowered to redirect resources, is aware of any condition requiring corrective actions. Since this second level official may not be physically located at the mine on a full-time basis, a period of two scheduled production days is proposed as a reasonable period of time for countersigning. The Agency solicits comments on this approach to countersigning the report of the preshift examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

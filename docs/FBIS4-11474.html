			<p>BFN     [Text] Chile has established its position on the UN  Population and Development Conference to be held in September.  Pope John Paul II has already criticized this conference.    Sernam [National Women's Secretariat] Director Josefina  Bilbao explained Chile's position on this conference which will  be held in Cairo.    She explained that, during the conference, Chile will  express  its opposition to abortion, an issue that will be discussed and  which has been harshly criticized by Pope John Paul II. But the  Chilean position differs from that of the Vatican in that it  upholds that there is more than one type of family.    Bilbao said that the National Family Council believes this  concept also encompasses common-law marriages and single-parent  families. She added that Chile supports birth control, which  has been practiced in our country for the past 30 years.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: British Vita launches Pounds 73.4m rights for possible takeovers BRITISH VITA, the Manchester-based polymer, fibre and foam company, is raising about Pounds 73.4m through a 1-for-5 rights issue to finance possible future acquisitions. Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive, said the company had no specific targets but wanted to be ready if opportunities, principally in Europe, arose. Mr Bob McGee, chairman, said: 'We are at a crossroads right now, and we want to drive on into Europe'. The rights issue, which is fully underwritten, is being arranged by Kleinwort Benson Securities and is priced at 212p. The shares fell 7p to 258p yesterday. The company also announced a slight drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 50.4m (Pounds 54.2m) for the year to end-December. The fall was due to a lower contribution from associates which dropped to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 5.9m). The company's share of losses from Spartech, its 29 per cent-owned US associate, totalled Pounds 2.3m. Sales in the UK and Spain were affected by recession but in Germany, the company's largest market after the UK, demand remained stable. Earnings fell to 16.9p (18.8p). The directors are recommending a final dividend of 3.6p to make a total of 7.05p (6.7p). Acquisitions made during the year in the Netherlands and US cost Pounds 43m. Gearing increased slightly to 20 per cent on shareholders funds of Pounds 164m. COMMENT Calling on shareholders in current market conditions without a specific reason is a little cheeky. But judging from the share price, which remained firm after an initial drop, British Vita has got away with it. That is partly because of the company's good track record, and partly because even its problem areas look containable. Its US associate has already been refinanced and made a small operating profit in the first quarter. Spain will take longer to turn round, but is small in comparison with the rest of the group. British Vita's strategy of picking up small acquisitions through Europe has already proved fruitful, and the company's decentralised management structure is likely to throw up increasing possibilities. Pre-tax profits for this year of about Pounds 59m put the shares on an adjusted earnings multiple of 15. While investors may want to take up their rights, the shares are fully valued.</p>

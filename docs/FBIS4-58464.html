			<p>BFN     [Text] President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani today received  Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan. During this meeting  the president referred to the incident of the Iranian plane  crash in the Karabakh region as a bitter and unpleasant tragedy  and stressed it would not serve the two countries' interests to  leave the true cause of this tragedy unclear. Iran expects the  outcome of the investigating team's work to be made available as  soon as possible so as to inform the people of the two countries  and particularly the families of the victims. Iran expects that  if negligence is proved the culprit is punished.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to this incident as one of  the sinister consequences of the futile war between the  republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia in the Karabakh region. He  added: Resorting to military force is not a suitable alternative  for resolving the Karabakh dispute, and this war will have no  military victor.    Stressing the need for finding a political and peaceful  solution to the Karabakh conflict, the president reiterated  Iran's readiness to help stop more bloodshed and homelessness of  this region's people.    The Armenian vice president, in the course of this meeting,  said the objective of his visit to Iran is to provide some  explanations to the cause of the Iranian C-130 plane crash. He  offered condolences and conveyed the deep regret of the Armenian  Government to the Iranian Government and people, particularly to  the families of the victims, and said: I will personally pursue  this case until the cause of the Iranian plane crash is cleared,  and I shall inform the Iranian Government of the outcome.    He also presented a report to the president on the latest  developments of the Karabakh conflict.</p>

[passage  omitted]    Asked to comment on a connection between the Syrian presence  in Lebanon and the situation in the south, he said there is no  such connection. He added: Since there is a clear  international decision to implement UN Security Council  Resolution 425, let the major powers pressure Israel to  implement it.    He said the Syrian presence in Lebanon is an issue that  concerns only the Lebanese and Syrian Governments.    Commenting on the peace process, Junblatt asserted that  there  can be no peace between the strong and the weak. He asked:  Could 'Arafat regain Jerusalem, get rid of the settlements, and  establish a state on his own?    Junblatt said there are ambiguous points in Oslo's secret  agreement and Washington's public agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

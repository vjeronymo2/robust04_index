Chu, Korean agent of the French arms dealer, is believed to  be either in the United States or Northeast Asia. He fled the  country Dec. 15.    The military prosecution is seeking to catch Fuan in a way  that minimizes international diplomatic friction, and will  consult with the Foreign Ministry and maintain close ties with  law-enforcement agencies in countries such as France.    The military prosecution freed an Army colonel and Navy  captain in charge of overseas procurement at the Defense  Logistics Agency on Saturday, suspending the charges against  them.    The duo are Col. Yun Sam-song, head of the agency's overseas  procurement office, and Capt. To Chong-il, a division chief in  Yun's office.    The two officers and a Defense Ministry civilian, who was  also released, will be referred to a disciplinary panel, a  Ministry source said.    The Ministry said Friday [7 January] the probe had revealed  that the 6.7 million-U.S.-dollar shell fraud was the product of  a conspiracy between Fuan and Chu.</p>

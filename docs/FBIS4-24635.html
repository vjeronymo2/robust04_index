			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- The World Health  Organization awarded the Chinese Association on Smoking and  Health and the Health Bureau of Jishan County of Shanxi Province  with WHO Tobacco or Health Medals here today.    Today is "World No-Tobacco Day", on which who annually  awards  individuals and units which have made contributions to smoking  control.    The Chinese Association on Smoking and Health has made great  efforts to institute smoking controls since it was established  in 1990, said an official from the Ministry of Public Health.  So far, 26 provincial associations on smoking and health and  over 300 basic organizations for smoking control have been set  up in the country.    The Health Bureau of Jishan County of Shanxi Province has  made remarkable achievements in smoking behavior intervention  among farmers. It is trying to transform local custom through  health education and formulating the villagers' pledge which  advocates the good habit of "not offering cigarettes to guests  in public places and at social activities." As a result, the  smoking rate has dropped by six percent in the pilot villages of  Jishan.    Chen Minzhang, minister of public health, said at the awards  ceremony that the Chinese Government has paid much attention to  tobacco control and actively supported China's bid for the 10th  World Conference on Tobacco or Health.    "I believe that success in our bid for the conference would  lead to far-reaching influences upon tobacco control in China,"  said Chen.</p>

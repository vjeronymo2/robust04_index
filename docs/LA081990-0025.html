			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE KEY TO HAPPINESS IN LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> In Patrick Goldstein's Aug. 5 profile of Steve Martin, "The Man Behind the  Madness," Martin observes how living in the Lotus Land of L.A. can drive one to  retrospective depression: "One day you look back and say, 'What did I do for  the last 10 years, except figure out how to make a left turn on Santa Monica  Boulevard?' "  </P> <P> Well, it took me 16 years, but I finally figured it out: Pass the corner, go a  block and turn right, then another right, then right again, and voila! The key  to happiness in Los Angeles is never having to make a left turn.  </P> <P> CLYDE WICKERSHAM  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

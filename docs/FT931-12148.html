			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Warner Estates dips to Pounds 7.48m WARNER Estates Holdings, the property investment group, saw pre-tax profits dip slightly from Pounds 7.64m to Pounds 7.48m in the year ended September 30 1992. Turnover improved 19 per cent to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 10.2m). Although rental income was unchanged at Pounds 8.3m, revenue from property trading jumped from Pounds 147,000 to Pounds 1.77m, thanks to the sale of a large property in the Midlands. However, increased costs led to lower overall operating profits of Pounds 6.19m (Pounds 6.47m). Mr David Veaser, finance director, said the residential and retail markets, to which the group was mainly exposed, were likely to react first to any recovery in the property market. Earnings per share were 11.15p, against 10.8p. The final dividend is 7p (6.75p) to make a total of 10.5p (10p).</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WILSON LAUDS RESOLUTION OF BOLSA CHICA DEADLOCK  </P> <P> Describing efforts to preserve the Bolsa Chica wetlands as the "largest  proposed restoration project of wetlands in the country," Sen. Pete Wilson  (R-Calif.) heaped praise on a local coalition Saturday for plans to protect the  environmentally sensitive area.  </P> <P> The senator, who is running for governor, made his remarks before about 60  people gathered on a bluff overlooking the scenic marsh, across the street from  a gated, oceanside development.  </P> <P> "You can look back and this will serve as a source of pride for you," Wilson  said. "Without your efforts, this would not have come about."  </P> <P> Bolsa Chica became the focus of national attention in February, when a huge oil  spill from the American Trader spewed black goo onto the shore at Huntington  Beach and Newport Beach. The spill raised fears that the oil would reach Bolsa  Chica, a prime nesting habitat for dozens of birds, including least terns and  light-footed clapper rails, both endangered species.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and Signal Landmark, owner of the Bolsa Chica bog, have  feuded for decades over the fate of the historic salt-and-freshwater marsh on  the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway, between Warner Avenue and Golden West  Street. A breakthrough finally came last year when Signal Landmark agreed to a  compromise calling for keeping 1,100 of the 1,635 acres as undeveloped  wetlands. This was a significant reduction from the firm's original proposal  calling for a much denser development that would have included a 1,400-acre  resort and marina and 5,700 homes on 412 acres.  </P> <P> "A lot of people think that the conflict between environmentalists and  developers is an unbridgeable" gap, Wilson told the audience of  environmentalists, local officials and representatives from Signal Landmark.  "But you have proved that wrong."  </P> <P> Although the compromise was hammered out last year, Signal Landmark only  recently announced plans to apply for federal permits needed to put the lengthy  process in motion. Signal Landmark has also asked the City Council to annex the  wetlands before preservation work begins. The council is scheduled to discuss  that request April 16.  </P> <P> Wilson won praise from local officials and environmentalists, who credited his  efforts for helping to bring about the compromise.  </P> <P> "Pete Wilson is a true amigo of Bolsa Chica," Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J.  Mays said. "With the oil spill that affected the city here and Newport Beach,  it is very important for coastal cities to work to preserve their natural  environment."  </P> <P> Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, also on hand for the ceremony, said the proposed  compromise goes a long way toward achieving that goal.  </P></p>

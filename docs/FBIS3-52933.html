He was met by the defense minister, Shaykh 'Ali  al-Sabah al-Salim.    In a statement to the Kuwait News Agency after his arrival,  Rifkind said that this was his second visit to the Kuwait as  defense secretary and that he had previously met Shaykh 'Ali  al-Sabah al-Salim in Britain.    Rifkind added that the United Kingdom assessed its relations  with the State of Kuwait highly and that it appreciated the way  it had been able to reconstruct the country since its liberation  from the Iraqi aggression by the international coalition forces.    Rifkind added: In a region which is still very volatile, and  where there is a lot of uncertainty and a great possibility for  aggression by the Iraqi regime, it is important that the  countries of the region and the United Kingdom should stand  firmly together. He said: We have some good arrangements with  Kuwait, which announced some time ago that it was interested in  buying Warrior armored troop carriers from the United Kingdom,  and we have welcomed that.    He added: There is a lot of interest by the Sultanate of  Oman  and Bahrain to establish close cooperation with us. We are also  cooperating with Kuwait in the military field. This includes  joint exercises, and a large number of Kuwaiti military  personnel are receiving training in the United Kingdom.    The British minister went on to say: We believe that it is  imperative that Iraq should release all the prisoners. We know  that Kuwait is concerned about their fate and we share that  concern.    He said: It is important to inform the Iraqi regime of the  need to comply with all UN demands if it wishes to join the  world community on an equal basis again.    Rifkind concluded that the issue of prisoners was of  paramount importance not only to Kuwait but to all those  concerned on humanitarian grounds, and to those who were  interested in the fate of any citizen held in Iraq.    It is to be noted that the British defense secretary is on a  tour in the Gulf region that has included Oman and Bahrain in  addition to Kuwait. He will leave tomorrow for the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia at the end of his current tour.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / France attacks German monetary policy GERMANY and France clashed over monetary policy yesterday at the first meeting of Community finance ministers since the Bundesbank pushed up interest rates in December. Germany's EC partners all expressed their frustration with Bonn, but France was the most openly critical. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's finance minister, complained that Bonn was not paying enough heed to domestic factors, such as fiscal and wage indiscipline, that affected Bundesbank money rates and thus all other EC economies. Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in Bonn's finance ministry, hit back, arguing that Bonn had to pick up the bill for unifying the country, yet at the same it could not intervene in such private sector pay deals as the recent award of more than 6 per cent to the steelworkers. 'I find it somewhat strange that there should be so much more talk about a half percentage point rise in interest rates (the Bundesbank's discount increase in December), and so little about the Uruguay Round negotiations of the Gatt trade talks,' retorted Mr Kohler. Bonn believes Paris is preventing any breakthrough on farm subsidies, German officials said. Behind Mr Beregovoy's comments lie an irritation that France has disciplined itself - bringing inflation down to an estimated rate of 3 per cent this year compared to 4.25 per cent across the Rhine - and would be well poised for recovery, but for having to match German interest rates. However, most other EC ministers seemed resigned to accepting that Germany had had no alternative. The Commission's latest annual report, approved by ministers yesterday, paints a picture of the EC only gradually pulling out of recession with average 2.25 per cent growth this year, not fast enough to prevent unemployment rising to 9 per cent. This is just half the current jobless rate in Ireland, whose turn it was yesterday to come under the 'convergence spotlight.' Ireland was commended for combining 'a catching up process with the successful pursuit of monetary stability.'</p>

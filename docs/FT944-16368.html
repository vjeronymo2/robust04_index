			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Downward trend continues at Ciba as sales fall 2.4% Ciba, the Swiss chemicals and pharma-ceuticals group, reported a 2.4 per cent drop in sales in the third quarter to SFr5bn (Dollars 3.9bn) and softened its profit forecast for the full year, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Ciba blamed the strength of the Swiss franc for the downward trend, which was already apparent in the first half. The performance of the important healthcare sector, which accounts for 38 per cent of group sales, continued to deteriorate in the face of pressures on healthcare costs. Its sales were down 9 per cent to SFr2.1bn in the third quarter while those of the pharmaceuticals division fell 8 per cent to SFr1.47bn Sales in the industry sector, covering mainly chemical businesses, were flat at SFr2bn. This was a slight improvement over the previous two quarters, 'due to a modest economic recovery'. The agricultural sector also had flat sales of SFr847m, after a 2 per cent fall in the first half. For the nine months, group sales were down 3 per cent to SFr16.6bn, but Ciba said that they were up 3 per cent expressed in local currencies. The group said it expected an 'increased operating profit' in the full year, which was a slightly less optimistic forecast than its statement in August that net income would be at least as high as 1993's SFr1.78bn.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting One drawback of the all-encompassing earnings figure arising from FRS3 is that it is more a record of all that has been happening than a real indicator of profitability. The kitchen-sink approach of the new accounting standard makes a nonsense of comparisons both between companies and reporting periods. Hence the quest for a method of adjusting FRS3 to provide a standard measure of underlying performance. The Institute of Investment Management and Research has rightly proposed that such an adjustment should be founded on the removal of non-trading, capital items from FRS3 earnings. Profits from the sale of assets - such as property trading profits taken by hotel groups - have little to do with trading performance. Those on the sale or termination of businesses should be excluded on the same principle. The results of discontinued businesses should be left in to provide a historic measure of performance, which is the best that adjustment can hope to do. Attempting to define maintainable earnings would involve too many subjective judgments. A bigger controversy relates to the cost of fundamental restructuring. Such charges occur infrequently and can be very large. The temptation is to exclude them from underlying earnings too. But the line between frequent and infrequent is blurred and companies might use the opportunity to hide all manner of costs in their normalised earnings. Including fundamental restructuring charges in adjusted earnings would require additional disclosure at the preliminary stage. Otherwise the market would be left guessing the level of tax relief on restructuring costs while it waited for the annual report. The scope for error could be large. Indeed, the quest for an earnings adjustment formula places an onus on companies to publish comprehensive information at the preliminary stage. That could be seen as an opportunity rather than a problem. If a benchmark level of preliminary disclosure can be set alongside a benchmark earnings adjustment, companies falling short will have some explaining to do. That may be the greatest prize of all.</p>

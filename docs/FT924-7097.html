			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Letter: Fooled by own mirage of debt Sir, James Morgan suggests a magic debt mountain arose in east Germany (Finance and the Family, October 31) from a 'predisposition to believe' gilded official data, which 'started when the World Bank misguidedly attempted to create comparable national income figures for every country in the world'. The bank was in the crowd that wrongly accepted what central planners said in the 1970s. But we broke away a decade ago to search for solutions - along a trail marked by a 1985 book, Dollar GNPs of the USSR and Eastern Europe, and this year's Historically Planned Economies (HPEs): A Guide to the Data. I think Mr Morgan wrongly blames 'assumptions about production and purchasing power' and presumes that 'realising the absurdity. . .the bank never indulged in the same exercise again'. The bank's concerns were more specific, mainly about data quality; and are being answered as HPEs join the bank and provide more detail, including purchasing power parities in the UN's International Comparisons Programme (ICP), etc. The alternative technique, relying on official exchange rates, looks more absurd at present for the former Soviet Union and some other HPEs undergoing radical changes in exchange regimes. There is a strong case for a tempered use of ICP-type information in this context. Returning to Mr Morgan's main theme, the mountain seems a conjurer's mirage once it is described as internal rather than foreign debt. As holder as well as issuer of such debt, the East German government seems only to have fooled itself. It is hard to see much role there for bank data, particularly when we corrected our mistake so long ago.

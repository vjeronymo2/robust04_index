			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: TV: A WITNESS FOR THE EXECUTION?  </P> <P> Executions on television?  </P> <P> San Quentin says no. But logic demands it.  </P> <P> No one, not even a condemned person, should be required to die in front of a TV  camera. To die in relative privacy, beyond the view of the multitudes, should  be a basic right accorded to everyone, no matter his or her crime.  </P> <P> However, there is simply no good reason to continue forbidding televised  executions in California when permission is given by the person to be executed.  This has nothing to do with being for or against capital punishment. It has  everything to do with good sense.  </P> <P> As veteran reporter Rollin Post of KRON-TV in San Francisco notes about  executions: "They're being done at the will of the public, they're being paid  for by the public and they're public punishment."  </P> <P> Logically, then, the public has the right to see them.  </P> <P> Supporters of the death penalty should want to see executions carried out  instead of keeping them hidden as if they were a source of shame instead of an  expression of the public will. Moreover, those who believe that executions  deter murder should not object to giving them the widest possible public  exposure through TV. If they are right about deterrence, more exposure would  lead to fewer murders.  </P> <P> Actually, executions have already been televised, in a manner of speaking. An  especially vivid example was the powerful depiction of a man dying in a gas  chamber on Thursday night's episode of "L.A. Law."  </P> <P> As KCOP Channel 13 news director Jeff Wald notes, however: "Often times you see  this simulated on entertainment programs, but this (TV at an execution) would  be the reality of what's taking place."  </P> <P> The issue is especially relevant in California these days, where polls show  that a sizable majority of citizens favors the death penalty and where the  capital-punishment bandwagon is crowded with gubernatorial candidates eager to  demonstrate their toughness on violent crime.  </P> <P> The televised-execution bandwagon is being driven by public-TV station KQED in  San Francisco.  </P> <P> "Every other facet of the justice system in California is open to cameras,"  said KQED public affairs director Michael Schwarz. "In what context can the  state have a right to tell us we can't cover this?"  </P> <P> Besides, he added: "If we're prepared to say this is public policy, to say we  support the death penalty, then we should be prepared to look at it."  </P> <P> It was KQED whose March 15 request to videotape the scheduled execution of  convicted killer Robert Alton Harris was rejected by San Quentin prison  officials without explanation. As it turned out, Harris won a stay that at  least for now is keeping him from the gas chamber.  </P> <P> Then on May 10, KQED filed suit in U.S. District Court, asking that Gov.  Deukmejian and San Quentin Warden Daniel B. Vasquez be required to rescind  present policy on press coverage of executions on grounds that it's  unconstitutional.  </P> <P> State law requires that executions be witnessed by specific officials in  addition to at least 12 "reputable citizens." By tradition, at least 14 members  of the news media have been allowed to attend each execution, and in  California's last execution in 1967, reporters were allowed to sketch and take  notes while witnessing the death of Aaron Mitchell from outside the gas  chamber.  </P> <P> In February, however, San Quentin said it would prohibit witnesses from taking  notes, sketching or using recording equipment and cameras.  </P> <P> And then KQED got the word specifically about TV cameras. Why the TV ban? "To  ensure the security and integrity of the ritual," explained San Quentin  spokesman Vernell Crittendon.  </P> <P> Come again?  </P> <P> Just how the "security" and "integrity" of a public execution can be affected  by the presence of a TV camera, or notebooks, sketch pads, recorders and still  cameras for that matter, is a bit fuzzy.  </P> <P> TV would be intrusive? Hardly. Some of today's TV gear is very unobtrusive, and  experience shows that cameras in the courtroom are as unnoticed as pieces of  furniture.  </P> <P> And what's to intrude upon, anyway? The decorum of the event? The TV camera  would turn a tasteful gassing into a circus?  </P> <P> Quite the contrary. Frequently criticized for sanitizing life, TV in this  instance would perform a service by showing unsoftened reality, a reality  endorsed by the public.  </P> <P> "It can take 10 to 15 minutes for someone to die," said Peter Shaplen, the KRON  news producer who was assigned to plan coverage at the prison leading up to the  execution of Harris.  </P> <P> Shaplen opposes televising actual executions, though. "I've covered death in  places like El Salvador," he said. "But those were combatants. In the case of  an execution, it can appear to be barbaric."  </P> <P> It is what it is.  </P> <P> Media critic Ben Bagdikian winces at the thought. "The idea of television at an  execution is morbid, and I think it's horrible," said Bagdikian, a professor in  the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley and a foe of capital  punishment. "I think television has an insatiable appetite for spectacle and  physical melodrama, and this is the ultimate one."  </P> <P> KQED would create no spectacle or drama that doesn't already exist, Schwarz  promises. "The camera operator would have orders not to move the camera. It  would act as a neutral witness, bringing the event directly to the viewer. It  would see what your eye would see from the witness room, no more or no less.  And we would put this on late at night and precede it with a warning."  </P> <P> In addition, Schwarz emphasizes: "We're not taking a position on the death  penalty."  </P> <P> Schwarz also destroys the "executions-are-too-gruesome-for-TV" argument. "Does  that mean we shouldn't have covered the Vietnam War, that we shouldn't have  shown young soldiers getting their brains blown out on the front lines, or the  murders of John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy? Why are these images more palatable  than an execution?"  </P> <P> Bagdikian fears that, instead of increasing sensitivity, televised executions  in most cases would desensitize the public and "enforce the idea that an eye  for an eye is what criminal justice should really be about." As for televised  executions being a deterrent, he argues: "In England they used to hang and  flail citizens publicly, and all it did was increase savagery."  </P> <P> Finally, there is San Francisco Examiner reporter Larry Hatfield, assigned by  his paper to be an official media witness to the Harris execution. It would  have been deja vu for him.  </P> <P> As a student journalist at the University of Iowa nearly 30 years ago, Hatfield  was a media witness at Iowa's last execution, the hanging of Charles Brown.  </P> <P> "It took 17 minutes before he was declared officially dead, and it's something  I'll never forget," he said. "I heard two sounds. One was the door itself  falling, which was a loud crack -- and about as loud was the crack of the guy's  neck. It made me opposed to capital punishment."  </P> <P> Yet Hatfield is ambivalent about televising executions. "Everyone ought to know  it's the people of California who are killing people and not some unseen prison  warden," he said. "On the other hand, if it's on television, it will be like  everything else on television, accepted and not quite real."  </P> <P> Real or unreal, however, the public has a right -- perhaps even an obligation  -- to watch it. And TV is the way to bring it to them.  </P></p>

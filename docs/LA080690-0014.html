			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Raid!: Ronald Reagan appeared in Fresno at a fund-raiser late last week and  ended up eating bugs. The former President was plagued by a swarm of gnats  buzzing the podium.  </P> <P> Reagan swatted at the bugs, coughed several times and said: "Some of these  gnats got inside." He took a gulp of water and said: "They don't taste good at  all," drawing a laugh from the crowd.  </P> <P> Too Many Tammys: Tammy Faye Bakker and her daughter, Tammy Sue Bakker Chapman,  recently went to the federal prison in Minnesota where patriarch Jim Bakker,  the fallen evangelist, is serving 45 years for defrauding his followers. The  three kicked around possible names for Tammy Sue's expected baby. Jim suggested  Tammy, but the two women frowned and Tammy Sue said: "No, Dad, no -- not  another Tammy."  </P> <P> Dabbling Dean: Deborah Gore Dean, still embroiled in the ongoing investigation  of the Housing and Urban Development scandals, now runs an antique shop called  the Proud American in Washington's ritzy Georgetown section. But the embattled  former HUD official still dabbles in lobbying, though she says her firm is  "breathing shallow . . . just a blip on the screen." Many say Dean was the main  string-puller for HUD's questionable housing projects.  </P> <P> Cheaper by the Dozen: Valley View Hospital in Glenwood Springs, Colo., has its  own rewards for loyalty. When Vicki Kesler went there for the birth of her 12th  child -- the seventh to be delivered at Valley View -- the hospital provided  its services free.  </P> <P> "I thought it would be nice to do something for them because they had supported  us so much over the years," said John Johnson, the hospital administrator.  </P> <P> Kesler, whose husband is an engineer, said that anytime she is asked to list  her profession, she writes: "The Kesler home, as mother of 12. That should be  sufficient."  </P></p>

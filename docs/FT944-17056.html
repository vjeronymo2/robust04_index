			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Walesa in clash over military A tug of war between President Lech Walesa and the Polish government over control of the armed forces broke into the open yesterday. Mr Walesa demanded the resignation of Mr Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the defence minister, who is opposing moves to bring the military under the control of the general staff. The latter answer directly to the president. Mr Kolodziejczyk is refusing to quit, according to ministry officials. Last week at Drawsko, in northwestern Poland, the military high command present at an annual training session expressed lack of confidence in Mr Kolodziejczyk, retired Warsaw Pact admiral. Statements backing Mr Walesa's efforts to have him replaced have brought the military into the political arena for the first time since democracy was restored five years ago.</p>

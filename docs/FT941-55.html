			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: AGF hit by losses on banking side Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the state insurance group scheduled for privatisation by the French government later this year, yesterday announced a sharp fall in net profits, of 35 per cent to FFr977m (Dollars 171.4m) in 1993, from FFr1.49bn in 1992. It blamed heavy losses from its banking interests. Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, the former banker earlier this year appointed chairman of AGF to orchestrate its sale to the private sector, said the group was on course for a return to profits growth in 1994. He disclosed that AGF was in talks with the economy ministry over a capital increase to raise cash for its own purposes, as part of the state share sale. Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurer, which is due to be privatised this spring, has already secured the government's agreement for a capital increase. AGF was affected last year by the competitive state of the French insurance industry, and by the increase in claims resulting from the floods in France last autumn. However, its main problem was the loss on its holdings in two financial companies, Comptoir des Entrepreneurs (29.7 per cent) and Banque du Phenix (100 per cent). Both businesses plunged into the red because of heavy writedowns on their French property interests. AGF's share of their losses amounted to FFr2.52bn in 1993.</p>

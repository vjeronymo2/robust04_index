			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jozo Culic in Bonn] </F>   [Excerpt] The third round of the talks -- initiated by the  Croats -- began in Bonn at 0900 today [10 January]. Presidents  Tudjman and Izetbegovic, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic,  Mile Akmadzic, foreign minister of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna, and adviser Martic and others are continuing their  talks on a cease-fire, the delineation of borders, access to the  sea at Ploce, and mutual Croat-Muslim relations in the future.    The details of the Croatian text -- in which Zagreb, we have  learned from well-informed sources, is seeking 17.5 percent of  the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina for the Croats in the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna and is not allowing the Muslims in any  way to take control of Neum -- have not been made public.    Izetbegovic last night agreed in principle to the Croat  proposal that offers peace, but the Muslims are very tough when  it comes to the details. It seems that the Muslims have  objections regarding Mostar; in central Bosnia they are seeking  to obtain virtually everything for themselves, and access to the  sea is unresolved as far as they are concerned.

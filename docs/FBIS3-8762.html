According to the National Defense Ministry [MON] chief, the  costs of integration with the Western security system should be  met using funds from the Office of the Council of Ministers'  [URM] budget reserves. Kolodziejczyk will accept a vice  minister designated by the government coalition on the condition  that "the person has received substantive briefing."    In Kolodziejczyk's opinion, his meeting in Paris with French  National Defense Minister Francois Leotard and German Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe ended on a note of success for the Polish  side.    "Let the French minister's statement speak for itself here:  `If the West fails to make any move toward Poland and the other  countries we should thank for the collapse of the Berlin Wall,  Poles will gain the right to call us cowards! We must no longer  keep turning toward the Kremlin and speculating what it might  mean that the current ruler there has knitted his brow," the MON  chief quoted his French opposite number during a press  conference convened in Gdynia.    Before the end of this year, joint military maneuvers will  be  carried out by Polish and Western army units. However, the aim  is to create so-called small tactical forces, which will allow  our armed forces to keep the costs to a minimum. Kolodziejczyk  maintains that this will allow a reduction of the estimated  expenditure on operations aimed at military integration with the  Western European Union to 250 billion zlotys [Z].    "I will not be looking for that money within the ministry;  it  should come from URM budget reserves. We will be able to find  funds for the current year, but I am afraid that, in the future,  we may face an embarrassing situation: We may be forced to  admit that we do indeed want integration very much but that we  cannot quite afford it."    Kolodziejczyk announced that "for legislative reasons, it is  necessary to appoint a parliamentary under secretary of state to  MON.    "I know that the Democratic Left Alliance has set its heart  on its own candidate, and I am even quite ready to accept him as  vice minister, provided he will have received substantive  briefing, enabling him to cooperate with me."</p>

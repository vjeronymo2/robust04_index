			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Museum for the man in the street - How user-friendly is the V&amp;A? Antony Thorncroft talks to Mrs Esteve-Coll ALMOST FIVE years ago Elizabeth Esteve-Coll took over as director of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum to a barrage of criticism unprecedented even in the bitchy world of museum politics. Previous V&amp;A directors disparaged her intellect; senior members of staff howled their protest at her supposed Philistinism. She was seen to be a Thatcherite appointment, under orders to bring market forces into what was seen as a cosy society of indolent, pampered, curators. Her expressed wish to open up the V&amp;A to the man in the street, making the collection accessible to a wider audience through detailed labels and audio visual presentations, struck at the traditional view of the museum as a place where scholars could quietly enjoy the finest collection of Renaissance bronzes outside Italy, or study an unrivalled array of Georgian furniture. In January Mrs Esteve-Coll starts her second five year term. Her re-appointment by her Trustees offers a good opportunity to assess her radical stewardship. How far has she changed her vision into reality? Well, in the numbers game the V&amp;A scores heavily, with attendances up 26 per cent this year to date, to over 880,000. The museum looks much better, simply sparkling with new galleries - for Indian art, for Chinese, for Japanese, with a refurbished 20th century gallery opening next week, and one devoted to Korean art in December. Large exhibitions are reappearing at the V&amp;A, like the successful Visions of Japan and the unsuccessful Sovereign, a celebration of 40 years a Queen. The gleam of Mrs Esteve-Coll shines brightest in the Choi gallery of Chinese art. It was financed by a Hong Kong businessman. Its content was determined by market research into what the public wants. It covers Chinese culture through universal themes - displays devoted to eating and drinking, worship, ruling, burial, etc - themes with which a modern family visiting the V&amp;A on a Sunday afternoon can relate and a world away from the traditional cabinets crammed with a hundred Tang horses and two hundred Ming vases. She is quite explicit. 'The role of this museum is education. That was why it was founded - to improve the taste of the general public in art and design, and to improve the taste of manufacturing industry. In the last five years we have gone back to these first principles.' This means that the museum is now heaving with school parties. Eighteen months ago 10,000 children visit the V&amp;A. Now it is 50,000 a year. By 1994 it will have risen to 100,000. They will gather in the converted Old Boiler House gallery which becomes an educational centre. This return to first principles is linked to the new national curriculum and the willingness of Government and industry to finance such expansion. All through the Esteve-Coll reign at the V&amp;A there has been this close interweaving between change and money. It is not hard to notice that most of the new galleries concentrate on oriental art - that is where sponsorship is forthcoming. Critics bemoan the fact that one of the traditional strengths of the V&amp;A - its English furniture collection - has not received such lavish renovation. Who would pay for the overhaul? Mrs Esteve-Coll is undoubtedly alive to the links between art and finance. She has supported her Trustees over the introduction of a voluntary donation from visitors, which brings in Pounds 1m a year. She is proud of the fact that this month saw the start of a series of travelling exhibitions of the V&amp;A treasures in Japan, with the useful fee compensating for their temporary loss. But she is adamant that the driving force behind her changes is much more mundane than making the museum a cost effective business. 'Most of our developments are driven by the condition of the roof'. That is why the Indian gallery received early treatment: its roof actually leaked. Now the hunt is on for money to patch up the Sculpture Court and the Raphael Court. But where does this leave the scholar and the aesthete? Unlike the average visitor he might not welcome the relabelling of the Donatello sculptures, with large graphic panels relating the sculptor to the Italian Renaissance. He might want to examine a hundred George II chairs or as many Victorian fabrics, looking for marginal differences. It leaves him in Battersea or Olympia where the V&amp;A has stored away in warehouses 350,000 objects which are readily available to anyone interested. Is there then a two layered V&amp;A, the spruced up South Kensington Museum, making the arts and crafts of the world accessible to the general public, and out-stations for the scholars? No, the layers stretch on up to the fourth floor of South Kensington where there are still many of the V&amp;A's 154 galleries which have lain undisturbed for half a century or more. Elizabeth Esteve-Coll is aware of the problem. She is moving on from the Art and Design departments, which display art in context, to the Methods and Technologies galleries, which concentrate on a single medium. Glass is the first to get the treatment, with the result that by January 1994 98.5 per cent of the V&amp;A's holdings will be on display. It would be naive to believe that the V&amp;A is now a settled, placid, ship like the National Gallery. Brimming with nervous energy Mrs Esteve-Coll is constantly pushing - pushing the scholars for more publications, the Government for more money to shore up the building, the staff to smile more; herself with a hectic schedule to keep sponsors sweet. The overwhelming impression is of activity. A constant flow of new exhibitions: of sporting trophies, including the Ashes, in November; of the new silver commissioned for 10 Downing Street in January; and the costume designs for the frothy TV success House of Eliott later next year. Then there is the plethora of new galleries - one devoted to Frank Lloyd Wright in January follows on the Korean and the 20th century. There is perhaps an air of uneasy compromise about the place. The dodging of the admission charge issue; the revitalised galleries being sponsorship led; the gulf between the undoubted scholarship that thrives at the V&amp;A with the exhibitions of work by hip graphic designer Neville Brody, an unconvincing show of pop ephemera, and a free plug for Elton John's collection before its sale at Sotheby's. But undoubtedly Mrs Esteve-Coll has survived and brought her vision - 'the professionalisation of the whole museum' - to some sort of fulfilment. The V&amp;A looks better, is more exciting, has a wider appeal, and is humming as never before.</p>

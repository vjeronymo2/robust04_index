			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Dispute over Etonbrook stake Etonbrook Properties, the development and dealing group, said yesterday that there had been a dispute as to the beneficial entitlement to 373,000 shares, some 9.74 per cent of its ordinary equity, currently registered in the name of Palmerston Investment Trust. Etonbrook had received a notice from Mr Andrew Perloff, which seeks to prevent the registration of the transfer of these shares to any other parties. The company understood that the reason for the notice was that a group of existing shareholders, including Mr Keith Moss, managing director, believed that they were entitled to these shares.</p>

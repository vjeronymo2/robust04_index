			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- A regular sitting of the Interregional  Deputies Faction -Center (MDF-Tsentr) [Mizhrehionalna Deputatska  Fraktsiya-Tsentr] on 5 May discussed the results of faction  members' participation in working groups preparing for the first  session of Ukraine's Supreme Council. In particular they  discussed adopting the rules and determining the agenda of the  first sitting. It was recognized that faction members should  support the adoption of temporary rules, which would combine  everything progressive from the rules of the previous Supreme  Council, but would give greater advantages to deputies factions  and groups.    Leonid Kuchma, cochairman of the Interregional Reform Bloc,  proposed that they take a stand on which candidate to support  for the post of speaker by the next MDF-Tsentr session. During  the discussion Oleksandr Moroz, Vasyl Durdynets, Ruslan Bodelan,  chairman of Odessa oblast council, and Volodymyr Hrynyov were  named. Expressing a personal point of view, Leonid Kuchma  stressed that he will hardly be able to support Vasyl Durdynets,  although he respects his executive skills. As the other  cochairman of the Interregional Reform Bloc -- Volodymyr Hrynyov  -- has not yet made a final decision on whether to contend for  the speaker's seat, the decision to support one or other  contender was postponed until the next sitting of the faction,  planned for 10 May.    Leonid Kuchma told a UNIAN correspondent that he is  convinced  that at least several dozen deputies from among those who "have  been forced to sign documents of other factions because of their  official position or who have not yet adopted a final position,"  will join the MDF-Tsentr faction within a few days of the new  parliament beginning work.</p>

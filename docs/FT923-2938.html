			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Stena Line predicts return to the black STENA LINE, the Swedish shipping and ferry group, said it was on course to make a profit of more than SKr250m (Dollars 48.8m) in 1992, marking a recovery from last year's loss of SKr302m. Mr Bo Lerenius, chief executive of Stena Line, said he expected profits (after net financial items) to exceed SKr250m 'provided the economic situation does not worsen still further during the autumn'. Stena Line swung to a loss of SKr302m in 1991 partly due to losses incurred by Sealink, its UK ferry operations. The group was forced to carry out a number of cost-cutting measures which included a pay freeze for Sealink employees in 1992 and the closure of its Folkestone-Boulogne ferry route. Stena Line said the recovery in profits was due to the combination of the cost-cutting measures in its international operations and 'the continued increase in volume so far this year for the entire group'. The number of passengers travelling on Stena Line ferries has risen by 2 per cent during the first eight months of this year, and freight volume has increased by 8 per cent.</p>

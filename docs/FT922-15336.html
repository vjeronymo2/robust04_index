			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UN envoy presses peace plan on Afghan leader THE United Nations special envoy on Afghanistan, Mr Benon Sevan, made an unscheduled trip to Kabul, the Afghan capital, yesterday after holding talks with Pakistani and Iranian ministers in Tehran, Reuter reports from Kabul. Mr Sevan went straight into talks with Afghan President Najibullah. UN officials refused to comment on the meeting. Diplomats in Kabul said the visit could indicate new developments in his efforts to convene an assembly of prominent Afghans next month to end 14 years of civil war. UN and mujahideen officials in Pakistan say he is trying to speed up the peace process for fear of growing instability in Kabul and northern Afghanistan. Earlier this month Mr Najibullah announced he would play no part in Mr Sevan's Afghan assembly and was ready to hand over all government powers if it could agree an acceptable interim government to take office in Kabul. His announcement coincided with Kabul's loss of the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif to mujahideen guerrillas.</p>

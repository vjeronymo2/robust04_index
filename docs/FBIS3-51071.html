			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Official sources told EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO on 4  January that the government fully confirmed the 1994 economic  program and the main targets designed with IMF experts during a  3 January meeting at the presidential residence in Punta del  Este.    In addition to President Luis Alberto Lacalle, Economy and  Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas; Gustavo Licandro, the  Economy and Finance Ministry under secretary; Javier De Haedo,  the Planning and Budget Bureau director; and Ernesto Talvi, the  Central Bank economic policy manager and a Central Bank adviser,  participated in the meeting at the Punta del Este official  residence.    The sources noted that Lacalle and his economic team  reviewed  last year's main achievements and confirmed the main guidelines  for the 1994 program.    The sources said these policy decisions are aimed at having  the inflation rate meet the monetary and foreign exchange rate  projections and achieving strict compliance with the  expenditures policy in order to "again" achieve the fiscal  balance target.    In addition, official projections estimate that "for the  fifth consecutive year" the net debt levels will be reduced, an  approximate 1.5-percent economic growth rate will be achieved,  the Central Bank reserves will grow again, and a deficit-laden  [as published] trade balance will be achieved.    The program keeps a 33 percent ceiling for the public  sector's salary increases in 1994, including an additional  2.7-percent increase for the settling of accounts and 9-percent  adjustments in May and September.  <H5>  Spending Constraints </H5>   The sources explained that the implementation of a number of  measures was confirmed given the 1993 salary adjustments and the  loss of some financing sources prompted by tax reductions.  These measures will allow the government to achieve a fiscal  balance during its last year of administration, thus closing a  $270 million fiscal gap, involving about two percentage points  of the GDP.    The aforementioned measures include limiting current  expenditures to 90 percent of those actually incurred in 1993,  cutting back on investments in central administration and public  enterprises, adjusting for lower unbudgeted expenditures, and  increasing ANCAP [National Administration of Fuels, Alcohol, and  Portland Cement] and UTE [State Electric Power and Telephones]  rates by another 10 percent. The 10-percent increase in ANCAP  and UTE rates already has been partially implemented through the  November and December adjustments.</p>

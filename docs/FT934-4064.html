			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Observer: Lucas's loss Richard Giordano's appointment as the new chairman of British Gas is good news for British Gas, but it is upsetting for Lucas Industries, which is also in need of a new chairman. Giordano joined the Lucas board last March and has been chairing the nominations committee charged with finding a replacement for Sir Anthony Gill, Lucas's 63-year-old chairman and chief executive. Having finally persuaded George Simpson, British Aerospace's deputy chief executive, to take over as Lucas's ceo, Giordano was also supposed to assist in the smooth handover of the executive leadership. Giordano had seemed firm favourite to take over as non-executive chairman from Sir Anthony. But Giordano is off to British Gas on January 1, so he will not have a lot of time left to help Lucas, where the new chief executive does not start until May. The net result is that the agonisingly slow reshuffle at the top of Lucas is going to take even longer.</p>

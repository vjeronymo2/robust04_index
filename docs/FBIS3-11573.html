			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast] </F>   [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Bernard Pallais has  been summoned to testify in the Jean Paul Genie murder trial.  The judge advocate today summoned Pallais to testify as a  witness in the trial against eight security escorts of General  Humberto Ortega, chief of the Nicaraguan Army, for the murder of  a young man in 1990.    At the time of the crime, Pallais was deputy government  minister and was involved in the investigations, according to  Judge Advocate Lieutenant Lester Gallo, who explained to Pallais  the reasons behind his being called to testify. The military  court last month opened the trial in connection with the death  of Jean Paul Genie Lacayo, who was sprayed with gunfire when he  attempted to drive past a military caravan along the road to  Masaya on the outskirts of Managua. Gen. Humberto Ortega made  statements [words indistinct] as a defendant, and, after the  inquiry concluded, the judge advocate asked him not to leave  Managua. This was interpreted by the press as a form of house  arrest. The restraining order will be in force throughout the  duration of the murder trial, which, according to defense  attorney Mariano Barahona, could last anywhere from three weeks  to more than a month.    Deputy Foreign Minister Pallais is a member of the  Tripartite  Commission created by Violeta Chamorro's government to  investigate the murders of former contras, which took place  between 1990-1992 -- murders to which members of the EPS  [Sandinist People's Army] have been linked. This commission  also includes members of the Catholic Church and the OAS, and it  has pointed its finger at the EPS as a violator of human rights  in light of the fact that the EPS failed to try those soldiers  allegedly responsible for the murders.</p>

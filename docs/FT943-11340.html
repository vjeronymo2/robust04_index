			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Food retailing Things have reached a pretty pass in the UK grocery industry when the two biggest chains believe the best means of expanding is to scrap over a small Scottish retailer such as William Low. But that battle may yet be seen as the last hurrah of industry consolidation heralding a more mature era. Scotland is the last area of the country to be carved up. It is significant that both bidders highlight the need to recycle rather than add capacity. All superstore groups are scaling back their once manic opening programmes - although that partly reflects a stricter planning regime. The average cost of superstores has fallen. The big groups are depreciating their assets more prudently, providing greater comfort about the quality of future earnings. The superstore chains have stamped their authority on the market by trimming prices - albeit at a cost to their gross margins. Diversification plans are developing in product ranges, geographical areas and store formats. Add the accelerating economic recovery and it is easy to understand why the sector has outperformed by 12 per cent over the past three months. But the dawn of that new era may prove false. Asda and Gateway, which started the pricing turbulence last year, may now be appreciating the relative price stability. But Kwik Save could prove the next disruptive force. Squeezed between the hard discounters and superstores, it may be tempted to give deep price cuts another go.</p>

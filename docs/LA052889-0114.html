			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIVIDE AND CONQUER  </P> <P> In Barry Horstman's May 23 article ("Supervisors OK Growth Compromise That  Pleases Neither Side"), a misunderstanding of Bob Glaser's past growth support  was made.  </P> <P> It was Citizens for Limited Growth that gathered signatures and put the "slow  growth" initiative on the ballot. Glaser and San Diegans for Managed Growth  encouraged and supported the opposing ballot measure, and we therefore lost  with a divided vote. The best way to win an election is to divide the vote, and  I hope we will remember this example when we have another citizen ballot  measure.  </P> <P> RUTH DUEMLER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

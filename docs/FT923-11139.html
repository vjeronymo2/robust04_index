			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Arts: Hail and farewell at Glyndebourne - Opera 'Well, that's that,' said Sir George Christie, appearing on stage last Thursday after the final curtain calls of the 1992 Glyndebourne Festival's final performance. He was in his best dry, throwaway vein, and proceeded to give a model demonstration of the uses of English understatement in end-of-term speeches of the kind. For 'that', after all, was not just an incandescent account of Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades - one of this season's two new stagings, and one of the outstanding events in festival history - but the last full-scale performance in a theatre on the point of being knocked down and totally re-built. In fact, that was even then not quite that for the theatre itself. The following evening it fired into action one last time, for a gala audience (aptly thanked by Sir George for paying 'extortionate prices') and a stage full of Glyndebourne opera stars past and present: Montserrat Caballe, Frederica von Stade, Ruggero Raimondi and Felicity Lott among the singers, Janet Baker, Elisabeth Soderstrom and Geraint Evans in speaking, memory-recalling roles, and the LPO and Glyndebourne Chorus conducted by the current and former Glyndebourne music directors, Andrew Davis and Bernard Haitink. The early-evening concert, which is said to have earned the re-building fund a cool Pounds 700,000, was given a delayed transmission on BBC2 - so that those of us watching and listening at home had the splendid post-prandial firework display as visual accompaniment to the closing item of the programme, the Figaro overture. On May 28 1934, that opera launched activities in the old theatre; if all goes according to plan, it will do the same in the new, exactly 60 years later. The choice, like most of the others on the gala programme, was cunningly devised to reflect peaks of achievement over the 58-year span of Glyndebourne's existence. Choruses from Idomeneo, Macbeth and The Rake's Progress, the final scenes of Monteverdi's Ulisse and Strauss's Capriccio, and diverse items from Don Giovanni, Il barbiere di Siviglia, Porgy and Bess and Peter Grimes (the other new production of the 1992 season) made up a tapestry skilfully woven out of specially significant and colourful Glyndebourne artistic threads. It was, as gala concerts go, a decent affair - not exactly scintillating (but then galas seldom are), not managing to infuse authentic Glyndebourne magic into the various operatic highlights (except during Cynthia Haymon's ravishing Gershwin 'Summertime'), but unfolded with dignity and tact. In another way, indeed, it afforded the wider world a truthful glimpse into the heart of the extraordinary Glyndebourne enigma: the enterprise, unsubsidised by state money and wholly dependent on the top end of the paying public, that has preserved consistently - and, increasingly in the modern world, incomparably - high, serious standards of opera-performance. However much glitz and conspicuous consumption there may be on the picnic lawns, in the theatre the rule has been productions long-rehearsed and musically responsible, and above all a telling closeness of contact between singers, players and audiences. With the years, and particularly with the various attempts at enlargement of the 1950s, that intimacy was bought at a price: as Christie puts it in his foreword to the 1992 programme book, 'with middle age (the theatre) has increasingly looked like Tom Kitten. We all have great affection for it, but the waistcoat buttons are fit to burst.' In truth it has never been a comfortable theatre either for performers or audiences (who on hot summer evenings have particularly felt the pinch of their too-tight dinner-jackets and trousers while squeezing into narrow rows and cramped seats). Glyndebourne regulars treasure their long list of unforgettable moments in spite of many of the theatre's features rather than because of them. The new house will add 300 seats to the old total of 850 (and make a welcome provision for standing places at the back of the second circle). There will be an enlarged pit, not to enable Glyndebourne to contemplate the orchestrally super-sized operas - according to Anthony Whitworth-Jones, festival general director, recent rumours of a Glyndebourne Tristan und Isolde in prospect are without foundation - but to give air to the instrumental sounds and physical relief to the cramped human beings producing them. (When occupied by 'period' bands, the front platform of the pit will rise to a suitable height at the touch of button.) There will also be a much-needed expansion of wing space, and improvements of various technical and lighting facilities, though the last word in state-of-the-art stage machinery has never been considered affordable or, more important, artistically imperative. But the proscenium arch will grow by only a few feet in all directions; for this reason, no existent production is likely to be denied a showing in the new house on grounds of size-suitability alone. Whitworth-Jones insists that it is to be a 'bigger house, not a big one. We said to the architects that we must preserve an intimate atmosphere in the auditorium: this was the first and last requirement. The fact of size is not going to alter repertory policy. Of course that's going to develop, but within the context of the policy which we've actually pursued for decades - which is basically making up an ensemble-type repertory, not huge-voice-league, star-based opera.' He speaks enticingly of future prospects for Handel (of all the operas and oratorios only Jephtha has previously been mounted, in an appallingly inauthentic edition), for a renewal of the 1950s Rossini re-discovery, for the new opera promised by Harrison Birtwistle for the Glyndebourne Touring Opera's 1994 schedule (to be taken on by the festival proper the following year). Next June, to assuage summer withdrawal pangs, there will be nine Festival Hall concert performances, three each of The Merry Widow conducted by the LPO chief, Franz Welser-Most, Fidelio conducted by Klaus Tennstedt, and Beatrice and Benedict conducted by Andrew Davis. The 1992 festival, with a flawed but heartfelt and deeply considered new Grimes, an utterly enthralling new Queen of Spades, and distinguished revivals of Cosi, Jenufa and Death in Venice, closed the old theatre in grandest Glyndebourne style. I wondered whether, at the end of it all, Whitworth-Jones wanted to rush out to the demolition teams already in action and shout 'Stop, this madness can go no further]'. His smile, tired but contented, was the only answer needed.</p>

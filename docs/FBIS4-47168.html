			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu. Serebryannykov, head of the subcommittee of </F> the fuel-energy complex of the commission for questions on the  development of basic sectors of the national economy of the  Ukrainian Supreme Council: "Energy Conservation: What Needs To  Be Done in Order To Move From Talk to Action"]    [Text] The question of energy conservation generates  an extremely difficult situation, which continues to worsen,  with respect to supplying the Ukrainian national economy with  fuel-energy resources. The shutdown of enterprises and the  reduction in the work week do not solve the problem, but only  make it more complex. In addition, this leads to social tension  in the labor unions of the enterprises, as confirmed by the  multitude of their appeals to the Ukrainian Supreme Council. The  last of such appeals was an open letter from the collective of  the Institute of Energy Conservation of the Ukrainian Academy of  Sciences [AN].    As the leading experts concerning questions of energy  conservation, they emphasize in the appeal the absence of a  guaranteed system for introducing economics in the use of energy  and resources and responsibility for their inefficient use.    Over the last 10 years, the Ukrainian economy was based on  ineffectual waste of energy, which lead to an energy and  economic crisis. The energy capacity of the gross domestic  product is several times greater than in the developed countries  of Western Europe. Prices for energy resources, which Ukraine  imports, in fact, are approaching world levels, and this  increase in practice has not influenced the use of fuel and  energy.    Enterprises almost automatically include the increase in  price of energy inputs in the production cost of the finished  product, totally ignoring the question of conserving energy  resources.    According to the Ministry of Energy, industry in Ukraine  every year inefficiently wasted almost 3 billion kilowatt-hours  of electric power and 6 million gigacalories of thermal energy.  The energy usage per unit of national income during 1991-1993  increased by 25 percent, while electric usage increased by 41.1  percent, at a time when the volume of production during  1992-1993 decreased by 20.6 percent.    According to the experts at the Institute of Energy  Conservation, which is supported by the Commission of the  Ukrainian Supreme Council for the problems of the development of  the basic sectors of the national economy, one of the  fundamental means for overcoming the energy crisis in Ukraine  should be an active government energy conservation policy.    Why should it be governmental?    For all the nations of the world, even for those that have  their own energy resources, the power industry is one of the  primary factors in protecting the functioning of the economy and  the social sphere. This is a guarantee of the strength of a  government, and its independence from unfriendly external  factors. That is why the administration of the power industry  and the drafting of an energy strategy and policy are matters  for the government. But, this does not simultaneously mean that  the power industry should function as a government sector of the  economy. It should be privatized, as in most of the developed  nations of the world. World experience shows that the  government's influence on this sector is secured through the  path of development of strategy and policy for the development  of energy, reinforced by corresponding legislative acts and,  most important, with economic methods of regulation.    Today, there are two principal directions for providing the  energy requirement of the country: growth of the energy capacity  for generation of energy, as was done earlier, during the  existence of the USSR; and a significant increase in the  efficient use of energy in all sectors of the economy, in other  words, energy conservation.    The first direction is absolutely hopeless and even  desperate  from an economic and ecological point of view. Under the  conditions of a shortage of its own energy resources and the  necessity of importing oil, gas, and coal at world prices, and  in the extremely difficult ecological situation in Ukraine,  energy conservation--this is the one possible and acceptable  path to resolving the energy crisis.    The experience of the developed countries of the world--of  Japan, France, Germany, and others--which today consume markedly  less energy per person than Ukraine and have a several times  larger gross national product, supports the correctness of such  an approach.    As has already been noted, the potential for energy  conservation in our country is enormous. Taking into account  world experience, it can be asserted that not less than 65  percent of energy resources can be conserved (taking into  account the state of the economy). One-third of the savings can  come from no cost-based and low cost-based measures, which  should be carried out by a strict deadline. The remaining  measures need significant capital investment. Along with this,  it is essential to take into account that the financial  investments in energy conservation are 3- to 5 times more  effective than investments in the growth of generating power.    What is deterring the process of energy conservation in our  country?    First of all, the absence of a legislative base on this  issue, which would untie these knots that have become tangled  over the course of many decades, Second, and this is most  important, the absence of equipment and instruments to measure  energy use (thermal, electric, gas, etc.). Third, a dedicated,  long-established organizational, technical, and technological  effort in all spheres to increase the efficient use of fuel and  energy. In practice, this means that energy conservation policy  should have a legal status and should be proclaimed as Ukrainian  government policy.    The most "active" deputies are spreading the idea that the  market will set the price of energy use, and that this will  influence energy conservation.    First, today we do not yet have a civilized and balanced  market, and significant time will be required for its creation.    Second, the experience of other countries shows that market  prices by themselves do not regulate the use of energy. All of  its outlays go into the production cost of goods, which steadily  increases.    This once again testifies that there should be government  regulation of energy use--that is, a joint use of market  mechanisms, methods, prices, and measures of an administrative  influence, at least during the transitional phase to a market  economy. Market methods by themselves are insufficient, they are  unable to fundamentally change the situation. The government  should establish the appropriate economic agreements, influence  the activities of the enterprises in the sphere of energy, which  would make it possible to raise the efficiency of their efforts  and to reduce society's need for fuel. Society should not pay  for the carelessness and the poor management of a few producers.    Such a long-term government policy of energy conservation  would without fail influence the state of affairs and would  ensure:    --a steady introduction of energy conservation and a  reduction in the price of goods;    --an increase in the competitiveness of production on the  world market and broad possibilities for trade in this;    --a sharp decrease in the outlay of money to pay for the  import of energy and fuel for all spheres of commerce,  enterprises, and the populace;    --an improvement in the state of affairs in the social  sphere  thanks to a reduction in need for energy and prices, thanks to  the production of highly efficient, domestic equipment  (refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, etc.);    --an incentive for the use of independent, untraditional  sources of energy--particularly in everyday life--of small-power  industry, energy-conserving electric lighting, and other  measures of energy conservation;    --the reduction of the technological load on nature, the  improvement of the ecological condition in the country, and the  increase of the life expectancy of the people. Already, the  reduction in the use of fuel in the energy complex will provide  a sharp reduction in the pollution of the environment.    Considering the importance of the energy conservation  question for Ukraine, its influence on the life of the  population and the improvement of its welfare, and taking in to  account the situation that is establishing itself in connection  with the Ukrainian Supreme Council elections, because of which  legislative solutions to energy conservation problems are put  off to a later time, we feel that the Ukrainian president could  undertake the matter and issue an edict in which energy  conservation will be recognized as a government policy and, with  its realization, organizational measures will be stipulated.</p>

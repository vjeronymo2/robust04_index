			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Environmental fears dismissed High environmental standards do not damage a country's international competitiveness, according to a new working paper from a senior World Bank economist. Industries which are subject to tight environmental rules  - particularly the chemical, energy and paper sectors in Europe and North America  - have been concerned that they will be undercut by competitors in other countries. But developing countries have frequently seen these fears as disguised protectionism. This month's meeting in Marrakesh to sign the accords in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade set up a committee to examine these potential conflicts. The World Bank's policy research paper, by Ms Piritta Sorsa, compares performance of sectors which are subject to tight environmental regulation in seven countries: Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Japan and the US. The countries were chosen because they aim for high environmental standards, she says. The study, which does not represent the views of the bank, concludes that the industrial sectors which spend most on pollution control generally maintained their international competitiveness between 1970 and 1990. World market shares in these sectors have not changed dramatically over the past two decades, despite introduction of higher environmental standards in most industrial countries, it adds.

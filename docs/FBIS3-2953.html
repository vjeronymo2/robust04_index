Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory  Commission (CSRC), said that the planned new issuance of 5.5  billion yuan in shares for 1994 will be conducted in accordance  with market situations. They will be floated in the latter part  of this year or next year.    This year, the state-owned and corporate-owned shares won't  be listed on the exchange for trading due to the current limited  conditions. And no stock revenue tax will be levied, Liu added  in his address to over 1,000 delegates from all over the country.    This SSE meeting will also discuss its working report and  budget project, revise its regulations and elect its board of  directors.    In 1993, the Shanghai equity market developed into a  national  market, with brisk state bond transactions, its upgrading of  trading facilities and steady rises in B stocks.</p>

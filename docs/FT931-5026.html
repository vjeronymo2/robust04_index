			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Lending lifts shares and recovery hopes NEWS of increased lending to British consumers boosted hopes for economic recovery yesterday and helped lift the UK equity market to a new high. The rise in share prices was also helped by buoyancy in overseas stock markets. Official seasonally adjusted figures showed that UK consumer borrowing through hire purchase agreements, bank credit cards and from specialist credit companies amounted to a net Pounds 151m in January, three times the Pounds 50m expected in the City. The news, coming after reports of growing business confidence, subdued wage pressures and last week's cut in German interest rates, added to optimism about a nascent UK economic upturn and paved the way for strong gains on financial markets. A strong start to the US bond market, which later prompted the Wall Street surge, along with heavy buying of the March stock index futures contract in London, saw the FT-SE 100 index rise to a new high of 2,957.3, up 35.2. The strength of international equity markets pushed US stocks up 64.84 to a record 3,469.42, helped by declining bond yields, growing confidence in the US economy and programme buying. The buoyancy was also reflected in Tokyo early today, where the Nikkei average rose more than 300 points initially, although it began to lose momentum after about an hour's trading. In London, government securities also closed firm, while sterling maintained most of Friday's gains, although it was hovering around the DM2.40 level in late New York trading. January's increase in UK net consumer credit was the biggest since July 1991. It reflected strong lending by finance houses to car buyers and a recovery of borrowing on bank credit cards.

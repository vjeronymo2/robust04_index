			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Legal Briefs: 10-year Bendectin case nears close THE 10-year legal battle in the US federal courts over whether Merrell Dow Pharmaceutical's anti-nausea drug Bendectin causes birth defects has finally reached the US Supreme Court. The case is being followed by corporate America with great interest even though the issues involved are relatively straightforward. The court is expected to announce for the first time a standard for determining when expert scientific evidence can be admitted in both civil and criminal cases. Scientists, politicians, lawyers and companies have long disagreed on whether and to what extent judges and juries are hoodwinked by phony or unreliable expert evidence. Corporate America believes unreliable evidence by 'experts' has been largely responsible for the huge jury awards against American companies in recent years. Merrell Dow has successfully defended itself against almost all of the 2,000 lawsuits that alleged that Bendectin causes limb deformities. From 1957 to 1983, when Bendectin was removed from the market, more than 33m women in 21 countries used the drug. The critical issue concerns proof that it is more likely than not that the drug caused the deformities. According to the US National Law Journal the parties involved usually rely on epidemiological or human evidence. So far, epidemiological studies performed on humans before the drug was removed from the market have failed to show a statistically significant relationship between the drug's use and birth defects. Attempts to prove a causal link by expert evidence based on chemical analysis and animal studies have so far been ruled inadmissible by the US courts. This is on the basis that an expert opinion on a scientific technique is only admissible if it is 'generally accepted' as a reliable technique within the scientific community. At the moment the courts are agreed that human or epidemiological evidence is the only reliable proof that a drug is a non-genetic cause of birth defects. It is this scientific controversy that the Supreme Court must sort out.</p>

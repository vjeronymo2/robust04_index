			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (KHI, headed by  President Hiroshi Ohba, President) has reached agreement with  Allied Signal, a U.S. aircraft equipment manufacturer (located  in California: Mr. David P. Burnham, Executive Vice President  for Aerospace) on jointly developing an auxiliary power unit  (APU) for aircraft. Announcement of this will be made shortly in  Japan and the United States. The APU is designed for mid-sized  passenger aircraft and Boeing is aiming to adopt it for use in  new-type aircraft such as passenger planes it is developing. The  first unit will be completed as early as 1996. Allied Signal is  the leading firm in the APU business, holding around a 90  percent share of the APU market. The belief is that by  cooperating with KHI, Allied Signal will be able to sell the APU  in the lucrative Japanese and Southeast Asian aircraft-company  markets, markets that are expected to grow.    The APU's will be installed in the rear of passenger planes  and used for such purposes as main-engine starting and powering  cabin airconditioning. It can be expected that the APU will be  mounted on new-type passenger planes that Boeing will develop  based upon the mid-sized 737 passenger plane.    The prospect is for KHI to produce the APU by making active  use of its Akaishi Plant, which is an aircraft engine factory  (located in Akaishi, Hyogo Prefecture) and its Nishigami Plant  (situated in Kobe).    In the past, KHI overhauled jet engines of companies such as  Allison, GE, and Rolls Royce and manufactured helicopter engines  by importing technology from Textron Lycoming of the United  States. KHI participated in the joint development of the V2500  engine for 150 seat-class passenger planes beginning in 1983.  Furthermore, KHI had a 1.04 percent share in the development and  manufacture of the U.S. Pratt and Whitney PW4000 in 1985 as well  as a 2.9 percent share in the Rolls Royce RB211-524 in 1988 and  decided on participation in the development and manufacture of  the Trent 800, the development model of that engine in 1990.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops 3.9 per cent despite rate cut THE BANK of Japan's 75 basis point-cut in the official discount rate to 3.75 per cent failed to alleviate the stock market's bearishness, and the Nikkei average plunged 3.9 per cent to its lowest close since January 1987, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost a net 764.16 at 18,581.79 after opening at the day's high of 19,325.47 and falling to the session's low of 18,562.63. The Topix index of all first section stocks ended 58.65 weaker at 1,359.67, dropping below 1,400 for the first time since November 1986. In London trading, however, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was finally 0.44 up at 1,070.44. Volume rose to 300m shares from 220m. Declines overwhelmed advances by 1,005 to 35, with 47 issues unchanged. The June Nikkei futures fell by a daily limit of 600 points to 18,980, while a total of 537 stocks set new lows since the beginning of last year. Total capitalisation of all first section stocks, which peaked at Y590,908bn in December 1989, fell below Y300,000bn for the first time since January 1987. The sharp falls were triggered by heavy selling by speculators and short-term investors, who had bought issues on margin. Speculative favourites plunged in panic selling as investors were forced to reduce holdings due to the declines in margin collateral values. Minebea, the day's most active issue, shed Y50 to Y414 and Kurabo Industries Y66 to Y415. Sentiment worsened as the market fell below the 10-year moving average of the Nikkei, at the 19,000 level. 'This means that investors who have bought shares during the past 10 years are losing on their investments,' said Mr Masao Ariga, general manager of Daiwa Securities' financial institutions sales division. Most analysts refrained from forecasting the expected downside support for the Nikkei average. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said share prices should bottom out between now and June. Mr Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities' equity division, said the 18,000 level would be the next support. 'Institutional investors would not buy equities at such levels but they wouldn't sell either,' he added. The overall weakness of the market was represented by the fall in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which lost Y21,000 to a new all-time low of Y615,000. However, some analysts pointed out that the major cause of the market's drop was the plunge in speculative issues. Blue chips remained above their mid-March lows on small-lot bargain hunting. Hitachi was down Y15 to Y770 and Sony Y50 to Y4,000. In Osaka, the OSE average closed 969.29 lower at 20,091.62 in volume of 32m shares. Roundup THE weakness of Tokyo drove other markets in the Pacific Basin down. HONG KONG staged a partial recovery after falling more than 60 points in the morning session on rumours that China was to announce changes in its party leadership. The Hang Seng index finished 28.35 off at 4,909.96. Turnover increased to HKDollars 2.14bn from HKDollars 1.94bn. Cheung Kong appreciated 10 cents to HKDollars 21.20 but HSBC Holdings declined HKDollars 1.00 to HKDollars 38.75. New World ended 10 cents firmer at HKDollars 14.90 after reporting strong earnings growth. SINGAPORE moved down to its lowest level since last October. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 20.20 to 1,394.06 in turnover of SDollars 90m, against SDollars 67.7m. SEOUL closed below the 600 level on profit-taking. The composite index receded 7.32 to 599.00 amid turnover of Won329.7bn, after Won388.7bn. The government's announcement of an investment package for the manufacturing sector failed to lift sentiment. MANILA rose in dull trade. The composite index put on 6.87 to 1,099.81. Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which advanced overnight in the US, was up 10 pesos at 820 pesos. BANGKOK ended on a mixed note as investors awaited news of the formation of a new government. The SET index was a slight 0.30 up at 822.42 in turnover of Bt4.99bn. AUSTRALIA, which had gained ground in the morning session, fell after Tokyo opened. The All Ordinaries index lost 8.6 on balance at 1,574.0 after ADollars 288m turnover.</p>

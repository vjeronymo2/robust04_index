			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] With the implementation of the new utility model law  coming in January 1994, the Japan Institute of Invention and  Innovation (JIII; Eiji Toyoda, chairman) has begun in earnest  the work of the Intellectual Property Technology Rating Center).  In conjunction with the shift to a no-examination system, the  Center will investigate technology preceding the technology  scheduled for patent application, will judge its appropriateness  for registration, and will try to prevent futile applications.  This service is aimed at small-medium sized companies and  individual inventors. As it begins the service it has published  guidelines for research method and application procedures.    Since under the new utility model law there will be  registration without ``substantial examination'', registerable  ideas won't be limited as under the old law to ideas with  novelty or improvements. Under the new law when a utility model  right is exercised there is a duty to inform the other party  with a ``technology rating document'' created by the Patent  Office.    In order to investigate issues such as whether the same  items  have appeared in an earlier patent application or if the  application includes an unregisterable portion and in order to  participate in the application process, the Center provides  accurate rating materials through research on preceding  technology for the items on which the small-medium sized  companies or individual inventors plan to apply.    Specifically, it uses the PATOLIS on-line patent information  database system to focus its search for five items of related  preceding technology in patents or utility models. In  conjunction with this, it presents to the requester a report  describing the scope of technology from the previous fifty years  which was listed in the on-line database and which seems to  belong to the category being investigated.    Items for which research can be requested include those  which  can be implemented immediately after application and those which  are not at the idea level but for which effectiveness and  structure for implementation are clear. As a rule, applications  are made through the JIII's regional branches or through the  region's chamber of commerce or commerce and industry  association.</p>

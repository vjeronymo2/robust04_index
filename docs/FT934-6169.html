			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Hopes rising for end to US coal strike after six months Hopes are rising for an end to the US coal strike, Reuter reports from Charleston. Mr Cecil Roberts, vice president of the United Mine Workers of America, said this week that union negotiators had reached an oral agreement with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association on a comprehensive new contract. However, the union was waiting to see written copies of the contract before calling off the six-month strike. 'We are approaching the time when we can see the light,' Mr Roberts said. Some 17,500 UMW workers in seven states are now on strike in a selective programme of action over working conditions and job security. Neither the mine operators nor the government-appointed mediator, Mr William Usery, have commented on speculation that a settlement is close. However, UMW members began abandoning picket lines on Tuesday in response to a union order, heightening expectations of an announcement following yesterday's Thanksgiving holiday.</p>

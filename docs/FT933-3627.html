			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / People: Royal Armouries in Leeds Sir James Glover, the former commander in chief United Kingdom Land Forces and a non-executive director of BP, has been appointed chairman designate of the as yet unnamed company which will be responsible for building and operating the new Royal Armouries in Leeds. Christopher O'Boyle (above) is appointed chief executive designate and moves from the Prudential where he was director of professional technical and property management services. They are actively seeking funding from the public and private sectors to enable building work to start soon. The museum to be built in Leeds will hold and display a large part of the UK's collection of arms and armour; its present repository, the Tower of London, has run out of space.</p>

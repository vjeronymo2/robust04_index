			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / French President Mitterrand in Cambodia President Francois Mitterrand of France with the Cambodian head of state, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, in Phnom Penh yesterday. Mr Mitterrand was the first French leader to visit France's former colony since Charles de Gaulle came in 1966, writes Victor Mallet in Phnom Penh. Mr Mitterrand appealed to Cambodia's rival political factions to abide by a peace agreement signed in Paris in 1991 and warned them not to disrupt or challenge the results of the UN-sponsored elections in May. The peace accords have been undermined by continued fighting between Khmer Rouge guerrillas and the Vietnamese-installed government, and by the refusal of the Khmer Rouge to participate in the elections or allow UN forces into its territory.</p>

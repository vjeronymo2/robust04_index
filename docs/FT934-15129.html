			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: TF1 earnings decline 14% to FFr281m THE pressures on the French media took their toll on TF1, the country's largest television station, in the first half of this year as net profits fell by 14 per cent to FFr281m (Dollars 50.2m) from FFr327m in the same period of 1992. TF1 attributed the decline in interim profits to seasonal factors and stressed that its first-half performance might not be indicative of the trend for the full financial year. The French media has come under strain over the past year as many advertisers have cut their marketing budgets. The reform of media buying, implemented by the former socialist government, has also destabilised the industry. In spite of these difficulties, TF1, which commands 40.8 per cent of the French television audience, increased its share of TV advertising to 54.4 per cent. Advertising revenue rose 7 per cent to FFr3.35bn in the first half of 1993, from FFr3.13bn in the same period of 1992. This contributed to a 5.4 per cent increase in consolidated sales to FFr3.92bn from FFr3.72bn and a 51.1 per cent rise in operating profits to FFr420m from FFr278m. However, TF1 did not have the benefit of the FFr125m capital gain made in the first half of 1992 from a property sale.</p>

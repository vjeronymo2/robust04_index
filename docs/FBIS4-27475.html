			<p>BFN     [Text] Chalat Worachat's hunger strike has sparked new  tension between the Democrat Party and its reluctant ally  Phalang Tham with party members exchanging heated remarks  yesterday over a Phalang Tham member's outburst against the  prime minister.    The showdown coincided with the resignation of four Phalang  Tham MPs from the coalition whips committee. The pullout was,  however, described as a normal procedure following Phalang  Tham's election of a new executive committee. Newly-elected  Phalang Tham Secretary General Udon Tantisunthon remained the  only Phalang Tham Party member in the whips' panel.    On Tuesday, Chaiwat Sinsuwong, a former deputy city  governor,  attacked Chuan for his failure to reach a compromise with  Chalat. "It's a shame for Thailand to have such a stupid prime  minister," the Phalang Tham hardliner said.    Phalang Tham leader Bunchu Rotchanasathian described  Chaiwat's statement as a personal opinion. But reaction from  powerful Phalang Tham founder Chamlong Simuang appeared more  controversial.    "We can't say who is right and who is wrong in this matter.  Everybody can express his opinions," Chamlong said.    Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa, a Democrat,  charged  that Chaiwat had bad intentions towards the both government and  hunger striker Chalat.    "I don't want to see someone take advantage of Chalat's  hunger to attack the government. It is not fair to Chalat or  the government," Aphisit said.    Chuan played down the issue and said he would not raise the  topic at the next Cabinet meeting.    "I haven't read (the newspapers)," the Democrat leader said.  "Anyway, I don't think I will talk about it at the Cabinet.  It's not that important."    But at a party for all coalition MPs hosted by the New  Aspiration Party, Chuan gave a speech which was seen by many as  an indirect message to Phalang Tham.    "Storms arrive every time Parliament convenes a session,"  Chuan said at the Emerald Hotel party. "I believe this time  they are not serious. But the most important thing is for all  of us to stick together in our ship. People assigned us to  bring this ship in to shore and we have to do it. We must land  on the Thai shore, not Bangladesh's. And nobody should abandon  the ship with the intention of being the only survivor."    Chamlong was conspicuously absent from the party. Another  Democrat, Deputy Finance Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri, reacted  furiously to Chaiwat's comments.    Asked if he would ask Phalang Tham to reprimand Chaiwat,  Trairong replied: "I dare not do that. Political parties  should respect each other. I know the shoulds and should-nots  of etiquette. I'm not that kind of low-life."    Democrat secretary general Sanan Khachonprasat said  Chaiwat's  statement was "nonsense" and added that Bunchu would take care  of the issue.    Chaiwat's unexpectedly strong remark heightened wild  speculation about Phalang Tham's possible role in Chalat's  controversial hunger strike. Although Bunchu has tried to  distance his party from Chalat, the activist has been strongly  supported by party hardliners who wrested control of Phalang  Tham's executive committee last weekend.    Over the past two days Chuan has implied that Chalat's  campaign for a new Constitution had escalated into a  collaboration of some sort with himself the ultimate target.  Special Branch police sources backed Chuan's statement  yesterday, saying Chalat's fast was creating circumstances which  might lead to an eventual antigovernment crusade.    Chamlong has been actively trying to seek a "way out" for  Chalat. But the Phalang Tham founder's suggestion that  government MPs join to draft a new constitution was rejected by  the Democrats and other coalition leaders as impractical and  unconstitutional.    Pro-democracy groups, a power base for Chamlong, have closed  ranks behind Chalat, demanding that the government abolish the  present Constitution and promulgate a new one as called for by  the activist. As the number of sympathizers has gradually  swelled at the protest site in front of Parliament, so have  fears of possible political unrest.    Chamlong admitted yesterday his party was trying to help  Chalat, but added that it was also in close contact with  coalition partners. Sources said Chamlong had also told Phalang  Tham members not to turn their individual support for Chalat  into a political stand of the party.    Chaiwat yesterday insisted that he had criticized Chuan  because the prime minister had failed to clearly explain why the  government could not comply with Chalat's demands. "A leader  must defuse problems, not allow small ones to grow into big  ones," he said.    The four Phalang Tham MPs who quit the coalition whips  committee are Sarit Santimethanidon (Khon Kaen), Sutham  Saengprathum (Nakhon Si Thammarat), Tinnawat Marnukkaphithak  (Bangkok) and Thamrong Saengsuriyachan (Bangkok).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA April 16 -- President Le Duc Anh paid a  visit to and had working sessions with leading officials of the  port city of Haiphong from April 12-14.    During the visit, President Le Duc Anh affirmed the  important  position and great potentials of Haiphong in making it an  open-door port city, an industrial, commercial, tourist and  service centre, an important transport conjunction in the north  and the entire country as a whole, and a key area for the  economic development in the region covering Hanoi-Haiphong and  the northern coastal of Quang Ninh. The average increase of  Haiphong's gross domestic production in the past three years was  10.5 percent. The industrial output annually increased by 13.5  per cent, of which the local figure (made by the local  industrial section) was 18.2 per cent. The production of the  local traditional products such as cement, woollen carpet,  footwear, garment, sea products and ship building and repairing  have been restored and developed remarkably. In 1993, some 2.7  million tonnes of goods, were unloaded in the port of Haiphong,  four times higher than that of the previous year. So far,  Haiphong has entered into 27 joint venture projects with  foreigners which were capitalized totally at some USD [U.S.  dollars] 650 million. It has also exerted sustained efforts to  improve its education, and job training work with the aim to  alleviate the unemployment in the city and its suburban areas.  President Le Duc Anh urged the party and people of Haiphong to  exert more effort to, together with the entire people of  Vietnam, step up the renovation process for a wealthy people,  strong country and a fair and civilized society.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Troubled Ford picks new sales director FORD of Britain, which has suffered three years of heavy losses and a steady erosion of its share of the UK new car market, yesterday appointed Mr Paddy Byrne as sales director. The reshuffling of its top management follows the appointment of Mr Ernie Thompson, its long-serving sales director, as chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Mr Byrne, who has been Ford of Europe's director of East European sales and export operations for the past two years, was previously chief executive of the troubled Waterford Wedgwood glassware and china group. The appointment of Mr Thompson as SMMT chief executive marks a sharp change of direction by the association. He succeeds Sir Hal Miller, former Conservative MP and joint chairman of the House of Commons all-party motor industry group. Mr Thompson's Ford background could prove divisive. Ford has voiced loud criticism of the growing Japanese presence in the industry, which it says is posing a direct threat to the existing motor industry technology base. Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, is now a full member of the SMMT, however, and other Japanese carmakers, Toyota and Honda, are expected to play a growing role.</p>

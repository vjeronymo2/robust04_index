			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Emap to expand radio side EMAP, the newspaper, mag-azine and exhibitions group, is hoping to expand its presence in commercial radio. The company yesterday submitted an application to the Radio Authority for one of two new commercial AM licences available for London. The Emap-backed consortium, London AM, chaired by Ms Joan Bakewell the television presenter, will be aimed mainly, but not entirely, at women. Research carried out by the consortium, the directors of which also include Ms Felicity Kendal, the actress, Ms Liz Kershaw, the radio DJ and Ms Sarah Greene, the television presenter, suggests that women are not well served by commercial radio in London. There is a rival consortium, which is also targeting female listeners, put together by Ms Lyne Franks, the public relations specialist. This consortium is backed by Jazz FM, the London station which recently won the new regional licence for the nort- west of England. Emap is also re-applying for its Kiss FM licence in London. If its London AM application is successful it will run the two in tandem. The publishing group controls Radio City in Liverpool and has a 29 per cent stake in Trans World which runs commercial radio stations in Manchester, Leeds and Preston. Applications for a total of eight London commercial licences have to be with the Radio Authority by Tuesday.</p>

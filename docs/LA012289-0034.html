			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> BURNIN' DOWN THE HOUSE: London's latest controversial music craze in London is  acid house (a delirious big-beat dance music, which has Brit teens bouncing off  the walls (and popping LSD to fuel their frenzy). If L.A. has an answer-music,  perhaps it's the city's new wave of psych-rock bands, who'll be on display at  Lhasaland Feb. 11. The bill features Caterwaul, Shiva Burlesque, the Nymphs and  Red Temple Spirits. . . . Cinemax recently taped a New Orleans special, "The  Neville Brothers: Tell It Like It Is," which will air on the cable service in  April. It stars the Nevilles, Buckwheat Zydeco, the Dixie Cups, the Dirty Dozen  Brass Band, Greg Allman, John Hiatt and actor Dennis Quaid, who flew down from  Memphis (where he's starring in "Great Balls of Fire," the Jerry Lee Lewis  bio-film) for a sizzling duet with Bonnie Raitt on "Closer to You," a song  Quaid wrote for "The Big Easy." But our vote for the night's most unusual guest  star goes to CBS-TV newsman Ed Bradley, a major Crescent City music fan who  sings "Sixty-Minute Man." . . . Kudos to KMPC-FM deejay Jim Ladd for being the  only rock deejay in town with enough savvy social consciousness to offer a Rev.  Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday tribute. On his Monday show, Ladd interspersed  excerpts from King speeches with anthems like Patti Smith's "People Have the  Power," Bruce Springsteen's "Chimes of Freedom," Bob Dylan's "I Shall Be  Released" and U2's moving ode to King, "Pride in the Name of Love."  </P></p>

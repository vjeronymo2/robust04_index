			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Gardening: A vintage year is on the cards - What the Chelsea flower show offers THIS weekend the Chelsea flower show enters the last days of preparation in readiness for the judges, visits by Royalty and the special charity preview on Monday, May 18. The show is an astonishing success story; exhibitors are just as eager to get a place in the show as the public is to see it. Tuesday and Wednesday, from 8am until 8pm, and Thursday from 8am until 3.30pm, are reserved this year for members of the Royal Horticultural Society. Only Thursday, from 3.30pm to 8pm, and Friday, from 8am until 5pm, are available for non-members. All tickets for the charity preview were sold a long time ago, and other bookings are so advanced that the only sensible advice for anyone who still hopes to see the show, but has no ticket, is to ring the credit-card booking number (tel:081-900-1919) and find out what is still available. The show's catalogue reads like a Who's Who of all the famous names in commercial horticulture. Indications are that 1992 is to be a vintage year. Whether interest centres on the open-air gardens or in the floral displays packed in the great three-and-a-half-acre marquee - said to be the biggest tent of its kind in the world - or in the close-packed exhibits of glass houses, garden furniture, ornaments, machinery and sundries which line avenues and fill odd places, this is a show which needs all the time that can be given to it - and will still leave much undiscovered. Among outdoor gardens is the large rockscape made by David Stevens for B &amp; Q, the do-it-yourself chain, which is constructed using a beautiful grey-blue quartzite rock in a natural way. Quartzite is an environmentally friendly rock, the quarrying of which does not harm any ecological situation. Stephens has used it cleverly in a landscape complete with crofter's cottage, stream, cascades, pool and a variety of flowering and foliage plants. Different in style and purpose are two small gardens made by Faith and Geoffrey Whitten, entitled Moving Home, and Moving Garden. As the names imply, these suggest a sequence of gardens for a young couple moving up in the world. Free use is made of container plants, to make the transfer from one garden to another easy and inexpensive. Elizabeth Banks Associates has gone in for sheer fantasy in what it calls a Paradise Garden, with five gazebos, numerous rills of water and a Turkish tent, which are said to represent the exoticism of Persia. Gillian Temple Associates has made a roof garden for Fisons, the fertilisers-to-pharmaceuticals group. A large number of features have been included, such as raised timber beds, glazed pots, sculpture, a water feature, a kitchen garden, a cut-flower area and a conservatory. Full marks for ingenuity but probably none for restfulness. More practical is the urban oasis designed by David Pearson for Yardley, suitable for the back garden of a terraced house with provision for outdoor living. It has raised beds, turf walls, arches, and space has been found for salad vegetables, flowers and herbs. Rosemary Verey describes her design as suitable for a London garden, but it would equally suit any small garden surrounded by other buildings. The staff and inmates of Leyhill Open Prison are back - this year with a garden planned around a mulberry tree. It has an historical theme: pre-Victorian to the left; Victorian to the top right; modern in front. Judging by Leyhill's past efforts this should be an interesting exhibit. The students of Merrist Wood College can always be expected to do something original, and this year they have made what they call a hillside chalet garden: a wildflower meadow and a chalet verandah spilling over with colourful pelagoniums. It is a simple study in contrasts. Pershore College of Horticulture is also a regular source of original design. This year its students are making a garden which represents a disused industrial site. Plants grow in cracks in the walls and various man-made features worn away by water are included, but the focal point is a derelict pump house and slate column split by gushing water. This is a essay in ingenuity but not, perhaps, one meant to be copied. Nor, probably, is the Uzbek Source Garden, made in the face of great logistical difficulties by Ravil Abdullin from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to represent the extremes of soil and climate in that part of central Asia. It includes features from the immense desert regions to those of the more fertile environments of meadows and thickets and it also finds space for the flora of the mountain ranges. The main marquee will be packed with exhibits from the large and spectacular to the small but fascinating. Hillier Nurseries says it is including in its exhibit of trees, shrubs, roses and herbaceous perennials the largest tree ever shown in the Chelsea marquee: an English oak, 8m high, and an essential part of the traditional English garden. Trees are also an important feature in the Notcutts Nurseries Exhibits - '40 trees for 40 years' it says, to represent the years of the Queen's reign. But no doubt, if all goes well over the weekend, Notcutts will not stop at this number. It has an interesting range of trees, some in cool storage to hold them back, others in greenhouses to hurry them along, some just naturally ready. One that seems certain to be there is an unusual, small growing, pink-flowered mountain ash named Sorbus hostii. Three Counties nurseries is making a spectacular display of garden pinks aided by Dartington Crystal, the glass manufacturer, which has provided about 100 special crystal vases and bowls for the blooms. Stephen Bailey is also showing an extensive selection of pinks and carnations containing a number of new varieties. There will also be some of the latest hybrid alstroemerias creating so much interest. Numerous rose exhibits are included, some shown in the traditional way, as cut flowers, some as naturally growing plants which, although a less spectacular type of display, always seems more interesting and revealing. David Austin Roses is an exhibitor showing growing plants flanking a central path and covering two walls. (Look out for some fine shrub varieties of the type Austin calls English Roses.) Mattock's Roses are including plenty of perpetual flowering ground cover roses. Cants is to have a spectacular display of cut flowers, and the exhibits from Peter Beales Roses is based on a new dictionary of roses resulting from the combination of two earlier books written by Beale, one called Classic Roses, and the other 20th Century Roses. The new book, Roses, is lavishly illustrated and the exhibit highlights some of its features. Bulbous plants are numerous and varied, from the many small species - the speciality of companies such as Broadleigh Gardens and Avon bulbs - to the great spectaculars of Walter Blom and Son and Van Tubergen, which this year is including a new red, pink and greenish white hippeastrum, rather unattractively named Spotty. Someone always seems to hold back a good display of daffodils for Chelsea; this year it has been done by J Walkers Bulbs. It says it will replace much of the exhibit halfway through the week, so it will be as impressive on the Friday as for the Monday judging. Stapeley Water Gardens is making a water-lily pool with a Monet-style bridge to celebrate its acquisition of Latour-Marliac, the water-lily specialist in the South of France, where many of the best new varieties have been raised. Cannington College holds the National Collections of argyranthemums and osteospermums. It is making an exceptionally fine exhibit of these South African daisies, and has itself raised some of the varieties. Burncoose and Southdown Nurseries, from Cornwall, is bringing many rare and some slightly tender trees and shrubs to the Chelsea show, as well as a big collection of hybrid lilies, mainly of the popular groups known as Mid Century and Oriental. Some spectacular exhibits have come from overseas. These include one from the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens in South Africa, which not only shows beautiful proteas, but also several succulents being shown for the first time. Machines, tools, garden sundries and buildings of many kinds, as well as an enormous array of ornaments and garden furniture are being shown at Chelsea once again, in bewildering number and variety. Some of the statues are above average in quality, but for sheer enterprise pride of place must go to Oak Leaf Conservatories. This company, engaged to restore the dome of a magnificent Victorian conservatory at Broughton Hall, proceeded to dismantle it, brought it to its workshops for repair, and has now re-erected it temporarily at Chelsea before returning it to Yorkshire, where it belongs.</p>

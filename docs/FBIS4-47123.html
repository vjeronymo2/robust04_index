			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marina Kalashnikova: "The Baltic Paradox: While </F> Trying To Put an End to the Common Past, the Baltic Countries  Are Doing All They Can for a Common Future with Russia"]    [Text] At first glance, the Baltic States can serve as a  model of Russia's "civilized divorce" from the USSR's former  republics. Their relations are developing based on the  "European" (negotiation) type. The Baltic version seems to be  the most predictable and the least disastrous. Therefore, it is  making it possible to delve calmly into the intertwining of  those problems which must be solved by Russia and the West in  the search for new principles of foreign policy and European  security.    However, as the English proverb goes, "it takes two to make  love or war." A divorce becomes civilized if both parties  observe agreed-upon and generally accepted rules of behavior. In  this sense, Russia has moved ahead much farther on the path to  compatibility with the world community. It has already withdrawn  or is withdrawing from the Baltic countries troops which may not  be on the territory of another state against its will.    In the area of economics, Russia is also offering the Baltic  States good relations. Latvia has been granted most favored  nation status. The transit of Russian freight and the proximity  of the Russian financial market are ensuring, to a great extent,  the prosperity of the former republics: Latvia is laying claim  to the role of the "Baltic Switzerland," while Estonia is  claiming that of the "Baltic Hong Kong."    Russia has even met the Baltic States halfway in moral  questions. In particular, agreement has been expressed with the  Latvian side in the condemnation of the 1940 occupation and the  postwar repressions.    Russia has covered its half of the path to a "civilized  divorce," having given up much and having lost much. The Baltic  Republics have succeeded greatly in their economic and political  "jump" toward the West: a program has been outlined, along with  time frames, for their gradual integration into the European  economic system and their insertion into the security structures  is also proceeding at a gradual pace.    But the ticket to Europe has been issued to these countries,  it seems, prematurely. The Baltic States have quite a few  unhealthy "small problems" capable of becoming the source of a  threat to security in the post-confrontation era. Building up in  the region is the potential for internal instability engendered  by ethnic confrontation, political extremism, economic jerks and  innovations, to which society is unable to adapt. Not precluded  is the threat of a local military conflict. The "Baltic  Perimeter" of Russia's borders, so safe at first glace, is not  without danger for Europe.    From the standpoint of culture and civilization, the Baltic  States have always been drawn toward the West and and it is in  this sense that their current "departure" has taken place.  Undoubtedly, the "pieces of the historical past" left in them  (the Russian-speaking population and the economic and military  infrastructures) and the geopolitical situation are still  keeping them within Russia's gravitational field. The Baltic  dualism, which, in individual matters, is changing into acute  incompatibility, is expanding the "dispute" area for possible  collisions between Russia and the West.    The chief danger lies in the fact that the Baltic countries  are rushing into Europe without being sufficiently "European."  First of all, they will hardly be able to fit the image of a  European state by subjecting the Russian-speaking population to  discrimination. In Latvia and Estonia, these people are viewed  as "colonists" and have been deprived of citizenship or have had  their civil rights infringed upon. The local parties' approaches  to the solution of this problem are often of a destructive  nature -- from proposals which bring to mind associations with  genocide and ethnic cleansing to "civilized segregation" in the  spirit of the declarations of Estonian President Lennert Meri  that "the rights of citizens and non-citizens will be  protected." However, this assumes the preservation of the  division of Estonia's population into first-class and  second-class citizens. That The Baltic States are not mature  enough for a "civilized divorce" from Russia and a final  "attachment" to the West is also becoming apparent in the  territorial claims against Russia, which Estonia is raising  especially importunately and which manifestly look like a  political anachronism.    This is the kind of baggage the Baltic countries are  bringing  with them into a united Europe and inserting into its security  structures, having already become associate members of the  Western European Union and participants in the "Partnership for  Peace" and hoping to find themselves in NATO in the near future.  The independent Baltic States, it seems, do not fully realize  the responsibility which indepence imposes on then. The  excessive aggressiveness with which the Baltic countries are  trying to become members of NATO or to obtain guarantees of  Western military assistance is threatening to make this region a  middleman in the aggravation of relations between Russia and the  West.    For the time being, Russia is bearing with restraint the  multilateral damage which the departure of the Baltic republics  is inflicting on it. It has been deprived of many bases and has  lost important parts of the PRO and PVO [ABM and Air Defense]  systems. Serious and costly restructuring of the entire  strategic military infrastructure of Russia's western oblasts,  which were formerly rear-area oblasts and have now turned out to  be forward-area oblasts, is needed. The communications system  with Kaliningrad Oblast has been undermined.    Russia's geostrategic losses are measured not simply by the  loss of its position in the Baltic region. Within the framework  of NATO, a special "Baltap" command has been established, the  area of responsibility of which has been declared to be the  entire Baltic Sea, right up to the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf  of Bothnia. Its everyday tasks include the development of all  types of cooperation in the region -- between NATO and Western  Europe, on the one hand, and the former socialist countries,  including Russia and and the Baltic States, on the other.  However, it can take upon itself the function of protection of  the Baltic States from an aggressor -- Russia, although, within  Baltap, it is considered a highly unlikely one.    By exaggerating fears about Russia's "imperial ambitions"  and  hurrying too rapidly into NATO, the Baltic States are provoking  feelings of heightened vulnerability in Russian military and  political circles. The prospect of turning out to be on one of  NATO's flanks, irrespective of the conditions of Russia's own  participation in the "Partnership for Peace," may stimulate in  them a desire to take preventive measures.    We have before us the "Baltic Paradox": while trying in  every  way possible to sever the bonds of the past, Latvia and Estonia  are doing all they can to strengthen a common future with  Russia. Not having solved the problem of citizenship and thereby  leaving within themselves a "Russian Enclave," they are  postponing their own prospects for becoming the "far abroad" and  are preserving for Russia the right to keep them within the  focus of its own "near" interests. The territorial claims and  the ardor for NATO are creating the impression that it is  advantageous for the Baltic countries to maintain a smoldering  and controllable tension in relations with Russia. But it is  hardly effective as a "trump card for bargaining" with Russia  and the West. If this is a method of national identification,  then it is too dangerous. In striving for a "civilized divorce,"  the Baltic States are proving to be insufficiently "civilized"  for it. While parting with Russia, the Baltic States are still  not ready to join Europe.</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARCH START SEEN FOR SHERIFF'S DNA LAB;  </P> <P> FORENSICS: TESTING OF DNA EVIDENCE FOR COURT USE IS PROJECTED TO BEGIN ABOUT  FOUR MONTHS LATER THAN SOME COUNTY SUPERVISORS EXPECTED.  </P> <P> A DNA laboratory approved by the Board of Supervisors last fall should be ready  in March to test samples for use as evidence in court, Sheriff's Department  officials said Monday.  </P> <P> That is about four months later than the December start-up date that  Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates gave the supervisors when he asked them in October  to fund the laboratory.  </P> <P> "I very definitely recall that," Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said. "We were  given an estimated date of completion . . . and now it looks like the original  estimate was off."  </P> <P> Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who was furious with other board members when  they voted to delay a decision on the laboratory by a month -- later shortened  to two weeks -- took the delay in stride this time.  </P> <P> "We were trying to rush it through, and it turned out not to be possible,"  Wieder said. "The important thing is that it's going to happen . . . and  whenever it gets here it'll be about time."  </P> <P> When the facility opens, Orange County will have the first crime laboratory in  California capable of taking tiny samples of blood, hair or semen and breaking  them down into cell fragments that contain deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, which  carries the genetic code unique to each individual.  </P> <P> DNA evidence -- processed by an outside laboratory -- was admitted in an Orange  County trial for the first time earlier this month. The rape suspect in the  case pleaded guilty three days after the evidence was ruled admissible.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department had been requesting a DNA testing laboratory for at  least two years, but its need was seen as acute last fall after a 12-year-old  girl was raped in a gated community in Huntington Beach, just blocks from  Wieder's home in the same development. The suspect arrested in that case had  been acquitted earlier of another rape charge, after prosecutors were late in  receiving DNA evidence from an outside lab.  </P> <P> Gates was unavailable for comment Monday, but Lt. Richard J. Olson, a Sheriff's  Department spokesman, said the laboratory is on schedule and is conducting  proficiency tests to ensure that it yields accurate results. The lab is in a  building next to the Orange County Jail in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "The original statements (projecting a December or January start-up) were about  testing," Olson said. "We're finishing up the first set now."  </P> <P> Frank Fitzpatrick, Sheriff's Department forensic science services director,  agreed that the lab has moved along as quickly as possible.  </P> <P> "I'm real happy about how quickly it's been moving," Fitzpatrick said. "We have  to do the testing, and get all our policies, procedures and manuals in place. .  . . We have to show we can do the work competently . . . before the evidence is  admissible in court."  </P> <P> Fitzpatrick explained that the four criminalists assigned to the DNA lab must  perform several batches of tests on DNA samples purchased from other labs --  without incorrectly matching a single set of samples -- before they can testify  as expert witnesses in court.  </P> <P> "The accuracy rate (that officials want) is 100%," Fitzpatrick said. "If there  is an incorrect result, we shut down the program and go back and look at it  from the beginning."  </P></p>

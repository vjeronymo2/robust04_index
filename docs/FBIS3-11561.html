			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Carlos Santana Ojeda and </F> guests Eloy Concepcion and Renato Recio from TRABAJADORES  newspaper -- live]    [Text] [Santana] Everyone knows that the Cuban cattle  industry is undergoing one of its most critical periods. Why is  this?    [Concepcion] I would not say most critical. I believe that  the cattle industry is beginning to emerge from its most  critical period. The main problem with the cattle was feed. We  had developed a cattle industry in Cuba based on a breed that  required mainly hay -- Holstein, primarily a dairy breed.    [Santana] And this hay was imported.    [Concepcion] It was imported. When this stopped, the cattle  naturally experienced the results of a lack of feed. This is the  reason I said it is not that the industry is undergoing a  crisis, but overcoming a crisis. I know that strong, nationwide  efforts began last year regarding cattle feed. There are signs  in Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and certain farms in Havana,  Camaguey, and Pinar del Rio that show the beginning of a  significant recovery in the Cuban cattle industry.    [Recio] I would like to give my opinion about what Eloy said  regarding the word crisis. What he is saying is true: The worst  part of the crisis is over. The worst part of a crisis is the  period of decline toward the bottom of the abyss -- to employ a  metaphor. The Cuban cattle industry has apparently halted its  decline. However, it stopped at a very low level. I believe we  have to stress this. The decline has stopped, but at a very low  level. We can affirm that the Cuban cattle industry is  undergoing a very, very critical period.    I will give you some points in case: The mass of Cuban  cattle  is extremely inferior to the ideal in any country. Cuba ought to  have a cattle population proportional to its human population.  We are far from having cattle proportional to our population.  Any dairy production should produce a liter-per-cow rate  of....[pauses] A poor quality breed should yield six liters a  day and a highly efficient breed ought to yield 12, 15, or 20.  Right now, our averages are lower than that of the worst of the  cattle industries.    However, as Eloy said, it is true that we had dipped even  lower and that in the past few months the process has stabilized  and shown a gradual improvement.    [Santana] What defines this?    [Recio] Renato is partially correct. When I said that we are  emerging from the crisis I was referring to the following: I  believe that the first crisis we experienced in this industry  was a subjective crisis on the part of the ranchers and cadres  who manage it, in not understanding in time, nor taking measures  in time to find alternative feeds that might not represent the  full nutritional potential of hay but would still have avoided a  further decline and complete destruction of the cattle industry.    For example: If you have no hay, are you going to sit on  your  hands and wait until the animal dies, or plant sugarcane, king  grass, or protein banks and do everything possible to keep that  animal alive? This is why I said that I believe the crisis is  behind us. I believe that now in the cattle sector, most  comrades, managers, ranchers, and dairy workers have a higher  awareness.    The drop in the cattle population, which resulted in  tremendous death figures in previous years, is this year  experiencing a slight reduction -- although not yet total. In  other words, we see a certain recovery of the cattle; births are  higher than deaths and more cows are becoming productive every  day. More cows are in gestation. The previous decline in the  cattle even lowered gestation because the severe malnutrition  prevented cows' coming into heat.    From an optimistic point of view, yes, a recovery is taking  place. There is a generalization of new methods. I want to  stress this issue of methodology -- the technology of  production. We have to keep in mind that wanting and getting are  not overnight things. We have to generalize technologies. Eloy  mentioned that a country where cattle workers used to produce  milk from a fine breed which required highly specialized  veterinary care and high-protein feed based on concentrates and  where grazing was not customary suddenly was forced by  circumstances to change methods. It has helped tremendously to  have the experience with the famous Voisin method, which we are  trying to generalize nationwide in an updated form. There is not  doubt that this technology is being generalized.    I want to introduce another issue because the Cuban people  should be well informed about this. We not only have to change  production technology. We also have to make genetic changes in  the Cuban cattle.    [Concepcion] There is the example of the Nazareno  enterprise.    [Recio] Eloy and I visited that enterprise recently here in  Havana. This enterprise has a great responsibility because it is  charged with the genetic reshaping of the Cuban cattle, from  primarily Holstein to Siboney. This is the result of a cross  between the high milk production of the Holstein and the  endurance and hardiness of the Zebu, which over many decades  proved its efficiency in Cuba.    [Santana] You mention that there is a cattle recovery. What  supports this? There is no milk. Milk is still rationed. I do  not see the results and the people are saying the same thing.    [Concepcion] There is another reason for the shortage of  milk. We used to import powdered milk through favorable-term  accords with former socialist countries, specifically, Germany.  That is the first thing. The second factor is that our own  cattle herd, primarily Holsteins fed on hay, was a great milk  producer. Milk supplies were higher than today. We imported  approximately 20,000 or 30,000 tons of hay. We no longer have  the capability to import that feed to produce milk. We have a  very large Holstein cattle population that could yield higher  levels of milk if we had hay.    [Recio] I also want to discuss two elements I believe we  should address in this program since we are talking straight.  First, I believe that increased worker welfare has also  contributed significantly to this recovery. You mentioned the  visit to the Nazareno enterprise. We also visited the Valle de  Peru enterprise. At this services complex we saw how they have  been building work tools for the ranchers, and how houses have  been built at the ranches.    The other element is cattle theft and slaughter. This is  truly a serious problem in many places, one that has  significantly hurt our herds. It is an element we have to keep  in mind. It is a situation that still has not been solved in any  province, except in some specific cases. This is seriously  hurting our cattle.    [Santana] You know that much has been said lately about the  Voisin Rational Grazing System. As a matter of fact, this is a  cattle method dating back to the sixties. Is this a valid  technology for these times?    [Concepcion] Completely valid. We can add that it was so  previously, from a purely technological point of view. What  happened is that we lived in a world where we had certain ties  with certain countries and blocs of countries and the economy  imposed certain rules. We got hay and concentrates relatively  easily. If under good conditions a Holstein gives over 22  liters, it makes no sense to graze. It apparently makes no  sense; we cannot be absolute here.    The main point of the Voisin method, as updated, lies in the  fact that Cuba is a tropical country, a country with a fertile  climate, a country which can produce sufficient pasture to  support, with modern, adequate technology, a considerable cattle  population without imported feed and concentrates and which can  attain higher production. What supports this? Not the people's  having more milk. We have to keep in mind that milk imports were  halted and we experienced a significant production drop of  approximately 50 percent. This is not easy to restore.    [Recio] Yes. We cannot hope to restore that. This is one of  the most difficult recovery process any country can experience.  It takes three years for a calf to become productive. Certain  things are being done. One supporting factor is the minidairy  farms. We have also to implement technological changes in the  minidairies and gradually eliminate those large enterprises  which do not correspond to today's reality with cattle.    [Santana] We have spoken of subjective problems. However,  are  our cattle workers truly efficient?    [Concepcion] I do not believe they are efficient enough,  yet.  I believe that once again a body of cattle workers is taking  shape with this new mentality, or need the country has, to use  the Voisin method, to handle cattle properly, and to house the  cattle workers at the ranches. This is why it is important to  locate homes near the workplace, so that the workers can live  there and care for those cattle. It is also important to promote  workers' welfare and self- sufficiency, promote pig and chicken  farming so that the entire family is available to take care of  the facility. I believe that this is the type of thing that will  solve this problem.</p>

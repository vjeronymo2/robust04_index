			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMODITIES;  </P> <P> SUPPLY REPORT HURTS GRAIN, LIVESTOCK FUTURES  </P> <P> Most grain and livestock futures prices closed mostly lower Monday in response  to supply figures released last week by the Agriculture Department.  </P> <P> On other markets, precious metals prices were mostly higher and most energy  futures declined.  </P> <P> Analysts attributed the grain and soybean declines on the Chicago Board of  Trade to the government report of higher-than-expected supplies of wheat, corn  and soybeans.  </P> <P> Also weighing on prices were weekend rains in growing areas, said grains  analyst Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  </P> <P> Prices regained some ground after soybean contracts fell under the  psychologically-important $7-a-bushel level, said analyst Steve Freed of Dean  Witter Reynolds Inc.  </P> <P> Wheat settled 4.75 cents to 7.50 cents higher, with the contract for delivery  in May at $4.085 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 9.5 cents lower, with May at  $2.59 a bushel; oats were 1 cent higher to 10 cents lower, with May at $1.87 a  bushel, and soybeans were 10 cents to 28.25 cents lower, with May at $7.10 a  bushel.  </P> <P> Livestock and meat prices generally fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  Only one contract, for April live hogs, managed to finish higher.  </P> <P> Friday's report on the supply of hogs and pigs indicated no shortage of hogs at  any time soon, said livestock analyst Chuck Levitt of Shearson Lehman Hutton  Inc.  </P> <P> Cattle futures also suffered from the government's pork report, Levitt said.  </P> <P> He explained: "It showed competition from pork would be heavy."  </P> <P> Record high prices at retail counters also has reduced consumer demand, Levitt  said.  </P> <P> Cattle settled 0.67 cents to 1.47 cent lower, with the contract for delivery in  April at 77.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.30 cents to 1.50 cents  lower, with April at 79.80 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.12 cent higher to  1.38 cents lower, with April at 40.37 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies  were 0.75 cent to 2 cents lower, with May at 35.35 cents a pound.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Precious Metals Rise  </P> <P> Prices for gold and silver futures were mostly higher on the Commodity Exchange  in New York.  </P> <P> "The market showed little movement," said William O'Neill, director of research  for Elders Futures Inc., adding that prices were supported in late trading by  the dollar being under pressure.  </P> <P> Gold settled 10 cents lower to $1.10 higher, with the contract for delivery in  April at $386.20 an ounce; silver was 0.6 cent lower to 1 cent higher, with  April at $5.788 an ounce.  </P> <P> Most energy futures prices fell slightly on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> Traders said they were nervous because the Coast Guard has reopened the Alaskan  port of Valdez to 24-hour tanker traffic. It was closed because of the oil  spill by an Exxon Corp. tanker March 24.  </P> <P> Crude oil settled 24 cents to 32 cents lower, with the contract for May at  $19.95 a barrel; heating oil was 0.62 cent to 1.12 cents lower, with May at  52.50 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline ranged 0.39 cent lower to 0.88 cent  higher, with May at 67.85 cents a gallon.  </P></p>

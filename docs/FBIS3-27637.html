Establishing a socialist market economic system is a  great cause without precedent in history, and there is no  ready-made experience which we can make use of. We will  inevitably encounter some difficulties and problems which we  have never experienced in the past. It is particularly  imperative for us to aim high and have lofty ambitions. We must  be bold in making explorations and blazing new trails. Without  lofty ambitions and great ideals, without pioneering spirit,  without the spirit of "taking a risk," and without a burst of  energy and vigor, we cannot break a good, new path and  accomplish something new.    At present, the broad masses of party members, cadres, and  the people are further emancipating their minds, seizing the  good opportunity, deepening reform, and struggling hard to  establish a socialist market economic system and develop a  socialist market economy. The situation is encouraging and  presses us to march forward courageously. Some comrades,  however, are lacking great ideals and ambition. They lack both  a vigorous spirit and an energetic drive.    Some comrades like to compare our province, Hunan, with some  provinces and regions, such as Guangdong, which are experiencing  fairly rapid economic development. They always complain that we  are backward in this respect or no good in that regard. In  fact, they are mistakenly belittling themselves. There gaps  truly do exist between us, Hunan, and those coastal provinces  and regions. For example, if we compare ourselves with Jiangsu,  we lag behind in township and town enterprises. If we compare  ourselves with Zhejiang, we lag behind in individual and private  economy. If we compare ourselves with Guangdong, we lag behind  in foreign-funded enterprises. If we compare ourselves with the  entire coastal area, we lag behind in the emancipation of the  mind. However, we must on no account unduly underestimate our  own capabilities, despite these gaps. We should realize that  Hunan's economic development is not slow. Last year, our  township and town enterprises got on the "expressway." Our  foreign-funded enterprises, tertiary industry, and individual  and private economy have been developing fairly rapidly. Our  GNP has been increasing at the highest speed since reform and  opening up. We do not object to comparing ourselves with  economically advanced coastal provinces and regions. The  purpose of this comparison, however, is not only to discover the  gaps; it is undertaken in order to make an analysis of the  reasons contributing to the gaps and study measures for  narrowing and eliminating them. Material dialectics have told us  that all things develop and change under certain conditions. As  long as we take a correct path and go all out in our efforts,  the gaps can be narrowed. The backward can definitely become  the advanced. We must aim high, have lofty ambitions, and learn  to use the views of material dialectics to exhibit judgment.  While looking at the gaps which have objectively existed, we  must not lose sight of our achievements in work. While  understanding the subjective reasons contributing to the gaps,  we must realize the constraints of the objective conditions.  While seeing those unfavorable conditions, we must not lose  sight of those favorable conditions to enhance our confidence  and pluck up our courage. Let bygones be bygones. The  latecomers can surpass the old-timers. It is no use feeling  sorry about losing the previous good opportunities. What is  important is that we must seize on new opportunities, give play  to our strong points, take truly practical measures, rouse  ourselves for vigorous efforts to make our province prosperous,  and try hard to catch up.    Some comrades have the mentality of "not attempting to earn  praise, but only working to avoid mistakes." They simply muddle  along and refuse to make progress. This shows that they are  devoid of lofty ambitions and great ideals. Communist party  members are vanguard fighters of the working class, who have a  communist consciousness. They must serve the people  wholeheartedly. They must be the first to bear hardship, and  the last to enjoy comforts. They must work selflessly for the  common good of the people and make more contributions. In  particular, our party cadres must diligently perform  administrative work for the people, must set a good example,  must struggle hard to do pioneering work, must explore the way  forward to blaze new trails, and must truly make achievements.  How can they "not attempt to earn praise, but only work to  avoid mistakes?" Refusing to do administrative work diligently  is also a type of corruption, albeit an invisible type of  corruption. If a party member or party cadre fails to work hard  to make contributions to the party, state and people, he is not  a qualified party member or party cadre. He will harm the cause  of the party and the people. It is precisely in this sense that  we say: "Failing to earn praise means committing mistakes."       Besides, some comrades have the mentality of "being content  with having enough clothes to wear and sufficient food to eat"  and "being satisfied with small-scale prosperity." This has  also shown that they are devoid of lofty ambitions and great  ideals. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, we have made great achievements in reform, opening  up, and socialist modernization, which have become the focus of  world's attention. The living standards of our people have been  significantly improved. On no account, however, can we be  content with the existing achievements. The Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has set two goals.  With regard to the goal of reform, we must initially establish  a socialist market economic system by the end of this century.  With regard to the goal of development, by the end of this  century we will realize small-scale prosperity. In the middle  of the next century, we will reach the level of the middle  strata of developed nations. These two goals are great,  glorious, and strenuous. We cannot attain them without lofty  ambitions, great ideals, and persistent hard work. If we are  content with the existing achievements of reform and  development, this will really be too paltry. Even though we  have succeeded in establishing the socialist market economic  system, realizing small-scale prosperity, and reaching the level  of the middle strata of the developed countries, we must not be  content with them. We must never stop progressing. Fighting  forever is our quality as communist party members as well as a  duty we must fulfill in the course of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    To aim high and have lofty ambitions, we must study hard  Marxism- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theories on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We  must persist in using the viewpoints of dialectical materialism  to observe and analyze problems to enhance our dedication to our  cause as well as our sense of responsibility. This is the  source of our strength for making explorations courageously and  advancing incessantly. It is also the source of strength for  building the socialist market economic system and pushing the  great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics to victory.</p>

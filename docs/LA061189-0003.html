			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> In reply to a recent statement in this column, I must stand up for Bill Press  on Channel 7. I look forward to his appearances and find his comments right on  target. Nobody pleases everyone but I want Channel 7 to know that Press makes a  favorable impression on this viewer.  </P> <P> Mildred M. Hurst, Northridge  </P></p>

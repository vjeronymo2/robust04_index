			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COOPER TO LEAD ITALIAN SOUTH ALL-STAR TEAM  </P> <P> The NBA is holding a reunion in Rome on Saturday. It's called the Italian  League All-Star Game.  </P> <P> Michael Cooper, Darryl Dawkins and Darren Daye were among the group of some 20  former NBA players selected for Italy's annual showcase for foreign stars.  </P> <P> Cooper was the leading vote-getter in balloting by fans for the south squad. He  is averaging 17 points and seven rebounds per game for Messaggero, which is  tied for second place with a 9-3 record.  </P> <P> Cooper won five NBA titles with the Lakers but never made the league's all-star  team.  </P> <P> "It's a great honor making the all-stars no matter what league you're in,"  Cooper said. "I feel guilty that after being in the so-called elite of  basketball for so long it took me such such a short time to become an all-star  here."  </P> <P> Ex-Sacramento King Vinny Del Negro, who led all vote-getters, was nursing an  ankle injury.  </P></p>

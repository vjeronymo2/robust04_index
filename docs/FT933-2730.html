			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Industry feeling effects of overseas downturn THE WORSENING recession in continental Europe has begun to feed through to companies based in Britain's industrial heartlands of the Midlands and northern England where growth in orders has begun to stall, two separate business surveys showed yesterday. Both the Yorkshire and Humberside CBI and the Engineering Employers Federation in the West Midlands reported that sluggish export trade with Europe was holding back business. Members of the Yorkshire and Humberside CBI regional council said the downturn in France and Germany had a 'severe' effect on them; and they were also worried by pressure on government spending programmes. Mr David Botterill, the West Midlands federation's chief executive, said overall trends were still positive but the government 'must tread very lightly in the manufacturing sector if the eggshell of recovery is not to be broken'. In the West Midlands, the federation's quarterly survey found that the proportion of companies with growing export orders had declined to 20 per cent, compared with 27 per cent in the second quarter. It was the second successive quarterly decline in export growth after sustained improvement over the four previous quarters. Meanwhile, the number of companies saying they had lost orders rose for the third successive quarter - up from 21 per cent at the start of the year to 27 per cent. 'Export orders reflect the deepening recession in the rest of Europe,' the federation said. A decline in domestic orders was also reported with 39 per cent reporting growing demand in August - down from 46 per cent in May. The percentage of companies reporting growth in total orders fell to 41 per cent from 48 per cent. Mr Botterill said: 'Most of our members believe that the recovery is very fragile. It is disturbing that following two surveys in February and May, when the net positive trend increased on all indicators, that the net increase during the August survey, although still positive, appears to have slowed.' Investment plans, profitability and cash flows among engineering companies were still moving ahead but at a slower rate than earlier in the year, he added. The CBI in Yorkshire and Humberside said the construction industry was also in trouble, while overcapacity was leading to severe competitive conditions and pressure on margins in many markets. Mr Peter Lee, chairman of the CBI regional council, added: 'Things are improving slowly but there is still uncertainty over investment plans and we continue to hear of reductions in workforces. Until there is a turnaround in the rest of the European Community, things will remain less than buoyant here.'</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Flynn hits back in works councils row Mr Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner for social affairs, has accused critics of Brussels' plans for trans-European works councils of misrepresenting the facts. Mr Flynn was taking aim at British employers' organisations he believes sabotaged efforts to get voluntary arrangements for information and consultation between both sides of industry. The Irish commissioner said the cost of the directive - estimated at most at Ecu10 per year per worker - was 'only a drop in the ocean when compared, for example, with the corporate entertainment or sponsorship budgets' of up to 1,500 large EU companies likely to be affected. Mr Flynn's broadside, on Tuesday night at the Irish-Belgian business association's annual dinner, came a day after a vitriolic attack on him and the Commission by Sir Michael Angus, the outgoing president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). It also comes before a keynote speech from Mr Jacques Delors scheduled for next Thursday, at which the Commission president plans to go on the offensive on European social policy for the first time since the UK won its opt-out from the Maastricht treaty's Social Chapter in December 1991. Mr Flynn said that after 23 years of discussion on works councils, the Commission was under a clear mandate from 11 of the 12 member states and a large majority in the directly-elected European Parliament to bring forward legislation. Despite this, it had activated the Social Chapter provision for unions and employers to negotiate a voluntary framework, as preferable and more flexible than a EU directive. This effort, Mr Flynn insisted, was scuttled by the UK and its employers' organisations. The modified directive, expected to be EU law by the end of the year, 'was a logical complement to the single market,' the commissioner argued, and there was no disagreement between Brussels and business about the need for it. As we move into the 21st century, he said 'no measure which seeks to improve information and consultation of employees can be incompatible with competitiveness - it is quite the contrary.' The Commission directive provides for minimum requirements on consultation with elected works councils, but only if companies fail to agree a voluntary arrangement sought by 100 employees or their representatives in at least two member states. British companies in continental Europe, but not in the UK, will be affected. Employers confident that their workforce is happy with present arrangements can relax, Mr Flynn said tartly: 'This proposal allows companies to do nothing, it does allow them to continue their existing procedures. The only thing it requires companies to have in order to do that is the consent of their employees.'</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Opinion splits on the Dow's direction - New York Has the four-month correction in the bull market run its course, or is the Dow destined to revisit its mid-April lows? Wall Street analysts are divided in their opinions, but there is a general consensus that the market could plod higher over the next few days. At issue is whether stocks will begin a sustained decline in the face of unpleasant surprises, or whether the market will show the kind of resilience which slowly carried share prices to record highs last year. Certainly, the action last week seemed like a reprise of the good old days which preceded February's shift in monetary policy. As expected, volatility increased, but when the dust settled after Friday's 'triple witching hour', the Dow had managed a net gain of 3 points on the week. Cyclical stocks, such as Caterpillar and Alcoa were also reinvigorated. 'More market participants are becoming comfortable that the Fed did not abort the recovery, and it's showing up in renewed interest in economically sensitive stocks,' says Alfred Goldman, an analyst at A. G. Edwards in St Louis. 'That's going to drag the market upwards, just like in 1993. The bottom line is we are returning to a difficult, stock-picker type of market.' Thomas McManus, a stock strategist at Morgan Stanley, acknowledges that the cyclicals have begun to return to their old form. However, he views their strength as one sign that the market is riding too high and ready for a fall. He fears investors have become too complacent in recent weeks. Their over-confidence has in turn increased the downside risk to share prices. As evidence, he points out that many of the 'put' options taken out during the bearish days of April were not renewed after their expiration. 'Investors have decided they don't need the protection.' On technical grounds, the positive mood should carry stocks forward, he says. 'The fact that investors have let their puts expire creates support for the market, because hedges sold against those puts are bought back.' So why worry? Because the market is in a lose-lose situation, says Mr McManus. If the economy continues to resist the Fed's efforts to slow it down, look for a further tightening and a fresh sell-off. The more likely scenario, he says, is that the central bank has already pushed rates high enough to cool the economy, putting a pinch on corporate earnings. If so, look for more companies to join PepsiCo, Hasbro, Unisys and others which issued profits warnings last week. 'This is the time when corporate America begins to confess,' the Morgan Stanley analyst says. 'Indeed, it is really this period, before the reporting season, which is the most dangerous for stocks.'</p>

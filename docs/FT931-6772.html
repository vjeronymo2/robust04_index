			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles may settle refinancing next month ISOSCELES, the parent of the Gateway food retail chain, put its business plan to its 38 banks yesterday morning and now hopes it can finalise its Pounds 1.4bn refinancing next month. This would be well before May 28, the expiry date of the standstill agreed with the banks before Christmas. The meeting is believed to have been positive. Since Mr David Simons became chief executive on January 4 he has apparently impressed the banks that he is getting a grip of a business which had suffered several top management changes. The business plan, which won approval from OC&amp;C, the management consultants, will form the basis of the refinancing, with the group's balance sheet being tailored to its ability to service debt. The refinancing is expected to involve a debt for equity swap, although not as large as earlier estimates, in part thanks to the fall in interest rates. Equity holders will be severely diluted. Mr Simons has rapidly simplified the structure of Gateway. He has also put the development of new retail formats on hold while making a priority of ensuring the shops are properly stocked, tidy and have chiller cabinets that work. Development of computer systems is also a priority. Suppliers to Gateway had precipitated the pre-Christmas standstill as they became nervous about Gateway's credit standing. The standstill agreement allayed those fears, and Gateway is understood not to have had to draw on an extra working capital facility provided at that time. However, there is a fear that suppliers could again become concerned as the May 28 deadline approaches and this is putting pressure on the group and its banks to reach an early agreement.</p>

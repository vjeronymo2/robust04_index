			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark retains EMS strength THE D-MARK maintained its strength against most European currencies yesterday, as the foreign exchange markets failed to shake off last week's concern about the future of European Monetary Union (Emu), writes James Blitz. With most of Europe off on holiday, trading was thinner than usual. But that did not stop the D-Mark making new gains against the Spanish peseta and Italian lira in the wake of last week's decision by the Danish people not to endorse the Maastricht treaty for closer political and economic union. Against the D-Mark, the peseta ended at Pta63.12, after Friday's close of Pta62.95, while the French franc gained only a small amount of ground, finishing at FFr3.370 compared with a previous FFr3.372. Sterling closed unchanged at DM2.9150. Traders said that neither the pound's performance nor the French franc's was enough to suggest that the worries over Maastricht were dying away. Emu-related fears are threatening the Italian lira more than any other currency, however. The market's view was that the Maastricht treaty would force Italy to curb its huge budget deficit more resolutely than its own politicians would. Yesterday, the lira slipped further against the German currency, closing at L756.8, its lowest point since last December. Analysts said this slippage is causing concern, especially considering that the Bank of Italy was last week forced to raise its emergency funding rate by  1/2 percentage point. Yesterday, one London bank reported that it had received several calls from the Bank of Italy requesting prices of European currencies, but there was no evidence that the Italian central bank had intervened in the market. There are now two important hurdles for the Italian currency. The first is L760, the high point in D-Mark/lira trading last December. Analysts said that if the lira crosses this threshold it could weaken to L764, its low limit against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism. The Bundesbank would be forced to intervene in the market and buy lire at this stage to keep the Italian currency within its permitted bands. The Bank of Italy might also have to lift its discount rate again to protect the currency. With no major US economic data out yesterday or today, dollar trading was mostly subdued. The US currency regained some of last week's losses in the European opening, but drifted back later in the day. The outcome was just modest net improvements for the dollar against the D-Mark and yen, at DM1.5895 from a previous finish of DM1.5880 and at around Y127.08 from Y126.75. In New York it ended at DM1.5865 and Y127.28.</p>

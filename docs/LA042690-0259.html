			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC, TRAFFIC AND MORE TRAFFIC . . .  </P> <P> Residents say traffic is the biggest problem facing North County, according to  a recent Times Poll. More than growth, more than the environment, more than  drugs or crime.  </P> <P> North County Focus wants to address some of those concerns in upcoming issues.  But first, we would like to hear more about them.  </P> <P> What is the most vexing commuting experience you have faced in North County?  Which are the worst roads? What questions do you want answered about commuting  -- by car or public transportation?  </P> <P> Does it burn you up when you see a single commuter driving in the car-pool  lanes? Do you wonder why Interstate 5 backs up so badly during the Del Mar Fair  and racing seasons?  </P> <P> Write to us about your experiences and your questions. We will try to address  them. Send your letters to:  </P> <P> North County Focus Traffic Survey  </P> <P> 400 S. Melrose Drive, Suite 108  </P> <P> Vista, Calif. 92083  </P></p>

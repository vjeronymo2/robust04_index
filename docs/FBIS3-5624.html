Nakamura, 44, a main opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) member of the House of Representatives, is suspected of  taking a 10 million yen bribe from leading construction firm  Kajima Corp. in January 1992, according to documents submitted  to lower house speaker Takako Doi.    The House of Representatives is expected to hold a plenary  session as early as Thursday to decide whether to give the  go-ahead to Nakamura's arrest, political sources said.    Parties within the ruling coalition government and the  opposition Japanese Communist Party are expected to agree to the  arrest of Nakamura, the sources said.    LDP head Yohei Kono on Tuesday said the LDP will not pursue  party interests in considering the prosecutors' request to  arrest Nakamura.    At the closed-door session, Justice Minister Akira Mikazuki  will brief committee members on the matter, the officials said.  On Tuesday, the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  asked the House of Representatives to decide on the prosecutors'  request for arresting Nakamura.    Diet permission is required for the arrest of  parliamentarians while the legislature is in session. The Diet  is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late  January.    Prosecutors applied for a warrant of arrest for Nakamura  from  the Tokyo District Court after Nakamura repeatedly refused to  voluntarily face questioning.    The cabinet decided to send to Diet the arrest request  issued  by Tokyo District Court Judge Kohei Ikeda.</p>

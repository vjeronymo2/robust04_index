			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As has been discussed previously in this preamble, OSM has allowed references to &sect;843.23 to remain in various sections of some of the other final rules adopted today in the event that a final &sect;843.23 is adopted. That such references have been allowed to remain, however, does not constitute a prejudgment by OSM to ultimately adopt proposed &sect;843.23 or some version of that rule. Any decision of this type will be made within the context of the subsequent rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 843.24_Oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control or the status of violations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided standards for OSM's oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control or the status of violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have established the bases which would have required OSM to have taken action under the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of proposed &sect;843.24. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided that OSM would have been required to take action whenever it determined, through its oversight of the implementation of State programs, that a State had issued a permit without complying with the State program equivalents of proposed &sect;&sect;773.22 (verification of ownership or control application information), 773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information), 773.24 (procedures for challenging ownership or control links in AVS), 773.26 (standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations), and 843.23 (sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control and violation information). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided that OSM would have been required to take action whenever it had determined, through its oversight of the implementation of State programs, that a State had failed in a systemic manner to comply with the State program equivalent of proposed &sect;773.27 (periodic check of ownership or control information). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have defined ``failure to comply in a systemic manner'' to include a continuing pattern of noncompliance by a State, or one of more instances of noncompliance that result from or evidence a legal or policy decision which the State intended to apply to similar cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;843.24, a State's isolated failure to comply with proposed &sect;773.27 (periodic check of ownership and control information) would have been treated differently from isolated failures to comply with the proposed regulations listed in paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;843.24. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have required OSM to initiate action under 30 CFR 843.21 if, as a result of the determination made under paragraph (a) of the proposed section, OSM had reason to believe that the State had issued a permit improvidently within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.20. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided for remedial actions by OSM against a State which did not comply with the proposed regulations relating to ownership or control and violation information during the permit application process. Such actions would have been applied where the State had knowingly failed to comply with the State program equivalents of sections 773.22 (verification of ownership or control application information), 773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information), 773.24 (procedures for challenging ownership or control links in AVS), 773.26 (standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations), or 843.23 (sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control and violation information), or where the State had failed in a systemic manner to comply with &sect;773.27 (periodic check of ownership and control information). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The Yemeni news agency, SABA', has learned that the visits  by  the brother members of the political bureau to the battlefront  are being made in order to implement a recently made decision by  that same organization. The soldiers of the units defending  unity and democracy have expressed great satisfaction and  appreciation concerning these visits, and with this wise and  sincere decision made during these hard times, which were  brought about by the criminal and oppressive war imposed on the  Yemeni people by the bloody al-Ahmar gang, which has turned the  southern and eastern governorates into their battlefields.</p>

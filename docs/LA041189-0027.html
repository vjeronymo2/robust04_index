			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GINGRICH INDICATES HOUSE TO PROBE REP. MCDADE  </P> <P> Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), condemning corruption by either political party,  suggested Monday that the House Ethics Committee will look into "very troubling  allegations" concerning a veteran GOP congressman's fees from a defense  contractor whose executives have pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the  government.  </P> <P> "You can expect something to happen," Gingrich told reporters, in the case of  Rep. Joseph M. McDade (R-Pa.), who is in his 14th term in the House. Gingrich,  who was elected last month to be the second-ranking House Republican leader,  was the moving force behind charges of ethical violations against House Speaker  Jim Wright (D-Tex.).  </P> <P> The FBI is investigating whether McDade violated election or bribery laws by  accepting more than $45,000 in campaign contributions and speaking fees from  officials affiliated with United Chem-Con Corp. The FBI is also investigating  McDade's use of United Chem-Con aircraft and two Delaware beach homes rented by  the company.  </P> <P> Six executives of the company pleaded guilty last November in federal court to  charges of conspiracy to defraud the Defense Department of more than $12  million. The executives were accused of inflating operating costs and using the  excess money from Navy contracts to finance a lavish life style, including  private jets and limousines.  </P> <P> The Wall Street Journal, which first disclosed the federal investigation of  McDade, reported that he had used his influence as ranking Republican on both  the House Appropriations subcommittee on defense and the Small Business  Committee to channel Navy contracts to United Chem-Con.  </P> <P> Gingrich, interviewed at a luncheon session with a group of reporters, said  that he is "not comfortable" talking about the McDade case now that he ranks  second in the Republican leadership. But he said that he intends to take up the  case with McDade himself and with House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of  Illinois.  </P> <P> McDade's office reported Monday that he was out of town and unavailable for  comment. A senior McDade aide, when told of Gingrich's comments, declared:  "Good heavens. Obviously we don't feel that way."  </P> <P> The aide, who asked not to be identified, said: "We thought the (FBI)  investigation was just a fishing expedition. I'm surprised Gingrich made those  comments."  </P> <P> Gingrich, who promised to raise ethics as a principal issue in future House  election campaigns, said that Congress needs "a more aggressive Ethics  Committee" and a standard procedure for filing charges of ethical violations  against its members.  </P> <P> The Ethics Committee is expected to release its long-awaited report on the  Wright investigation late this week or next week. A finding of a serious  violation of House rules, if confirmed by the full House, could cost Wright his  post as Speaker.  </P> <P> Gingrich said that such a finding would make members of Congress "absolutely  obligated" to remove Wright from his post. He said that he would be "surprised"  if Rep. Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the House majority leader, has not  succeeded Wright as Speaker by the end of June.  </P> <P> On other issues, Gingrich said that President Bush "can't afford" to seek  consensus the way President Dwight D. Eisenhower did. The conservative  movement, he said "is too strong for that, there would be an insurgency."  </P> <P> In the past, Gingrich has expressed admiration for Oliver L. North, the former  White House aide now being tried for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. But  for the first time, he expressed reservations Monday about some of North's  actions.  </P> <P> "You can't set a standard that the President's men can lie," declared Gingrich.  He added that he thought North "got caught up in all the talk of patriotism" at  the White House and got "overextended" in his zeal to carry out Administration  policy.  </P> <P> Reagan himself got so caught up in patriotic fervor and an "us vs. them"  attitude toward Congress, Gingrich said, that when leaving Washington aboard  Air Force One the President would joke about "how tempting it would be to bomb  the Capitol."  </P> <P> Gingrich, who said he was traveling aboard Air Force One with Reagan when he  made the remark, said that the President's attitude was that "we patriots are  going to save the West, and those guys on the Hill don't understand."  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pechiney cuts stake in packaging subsidiary PECHINEY, the French state-owned aluminium producer, cut its stake in its packaging subsidiary, Pechiney International, to 67.9 per cent yesterday, with the sale of FFr1.29bn (Dollars 230m) of its shares in a private placement. Its holding fell from 74.1 per cent and is likely to fall further to 66.7 per cent at the end of June when publicly held warrants on its shares fall due to be exercised. The private placement was conducted in France and internationally by Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Suisse First Boston and Lazard Freres. The three banks bought 14.3m warrants in the subsidiary from Pechiney and immediately exercised them, resulting in the issue of 7,146,068 new shares. Yesterday's sale raised FFr1.29bn for Pechiney International. The total will rise to FFr1.7bn should further publicly held warrants be exercised at the end of June. In addition, the company expects to raise FFr3.85bn shortly from the sale of its aluminium and international trading businesses to its parent. The money raised would 'strengthen Pechiney International's financial position and enhance its ability to develop its principal line of business, packaging', the company said. Pechiney added that the private placement - which came after the market had closed - was expected to be completed shortly. No particular block of shares was earmarked for sale internationally, with all three banks selling shares both in France and abroad.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 11 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur demanded Wednesday [11 May] the unconditional release  of 11 French aid workers held by Bosnian Serbs for alleged arms  trafficking.    Balladur's Minister of European Affairs Alain Lemassoure  warned the Serbs that, if they continued with their "parody of a  trial" of the 11, Paris would regard the affair as a war crime.    The 11 members of the Premiere Urgence (First Emergency)  group have been held since April 8 at the Sarajevo suburb of  Lukavica and deny the smuggling allegations. The Bosnian Serbs  have just extended their detention for a month pending trial and  say the detainees could face up to 15 years in prison.    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said here Wednesday  that he hoped to obtain the men's release. "We hope that  through negotiation we can find a way to free the hostages," he  said after a 45-minute meeting with Balladur.    Balladur assured French National Assembly deputies the  government was "using all the means it can" to obtain its  nationals' release. He decried that the aid workers were being  "held hostage in the most cynical fashion".    The French premier also told parliament the time was  approaching when France would have to consider if there was any  point in continuing her presence in Bosnia if the "Great Powers"  and the warring factions were not ready to take appropriate  action to resolve the conflict.    Foreign Ministers from Europe, the United States and Russia  are due to hold a meeting on Bosnia Friday in Geneva.</p>

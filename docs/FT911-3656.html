			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: French boost Romanian links FRANCE is poised to become Romania's leading foreign investor, following the visit of President Francois Mitterrand to Bucharest last week. Mr Mitterrand, the first head of state to visit Romania since the revolution in December 1989, was accompanied by six ministers, a dozen leading businessmen, and bankers from the French Foreign Trade Bank, the Credit Commercial de France and Lazard Freres. France clearly intends to take advantage of the strong cultural links between the two countries. French companies have been reluctant until now to invest in Romania, largely because they have been waiting for the law on foreign investment to be enacted this month. Most western investments in Romania have tended to focus on small-scale activities. In the first quarter of 1991, Germany and Italy invested the most, with Dollars 5.2m and Dollars 2.2m, respectively. However, French companies anxious to gain a foothold in eastern Europe now appear to be taking Romania as a serious potential trading partner. This shift in emphasis was confirmed by the companies who travelled with Mr Mitterrand. They included: CIT Alcatel. It is hoping to gain 40 per cent of the market in telephone systems. It will be competing with Siemens of Germany, which signed a joint-venture agreement last autumn. Groupe Sucres et Denrees. It signed a FFr100m (Pounds 9.93m) contract for the rehabilitation of sugar beet production and the construction of three sugar refineries. Other large companies about to sign contracts include Societe Generale des Eaux, which is planning to modernise Bucharest's poor water system and Elf Aquitaine, which is looking into the country's petrol stations network. Bouygues. It signed during the presidential visit a letter of intent for the largest joint venture in the country so far, the construction of an international trade centre. The government-backed French international radio service, Radio France International, has been broadcasting locally since January. A bilingual station in Bucharest is planned for later in the spring. The francophone international channel, TV5 Europe, started broadcasting in Bucharest the day the French president arrived. France's cultural budget in Romania already amounts to FFrs70m, by far the largest among western countries.</p>

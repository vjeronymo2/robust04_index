			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Hop"-signed article: "The Importance of the Czech </F> Republic in the Heroin Trade Is Growing"]    [Text] Prague -- Czech police managed within a week to  seize 25 kg of pure heroin, which is almost eight kg more than  was seized over the entire previous year. These figures  together with the statistics of drugs seized in Western Europe,  which the smugglers evidently transported through the territory  of the Czech Republic (less than 750 kg in 1992, 997 kg last  year), testify to the steadily growing quantity of heroin in  transit and to the important status of the Czech Republic on the  so-called Balkan route. A total in excess of 8,000 kg of heroin  was seized in all European states last year, which is one-half  more than in 1988.    Two branches of this smuggling path go through the Czech  Republic. One leads from Istanbul, Turkey, through Sofia,  Belgrade, Budapest, and Prague to the Waldhaus border crossing.  The other branch passing through the Czech-German border begins  in Constanta, Romania. In both instances, the final destination  for the narcotics is Scandinavia and Western Europe. According  to police sources, only a marginal part of the narcotics remains  in the Czech Republic. Because of the high price of heroin, its  users are recruited mostly from business circles. Jiri Richter,  director of the National Drug and Information Service, comments  on this: "Recently, the participation of the Czech citizens in  various crime organizations involved in drug smuggling has  grown. It is understandable--the Czech cleverness, longing for  money, and skills are rather expedient features for the  narcotics trade."    One of the important sites for drug smuggling is the  [Prague-] Ruzyne airport. Drug couriers from Asia, Africa, and  South America come to Prague, and then continue to other parts  of Europe by car or train. Because of the limited technical  possibilities and lack of legislation, the Prague airport is  becoming a suitable transfer point for smugglers.    Drug-crime specialists point out that the interest in the  Czech Republic on the part of dealers is not declining because  dirty money can be laundered here without many problems.  According to them, the individual gangs will attempt to  penetrate the highest political and social strata.</p>

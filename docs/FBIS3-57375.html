The electoral debacle of Mykola Bagrov, speaker of the  Crimean parliament, in the first round of elections is virtually  a defeat for the Party of Crimean Economic Rebirth [PEVK], which  decided to support Bagrov at its convention. As a matter of  fact, the PEVK could propose for president one its members --  there are suitable candidates in this party. However,  entrepreneurs have always been noted for their realistic and  sober thinking and their ability to predict things. They  understand that experience gathered at rallies is not enough to  become a good president. Czars, for example, were prepared to  rule from the day they were born -- and not all of them were  good at it. When someone's background includes only a higher  educational institution -- and a Soviet one at that -- and  slight experience as an attorney, he would find it somewhat hard  to run the state. Yuriy Meshkov never got a chance to hold even  a low managerial post. Of course, he did not even plan to  become the president. He was elevated this high by the  All-Russian idea and ample promises generally distributed at  rallies during the first round. Here is what Oleksandr Dudko,  member of the PEVK Presidium and president of the Union of  Crimean Entrepreneurs, told us.    [Begin Dudko recording] If you carefully read programs of  the  PEVK and Meshkov, you'll find them consisting of basically the  same elements -- salaries paid in rubles, removal of customs  barriers, etc. -- only our program is without any heavy  political shading. To achieve all this, one doesn't necessarily  have to quarrel with our current situation and replace one  border with another. [end recording]    The PEVK will soon try to demonstrate to Crimean residents  its implementation mechanisms and expose all of its advantages.  However, it will be up to electors to decide for whom they  should cast their votes. Whatever the case, they will get what  they elect.</p>

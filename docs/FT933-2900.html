			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Alliance to curb propeller loss - British Aerospace interim results BRITISH Aerospace is stepping up its efforts to negotiate an alliance with other European aerospace companies to rationalise its lossmaking turbo propeller activities. 'Our turbo propeller sector is where the real problem lies in our commercial aircraft operations,' said yesterday Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive. These operations, which include production of the Jetstream commuter aircraft and the Advanced Turbo Prop (ATP) airliner, lost Pounds 60m in the first half of this year and are likely to incur a similar amount in the second half. After negotiating a partnership with Taiwan Aerospace for its lossmaking BAe 146 regional jet business, BAe is now concentrating increasingly in forging a similar partnership for the turbo propeller business which has been regrouped at the company's facility at Prestwick in Scotland. BAe appears to be leaning towards a partnership with the French Aerospatiale group, Alenia of Italy and Casa of Spain. Such a partnership would also be open to Deutsche Aerospace and Fokker, the Dutch manufacturer which has recently come under the control of Deutsche Aerospace. However, it seems difficult to see at this stage the German company and Fokker teaming up with the BAe proposal. This could ultimately lead to a rationalisation of the European turbo propeller aircraft industry around two groups: one including BAe, Aerospatiale, Alenia and Casa and a so-called North European group including Deutsche Aerospace, Fokker and Saab of Sweden. Overall, BAe's commercial aircraft activities made a loss before interest of Pounds 81m in the first half year.</p>

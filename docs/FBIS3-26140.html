Autonomous regional  leaders Abulaiti Amudurexiti, Wang Lequan, and Keyum Bawundun  attended the conference.    In 1993, our region reaped bumper harvests in agriculture,  registered industrial growth, enjoyed booming market activity,  conducted brisk border trade, increased financial revenue,  improved living standards, and achieved initial success in  implementing central macroeconomic regulatory and control  measures. By and large, Xinjiang enjoyed good financial order  and economic operations. Nevertheless, secondary and tertiary  industries, which are primarily based on village and town  enterprises, still constituted a small proportion of the  economy. Although industrial production developed well, the  general level of economic efficiency in enterprises remained  low.    The general guiding thought for our region's economic work  and trade in 1994 is: Earnestly implementing the guidelines of  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and  the Sixth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Xinjiang  Autonomous Regional Party Committee, turning reform into a  driving force, focusing on development, exploiting resources,  optimizing the economic structure, opening wider to the outside  world, improving economic efficiency, and promoting rapid  development of Xinjiang's economy based on high efficiency. This  year, we should expedite the pace of deepening reform in  state-run enterprises, further improve large and medium  enterprises, vigorously advance tehnological progress in  enterprises, and further improve quality control. We should  also accelerate the development of village and town enterprises,  nurture new economic growth sectors, accelerate economic and  market development, increase commercial and trade flows, tighten  and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, and coordinate  work in all aspects of economic operations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said  he is confident that a peaceful solution may be possible in  Bosnia-Herzegovina after all, due to the most recent UN  decisions. Priority at the moment is to remove the Serbs'  "terrible stranglehold" around Gorazde, Kinkel said in Bonn  today. He stressed that the agreed cease-fire is basically  being adhered to. There is at present no reason for NATO to  intervene.</p>

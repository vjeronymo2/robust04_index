			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TENSE BUT QUIET DAY FOLLOWS SCHOOL BRAWL;  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD: HALF OF THE STUDENTS AND MANY TEACHERS STAYED HOME AFTER VIOLENT  CONFLICT BETWEEN BLACKS AND LATINOS.  </P> <P> In the aftermath of a brawl between black and Latino students at Inglewood High  School, no disturbances were reported on campus Wednesday but tensions remained  high. Half of the students and many teachers stayed away from classes, and a  beefed-up security crew confiscated a number of weapons from students on their  way into school.  </P> <P> In class, students wrote essays on the causes of Tuesday's fights. Supt. George  McKenna, who spent most of the day on campus, said school psychologists,  parents and members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference will hold  workshops on conflict resolution today with selected black and Latino students.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an aide said County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn will ask the county  Human Relations Committee to investigate the campus disturbances at next  Tuesday's Board of Supervisors meeting. The Inglewood school board will also  take up the disturbances at its meeting next Wednesday.  </P> <P> Ethnic pride turned to ethnic violence at the high school Tuesday when black  students walked out on a Cinco de Mayo celebration to retaliate against Latinos  who left a black history assembly in February.  </P> <P> After Tuesday's walkout, insults escalated into a series of fistfights that  involved dozens of students, prompting administrators to end the school day  early and call in Inglewood police. Police continued to patrol the area around  the school Wednesday.  </P> <P> Security guards reported seizing far more weapons than usual Wednesday morning,  including guns, knives and a crowbar. District spokesman Maurice Wiley was  unable to determine how many weapons were confiscated.  </P> <P> About half of the school's 2,100 students returned to campus Wednesday morning.  Wiley said teacher absences were also higher than normal, but he did not know  specific numbers.  </P> <P> Among the absentees was Principal Lawrence Freeman, who called in sick.  </P> <P> Freeman said in an interview Tuesday that he was seriously considering  retirement.  </P> <P> "How many times can you get your heart broken?" the 67-year-old educator asked.  "I think our race (blacks) should be ashamed of itself. These blacks better get  busy. They need to stop fighting and start competing."  </P> <P> In interviews Tuesday and Wednesday, students said blacks and Latinos have not  clashed in the past at Inglewood High, although the two groups are socially  separate and tensions do exist in the student body, which is 53% black, 43%  Latino, 2% white and 2% other.  </P> <P> "Mostly it's blacks around blacks and Mexicans around Mexicans, but I didn't  know there was prejudice until (the fighting broke out)," said Gonzalo  Curuchet, 15.  </P> <P> "We don't always get along with the black people here," said Alex Quintanilla,  18. "They think they're superior to us. We work so hard to learn English. We  work so hard to get jobs. We work so hard in our lives and they call us names."  </P> <P> Black students said they think Latinos get favored treatment at the school.  They said Freeman enforces the dress code more strictly for black girls, only  has Latino girls working in the front office and gave more support to the Cinco  de Mayo celebration than to Black History Month.  </P> <P> "They got a trip to Olvera Street," Maneka Hubbard, 16, said of her Latino  classmates. "They got a dance. They even named our cafeteria El Casa Maria."  </P> <P> Black students said school officials would not allow them to select a Black  History Month queen. Tuesday's walkout occurred while Freeman was distributing  flowers to the contestants for Cinco de Mayo queen.  </P> <P> Freeman said Tuesday that nobody ever asked him for a Black History Month  queen. He denied that favoritism exists at the school.  </P> <P> "Don't try to read too much into this," Freeman said. "The whole thing is a  bunch of punks who walked out and started this. Don't give it the dignity of  racial strife. It's a bunch of non-thinking children doing the wrong thing."  </P> <P> McKenna agreed Wednesday that the racial problems are not as widespread as they  appear.  </P> <P> "I think 95% of the kids are surprised this occurred and have no idea what  happened or why," he said.  </P> <P> McKenna said he has not known Freeman to exhibit favoritism, "but there may be  the perception that in making one group feel welcome he has made another group  feel unwelcome."  </P> <P> Administrators were not the only ones assessing the reasons for Tuesday's  clashes.  </P> <P> Chaka Jones, 17, attributed the fighting to "a lot of built-up hostilities" and  said: "It doesn't matter who threw the first punch. The question is why did  punches continue to be thrown?"  </P> <P> Students said tensions between the two groups escalated in February when a  large group of Latino students walked out of a black history assembly that  featured Duke Ellington music, a tap dancing performance and brief history  lessons about prominent blacks.  </P> <P> When Latinos staged a Mexican folk dancing demonstration and other activities  in honor of Cinco de Mayo in the gym Tuesday, a group of between 10 and 15  black students walked out. More joined in. Soon both black and Latino students  were leaving.  </P> <P> Outside the gym, students said, insults were exchanged and sporadic fighting  began. When administrators tried to break up one fight, another would begin.  After school was dismissed, the disturbances moved outside and many students  rushed into the street.  </P> <P> "Blacks were fighting Hispanics and Hispanics were fighting blacks," said  Johnnie Thomas, the district's security chief. "Then all hell broke loose."  </P></p>

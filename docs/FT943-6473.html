			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Brit Steel and SSAB in Norway expansion British Steel and SSAB, the Swedish steel group, have agreed to take full control of Norsk Stal, Norway's leading steel distributor. The two companies, which already hold 48 per cent of Norsk Stal's shares, are buying the majority stake from Norsk Jern Holding, the largest Norwegian steel producer, on undisclosed terms. Norsk Stal, which last year achieved profits of NKr20m (Pounds 1.9m) on turnover of NKr1.16bn, is already the main distribution outlet for both British Steel and SSAB in Norway. Its operations include Norsk Stal Tynnplater, Norway's largest steel service centre with clients in both Sweden and Norway. The deal was initiated by Norsk Jern as part of a restructuring which will focus its operations on Fundia, a producer of long steel products. Terms are expected to be finalised by the middle of next month but will be subject to approval from the European Commission and Nordic authorities. SSAB is Scandinavia's biggest steel producer with a targeted market share of 50 per cent in heavy plate and strip products. It already collaborates with British Steel through European Electrical Steels, which has operations in both Sweden and Wales. British Steel owns 75 per cent of the venture.</p>

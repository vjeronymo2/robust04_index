			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Kugelfischer to double losses in second half SECOND-HALF losses at Kugelfischer, the German bearings and industrial systems group, will be more than double the DM45m (Dollars 29m) deficit reported in the first six months, the company said yesterday. Demand was expected to continue falling for the next few months and output would fall by 10 per cent next year, it said. Figures for the first 10 months of this year showed an accelerating fall in sales. Turnover at the end of October was down 7.8 per cent, compared with a 7 per cent fall reported a month earlier. The group, which recently announced the closure of its loss-making works in east Berlin with the loss of 470 jobs, said results would be affected by the costs of the shut-down and heavy losses in its other east German businesses. Kugelfischer said total losses this year would be well over DM135m, compared with a deficit of DM80m in 1991. Cost cutting measures so far this year have included an 8 per cent cut in the workforce, reducing the payroll to 32,000.</p>

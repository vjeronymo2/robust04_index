			<p>BFN     [Text] Gweru April 10 SAPA -- Voter registration for  Zimbabwe's 1995 election got of to a slow start, a ZANU (PF)  [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] provincial  coordinating committee concluded on Sunday [10 April] after a  two day meeting, ZIANA national news agency reports. Only  113,115 voters were registered during the first two weeks of a  national registration campaign.    ZANU (PF) Midlands Provincial Chairman Frederick Shava said  the party had not yet told its members about the importance of  taking part in the elections. "Registration kicked off on a  very low note because people had not been mobilised fully and  they were apprehensive," he said.    Mr Shava said he hoped voter registration would pick up when  people at cell, ward, district and provincial levels were  mobilised.    Mr Shava said the party was in full swing of consolidating  itself and had sold 50,000 party membership cards in the  Midlands region during the last three months.    All Central Committee members, parliamentarians, chiefs and  local party officials would be involved in the regional  mobilisation drive starting on April 19, Mr Shava said. "We are  satisfied that the restructuring exercise of the party is going  into the correct phase and we shall have finished the exercise  before the main congress begins," he said.    The position of provincial women's league economic affairs  secretary and legal affairs and human rights secretary still  needed to be filled, he added.</p>

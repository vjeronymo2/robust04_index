			<p>BFN     [Text] In Hebron, 11 residents were wounded in incidents  this afternoon. A group of settlers was pelted with rocks, and  one of them opened fire. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports  that, according to various reports, three Palestinian residents  were apparently injured by the shooting. Another eight were  injured when the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] moved in to put out  riots which followed the shooting incident in Hebron. One of  the wounded is in grave condition, two suffer medium wounds, and  the rest were lightly wounded.    Representatives of the Temporary International Presence in  Hebron arrived at the site of the incident and began collecting  evidence from the Arab residents of Hebron. The Jews did not  testify about the incident. Also, the IDF has not yet detained  any settler for questioning, but an IDF unit is on its way to  the Shavey Hevron Yeshiva to investigate which of the settlers  fired the shots.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan is likely to export  208 Ching Kuo jets, also known as Indigenous Defense Fighters  (IDFs) to foreign countries between 1997 and 2010, General Lin  Wen-li, director of the Aero Industry Development Center (AIDC),  said Tuesday [21 June].    The exports, if achieved, would give Taiwan a 12-percent  share of the world market of IDF-type fighters, Lin, formerly  commander-in-chief of the Air Force, said. He said that it is  the goal of the AIDC to export the locally made aircraft.  "Although it's surely the way the AIDC has to go, an export  license from the United States and permit from the government  are still necessary."    The AIDC, with technological assistance from the United  States, is producing two IDFs monthly. The cooperative  relationship calls for Taiwan to get American approval before it  can sell the aircraft abroad. He said that a squadron of 24  IDFs will be delivered to the Air Force as scheduled by the end  of this year, greatly beefing up Taiwan's air defense capability.    Each IDF costs US$24 million to make, but Lin said that  could  be lowered to US$22 million in the future with accumulated  experience and improved operations of the AIDC. Lin said the  AIDC is responsible for designing and producing the bodies of  the IDFs, 50 percent of its generators and less than [word  indistinct] percent of its electronic equipment, with the  remaining parts being supplied by the United States. He said  that although the local content rate could be raised further in  the long run, that goal would be difficult to achieve anytime  soon under the agreement reached with the United States.    He said that several foreign aircraft producers, including  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing of the U.S., British Aerospace plc  and Dassault of France, have approached the AIDC about the  possibility of joint production of commercial planes even though  the AIDC at the moment is incapable of making such planes. Lin  said, however, that the AIDC will aggressively seek to sell  components and parts or establish relationships with foreign  airplane makers to jointly develop commercial aircraft.    The AIDC, formerly controlled by the Cheng-shan Institute of  Science and Technology, will soon become the first state-run  company under the Defense Ministry.</p>

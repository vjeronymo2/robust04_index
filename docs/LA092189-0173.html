			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDITOR OF LONDON'S MOST POPULAR PAPER DEFENDS ITS RACY CONTENTS  </P> <P> Newspaper editors do not usually make news, but most of Britain's serious  papers Tuesday carried a lengthy interview with the editor of the Sun, the  country's raciest and largest-selling popular tabloid.  </P> <P> For the best part of the eight years Kelvin MacKenzie, 42, has edited the Sun,  he has declined interviews while his paper has gone from strength to strength  on a much-scorned mixture of gutter-level gossip, screaming headlines,  half-naked women, and snappy sports coverage.  </P> <P> So when Mackenzie decided to break his silence and spin his words of  popular-press philosophy to a group of reporters from the more conventional  newspapers here, he found an attentive audience.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Baring It All  </P> <P> "Kelvin bares it all in confessions of a Sun editor," said the Guardian, which  left out of its report MacKenzie's typically cheeky assertion: "We could all go  and edit the Guardian, whereas the editor of the Guardian couldn't edit the  Sun."  </P> <P> He may have a point. Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Sun (circulation 4 million)  and four other British newspapers, once told a visitor that he thought the Sun,  under MacKenzie's stewardship, was the best-edited paper in the world.  </P> <P> If the degree to which an editor puts his personal stamp on the paper is the  measure of successful editing, then MacKenzie surely is in a class of his own.  </P> <P> His selection of stories is nothing if not idiosyncratic, even bizarre. To his  mind the most important story in the world Tuesday was "Four Pet Bunnies Killed  by Head." Beneath the front-page, 2-inch-high headline was the story of how a  school principal shot a neighbor's rabbits because they were eating his  lettuce.  </P> <P> His readers were told the tale was a "SUN EXCLUSIVE." Certainly, no other paper  bothered to print it.  </P> <P> MacKenzie dismissed the judgment of more conventional editors, saying: "They  ask what is the most uninteresting thing which has happened in Britain or the  world yesterday, put that at the top of the page, and then descend slowly.  </P> <P> "To think there are decent trees in Finland being cut down for that. Journalism  is about doing the unobvious story: the big story from Lebanon is the day when  there isn't any shooting."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a Strong Point  </P> <P> Readers of the Sun would be hard-pressed to know whether the guns in Lebanon  were firing or silent at any time. Foreign news is not its strong point, except  if it involves movie stars or models.  </P> <P> But at the office of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the Sun is taken  extremely seriously. Editorially, it hammers home the Thatcherite principles of  free enterprise and individual responsibility.  </P> <P> It has, in the words of one of Mrs. Thatcher's closest aides, "popular  resonance." The aide said: "If you want to know what the average Briton is  thinking, don't read the Times, the Telegraph, or the Guardian. Read the Sun."  </P> <P> One feature of the Sun is its daily "Page Three Girl," a black-and-white photo  of a topless model with a tee-hee caption. Tuesday's Page Three Girl showed a  bare-chested blonde, under which read the words: "Hairdresser Sharon . . .  started work as a shampoo girl -- and is still putting the lads in a lather."  </P> <P> Although the Page Three Girl has infuriated feminists, the Sun attracts more  female readers than any other paper. The pinups, said MacKenzie, were "a  fixture."  </P> <P> Increasingly politicians and others have expressed misgivings about the Sun's  irresponsibility, its invasion of privacy, and its sheer arrogance.  </P> <P> It provoked legislation, narrowly defeated in parliament, which would have  imposed limits on media intrusion. It brought censure from other editors and  journalists for setting a new low in reporting standards and bringing the  entire profession into disrepute.  </P> <P> As the major sign of public outrage, the Sun was ordered to pay singer Elton  John a record .56 million in libel damages for unfounded allegations about his  sex life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Invited to Lunch  </P> <P> It was a somewhat chastened editor who invited the reporters to lunch to mark  the 20th anniversary of Murdoch's acquisition of the Sun, which has its roots  in the unlikely origins of a serious trade union-backed newspaper.  </P> <P> "We have made some big errors. Elton John was a big error. When you're as big  as the Sun, when you drop a big clangor, that's the danger," he said.  </P> <P> MacKenzie acknowledged that he was also concerned about the prospect of tighter  legal controls on the media. There is no right-to-know legislation on the books  here, and English libel laws are much tighter than in the United States. A new  secrecy act threatens to put even stricter limits on the flow of official  information to the media.  </P> <P> "A law of privacy is just another form of denying readers their right to know,"  he said.  </P> <P> In response to the complaints against his paper, MacKenzie earlier this year  appointed an in-house omsbudsman to pass judgment on contentious stories. So  far 2 of 63 complaints have been upheld.  </P></p>

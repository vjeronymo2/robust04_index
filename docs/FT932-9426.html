			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (12): China sets a gruelling pace - The Race for Foreign Investment THE MANGY dog which ekes out a miserable existence on the steps of the Investment Co-ordinating Board (BKPM) office in Jakarta gives the potential investor an unduly dismal impression of the fate awaiting him in Indonesia. Foreign investment applications have in fact risen steadily in the last seven years as Asian and western manufacturers take advantage of the country's abundant and modestly-priced workforce - workers sometimes earn only a dollar a day - and its large consumer market. First it was textiles. Much of the international export industry, after moving from Japan to Taiwan and Korea, has now settled in countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and China. The value of Indonesian textile and garment exports rose to about Dollars 6bn last year, about six times the level of 1986. Then came electronics. Samsung of South Korea and Sony of Japan have started to export video recorders and audio systems from Indonesia. Exports of electrical appliances have doubled to about Dollars 1bn a year from Dollars 500m in 1991. Indonesian officials, however, are worried. They are concerned about increasing competition for investment dollars from the fast-growing economies of China, Vietnam and India, and they are dismayed by the sharp fall in domestic investment over the last three years. Although the BKPM's foreign investment approvals (which exclude oil and gas exploration) reached a record Dollars 10.3bn last year, the underlying level of foreign interest in Indonesia appears to be falling; about Dollars 3bn of the 1992 approvals total came from two huge projects - a planned oil refinery in south Sumatra proposed by British Petroleum and C. Itoh, and the Chandra Asri petrochemical plant in west Java which underwent a controversial switch from domestic to foreign investment status after the government sought to limit foreign borrowing by domestic companies. The figures must also be treated with caution, since historically only about half of approved foreign projects by value, and a third of domestic ones, are actually implemented. 'The competition for the investment buck from China and to a lesser extent Vietnam is quite a lot more serious than we had assumed,' said a foreign banker in Jakarta. Companies complain about a number of obstacles to doing good business in Indonesia: the hopelessly inadequate legal system, excessive corruption and bureaucracy (especially in the issuing of industrial licences by provincial authorities), and the tendency of university graduates to choose cushy jobs in the civil service or the banks rather than work in industry. The application process for foreign investors can take six months, and there are restrictions on the level of foreign ownership. An added burden for companies proposing large projects is the possibility that one of President Suharto's children will want to take a stake in the business - a disincentive for foreign creditors who might otherwise be willing to provide finance. Shortages of electricity and clean water, a poor telephone service and other infrastructural problems common to other rapidly expanding Asian economies also cause difficulties. 'In terms of investment conditions, if you compare it to any country I think Indonesia is among the least advanced,' said Mr Yohsuke Udaka, director of PT Teijin Indonesia Fiber Corp, a Japanese-Indonesian joint venture manufacturer of synthetic fiber and yarn. He compared Indonesia's relatively restricted investment regime to the incentives on offer elsewhere, including tax holidays in China and electricity rebates in Thailand. The point is not lost on BKPM officials. 'A lot of Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese investment that should have gone to Indonesia has gone to Thailand,' says Mr Asril Noer, the BKPM's director of overseas promotion. 'I think they are quite attractive with their incentives.' From President Suharto downwards, Indonesian officials are aware of the need to accommodate 2.5m new jobseekers each year and realise that they will have to improve Indonesia's investment image further. A package of reforms introduced last year allows foreigners to start with 100 per cent ownership of a project if it has paid-up capital of at least Dollars 50m, or if it is sited outside the main island of Java and the more developed parts of Sumatra. This year, the BKPM's status was raised in the March cabinet reshuffle by the elevation of Mr Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, the BKPM chairman, to ministerial rank. The government is expected to ease industrial licensing procedures and extend land lease titles, perhaps to 50 or 60 years from the current 30 or 35 years. It may also reduce the Dollars 50m limit for 100 per cent initial foreign ownership. 'I think they have to give a good signal very soon,' said Ms Mari Pangestu, chief economist at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta. Investors and government officials are also anxious to establish component industries so that manufacturers can source more of their materials inside Indonesia - instead of keeping large stocks of imported products in their factories - and an Indonesian mission is due to travel to Japan in June to discuss the issue. Progress has already been made. PT Teijin Indonesia, for example, uses purified terephthalic acid (PTA) as one of its principal raw materials to make polyester fibre and should soon be able to receive supplies from a new Mitsubishi PTA plant in Indonesia; hitherto it has been obliged to buy PTA on the international market and to buy the output of Pertamina, the state oil company, despite its dissatisfaction with the quality and reliability of Pertamina's supply. Another concern which the government may seek to address is the falling level of domestic investment. BKPM figures show domestic approvals falling to Rp29,342bn in 1992 from Rp41,085bn in 1991 and Rp55,278 in 1990. The government's 'tight money' policy of restraining credit growth since 1990 is regarded as the main culprit, but nationalist Indonesians have also complained that the ethnic Chinese citizens who dominate private commerce and industry have been investing in China at the expense of Indonesia. Such complaints smack of over-simplification. The Chinese retort that they are subjected to equally fierce criticism if they invest too much in Indonesia - on the grounds that they are supposedly monopolising Indonesian business - and point out that much of the money invested abroad is already located offshore in Hong Kong or Singapore. Furthermore, the income from profitable investments in China or elsewhere can be used to fund expansion in Indonesia itself. There is, however, widespread concern at the obvious emotional attachment to China displayed by ethnic Chinese businessmen from Indonesia, although when a wealthy entrepreneur flies north it is hard to tell if he is negotiating business deals in southern China or merely gambling in Macao. With both domestic and foreign investment requiring further encouragement, it may not be long before the government acts. 'We recognise that on a competitiveness rating, we are now rather behind, especially compared with China,' said Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, the finance minister. 'We have to improve the whole investment climate .. We will do it soon.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NON-OIL INVESTMENT APPROVALS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year           Domestic            Foreign          FDI inflow                 (Rp bn)        (Dollars m)         (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1987             10,449              1,520                 723 1988             14,238              4,481                 824 1989             19,439              4,718               1,025 1990             55,278              8,751               1,443 1991             41,084              8,778               1,960 1992             29,341             10,313                na  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FDI = foreign direct investment Source: BKPM/Bank Indonesia  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

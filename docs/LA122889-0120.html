			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N. AGENCY ASKS FOR 700,000 TONS OF FOOD TO AVERT ETHIOPIA FAMINE  </P> <P> A U.N. agency appealed Wednesday for 700,000 tons of food to avert widespread  starvation in northern Ethiopia, where as many as 4 million people are  threatened by famine.  </P> <P> The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said its estimate was based on a  recent crop survey, which found that serious drought had cut harvests by nearly  80% in Eritrea province and 50% in Eritrea's southern neighbor, Tigre.  </P> <P> Rebels in northern Ethiopia said Wednesday they have defeated a major offensive  by government forces and captured the large town of Debre Tabor in Gonder  province, 200 miles north-northwest of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Tigre People's Liberation Front said that 3,200 government  troops were killed or wounded in heavy fighting starting last week.  </P> <P> "It's a very significant victory," spokesman Tewolde Gabru said from London in  a telephone interview. He did not detail rebel losses.  </P> <P> The FAO said there also would be food deficits in eastern Ethiopia and to a  lesser extent in pockets of the southern and central regions.  </P> <P> An "international relief operation of major proportions" is needed to avert a  repeat of the 1984-85 drought and famine when an estimated 1 million people  died, said FAO Director General Edouard Saouma, in a statement issued in  Nairobi.  </P> <P> Saouma also urged donors to provide logistic support to ensure the "timely  delivery" of aid.  </P> <P> Fighting in Eritrea and Tigre between the government and insurgents has closed  many roads, a situation that might require aircraft for relief deliveries.  </P></p>

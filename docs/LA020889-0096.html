			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAULTY BRAKES HINTED IN BUS DEATHS OF 19  </P> <P> Mexican authorities said Tuesday that mechanical failure -- possibly faulty  brakes -- was the likely cause of a bus crash in Ensenada that left at least 19  people dead and 22 others injured, many seriously.  </P> <P> "It appears that the driver couldn't stop the vehicle," said Elias Padilla  Gonzalez, who heads the Ensenada branch of the Baja California transit  department, which is investigating Monday's accident.  </P> <P> Padilla and others described the accident in telephone interviews Tuesday.  </P> <P> The bus -- reportedly more than 20 years old -- was filled to capacity when it  veered off a sharp curve on an unpaved road northeast of downtown Ensenada and  plunged more than 50 yards down an embankment, officials said. The vehicle  rolled over numerous times before coming to rest at the bottom of a hill  shortly after 11:30 a.m. Monday. Driving conditions, already hazardous on the  steep, rocky roadway, were rendered even more perilous by recent rain,  authorities said.  </P> <P> According to a police interview with one witness, the driver warned passengers,  "Hang On! We have no brakes!" shortly before going over the side.  </P> <P> The bus was owned by a cooperative known as Rojo y Blanco (Red and White). The  driver, identified as Martin Rosales, was among 15 people reported dead at the  scene, authorities said. Four others succumbed at hospitals on Tuesday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Party [NP] has warned that  KwaZulu-Natal could suffer untold harm to its economy unless the  question of a capital for the region is handled responsibly.  This follows reports of an ANC plan to boycott a provincial  legislature meeting in Ulundi. Mr. Tino Volker of the NP called  for a special sitting of the provincial legislature to appoint  an advisory committee on the site for a capital.    Meanwhile, the ANC has confirmed it will boycott the next  sitting of the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature which is scheduled to  be held in Ulundi at the end of this month. The ANC said it was  politically wrong to hold the meeting in the IFP stronghold.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 29 (CNA) -- In a bid to curb the  snowballing trade deficit with Japan, Taiwan is planning to  establish a holding firm to introduce key manufacturing  technologies from Japan, Kao Ching-yuan, chairman of the Chinese  National Federation of Industries, said Friday [29 April].    Kao said he will invite the public and private sectors as  well as Japanese firms to jointly invest in the holding company  which will have a capital base of at least NT [New Taiwan] $10  billion (US$378 million).    After its establishment, the holding company will seek to  transfer from Japan the technologies used in manufacturing each  product that Taiwan imports, since Japanese imports exceed US$30  million yearly, he added.    Kao said that Economics Minister P.K. Chiang and several  local business heavyweights, including Honorary Chairman Ku  Chen-fu of the Chinese National Association of Industry and  Commerce, have expressed their support for the proposed company.    Taiwan has been disappointed with the result of its efforts  to trim the trade deficit with Japan, and the gap is, in fact,  widening. The deficit totaled US$14.22 billion last year, and  is expected to increase to US$15.5 billion this year. The  first- quarter deficit was US$3.7 billion.</p>

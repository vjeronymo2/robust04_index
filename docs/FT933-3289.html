			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Lonrho head in venture to develop key City site THE 35-year struggle by Lord Palumbo to build on one of the City of London's most prominent sites - One Poultry, opposite the Mansion House - seems destined for success. Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, and Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier who is joint chief executive of Lonrho, yesterday announced a joint venture to develop the site, which is near the Bank of England and is occupied by listed buildings including the Mappin &amp; Webb building. The deal marks the start of a new phase of speculative development in the City, which is stabilising after one of the fiercest downturns of any property market in the country. Lord Palumbo said: 'The recession has turned the corner.' Construction of the building, which will have 125,000 sq ft of offices and 25,000 sq ft of retail space, is expected to start next April or May and to be completed in 1996. The plans for the site have been opposed by conservationists, including Prince Charles, who described the design by the late Sir James Stirling as a '1930s wireless set'. Mr Bock has acquired 50 per cent of the site. Advanta, the Frankfurt-based property company 80 per cent controlled by Mr Bock, will provide the funding and undertake the building's project management. Lord Palumbo said he and Mr Bock had an 'immediate rapport' after being introduced at the start of the year by a mutual friend who knew of their passion for architecture and the arts. They decided to go into partnership but delayed their announcement until after they received the support of the City Corporation, which in the past opposed development plans. 'They took the view that it would be absurd to keep challenging the development,' Lord Palumbo said. Mr Bock said he was delighted all the legal hurdles had been surmounted. But Lord Palumbo was more circumspect: 'It's as if you are leading 1-0, but you cannot afford to relax in the last two minutes of the game.' The developers expect an international financial services company to occupy the building. Tenants will not be sought for at least a year. Observer, Page 25</p>

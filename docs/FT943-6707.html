			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Negotiating the recovery Beyond Reasonable Doubt, the title of Lord Archer's first play, may no longer describe his chances of joining another government, but it does a good job of summing up the prospects for the UK recovery. With real growth exceeding predictions, and inflation undershooting them, two years of healthy economic growth seem all but certain. The forecast for the government, however, is as doubt-laden as ever. Monday's news that the economy grew more quickly than expected in the year to June was a pleasant follow-up to the previous week's surprisingly subdued July inflation figures. Real GDP is now thought to be growing at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent: earlier estimates had put it at 3.3 per cent. The August survey of monthly trends in manufacturing from the Confederation of British Industry did little to spoil the rosy picture. A higher proportion of respondents expect to raise output in the coming four months than at any time since the recovery began. Mr John Major, the prime minister, may be less enthralled with 'trickle-down economics' than his predecessor, but any government tends to expect good economic news to trickle down on to its popularity. Yesterday's Mori poll, indicating another record low in the Conservatives' popularity, scotched that theory again. The opposition's current 33 percentage point lead contrasts with the three-point Tory lead at the end of the second quarter of 1992, when the economy first edged out of recession. Conservative MPs will be pinning their hopes on Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, to revive the relationship between economics and politics, with tax cuts by the November 1995 budget, if not before. He will be able to oblige them, without jeopardising the economy's longer run stability, only if the economy's traditional Achilles heels - the current account and public sector borrowing - prove less troublesome than history would suggest. On the first, there are indeed grounds for optimism, none of them conclusive. On the second, the government's own commitments have put it on a precarious path. Favourable surprises The downward Pounds 600m revision to the UK's current account deficit in 1993, which was announced on Monday, does not significantly affect the combined Pounds 10.3bn shortfall in net exports for that year. But observers have been revising their expectations for medium-term export growth in the wake of the week's other favourable surprises. The CBI now predicts the volume of goods sold abroad to grow by 6 per cent this year and next. There was some justification for this in its own survey, which found favourable growth in export orders. More significant, however, is the fact that the largest continental European countries are emerging from recession faster than previously thought. French and German consumers may prove happier to splash out on consumer goods in the coming year, as their economies revive, than their counterparts in Britain. That would certainly be the preferred out-turn. Feel-good factor The trouble is that the current account is not the government's only concern. It is also worried by the lack of a 'feel-good factor' in the recovery this far. For all that it has been consumption-led: consumer expenditure accounted for over three-quarters of the 1.9 per cent growth in GDP in 1993, and looks set to provide around two-thirds of this year's figure. Consumption growth has not been matched in the consumer confidence figures, largely because the spenders' real incomes were being squeezed at the same time. Mr Clarke inflicted much of the pain himself, in the tax increases announced last November. By 1996, the combined prudence of the last three budgets will be yielding some Pounds 17bn a year in extra revenue. How much, if anything, he can give back to the electorate will depend on whether he can stick to the severe targets for control of public spending which he re-affirmed in June. In theory, real public spending is to rise a mere 1 per cent a year over the four years from last November. Achieving this would make Mr Clarke a more frugal keeper of the public finances than any chancellor of the 1980s. That alone would appear to provide good grounds for scepticism. But the fact that he has linked his efforts to the constraint of headline public sector wage deals means that the chances of visible failure are even larger than usual. True, the subdued behaviour of average wages over the past few quarters means that the gap between public and private sector earnings growth is less than one might have predicted at the time the policy was imposed. But the shortfall is likely to provide a growing source of pressure in the public pay rounds ahead. Certainly, this is a high risk approach. The conflicts produced by such a blunt-edged instrument of fiscal restraint are a poor way to revive the public's confidence. Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less may have been a bestselling book. It may prove to do less well as a political strategy.</p>

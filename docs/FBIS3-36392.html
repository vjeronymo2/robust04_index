The miners of Irsha-Borodino Open-Cut Mine, in Krasnoyarsk  Kray, seem to be on the point of stopping sending coal to their  consumers, including Irkutsk Oblast. To hit its heat and  electric power stations below the belt, as the saying goes. You  can imagine what kind of a situation is being created in that  complex.... In addition, its own "Vostsibugol" miners are also  in a prestrike state.    What complaint is being advanced from the two fronts?  Reciprocal nonpayments. The power workers are in the same  trouble. What money can they demand from Bratsk Industrial  Complex, let us assume, when it is on the point of being reduced  to beggary?    As regards the non-delivery of Borodino coal, Oblast  Governor  Yuriy Nozhikov has already promised to "introduce  countersanctions." For example, to stop the supply of  electricity to Krasnoyarsk's industrial enterprises. No, they  have not yet fallen out with each other: They are continuing to  seek ways to resolve the problem of nonpayments, and they also  intend to hold consultations with the Russian Federation  Government. The situation is difficult, although it should not  be overdramatized. There is still a hope, although it might be a  naive one: They are, after all, neighbors. For only yesterday  they were championing their interests at the federal level.  Today this is necessary at the local level. However "wild" the  market might be, the governor is right: "We will never give up  the defense of the region's interests. We will say that we  cannot increase or reduce the run-off of water to the  hydroelectric power station without affecting the interests of  Yenisey River shipping. We will not encroach upon each other."  Or the gram of coal and the kilowatt-hour of electricity, which  are essential to the people, will still prove to be serious  arguments, and financial chaos will divide the Siberians along  their own banks -- the banks of the Angara and the Yenisey.</p>

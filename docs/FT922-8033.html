			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fibre optics too hot to handle Cheaper and faster monitoring systems for detecting fire or extreme temperature changes are promised as a result of a simple application of fibre-optics by Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group. Normally fibre-optic cable is unaffected by heat or physical disturbance. But the company has discovered that if the cable is microscopically bent at specific points then it becomes sensitive to temperature change. This can be registered within seconds on a central computer. The new method, dubbed the Erica sensor, is particularly suited to monitoring over large distances or areas. Applications are likely to include fire and entry alarms and monitoring systems for power distribution cables and large heating systems. Ericsson Network Engineering: Sweden, 468 764 0000.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Russia hopeful on debt accord RUSSIA could conclude an agreement on its commerical debt in a few weeks, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, said yesterday. It would then start making payments on debts to commercial banks which have been subjected to 90-day rollovers until now. Moscow had set aside Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m) for London Club debt servicing this year, to be paid in three instalments of Dollars 166m, Mr Shokhin said. Russia had failed to conclude a rescheduling agreement with western commercial banks in Frankfurt last week because of outstanding disagreements and the banks' desire to consult further among themselves. One of the problems had been Russia's refusal to drop its 'sovereign immunity'. This would have given creditors unlimited claim over all state-owned assets, which were considerably greater in Russia than in other countries, he said. Russia was prepared only to grant a more limited government guarantee for debt repayments. But Mr Shokhin claimed an agreement could have been signed in Frankfurt had it not been for a desire by the small steering committee of bankers, which conducted the negotiations, to consult the 600 banks they represent. He also announced plans to begin dealing with the arrears owed to companies which had supplied goods to the Russian government. He invited them to form 'creditor clubs' in each country, which would then negotiate on behalf of all suppliers with a special committee for managing Russia's foreign debts.</p>

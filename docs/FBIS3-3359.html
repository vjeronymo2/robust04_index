A Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement that DPRK  had honestly fulfilled its obligations by receiving the  inspection group of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  and providing all conditions for their inspections.    The DPRK has also held several rounds of working contacts  with South Korea on an early exchange of envoys.    However, the statement said, the United State has fulfilled  none of its obligations specified in the New York agreement  reached on February 25.    The United States has threatened to resume the "Team Spirit"  joint military exercises with South Korea in 1994 if the DPRK  refuses more nuclear inspections and envoy exchange. In  addition, the U.S. will not attend the Geneva talks and will  present the nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council.    The statement accused the United States of trying to isolate  and stifle the DPRK through the Geneva talks.    The statement added that under such circumstances, the DPRK  will neither regard it as its obligation to ensure the  continuity of nuclear safety nor send a delegation to the Geneva  talks.    The statement said if the United States continues to  exercise  power politics and exert pressure on DPRK, DPRK will have no  alternative but finally withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).</p>

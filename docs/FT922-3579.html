			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Japanese life companies set back by Tokyo stock losses JAPAN'S big life insurance companies, hit by steep drops in Japanese share prices and interest rates, posted sharp declines in their returns on investment in the year to March 31, Reuter reports from Tokyo. With the Tokyo stock market showing no signs of recovery and premium income growth slowing, the life insurers would continue to pump much of their new money into domestic loans to secure stable returns, according to industry officials. The eight leading life insurers announced their business results for 1991-92 yesterday . Return on investment at the eight companies ranged from 4.75 per cent to 6.13 per cent, down more than one percentage point from a year earlier. 'The gaps between insurers are widening, and will continue to widen, based on their skills as investors,' said an official at Meiji Mutual Life Insurance. Assets at the eight insurers rose to Y110,310bn (Dollars 875.47bn) in 1991-92, an average growth of 8.5 per cent and the slowest rate since the Second World War. Officials ascribed the slow tempo to lower sales of savings-oriented insurance products and poorer returns on investment. The eight companies account for more than 75 per cent of the assets held at Japan's 26 life insurance companies. With 'risky' securities holdings at high levels, the investment heavyweights trimmed their foreign currency assets by an average 1.6 per cent in 1991-92 to Y17,110bn at end-March. Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance and Meiji Life bucked the trend, increasing foreign assets by 8.0 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively. However, Nippon Life Insurance slashed overseas assets by 8.6 per cent, Sumitomo Life Insurance by 9.5 per cent, and Asahi Mutural Life Insurance by 1.2 per cent. At the same time, the insurers were cautious about domestic equities because of low returns and high volatility since the 225-share Nikkei average index fell about 26 per cent in 1991-92. Nippon Life cut its holdings of foreign securities to Y3,380bn in 1991-92 from Y3,500bn a year earlier. As a result, foreign securities as a share of assets fell to 11.7 per cent at the end of March, from 13.1 per cent a year earlier. The sharp decline in Japanese share prices in 1991-92 forced the eight life insurance companies to take a securities write-down of Y1,870bn, an increase of 135.3 per cent from a year earlier. Life insurers would remain net stock buyers in the current year since they expected their assets to grow, but would remain cautious about equity investments, according to the officials. An official at Nippon Life, Japan's largest life insurer, said his company would continue to allocate new money mainly to domestic loans and domestic bonds in the 1992-93 financial year. Unrealised share profits at the eight insurers fell to Y8,430bn at end-March from Y21,610bn a year earlier. After the write-down of securities and plunges in unrealised profit in shareholdings, the eight insurers will cut dividends to policy-holders in 1991-92. 'It is a sign that Japanese insurers will be forced to offer different dividends to policy-holders in future,' said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre.</p>

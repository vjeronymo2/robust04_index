			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: SG Warburg supported BT price with 22.5m share buy SG WARBURG Securities, the global co-ordinator for the flotation in December of the second tranche of British Telecommunications yesterday said that it had bought 22.5m shares from the Treasury as part of measures designed to help stabilise the share price. The announcement could imply that Warburg has bought up to 96m shares in the stock market since the December 9 float, which could have made it a profit of about Pounds 1.5m. The terms of the offer allowed Warburg to over-allot up to 7.5 per cent of the tranche, up to 118m shares, and to cover that position by buying in the market or from the Treasury if the price fell below the flotation price of 125p. The measure was intended to help support the share price if necessary. Given the strong demand at the float - institutions applied for nearly double the allocated shares - it has been assumed that Warburg over-allotted the full 7.5 per cent. Yesterday's statement would then imply that it had bought up to 96m shares in the market. The new partly-paid shares slumped after the float to a low of 120 1/4 p on December 23, but have since recovered to 125 1/2 p. To make a profit from buying shares in the market, Warburg would have had to buy at below about 122 1/2 p, given its commission costs. If it had exercised the full over-allotment facility and had bought 96m shares in the market at about the lowest price, it could have made Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2m profit. However, Warburg paid the Treasury 125p less commission costs for the 22.5m shares and so would not have made a significant profit on those. Including that purchase by Warburg, the total number of shares sold by the Treasury is now nearly 1.6bn. The government still owns 22 per cent of British Telecom.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALE OF TWO CRITICS  </P> <P> My question to Times critic Dan Sullivan is why did he think Peter's piece  required a rejoinder in the first place? Is Dan so paranoid that this British  counterpart might be right that he felt the compulsion to strike down what  Peter wrote?  </P> <P> The fact is, having read Sullivan's criticisms for many years, I have never  gotten the impression that Sullivan himself thinks terribly highly of theater  in Los Angeles, and that he would be much happier reviewing plays in London or  New York.  </P> <P> JEFF TRENT  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

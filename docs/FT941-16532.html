			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Scott Inquiry to examine UK/Iraq documents The Scott inquiry is examining documents which suggest that the contribution of UK manufacturing to Iraq's military enhancement was more widespread than that suggested by Whitehall and ministers. An official with the inquiry confirmed yesterday that Lord Justice Scott is looking at a dossier supplied by The Sunday Times which includes allegations that Royal Ordnance supplied material to Germany which was eventually shipped to Iraq. British Aerospace has denied that it has breached export regulations and is offering to co-operate fully. Meanwhile, the inquiry is checking United Nations documents made available by the government to see if any of those concerning Iraq's nuclear programme are missing. The inquiry was given information last year which had been gathered by a UN inspectorate team and was thought to mention the names of British companies involved. The Sunday Telegraph yesterday said some of the documents had been suppressed by the government.</p>

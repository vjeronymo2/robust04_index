			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Dividend rises expected to shock politicians - Michael Smith considers the interim results from the electricity companies which begin on Thursday It says something about a sector when a company is expected to kick off the interim results season with an 11 per cent dividend rise which is likely to be seen as uninspiring by comparison with its peers. The sector is electricity, which has delivered an almost uninterrupted stream of good news to shareholders since privatisation began four years ago. The company is Scottish Power, which reports on Thursday. It may exceed the market's 11 per cent expectations but it would have to perform miracles to match the England and Wales electricity companies. Some of the 12 regional companies are considered capable of delivering dividend rises of more than 25 per cent, extraordinary even by their extraordinary standards. National Power and PowerGen, the generators, should not be too far behind, with analysts expecting about 20 per cent in each case, even though both have lost market share in recent years. Profit increases for all companies will be meaningless because so much of power companies' sales are in the second half of the year. But the dividend rises will show that this is a sector in very good health. Far too good in the view of critics. A political row seems inevitable. The Labour Party will use the results to promote its view that the electricity companies were floated too cheaply and are given too easy a ride by the regulator. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, warned last weekend that his party believed some companies should be subject to a windfall profits tax, especially in view of the regional companies' forthcoming flotation of the National Grid. The Grid is expected to fetch at least Pounds 4bn, whereas it was valued at just Pounds 1.2bn in 1990. Shareholders in Scottish Power and its neighbour Scottish Hydro-Electric should suffer less than the regional electricity companies from the political row's fall out. They have no stake in the Grid and have had to cope with considerably tighter price controls than the regional companies in England and Wales. Furthermore this year's regulatory review of prices, to take effect from next April, was viewed by the market as being much tougher on the Scottish companies than those in England and Wales. Hydro agreed. Two weeks ago it announced it was rejecting the controls on its distribution business, triggering a referal to the Monopolies and Mergers and Commission. With such an important issue at stake Hydro may be relatively subdued when announcing its results next month. Even so, it is expected to produce an interim dividend rise of about 10 per cent. The City will be looking for guidance from Hydro as to how it sees the referal taking shape. The main question investors will ask of Scottish Power is what it intends to do with its likely cash surplus. Unlike the England and Wales companies it has not sought shareholder permission to buy back shares. Does it intend to make a large acquisition, perhaps buying one of the England and Wales regional companies? Or will it follow the example of East Midlands Electricity and provide a large special dividend. South of the border similar questions will be put to Southern Electric and Yorkshire Electricity. Both have approval to buy back shares but have not yet done so. Yorkshire's recent withdrawal from a deal to buy a stake in Stockholm Energi could free up about Pounds 150m. Most of the other regional companies can still effect buy backs since all but two, Midlands and Northern, have yet to reach the 10 per cent limits which have been approved. Other topics of interest will include the regional companies' non-core activities, including retailing and contracting, in which some companies are struggling to make profits. The main focus, however, will be on dividends. Opinions differ as to how far the England and Wales companies dare go. One theory is that with the regulatory review over and an election still probably two years away, the companies will throw off their inhibitions and pump out as much money as they can. 'The gloves are off,' said Mr Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett, the securities house. 'Conveniently the Budget on November 29 pre-dates the (main) reporting season, so aggressive dividend announcements will not add to the clamour for the government to impose a savage one-off tax on the planned disposal of the National Grid.' Mr Kevin Lapwood, at Smith New Court, disagreed. 'The recs have a political dilemma. Share buy backs mean that some companies could push dividend increases per share, rather than total dividend payments, past 25 per cent. 'But companies have to be sensitive about what the Tories might do to them as a result of the Grid sale. MPs are acutely aware that a spot of rec-bashing could do them some good in the polls.' The English generators both report next week with PowerGen on Tuesday and National Power on Thursday. Their results are the last before the government sells its remaining 40 per cent holdings in February, so there will be more than usual interest. Issues include the companies' diversification and their attempts to try to sell up to 6,000MW of capacity by the end of next year, as agreed with the regulator. Northern Ireland Electricity, the last of the 17 companies to be privatised, is expected to show dividend growth of about 15 per cent. But this is the one company where dividends may taken second place to other issues. The main interest will centre on the effects of the IRA ceasefire. Company engineers have already been investigating the possibility of re-opening the interconnector with the Irish Republic.  -------------------------------------------------------------------               ELECTRICITY COMPANIES: DIVIDEND FORECASTS  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Interim Results                            Forecast*              Percentage date        Company                range (p)   Previous     increase  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Nov 10      Scottish Power           4.58        4.13        10.9 Nov 15      PowerGen                  4.7        3.95        19.0 Nov 17      National Power            4.6        3.75        22.7 Dec 1       Seeboard                 3.85         3.3        16.7 Dec 5       N Ireland                 3.9        3.39        15.0 Dec 6       Midlands                  8.8        7.65        15.0 Dec 7       Swalec                 **11.0         7.5        46.7 Dec 8       Hydro-Electric            4.4        3.96        11.1 Dec 9       Norweb                    7.7         6.7        14.9 Dec 12      Northern                  8.6         7.4        16.2 Dec 12      Eastern                   7.9         6.6        19.7 Dec 13      Southern                  7.8         6.7        16.4 Dec 14      London                    8.4         7.4        13.5 Dec 14      Manweb                    8.1         7.0        15.7 Dec 15      South Western             8.1         7.0        15.7 Dec 16      Yorkshire                 7.9         6.9        14.5 Dec 19      East Midlands             7.8         6.8        14.7  ------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Dividend 'rebalanced'. *  Forecasts do not include scope for greater dividend enhancement    following recent share buy backs.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: SG Warburg and company annual reports.  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

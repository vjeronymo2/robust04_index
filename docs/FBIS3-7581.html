			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- U.S. Ambassador to Japan  Walter Mondale said Wednesday [30 March] he is "disappointed"  with Japan's new market-opening package designed to help ease  trade tensions between the two nations.    Speaking to a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of  Commerce in Japan (ACCJ), Mondale said there is "virtually  nothing" which can significantly reduce Japan's current account  surplus in the Japanese package unveiled the previous day.  "There is not a stimulation at all" for the Japanese economy in  the program, he said.    Japan announced Tuesday a new package of measures to further  open its markets to foreign products in a bid to bring down its  towering trade surplus with the rest of the world, the United  States in particular. The package offers, however, no fresh  proposals on macroeconomic measures, although it promises to  come up with concrete plans for comprehensive tax reform by the  end of June.    The program is a "very generalized statement of steps that  will be taken down the road," Mondale said. He was also  dissatisfied with plans for further deregulation featured in the  package, calling them "very vague" and "very difficult to  analyze."    His remarks reinforced criticism expressed overnight by U.S.  Officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor,  who said the package has failed to meet U.S. concerns.    Mondale said the package cannot justify the resumption of  the  Japan-U.S. "Framework" trade talks aimed at slimming the  bilateral trade surplus.    The Japanese package is designed to show Tokyo's commitment  to reducing its surplus and help break the impasse in the  framework negotiations, which broke down in February.    He indicated the possibility that Washington may resort to  trade sanctions unless Japan works to bring down its surplus.    "We very much hope (sanctions) won't be necessary. But we've  also said we cannot live with the status quo."    The U.S. ambassador said much should be done, particularly  in  the auto and auto components, one of the key areas covered by  the framework trade negotiations. "Basically, we have a closed  market here," he said, citing heavy import taxes and tight  inspection requirements as examples of the obstacles hampering  sales of U.S. cars in Japan.    If progress cannot be made in this central area, he said, it  is very hard to see how overall progress can be made in the  framework talks.    Mondale also said the U.S. does not intend to specifically  instruct Japan about what it should do to boost domestic demand  because giving specifics is "perhaps improper."    "We do not come to Japan to say, `here is the American tax  program you are putting into place,"' he said.</p>

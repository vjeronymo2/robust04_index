			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Bid to revive satellite sports channel ATTEMPTS are being made to revive Eurosport, the satellite television sports channel that went off the air yesterday. It collapsed after attempts to find Pounds 60m from new investors failed before the deadline ran out last Friday. The Eurosport consortium brought together 17 of Europe's public service broadcasters, including the BBC and Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International. In February the European Commission decided that the consortium breached Community competition rules. As a result it would have been illegal for Mr Murdoch to continue the News International-Sky Television involvement beyond May 5. Apart from putting in finance to take the venture to break-even, potential new investors TF1, the French television company, and International Events Management (IEM), a grouping of German companies, would have bought out Mr Murdoch's 50 per cent stake. Mr Alan Hart, the Eurosport chairman, said yesterday that there was still a consortium 'and we will do all we can to keep the concept alive.' Others blamed Brussels for tipping the balance against survival. At a meeting with Community officials last week, TFI and IEM were told they were acceptable Eurosport partners in competition terms. However, it is believed that the officials raised serious questions about the future of the European Broadcasting Union. Its role as purchaser of exclusive broadcasting rights for its members is being investigated by the Commission. Eurosport had access to those rights through its partners who were EBU members. The uncertainty over the EBU meant that neither TF1 nor IEM could complete the Eurosport deal in the time available. 'They say they want to stimulate competition. All they've done is kill it,' said one of those involved. However, the Commission said yesterday that it remained ready to continue discussions with Eurosport. The channel began broadcasting in February 1989 and reached more than 25m homes through satellite dishes and cable television networks.</p>

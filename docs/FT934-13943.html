			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt starts week with a gain of 1 per cent FURTHER gains were seen among continental bourses yesterday as the bull run showed no sign of flagging, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT closed nearly 1 per cent higher in active trading, although slightly off its intraday high of 2,043. The DAX index ended up 18.29 at 2,033.32 in turnover of DM9bn. Nikko Europe in its German market comment noted that any consolidation would be muted because of 'funds seeking equities given the increasingly lower yields on deposit. The question is: how much more liquidity is there to come and when will fundamentals catch up with share prices?' In spite of a Bundesbank council meeting due this Thursday many market observers do not expect a further easing in German rates until next month. The chemical sector attracted particular interest. Robert Fleming in London has recently put out a buy recommendation on Bayer and Degussa and noted that positive signs for the sector included: accelerated cost cutting and first signs of improving polymer prices as European surplus capacity is syphoned off by recovering demand in the US. Bayer and Degussa added DM2.30 and DM13.20 respectively to DM313.70 and DM406.50. ZURICH reached a seventh consecutive record high with the SMI index adding 51.0 or 1.9 per cent to 2,663.6, with the advance again based on a firm dollar and hopes of lower interest rates. Sandoz, which reported nine month figures last Thursday, rose SFr115 or 3.2 per cent to SFr3,670 as Mr Marc Freudweiler at Credit Suisse noted that the share had underperformed recently and recommended that investors take advantage of the current low price. CS Holding added SFr85 to SFr3,350. Merrill Lynch commented recently that it was the most modestly valued of the big three Swiss banks and the furthest from potential peak earnings. This year's windfall profits would bolster its capital base and it was the only one of the three that appeared undervalued in a European context. PARIS fell back slightly from midsession highs but the CAC-40 index still managed a day's gain of 5.73 to 2,144.99. There was tremendous activity in BNP stock on its first day of trading after privatisation, and at one stage the shares were suspended briefly after breaking through a 15 per cent fluctuation band. The shares finally closed at FFr283.90. The government also confirmed that Rhone-Poulenc will be the next major privatisation issue, following suggestions last week that Elf-Aquitaine, also confirmed as number three, might move up the list. The two closed respectively up FFr2.40 and FFr6.50 at FFr145.50 and FFr434.00. MILAN followed in the wake of Fiat's strong performance and the Comit index rose 12.29 or 2.1 per cent to 589.88. Mr Gian Luca Manca of Robert Fleming Securities noted that the market was also supported by expectations of lower interest rates and a waning of recent worries over liquidity. Heavy foreign and domestic buying took Fiat L172 or 4.5 per cent higher to L4,000 in continued response to the rights issue last Friday. Italmobiliare, also making a capital call this month, rose L1,595 or 5.1 per cent to L32,995. Montedison climbed L31 to L831 in spite of continuing uncertainty over the rescue plan. AMSTERDAM remained in positive territory with the heavyweight international stocks all performing well. The CBS Tendency index advanced 1.3 to 132.1. BRUSSELS played the interest rate theme with the Bel-20 index ending at a new record high, up 10.19 at 1,381.05 in turnover of some BFr1.7bn. VIENNA put on more than 3 per cent helped by the bullish mood elsewhere on the continent. The ATX index closed up 33.73 at 1,077.56, its highest level since early March 1992. The Nordic markets all showed gains with OSLO's All share index at a new three year high, up 9.75 at 599.69. In STOCKHOLM the Affarsvarlden general index put on 15.90 to 1,397.80 in spite of a fall in Ericsson, down SKr4 to SKr466 in the B shares. COPENHAGEN's KFX index broke the 100 barrier, closing up 0.69 at 100.56. ISTANBUL added to Friday's losses with a fall in the composite index of 258.8 to 14,935.3.

The year 1993 was evaluated by the CCPCC as the most  difficult in the revolution.    The Central Committee believed that it is necessary to  evaluate correctly the required measures related to the creation  of basic units of cooperative production, the legalization of  possessing foreign currency and the opening up to certain  foreign capital investments.    Among the problems is the need for each institution to work  systematically to reduce its budget and to increase efficiency  in the use of resources.    The plenary session also discussed the need to reduce the  excess money in circulation.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / OECD Annual Report: Trade rows need to be tackled - Conclusion of Uruguay Round is only half the battle The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development yesterday urged governments to use the momentum for trade liberalisation created by last week's Uruguay Round agreement to tackle other trade disputes and difficulties. Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, said the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round did not mean that all trade problems were solved. The final agreement either did not cover or only partially covered a number of long-standing problems, he said. New issues such as the interaction between trade and measures to protect the environment had emerged since the start of the round and were creating friction. Fresh threats to the multilateral trading system had also emerged during the recession in the industrialised world and there had been a perceptible drift towards managed trade measures, he said. Although he did not name the US, which has sought numerical goals for reducing Japan's trade surplus, Mr Shigehara criticised moves towards bilateral 'results-oriented' approaches to trade aimed at guaranteeing market shares or setting specific changes in bilateral trade balances. Another problem was the emergence of an environment in which vested interests were protected at the expense of the consumer and which ultimately damaged the industries that were being protected by taking from them the incentive to innovate. Mr Shigehara said governments - and in particular the 24 industrialised member states of the OECD - should resist these wider threats to the global trading system by building on the Uruguay Round agreement. The round could start having a positive psychological impact on the global economy next year. However, it still had to be ratified so that its beneficial effects would be felt only gradually. The OECD has estimated that the trade liberalisation measures agreed in the round could boost world welfare by Dollars 270bn (Pounds 181bn) at current prices by 2002. Yesterday, Mr Shigehara said that this figure, which would be equivalent to about 1 per cent of likely global income, was 'probably an underestimate'.</p>

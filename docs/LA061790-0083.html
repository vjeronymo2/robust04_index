			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTALISTS LOOK TOWARD CITY RACES;  </P> <P> POLITICS: TWO UNEXPECTED VICTORIES HAVE GIVEN SLOW-GROWTH BACKERS HOPE THAT  VOTERS ARE READY TO LIMIT DEVELOPMENT.  </P> <P> Unexpected victories by slow-growth advocates in three Ventura City Council  races and in a county supervisor race have convinced environmentalists that the  greening of politics has begun in Ventura County.  </P> <P> "I would suggest that anybody running on a strictly environmental platform can  get into office if they are credible," said Stan Greene, president of the  700-member group Citizens to Preserve the Ojai. "There is a groundswell now. I  think the last two elections bear that out."  </P> <P> Some environmentalists are already looking to elections in November, when they  expect numerous candidates to run for City Council seats in attempts to slow  Oxnard's rapid growth and to curb what they see as development abuses in  Camarillo and Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Indeed, with the astounding upset victory by 25-year-old political novice Maria  VanderKolk for 2nd District supervisor on June 5, slow-growth advocates say  they see unparalleled political possibilities.  </P> <P> "This is our window of opportunity," said Ken Bauer of Westlake Village, a key  strategist in VanderKolk's victory over Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer.  </P> <P> VanderKolk's success -- attributed to her opposition to two large housing  projects and to Schaefer's refusal to seriously campaign -- also reflects the  impact of canvassing by about 75 volunteers recruited primarily from the  fledgling environmental group Save Open Space.  </P> <P> That type of shoe-leather support by volunteers also marked the victories last  fall of new Ventura City Council members Cathy Bean, Gary Tuttle and Todd  Collart, who argued that city limits on growth were too lax.  </P> <P> "VanderKolk's victory underscores the point that you can't get elected in this  area without seriously addressing the issue of growth," said Kevin Sweeney,  public-affairs director for Ventura-based Patagonia Inc., a clothing company  that contributes to environmental groups and local campaigns.  </P> <P> "There has been a victory in the north part of the county and a victory in the  south part," he said, "so now you begin to fill in the blanks in between."  </P> <P> How that can be done is uncertain. But it appears that several slow-growth  candidates will run in Oxnard this fall, when a majority of the five positions  on the City Council will be on the ballot.  </P> <P> Though filing does not begin until mid-July, Paul K. Dolan and Scott Bollinger  have already announced their candidacies, citing "unequivocal opposition to  future rampant growth" as part of their joint platform.  </P> <P> Accountant Scott Weiss, who co-founded a slow-growth group early this year,  said last week that the VanderKolk upset had encouraged him to consider running  for the Oxnard council.  </P> <P> Weiss said his small organization is looking for other slow-growth candidates  to back and is soliciting help from Patagonia, which provided financial backing  and advice to VanderKolk and to the three Ventura candidates.  </P> <P> In Camarillo, representatives from five homeowner groups are meeting to decide  how to fight zoning changes that are allowing agricultural land to be developed  as shopping centers and industrial parks, homeowner Chris DeSales said last  week.  </P> <P> He expects an umbrella organization to be formed soon that will back City  Council candidates in the fall campaign, said DeSales, a resident of Woodside  Greens at the base of the Conejo Grade.  </P> <P> "It's the same issue with each group," he said. "People are seeing more  agricultural land going under. We are all concerned about this kind of  development, which seems to be continuing unabated."  </P> <P> In Thousand Oaks, some supporters of VanderKolk say they hope to continue their  crusade for stringent growth controls in City Council races there. Thousand  Oaks, under Measure A passed in 1980, limits residential construction to 500  units a year -- a sharp cut from the thousands per year proposed before its  approval.  </P> <P> But Eloise Zeanah, campaign manager for VanderKolk and twice an unsuccessful  council candidate, said she and others are bothered by the City Council's  borrowing of housing allocations from future years.  </P> <P> "The residents need to know that our elected officials have skirted the intent  of Measure A," she said. "It has not controlled growth, it has only metered it.  These problems are beginning to surface now."  </P> <P> Despite the environmentalists' surge of optimism since the recent victories,  some slow-growth advocates have begun to discuss how they can push their  message more effectively.  </P> <P> Sweeney, Bauer and others said that, if Ventura County environmental groups --  traditionally linked loosely and only marginally active in politics -- are to  take advantage of voters' heightened concerns, a countywide environmental  organization needs to be established.  </P> <P> "If we are going to prevent Ventura County from becoming another Orange County,  we really do need to get better organized," said Bauer, an ARCO executive who  moved from Los Angeles in 1976 to escape crime and congestion. "I'd love to get  something more permanent set up."  </P> <P> Sweeney said the current race-by-race approach to politics is not the best way  to win elections. In addition, it provides little research to support the  positions of slow-growth candidates once they are elected and "have to say no  to development 400 to 500 times in four years," he said.  </P> <P> "The next stage that has to happen will be a more proactive environmental  organization," Sweeney said. Such an office, staffed with a full-time  environmental researcher, would mean that "this county begins to develop a  backbone around its environment," he said.  </P> <P> A model for that organization can be found 30 miles up the U.S. 101 in Santa  Barbara County, where a strong push since a disastrous 1969 oil spill has led  to a network of environmental organizations.  </P> <P> The groups include an agency to monitor neighborhood growth issues, a political  action committee, a large research institute and a legal center with three  attorneys.  </P> <P> Slow-growth advocates, assisted by this network, now hold a majority of the  seats on the Santa Barbara City Council and the County Board of Supervisors,  said Robert Klausner, head of the political-action committee.  </P> <P> "This issue is a slam dunk," Klausner said. "We haven't had to sell anything.  It's tapping on concerns about the quality of life. It's not like someone is  laying a philosophy on them."  </P> <P> In Ventura County, individual environmental groups have scored a number of  legal and political victories during the last 20 years, but no such network has  ever been formed.  </P> <P> Patagonia recently has filled the role of a countywide environmental agency,  contributing $35,000 to local organizations last fiscal year and offering  political support in three campaigns, beginning with an unsuccessful  congressional bid in 1988 by state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara).  </P> <P> The outdoor-clothing company, whose influence has grown as its sales have  boomed since 1984, contributed $15,000 in slow-growth advertisements to last  fall's city races and $9,000 in ads leading up to this month's supervisorial  election. Owners Yvon and Malinda Chouinard contributed $2,000 personally to  VanderKolk, the maximum allowed by law.  </P> <P> "In a lot of ways, we've been a deep pockets for this county," said Sweeney,  who has orchestrated the company's move into political activism since he  arrived two years ago.  </P> <P> Patagonia has also hired part time the pre-eminent environmental researcher in  the county, Russ Baggerly, a former shoemaker from Meiners Oaks who for years  was a spokesman for both Citizens to Preserve the Ojai and the Environmental  Coalition.  </P> <P> Baggerly and his wife, Pat, are still directors of the Environmental Coalition,  a loose-knit group that takes positions on countywide issues and claims about  400 members.  </P> <P> Several directors of the Environmental Coalition said in interviews that they  too would like to see a more coherent countywide approach to environmental  problems but see no obvious way to achieve that goal.  </P> <P> "For 10 years now, I've been told that there are two things I have to do -- go  out and get volunteers and get people elected to office. I'm absolutely  worthless at both," said Cynthia Leake, a coalition director and chairwoman of  the 1,800-member Sespe Group of the Los Padres Chapter of the Sierra Club.  </P> <P> To create a political arm "takes money, time and energy. We need a staff and  don't have one," she said.  </P> <P> Russ Baggerly said that while local environmentalists want more support for  both research and political campaigns, they haven't come to expect it.  </P> <P> "We'll probably take it a race at a time," he said. "We know we have to get  environmentally sensitive people elected to office. But it comes down to  money." And neither staunch environmentalists nor residents who simply want to  slow the pace of growth seem to contribute much to such campaigns, he said.  </P> <P> Neil Moyer, president of the coalition and a new member of the Ventura Planning  Commission, said there are other basic problems with the concept of a  countywide environmental group.  </P> <P> "Different groups have different objectives, and they don't always overlap,"  said Moyer, an air-quality expert who works for Texaco.  </P> <P> In addition, the east and west counties, separated by the Conejo Grade, are  geographically distinct and have different problems, as do the inland areas  near Ojai and Fillmore, he said.  </P> <P> "So things are still very much fragmented on both a geographical basis and on  an issues basis," he said. "That's always going to be a problem with  environmental groups. Though they all arguably are under this green umbrella,  they have different interests and some of them are not very political at all."  </P> <P> Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle, a former world-class runner elected on a  slow-growth platform last fall, said: "I think the environmental movement is  here to stay.  </P> <P> "But I'm not going to go out and try to organize the county. I'm staying in  Ventura. I've got enough problems right here."  </P> <P> Ventura County's desire to hold back the sprawl of Los Angeles County has been  apparent for at least three decades, veterans of the environmental movement  say.  </P> <P> Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, formed in the mid-1960s, blocked an effort to  widen California 33, which would have allowed a growth boom.  </P> <P> In 1970, Pat Ellison, fresh from cleaning sea birds soiled with oil from the  Santa Barbara slick, helped found the Environmental Coalition. And in 1973, she  joined two other slow-growth candidates on the Ventura City Council.  </P> <P> With John McWherter, who is still on the council, they approved a series of  pioneering reforms that created an agricultural preserve within the city and  forced the clustering of new construction closer to the city.  </P> <P> Ventura County also approved a General Plan that requires development to be  clustered in or near cities. Now, all 10 cities in the county, except for  Oxnard, limit construction in some way.  </P> <P> "We've had a lot of victories over the last 20 years, but we're still  struggling hard," Ellison said.  </P></p>

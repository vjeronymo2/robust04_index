			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / International Company News: Weak metal price hits Alcoa's third quarter earnings A FALL in the price of aluminium has left third-quarter earnings of Aluminum Co of America (Alcoa), the world's largest producer of the metal, 18 per cent lower at Dollars 62.2m, or 72 cents per share, down from Dollars 75.9m, or 88 cents, a year earlier. Sales slipped to Dollars 2.4bn from Dollars 2.5bn. For the first nine months earnings fell by 58 per cent to Dollars 107.6m, or Dollars 1.24 a share, from Dollars 254.1m, or Dollars 2.97. A large part of this fall was due to extraordinary second-quarter losses and special charges of Dollars 104.7m, or Dollars 1.22 per share, relating to debt restructuring and the sacking of about 2,500 employees. Excluding the special charges, Alcoa's 1992 earnings to date came to to Dollars 212.3m, or Dollars 2.46 a share. The rest of the slide in nine month earnings was due to lower prices for alumina, ingot, and most fabricated products, the company said. Mr Victor Lazarovici, of S. G. Warburg in New York, said the results were 'surprisingly strong'. He pointed to the cost reductions, and noted that Alcoa's realisations from manufactured products rose to Dollars 1.38 a pound, up from Dollars 1.33 in the second quarter, and Dollars 1.30 in the first. As expected, the company's aluminium product shipments fell in the third quarter, to 675,000 tonnes, from 726,000 a year earlier. The third-quarter earnings were struck after unfavourable foreign exchange adjustments of Dollars 8.1m compared with Dollars 7.4m. Alcoa's stock closed down  1/8 at Dollars 64 1/8 on Wall Street after the results were released on Friday.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: VAT blow for charities and schools CHARITIES and schools face having to pay value-aded tax on non-business electricity and gas bills for the first time next year, when the tax is imposed on fuel for domestic use. They could, however, benefit from a tax loophole which will also be of use to individuals. Residential homes for the elderly could also make substantial savings. Anyone with enough cash reserves can avoid the new tax simply by paying for several years' worth of fuel before the end of March next year. VAT is charged at the rate that applies at the date of invoice or payment, whichever is earlier. So, payments accepted before April 1 1994, when VAT is imposed on domestic fuel at 8 per cent, will be zero-rated and payments made before April 1 1995, when the rate is increased to 17.5 per cent, will be subject to VAT at 8 per cent. Chantrey Vellacott, the London-based accountancy firm, has calculated that a charity with annual fuel bills of Pounds 5,000 could make a net saving of Pounds 670 by paying two years' worth of bills in advance. This comes from a saving of Pounds 1,275 on VAT, less Pounds 605 in interest which would have been earned if the money had been kept on deposit at 5 per cent. Individuals could save smaller amounts, depending on their fuel consumption. Independent boarding schools and grant-maintained schools, if they have charity status, will be able to exploit the method, but independent day schools will not. This anomaly is because of the distinction between business and non-business activities. Teaching at grant- maintained schools is seen as a charitable function, so fuel used is zero-rated. Teaching at independent schools, even if they are charities, is defined as a business activity because pupils have to pay for it, so fuel is standard-rated. But fuel used to heat residential accommodation at boarding schools is zero rated at present. This means that grant-maintained schools should be able to avoid VAT by pre-paying their entire fuel bills, while boarding schools could pre-pay the portion of their bills relating to residential accommodation. According to Jeremy Bird, secretary of the Independent Schools Bursars Association, most schools are aware of the advance payment option. 'Schools will be thinking about it but, of course, to pay in advance you have to have the money. It is a cost-benefit exercise,' he says. In the same way, charities already pay VAT on fuel used for business activities (eg, shops) but non-business activities are zero-rated, so tax savings could be made by paying those bills in advance. Anyone planning to take advantage of this loophole needs to make sure their gas or electricity supplier is willing to accept advance payments rather than simply treating them as mistaken overpayments. Most electricity boards have said they are willing to co-operate in the tax avoidance exercise, but will not be publicising it or offering discounts for early payment. Payments should be accompanied by a letter to them explaining the purpose. One consideration for individuals hoping to avoid VAT in this way is how long they expect to stay in their present home. It is unlikely to be possible to transfer pre-payments between electricity and gas suppliers while maintaining the tax benefit. But charities, schools, and nursing homes, being less mobile, should not have this problem. Another group which might be able to benefit is residents of blocks of flats where heating is supplied centrally. It might be, however, that some blocks have been paying VAT wrongly on this fuel since 1990 when the tax was imposed on fuel for business use. This has yet to be clarified, though.</p>

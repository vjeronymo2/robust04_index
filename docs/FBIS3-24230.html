			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Remarks of Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Duma </F> committee for CIS matters, and cochairman of the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord, recorded from a telephone conversation  by Maxim Shabalin, under the "At First Hand" rubric; date not  given: "Do Not Play With Matches"]    [Text] The Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES],  together with the Women of Russia faction, was the initiator of  the adoption of the Memorandum of Accord. I had occasion several  times at the council of the Duma to defend the principle of pact  voting. For the first time from the beginning of work of the new  parliament, I had a reason to tell the voters: Everything  possible was done not to repeat the nightmare of the recent  past, and so that the dead do not grasp for the legs of the  living. Manifestos, memoranda, declarations--these are not  documents of direct action. But there are quite a few examples  in the history of many states about what kind of role the  declaration or nondeclaration of such documents can play. I will  risk saying that the resolutions adopted by the Duma really  provide an opportunity for accord. It, of course, can be missed  due to a misunderstanding or malicious intent. Unfortunately,  the behavior of some of our natural allies--deputies from  Russia's Choice and the Yavlinskiy bloc--is a reason to suspect  at least elements of such intent in their attitude toward the  Memorandum.    Very much depends now on the mass media, inasmuch as it is  it  that brings the essence of one or another decision of the  legislative or executive authority to the people. If all  commentaries reduce the usefulness of the adopted Memorandum to  zero, then its value really will prove to be no more than the  value of the paper it is written on. The search for accord is  not a very simple matter, but its necessity should be recognized.    The fighting fervor of the antagonistic parties, which once  almost brought Russia to the brink of a civil war, remains.  There is evidence of attempts by individual deputies to  undermine the adoption and to dodge it at the last moment. But  if the president, nonetheless, intends to observe the  Constitution and not to violate the authority of the Duma, then  the people who are under investigation in Lefortovo will be  amnestied. How they behave in the future depends on us.  Orientation on a continuation of the confrontation and on a  vendetta will not lead to anything, especially when the  character of the persons involved in the dispute from both sides  is taken into account--of the president, of Khasbulatov, and of  Rutskoy. The characters are not easy to get along with--I would  say, they are Russians.    I am convinced that there are no prisons that hold you  forever. It is impossible for the trial of the participants in  the October events not to turn into a political trial. An  example of such a trial is the GKChP [State Committee for the  State of the Emergency] affair, to which there is no visible end  without an amnesty. The more quickly it takes place, the fewer  reasons there will be for being concerned about the fate of  future elections--both local and presidential. I am confident  that many alleged political authorities will waver considerably  after an amnesty. We, for example, do not intend to fight for  Rutskoy's electorate, but such a fight is in prospect for  Vladimir Volfovich.    In addition, I do not think that an investigation into the  October events is really advantageous to the current executive  authority, inasmuch as any investigation inevitably will get  stuck on Edict No. 1400, which the author himself recognized as  unconstitutional. I want to close this page, and not only I.  Individuals continue to threaten a civil war, but I would ask  them to calm down and to leave the matches alone.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Juliette Saunders] </F>   [Text] Port Elizabeth May 2 SAPA -- The African National  Congress overcame all opposition with a crushing victory Monday  [2 May] in the Eastern Cape, south of the Kei River, in South  Africa's first democratic election. Port Elizabeth, the largest  urban centre in the sub-region with an estimated voter  population of 470,000, closed the counting. The ANC swept the  boards with 252,531 of the votes for the National Assembly.    Its closest challenger, the National Party [NP], won 130,085  votes.    The total number of votes cast was 416,395, electoral  officials announced at 10.30PM. Rejected ballots numbered  2,928. After the NP, the ANC's opponents lagged far behind:  the Democratic Party [DP] with 13,867 votes, the Freedom Front  with 4,757 and the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] with just 4,119.    The scenario was similar for the provincial legislature. The  ANC scored 246,732 votes against the NP's 115,841 out of a total  412,133 ballots cast. The DP moved upwards to 29,991, as did  the rightwing front with 5,923 votes. The PAC dipped slightly  to 4,101.    In neighbouring Uitenhage where the white and coloured vote  niggled the ANC, Nelson Mandela's party also scored an easy win  with 66,066 out of the 103,002 votes cast for the National  Assembly, against the NP's 31,284 and the Freedom Front's 2,494.    Across the broader Eastern Cape and Kei region, the NP  threat  lessened throughout the day. The party dropped from 19.3 per  cent in the morning to 10.7 per cent by 11PM Monday compared  with 82.6 per cent for the ANC. The DP's support climbed slowly  from 2.4 per cent to 2.6 per cent. Ironically the PAC and  Freedom Front recorded similar percentages of just under two per  cent. The African Christian Democratic Party, which some  expected would gain a credible showing in the region, pegged  below one percentage point.    Counting was smooth throughout the sub-region except for  Port  Elizabeth where ballot box disputes resulted in stoppages. A  criminal investigation is pending over 30 ballot boxes from the  sprawling township of KwaZakele which police allege were  tampered with by Independent Electoral Commission officials.    Eastern Cape Attorney-General [AG] Les Roberts is to decide  whether a prosecution on the charge of electoral fraud is  feasible. The IEC and police have conducted separate inquiries  into the alleged tampering.    Agreement was reached early Monday evening between political  party agents and the IEC to count the 30,000-odd KwaZakhele  votes. With the mandate of the AG, the votes are excluded from  the final tally, are listed separately as "disputed" and will be  stored in an isolated container until the dispute is settled.  The NP's formal request for the votes to be declared invalid  must also still be decided on by the commission.    A second complaint by the NP -- over the way ballots were  compressed in another 24 ballot boxes from KwaZakhele -- was  resolved after a lengthy meeting on Monday when all the parties  accepted there had been no fraudulent tampering with the votes.  IEC officials said no abnormal trends were spotted with the  KwaZakhele votes at counting time.    Neither the premier candidate for the ANC nor NP was in the  region on Monday. Robben Island veteran Ray Mhlaba was at his  party's headquarters in Johannesburg. Dr Tertius Delport, the  former local government minister, flew to Pretoria for a meeting  with F W de Klerk.</p>

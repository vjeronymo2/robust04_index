Both sides  will hold full-fledged discussions beginning 12 January, and the  meeting on automobiles and auto parts is set to be held again in  Washington on 20 January. The two countries are to reach a  final agreement in a plenary session of the meeting slated for  late February.    Priority has been given to the automobiles and auto parts  sector, government procurement sector, and insurance sector, and  the two countries are to draw a conclusion on all sectors by 11  February when the Japan-U.S. summit talks are to be held.

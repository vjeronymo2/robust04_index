			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Advertising The brace of rights issues sprung upon the market by two advertising agencies last week may have convinced investors that life is returning to that most unfashionable of sectors. A glance at the agencies' share prices only reinforces the conclusion. Abbott Mead Vickers has had a strong run in recent weeks. Even WPP's and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's shares, which have long lingered in the world of the living dead, have shown signs of resurrection. They have outperformed the market by 39 per cent and 27 per cent respectively over the past three months. However, the sector's revival is based more on hope than expectation. In theory advertising should be one of the first beneficiaries of an economic upturn. So far at least, its practitioners have seen scant signs of it. On closer inspection, last week's rights issues confirm this more cautious view. Both companies want the money to position themselves for recovery rather than meet specific expansion needs. Gold Greenlees Trott's Pounds 15m cash call was designed to fund as yet unspecified acquisitions. Lopex's Pounds 3.5m rights issue is being used to bolster its depleted balance sheet. This should eventually help it chase new business, with clients as much concerned with an agency's financial stability as its creative credentials. Advertising's operational gearing will show through in time. Investors, though, are being somewhat premature.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Truce agreed on future of Smithfield market The Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, and the Smithfield Market Tenants' Association yesterday agreed a truce in the long-running dispute over funding the market which at one point had threatened the City's constitution. The dispute, triggered by disagreements over how to pay for the Pounds 60m refurbishment of the meat market required by European hygiene regulations, had led to attempts by Smithfield traders to pack the electoral register for December's elections to the City's Court of Common Council. Under the City's medieval constitution, some wards have fewer than 100 electors, making them an easy target for special-interest groups. Senior corporation officials feared that the traders could win as many as a third of the seats, inflicting critical damage on the organisation's political credibility. They had encouraged private companies and partnerships to boost the numbers of staff they put on the electoral roll. Preliminary indications are that the register has several thousand more names on it this year than it did last. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy committee, said that the City would continue with plans to reform the franchise - which would require an act of parliament - even though the Smithfield campaign had ended. He said: 'You can be quite sure we will be reviewing this year's events and coming forward with a reform package we will put to the government, even though they are not very sympathetic.' The traders' campaign appears to have won concessions. The City is spending an extra Pounds 2m, spread over five years, to add to the Pounds 10m in subsidies during that period which it had already agreed. The tenants have accepted an increase in the rents which they must pay per square foot from Pounds 13 to Pounds 20. At one point they had claimed they would be asked to pay an extra 400 per cent, and that the corporation's proposals would mean closure of the market. They also challenged the City's actions unsuccessfully in the courts. Mr John Brewster, chairman of the tenants' association, said he was delighted by the agreement, while Mr Cassidy said the City and the tenants would now be able 'to work together to make Smithfield the best market in Europe'. The corporation has already spent Pounds 27m building new trading and office accommodation, and will continue with plans to spend another Pounds 33m on improving listed buildings and the basement car park, and providing new commercial office space.</p>

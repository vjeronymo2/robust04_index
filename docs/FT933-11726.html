			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Time to make up or break up: Will British Gas be dismantled or remain a privatised monopoly Mr Cedric Brown, the burly chief executive of British Gas, has come a long way since he was a gas engineer in Yorkshire. He heads one of Britain's largest companies at a crucial time, and he is about to face the biggest test of his career. This week Mr Brown will discover whether his gamble of submitting British Gas to an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has paid off, or whether it will result in the break-up of the company. Mr Brown made the unprecedented request a year ago when he assumed the post of chief executive. It was a measure of his frustration over the constant bickering and lack of agreement about pricing and supply between the company and its regulator, Ofgas. But the blunt Yorkshireman's high-risk strategy of opening up British Gas to a full-scale investigation could backfire. If the commission recommends breaking the company up into smaller concerns - as Ofgas has suggested - Mr Brown could lose the fiefdom over which he presides. The question is: will parts of British Gas be sold off so that the household supply market can be opened up to competition? The inquiry has put Mr Brown in the awkward position of defending British Gas's monopoly over household supply in front of an inquiry panel of free-market academics and legal experts. He has submitted a pile of evidence 5ft high to the commission, which has spoken to about 550 interested parties. At the same time, British Gas has mounted a charm offensive on government ministers who will decide whether to enshrine the commission's verdict in law. If British Gas were to retain its monopoly, some ministers believe, it would only be because Mr Brown's arguments had won the day. But with electricity supply partially to be opened to competitors next year and fully in 1998, and with British Gas's monopoly already in the government's sights before the commission was called in, Mr Brown is rowing against the tide. British Gas claims it has recently been won over by the case for competition. Mr Brown says he is not averse to the idea of a freer market for households, but emphasises the need to tread carefully to ensure that neither customers nor shareholders lose out. However, he has warned the commission that an end to British Gas's monopoly could throw up several important problems. The three main issues are safety, security of supply, and price. Safety is at risk, argue Mr Brown and his gas engineers, if any company can feed into and take out from the pipeline network as much gas as it likes. If too much gas is taken out of the system at any one moment, air could be sucked in, causing an explosion. Less dramatic, but just as important for many customers, is the guaranteed supply provided by British Gas, Mr Brown says. If competition takes off and rival suppliers run out of gas on cold days in winter, customers signed up to those suppliers could see gas for their boilers switched off with little warning. Stretching this point further, Mr Brown believes that, in an open market, there could be customers that no company wants to supply - those with large debts or in remote regions, for example. At the moment, British Gas must supply anyone who wants gas, but that obligation could end, along with the monopoly. Mr Brown's final, and perhaps most powerful, point is that prices for the pensioner with one gas burner could double if market forces were introduced. A third of his 18m household customers currently subsidise the other two-thirds who use less gas. His arguments are rejected by competitors already wresting market share from British Gas in the industrial sector. In a study sponsored by a group of rival companies, accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand put forward a plan for opening up the domestic market without disruption. Coopers &amp; Lybrand suggested that competition could be introduced into household supply gradually from 1995 over a five-year period. The plan suggests testing all competitors on their suitability to supply household customers - ensuring they have adequate financial resources and gas supplies. All companies would be obliged to supply any customer approaching them, guaranteeing a certain minimum standard of service. A financial bond lodged with the regulator, or access to emergency gas supplies, could help ensure that no company cuts off any home gas supply because it has run out of gas. One of the companies sponsoring the Coopers plan, Alliance Gas, has provided further assurances, suggesting it can fulfil the functions currently performed by British Gas and still cut prices to all users by an average of Pounds 50 a year, or 10 per cent of bills. In any case, the price cap keeping British Gas's household price increases to a minimum will need to be in place until competition has been established. With competitors effectively able to answer two of British Gas's objections, the safety issue remains the real drawback to a liberalised market. But many of British Gas's safety fears could be removed by having a central pipeline company responsible for balancing supply and demand. This company could have access to a source of gas in order to regulate gas flows and for use in emergencies. The pipeline company would have to be separate from the rest of British Gas's business. Otherwise, some gas companies and the regulator believe, the development of competition could be hampered. A separation of pipelines from trading - either by accounting separation or a total sell-off - would ensure that British Gas's own marketing operations are not given more favourable access to the transport system than its competitors. This is another area on which the commission must pronounce. It is reviewing not only a sell-off of pipelines, but a wholesale break-up of the company into smaller regional units as has been suggested by Ofgas. Mr Brown contends that fully dismantling the company would cost Pounds 3bn over 10 years. It is estimated that a move to split off the pipelines would cost about Pounds 300m over the same period. This is because some costs would be duplicated if the company were split up. The high potential costs of break-up could sway the government to opt for the status quo. British Gas has already agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to separate accounting procedures between pipelines and its trading operations by this September. An important indicator of the future profitability of the pipeline network will be the rate of return set by the commission. Mr Brown believes that 4.5 per cent - the present rate - is too low. Ofgas reckons it is too high. This disagreement was one reason why Mr Brown requested the commission review. Mr Brown hoped to gain a more stable environment for the business over the next couple of years. He says constant arguing with Ofgas and a changing regulatory agenda were making it difficult to plan. To avoid further disputes, the commission's solution must help to soothe relations between the company and its regulator, and therefore must also be acceptable to Ofgas. Some of the abrasiveness may be removed anyway with the retirement of Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas and scourge of British Gas, in October. Ofgas and Mr Brown are not the only parties awaiting the commission's decision. The rest of the energy sector is also eager to know the verdict, because it will indicate how far the government wants to encourage competition elsewhere in the privatised utilities.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BRITISH GAS COMPETITORS' STRATEGY FOR OPENING UP HOUSEHOLD MARKET  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THIS WEEK  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Monopolies and Mergers Commission decides on new market/industry   structure, agreement in principle on how new market will work  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Preparation phase, framework implementation timetable, definition of   agreed contractual framework legislation and licences, regulatory   regime  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Preparation phase, development contracts, charging structures,   accounting systems, control systems  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1995  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Managed competition (5-year period) new public gas suppliers start   trading, fall in British Gas household market share  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 2000  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Full competition  review of storage company regulation, review of   charges/regulation for small consumers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Coopers &amp; Lybrand  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

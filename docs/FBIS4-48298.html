			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Peace and reconciliation in Kwazulu/Natal"] </F>   [Text] Today, in KwaZulu/Natal is the big day when the  parliament of the KwaZulu/Natal region is inaugurated. This  parliament has representation from those parties that achieved  success in the recent election.    It is a parliament of the people of this region, elected by  them; therefore we do not doubt that the people will give it due  respect and cooperation in its operation.    We congratulate all the parties that achieved success in  this  election and we desire that they work together toward  development in KwaZulu/Natal. Special congratulations to the  new prime minister of the region, the honorable Dr. Mdlalose,  who has been given the great responsibility of leading at a time  of healing of the wounds and hurts of the people of  KwaZulu/Natal.    We do not doubt that he will be able to work together with  Mr. Jacob Zuma of the ANC in making peace between the followers  of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC, who have been at  loggerheads for many years in this region. We request that  other ANC leaders in the region, such as Mr. Harry Gwala,  support Mr. Zuma in this task.    The time for war is now past. This is a time of  reconciliation and reconstruction. This is the time to gird up  for the hard work at hand of repairing the damage inflicted by  apartheid in this country, especially on the black community.  In KwaZulu/Natal we have the wonderful opportunity of also  working together to rebuild what was broken down by the anarchy  and violence that compromised much that was good in the region.    This region has a great many people, but also has much  poverty and underdevelopment. Job opportunities must be  created, houses must be built, schools must be built and  teachers trained, hospitals and clinics must be built, roads  constructed, and food and other commodities produced. All this  cannot be achieved without peace and reconciliation in this  region. We therefore urge everyone to work for peace and  reconciliation if our freedom is to bear tangible results.</p>

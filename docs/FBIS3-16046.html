In an  interview with ITAR-TASS he described as groundless today's  reports that agreements were signed at the meeting. Such  claims, he said, pursue purely propaganda motives, and  Azerbaijan is passing off as fact its versions of a regional  peace settlement.    Ararktsyan recalled that at the meeting various suggestions  were made regarding a cease-fire and peace guarantees, which  could be based on the CSCE's Vienna timetable, Russian  proposals, and also other possibilities.</p>

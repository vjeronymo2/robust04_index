The article says:    Comrade Kim Chong-il, member of the Presidium of the  Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the  Workers' Party of Korea, saw to it that the Pyongyang  declaration was made public, considerate of the realities that  many parties are groping their way how to rebuild the socialist  movement under the condition that socialism suffered setbacks in  some countries.    Heads and representatives of the political parties desirous  of socialism including many communist and workers' parties all  over the world got together and adopted the historic Pyongyang  declaration "Let us defend and advance the cause of socialism"  in Pyongyang in April 1992.    Comrade Kim Chong-il is directing deep attention to  strengthening the motive force of the socialist movement.    He said that to strengthen the motive force of revolution it  is imperative to strengthen the working-class party and enhance  its leadership role.    He published in recent years his works "The Workers' Party  of  Korea Organizes and Guides All the Victories of our People",  "Our Socialism Centred on the Masses Shall Not Perish" and "On  the Fundamentals of Revolutionary Party Building" in which he  put forward fundamental principles that should be maintained in  the building and activities of the working-class party to build  a new revolutionary party capable of rebuilding the socialist  movement and the ways for their implementation and gave correct  answers to many theoretical and practical matters arising in the  international arena, thus making undying contributions to the  development of the socialist movement.    The Workers' Party and the people of Korea now under the  guidance of Comrade Kim Chong-il are determinedly defending and  maintaining the Korean-style socialism and bringing the  advantages and vitality of socialism into full play with the  might of the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and  the masses.</p>

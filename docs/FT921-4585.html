			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Economics Notebook: The road to EMU develops some potholes SHAKESPEARE asked: 'What's in a name?' The question on the lips of Europe's central bankers is 'What's in a clause?' The argument about central banking independence is crucial to the political jousting over European Monetary Union (EMU). Parliaments around Europe are being called on to ratify the treaty for EMU agreed last December at Maastricht. The small print will be keenly scrutinised. There are strong indications from the German Bundesbank and the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) that treaty language on EMU which might have seemed acceptable three months ago now looks less than adequate to settle German qualms about giving up the D-mark. The pivotal component of EMU, set to take place at the latest by 1999 according to the Maastricht timetable, would be an 'independent' European central bank (ECB) running the future single European currency. At the insistence of the Germans, heads of government at Maastricht agreed a statute for the mooted ECB assuring that the bank should not take 'instructions' from governments. Indeed, the statute goes further than the 1957 Bundesbank Law in assuring the prime goal of price stability. The law governing the Bundesbank talks more vaguely of 'safeguarding the currency' - a concept which was first introduced into the Reichsbank Law in 1939, and interpreted for most of the first 20 years of the Bundesbank's existence as establishing exchange rate stability as the priority. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, is a great believer in EMU - but on Germany's terms. He is one of the leading figures in Germany challenging the assumption that clauses in central bank statutes, by themselves, are enough to guarantee a low inflation rate. For Mr Tietmeyer, the general economic and political environment in which a central bank operates is the most crucial factor in determining whether it will carry out its job properly. 'It will be of great importance,' said Mr Tietmeyer in mid-January, 'if and to what extent the future European central bank succeeds in winning an independent profile linked to price stability. In contrast to German monetary union (when the Bundesbank in 1990 took over control of the East German currency area) the institution which takes over responsibility (in Europe) will not be one with a well-established track record. 'It will be a question of setting up a new supranational institution which can rely neither on its own tradition of stability orientated policies, nor on support in public opinion comparable to the situation in post-war Germany.' Mr Tietmeyer's speech is in line with the general German mood of questioning over Maastricht now emerging into the public spotlight. Mr Wilhelm Nolling, the mercurial Social Democrat president of the Hamburg central bank and one of the most outspoken members of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, went further in a powerful Maastricht critique published at the end of last month. Even though the EMU treaty 'fully' took over German ideas on the independence of the ECB, Mr Nolling warned against 'overestimating' the role of the future European central bank. The trust of German public opinion in the Bundesbank had been built up over years. It could not be automatically transferred to the ECB. The debate about central banking independence is all the more piquant because most independent central banks are not doing well in the fight against inflation. The Japanese and French central banks, more beholden to governments than the German and Swiss ones, are chalking up better 'stability' performances than the Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank. Even Britain records a similar inflation rate to Germany's 4 per cent. Germany's lagging in the inflation stakes has, of course, been keenly registered by the Bundesbank. But, rather than making the denizens of the D-mark doubt the value of their own approach to monetary affairs, Germany's slippage in the stability stakes is prompting the Bundesbank to redouble its anti-inflationary efforts. The rise in German inflation, the Bundesbank argues, illustrates that central banking independence alone is not sufficient to bring down inflation. But it also emphasises the negative effects which an outside event - in this case, German reunification - can bring to bear on economic stability. Thus, according to the Bundesbank, it underlines the need for a truly independent central banking body to adopt strict policies to correct these tendencies. The Bundesbank is using every opportunity to stress that German interest rates will remain high until inflation shows persuasive signs of coming down to its medium-term 2 per cent goal. German, and European, monetary policy is thus in for a rough ride. A continuation of German monetary tightness for the next year, combined with only partial Bundestag ratification of the Maastricht treaty this summer, could deal a fatal blow to the EMU process. If, on the other hand, the Bundesbank does succeed, against all the odds, in quickly correcting the increase in inflation during the next 12 months, and thus allows German interest rates to fall significantly before long, EMU backers will also have no reason to rejoice. In that case, the German central bank will win back its 'stability-first' laurels - and the German government will be even less enthusiastic about seeing it replaced by an ECB at the end of the decade. Either way, the journey to EMU looks fraught with more risks than were apparent three months ago. Germany holds the key to whether the threatened road blocks can be removed.  --------------------------------------- CENTRAL BANKS  --------------------------------------- in descending order of independence                    inflation rate %  --------------------------------------- Sweden             5.3 (Jan) Germany            4.0 (Jan) Switzerland        4.6 (Feb) Netherlands        4.1 (Jan) US                 2.6 (Jan) Japan              2.2 (Feb) Britain            4.2 (Jan) France             2.9 (Jan) Italy              5.3 (Feb)  ---------------------------------------</p>

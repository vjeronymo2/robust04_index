			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / El Salvador deal lifts peace hopes EL SALVADOR'S government has agreed to extend to December 15 the deadline by which the country's former rebels demobilise, thereby breaking the impasse that had threatened to scupper peace accords signed in Mexico City on January 15, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The FMLN rebels had originally agreed to demobilise by October 31, but missed two deadlines after claiming the government had not complied with pledges to give them land and reform the military. Under the new guidelines, 20 per cent of the forces will be demobilised on October 31, another 20 per cent on November 20, and the final 20 per cent on December 15. The government has in turn submitted to the UN proposals to purge army officers found guilty of, among other transgressions, human rights abuses. The confidential list of transgressors is reported to be more far-reaching than many expected, and is said to include General Rene Emilio Ponce, the Minister of Defence, his deputy and more than 100 senior and middle-ranking officers. Although some 40,000 civilians were killed in El Salvador's 12-year civil war, only one senior officer has been imprisoned for human rights abuses. The government's ability to purge the army is seen as a key test of whether the army can be brought under civilian control, and will influence foreign aid to El Salvador.</p>

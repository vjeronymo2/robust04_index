			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. BEAT: TRULIO DISGRACIAS SEEKS UNITY IN ROCK 'N' ROLL  </P> <P> Looking for the next big thing in the L.A. rock scene?  </P> <P> They don't come much bigger than Trulio Disgracias -- an amalgamation of local  rockers, funksters, rappers and jazzbos that at last count reached 23 members.  </P> <P> Among the throng are most of Fishbone, a couple of Parliament/Funkadelic  veterans, one Red Hot Chili Pepper. Depending on who shows up, there are as  many as five lead guitarists, five bassists and four lead singers. The band has  become a hot item in local clubs, gaining attention through recent opening  slots at shows headlined by Living Colour and Public Enemy.  </P> <P> The method to this madness?  </P> <P> "It's a statement that there is a music scene in L.A. besides heavy metal,"  said Kendall Jones, Trulio and Fishbone guitarist. "We're not putting metal  down. We're going to do metal songs in our sets. The thing is we can prove it  comes from a diverse group of people. The whole thing is to unify the music  scene as opposed to just give attention to one thing at a time. We've got  people from jazz backgrounds, rap, metal, funk, punk."  </P> <P> The group's sound is not as chaotic as you might think -- or at least the chaos  is channeled.  </P> <P> "The first thing people think is, 'Oh no! It's going to be total disaster,' "  said John Bigham, who plays guitar with Miles Davis when not gigging with  Trulio. "We rehearse well, and everybody has a job to do in the band."  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Jones admits that there's another purpose to the band: to  party.  </P> <P> "It can't help being fun," he said of the band's wild shows. "We try to  infiltrate the party into the audience so the band and audience are one. It's a  beautiful thing."  </P> <P> With Fishbone about to embark on tours of England, Europe and the eastern  United States, Trulio Disgracias will be on hiatus for a couple of months. But  Jones said they will try to squeeze in some dates between tour legs, and once  Fishbone is back home in the summer the band will resume active duty around  town.  </P> <P> END OF AN ERA: The Club With No Name gets a name this weekend, with the winner  of a christening contest scheduled to have been announced Saturday night. With  that will come the official end of the Scream. That name -- a fixture on the  underground night-life scene since 1985 -- was relinquished when the club's  founders Dayle Gloria and Michael Stewart recently went their separate ways.  Gloria continues to oversee the newly monikered club at the Scream's old  locations (Mondays and Fridays at the Probe in Hollywood, Saturdays at the Park  Plaza Hotel), but says the club will reflect the changes in local tastes rather  than be the headquarters for the late-night gloom set.  </P> <P> "I want it to be a more universal club," she said. "A lot of people are really  getting into alternative music now. The crowds are integrating more. You used  to have to be totally into it, with black hair and white face. But now  everybody wants to have fun and see bands."  </P> <P> Gloria said she plans to start shows earlier -- though not too early.  Headliners will go on starting about 12:30 a.m. Upcoming shows include the  Miracle Workers at the Hollywood site on Friday, and Fetchin' Bones on Saturday  and the Lyres on March 31 at the Park Plaza.  </P> <P> ONCE UPON A TIME: While waiting for the release of Peter Case's second solo  album next month, fans may want to seek out "One Night in America," a  newly-released live recording from a 1981 show by Case's old band, the  Plimsouls, issued through the French New Rose label. Steven Soles (who also  produced the new Case LP) did a terrific job remixing the session, giving the  album the forceful presence of what sounds like a particularly good night for  the excellent band. Among the highlights are versions of the demi-hit "A  Million Miles Away" (with Case flubbing the words on one verse), plus outside  material including the Outsiders' "Time Won't Let Me" and the Kinks' "Come On  Now."  </P> <P> METALLURGY: A potential bidding war for the Lostboys came to a screeching halt  when Atlantic Records snatched up the band sight unseen recently. The group's  hard-rock sound contains a psychotic bent and fierce vocals, courtesy of Randy  O, former singer for the Sunset Strip band Odin (featured in the film "Decline  of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years").  </P> <P> The fact that Vicky Hamilton manages the band adds to its credibility. Her  association with platinum acts Poison, Stryper and Guns N' Roses is well known.  Oh, yes, Atlantic representatives finally saw the group and were pleased with  what they got. . . .  </P> <P> What has three guitarists, two bassists, a drummer, a couple of floor tom-tom  pounders and a singer who portrays "the Cow God" and "Satan's ham"? A group  called Green Jello, which made a rare appearance at the Coconut Teaszer  recently. Among the crowd-pleasing tunes were "Welcome to the Giant" -- a  supermarket send-up of Guns N' Roses' "Welcome to the Jungle" -- and a  rip-roaring version of "Free Bird." . . .  </P> <P> On a scarier note, there's Haunted Garage. This band is a rock 'n' roll version  of a campy horror flick, down to the severed body parts, blood and gore. The  songs have titles like "Incredible Two-Headed Transplant," and are punked-up,  cranked-out, three-minute descents into electrified insanity. This hard-working  band is earning its growing infamy with frequent gigs around town.  </P> <P> WHAT'S IN A NAME?: The group is Dread Zeppelin, and if you know your Rasta  lingo and your British rock, you can figure out what it does: As the band's  poster says, "Zeppelin Music, Reggae Style." If that's not enough, there's lead  singer Tortelvis -- an Elvis (rotund Vegas-era) impersonator -- and a lineup  with the names of Ja Paul Jo, Carl Ja, Cheese, Put-Mon and Ed Zeppelin. And  while the band likes to let on that it's from Memphis, it's actually based in  Pasadena.  </P> <P> After playing a few shows at the Cage in Pasadena and a couple of colleges,  Dread Zeppelin is making its Hollywood debut on Tuesday at Club Lingerie. The  Sierra Madre-based independent Birdcage Records is gearing up to record a  single of "Immigrant Song" and "Hey Hey What Can I Do," the only Zeppelin  B-side that wasn't an album cut.  </P> <P> BUZZWORDS: Heidi Rodewald and David Nolte, both formerly of Wednesday Week,  have started a new band called Viewmaster. Nolte, who was also a member of the  Last, says the new band sounds "a lot darker, with more of a hard edge" than  the band they left. Viewmaster -- which also includes former Zippers bassist  Danielle Faye -- will perform at Be Bop Records in Reseda on April 7. . . .  </P> <P> The Swamp Zombies are starting an "anti-mall" tour (take that, Tiffany) to  promote their new album "Fink." The band will perform on March 30 at Peer  Records in the Campus Shopping Center in Irvine, April 1 at Digital Ear at the  Lafayette Plaza in Tustin and April 2 at Moby Disc in Westminster. . . .  </P> <P> With the term world music used to death these days, Rotondi has come up with a  new word to describe its mix of polka and everything else: amalgapop.  </P> <P> Metallurgy was contributed by Janiss Garza.  </P> <P> </P></p>

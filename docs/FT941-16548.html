			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Japanese politician named in bribe case Japan's former trade minister, Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, a senior figure in the once-dominant Liberal Democratic party, is the latest politician linked to a bid-rigging and bribery scandal, according to the daily Asahi Shimbun newspaper, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Mr Kajiyama allegedly took Y10m (Pounds 60,000) from Mitsui Construction in exchange for helping it win a public works contract in his home region. Asahi, quoting government sources, said state prosecutors were tipped off about Mr Kajiyama's alleged involvement during their questioning of former regional governor Mr Fujio Takeuchi, who is on trial on charges of taking bribes from four big contractors. Mr Kajiyama's office allegedly contacted Mr Takeuchi, then governor of Ibaraki north of Tokyo, to urge him to select Mitsui as one of the contractors in a Y25bn government dam project in Ibaraki.</p>

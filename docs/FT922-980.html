			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Seoul 'making progress' in stabilising economy SEOUL is making progress in stabilising South Korea's overheated economy, the Bank of Korea, the country's central bank, said in its revised economic forecast for 1992 yesterday. The government has informally adopted a target of 'triple seven' economy this year: 7 per cent GNP growth rate, 7 per cent inflation, and a Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.7bn) current account deficit. The bank predicts the economy will grow 7.3 per cent against 8.4 per cent in 1991. Inflation will slow to 8 per cent from 9.3 per cent in 1991 due to lower economic growth and moderate wage increases. The current account deficit will shrink to Dollars 6.7bn from Dollars 8.7bn last year as the trade deficit narrows to Dollars 4.3bn due to improved export growth. Exports will rise 9 per cent, reflecting a recovery in Seoul's main overseas markets and the won's depreciation. Imports will grow 5.6 per cent as the economic slowdown curbs demand.</p>

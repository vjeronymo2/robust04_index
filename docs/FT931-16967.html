			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Letter From Moscow: Russia's 'loadsaroubles' At one of Russia's first private primary schools, children sing in English and receive miniature dollar bills as a reward for good behaviour. At the state kindergarten from which it leases its premises, teachers provide no-frills education for a fifth of the salary paid their 'capitalist' counterparts. As Russia has lurched towards a market economy over the past year, open inequality has begun replacing the hidden privileges of the old elite. Some of the trappings of capitalism - as depicted by Communist propaganda - have also been introduced. Half-naked women dance in cages at one of Moscow's new nightclubs, while old people impoverished by price liberalisation can be seen fishing through rubbish bins. The main beneficiaries of the reforms, which have made goods and services available to anybody who can afford them, are Russia's new rich. Their hallmarks are expensive foreign cars, frequent foreign travel and several garishly furnished homes. Thanks to legislation and a change in public attitudes towards private business, members of this exclusive club, who have made fortunes over the past few years trading everything from raw materials to consumer goods, are now in the public eye. Despite the advantages of wealth, the new rich say life remains tough. Mr Kakha Bendukidze, a roly-poly Georgian who runs everything from an oil investment fund to the largest private merchant fleet in the former Soviet Union, admits he is still embarrassed by his wealth - and loath to spend it on himself. 'When I spend one dollar on myself, it is just one dollar. When I invest it, it becomes two dollars,' says this former molecular biologist, sitting in a chaotic office graced only by a small bronze sculpture. Wearing a light-green cashmere sweater, beige trousers and Hush-Puppies, he resembles his wealthy peers in the west. Another member of Russia's new rich is Mr Pavel Dudnikov, a 'child of the street' who made his fortune from a sprawling network of slot machines and video games and now has the General Motors distributorship to sell Cadillacs across the country. He says he has not even had time to move his family out of a two-room apartment. 'All my life is work because of the circumstances we are doing everything in. There's no normal legislation, no normal infrastructure and no banks worthy of the name,' says this gold-toothed former worker as he toys with a lighter and puffs American cigarettes. He is delighted, however, by Russia's appetite for Cadillacs. He claims hundreds of cars, including a few Dollars 300,000 limousines of the variety which ferry around US presidents, have been sold since he started up Trinity Motors with a US partner last May. Other new rich, who also plead a taxing schedule, have less trouble spending their money. When his wife gave birth at an exclusive London hospital, Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, head of the Most (Bridge) Group which makes most of its money from Moscow real estate deals, booked airline tickets every weekend for five months so that he could visit her. Now he faces the dilemma of deciding whether or not to send his eldest son to school abroad, perhaps in England. While his favourite car is a BMW, he has a dozen cars to choose from, a flat in Chelsea, a house in Portugal, and a few homes scattered around Russia (like most Russian rich seeking to minimise their tax bill, all the property he has access to is registered as belonging to his company). The family doctor is in Harley Street. But what he fears most are 'hooligans': a team of 18 bodyguards takes turns protecting him and his family around the clock. A private security force of 450 men guards the building site and offices of his company, whose annual turnover he puts at Rbs100bn (Pounds 155m). Nobody knows how many rich there are in Russia or where the dividing line between crime and business lies. Mr Bendukidze breaks them into three categories: 'Bureaucrats who live off their jobs by taking bribes, entrepreneurs who live off their wits, and criminals who live off violence.' He has no doubts his own entrepreneurial category is the most worthwhile. 'I would not hire most directors of state-owned enterprises to wipe the floor,' he says. He says the only solution to the country's economic woes is the total privatisation of the state-owned economy to make room for new managers - in short 'the Georgian money-bags' so feared by the old-style 'bureaucrats' who run most Russian businesses. Although they felt insulted by the new prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, when he announced that Russia should have a market and not a bazaar, the new rich believe they are now strong enough to withstand any attempt to crush Russia's nascent capitalism. (In case of a state backlash, most have money in foreign bank accounts.) 'Being wealthy gives you the power to say no to bureaucrats,' says the 40-year-old Gusinsky, who graduated as a theatre director but whose only production has been a dazzling financial empire which, like most Russian businesses, is closed to the scrutiny of outsiders. Mr Konstantin Borovoi, who spearheaded the development of Russia's commodity exchanges, has set up his own Economic Freedom party to defend entrepreneurial interests. 'I don't get pleasure out of this party. I set it up because we need it,' says this former mathematician who, with typical extravagance, says he would shoot himself if the Communists returned to power. Others, like Gusinsky, prefer to influence events from behind the scenes. He suggested, for instance, that he would be providing cash to finance support for President Boris Yeltsin's April 11 referendum on a new constitution - including the crucial issue of private land ownership. But his greatest concern is the number of his colleagues who have no trust in the future. Many of them are taking their money and settling abroad. 'Every time a man who can make money leaves Russia, it is a tragedy for the country.'</p>

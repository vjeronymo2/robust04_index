			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Bunds encouraged by hopes of interest rate easing German government bonds were lifted by official remarks which accompanied the release of GDP data for the second quarter. The data showed a strong recovery in the German economy, in line with market expectations, but senior officials said there were no signs of over-heating. These comments led to cautious optimism in some quarters that the Bundesbank would ease official interest rates, or at least the repo rate, at its regular council meeting next Thursday. These hopes encouraged yields on 10-year bunds to come in to around 7.43 per cent from just over 7.5 per cent the day before. However, most analysts remained sceptical about a further cut in German interest rates. Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg, noted that yesterday's improved sentiment followed a week in which bund futures had dropped by two points. In addition, the safe distribution of the new Treuhand bond issue had eliminated market worries of an overhang of supply. 'There is no fundamental change to the market . . . there is not really room for further easing,' said Mr Kokko. Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International, said signs that the economy's recovery favoured investment spending over consumer spending, which was still fragile, could lend support to the view that rates could fall further. However, there were still doubts on the inflation front. 'The market's rise is a short-term reaction; the trend is still for a further sell-off,' she said. Mr Andrew Bevan, the newly-appointed international bond economist at Goldman Sachs, said the GDP data made it even more likely the Bundesbank would have to rein in monetary growth early next year. 'It is going to have to take a fairly tight stance on rates which has not been fully discounted by the market,' he said. On Liffe, the December bund future stood 0.51 points higher at 89.67 in the late afternoon, off the day's high of 89.74. Gilts hit a more cheerful note, buoyed by the rise in bunds and the release of the CBI distributive trade survey, which pointed to a slowdown in consumer spending. This was taken as further evidence that pressure for a rise in UK interest rates was easing. Mr Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB, said: 'The survey suggests that the tax rises are hitting the consumer who is becoming more cautious. With the housing market so fragile, a rate rise would undermine confidence even more.' Mr Simon Briscoe, of SG Warburg, said if the CBI data were indicative of other economic figures due in coming months, there would be little pressure for a rate rise. However, Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers said other parts of the economy were picking up more strongly than the CBI data suggested. The yield spread between gilts and bunds narrowed to 130 basis points from 137 on Wednesday. On Liffe, the December long gilt future rose to 100 31/32 in late trading, up  3/4 points on the day. Italian and Spanish bonds were pulled up by the Europe-wide rise in bond prices. The yield on the 10-year Italian benchmark bond fell to 12.11 per cent from 12.26. However, Mr Huw Roberts at NatWest Markets warned that the market would fall back if the government continued to prevaricate over the budget deficit. The Spanish benchmark 10-year bond yield fell to 11.22 per cent from 11.38 per cent. US Treasury bonds were finishing close to their opening values yesterday afternoon as traders adjusted their positions ahead of today's inflation data. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was off 1/32 at 99 5/32 , with the yield rising to 7.565 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 3/32 , to yield 6.181 per cent. Traders plodded through another sluggish session, with many of them waiting for the release of August's producer price index before stepping back in to the market. Today's report was expected to show an upturn in inflationary pressures. Analysts were forecasting a 0.5 per cent gain in last month's PPI, and a 0.3 per cent rise when the volatile food and energy sectors were excluded. However, there was a growing minority in the market which felt such estimates were excessive, leading some traders to begin covering their bets that bond prices would decline on the data's release. Even those who were comfortable with the consensus forecasts did not expect bonds to tumble on a big jump in producer prices. Most economists thought the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates again before November, even if today's inflation reading was strong. Such confidence allowed bond prices to appreciate amid the morning's light trading conditions. The market gained an extra push from a moderating trend in commodity prices and a firmer dollar.</p>

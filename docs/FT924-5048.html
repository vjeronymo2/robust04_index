			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stockholm bourse resumes post-devaluation rally BOURSES traded quietly after an eventful week during which renewed currency tension monopolised investors' attention, writes Our Markets Staff. STOCKHOLM resumed its post-devaluation rally after Thursday's pause. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 22.7 or 2.6 per cent to 885.2, up 7.8 per cent on the week, in turnover of SKr811m, down from SKr1.12bn. Trading concentrated on blue chips and Ericsson B shares added SKr5 to SKr177 in volume of SKr122m. With the exception of bank shares, all sectors posted advances. A sharp jump was registered for the real estate and construction sector, up 14.2 per cent on speculation that lower interest rates will bring about a recovery in property prices. The banking sector dropped 5.5 per cent, after its 30 per cent surge over the previous two trading sessions. Handelsbanken B fell SKr1 to SKr33.5 while S-E-Banken C eased SKr2 to SKr15. PARIS continued to speculate about the future of the franc, and the CAC-40 index ended 10.11 higher at 1,749.79, up 1.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was a paltry FFr1.5bn. The most significant faller of the day was Michelin which dropped FFr6.8 or 3.7 per cent to FFr178.70 on news that the tyre manufacturer had introduced short-time working, including extended Christmas shutdowns, at a number of its European factories. The television stock, Canal Plus, fell FFr23 to FFr1,045 after Carolco Pictures, in which it has a 12 per cent stake, said again that it was unable to pay its debts. Risers included Rhone Poulenc CIs, up FFr6 to FFr514 following its meeting with analysts in London and Lafarge, FFr6.70 higher at FFr312.50. MILAN ended mixed in thin trading and the Comit index eased just 0.05 to 442.58, down 3.6 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at not more than Thursday's L170.5bn. The agro-industrial and food group, Montedison, made early gains after Thursday's announcement of management changes in the company and at its parent group, Ferruzzi Finanziaria. The stock added L49 or 4.3 per cent to L1,200 at the fixing but eased back later. Other stocks which had been bid up for speculative reasons fell back as the retailer, Rinascente, dropped L381 or 5.2 per cent to L6,900. But the state-controlled food group, Sme, rose L25 to L5,645. FRANKFURT closed a grey week, featuring moderately depressing inflation reports, worrying Volkswagen results and disappointment with interest rate prospects. The DAX index ended at 1,522.93, down 0.23 on the day and 1.4 per cent lower over the last five. Turnover fell from DM6.1bn to DM3.8bn. VW fell again, by DM3.70 to DM267, as other carmakers recovered. Retailers were also inclined mostly to move back up again but dealers said that they did not believe this to be a pre-Christmas rally. The retail sector - with Hornbach, in do-it-yourself, as the exception  - is rated underweight in a James Capel review which underweights the Frankfurt market as a whole; and it is underperforming. The DM5 rise to DM430 in Douglas left the luxury-oriented specialist down 5.5 per cent on the week and, in department stores, Karstadt fell another DM3.80 to DM500.20 for a 4 per cent drop over five days. OSLO fell in thin trading as speculation about a devaluation of the crown receded. The all-share index ended 3.61 lower at 353.74, down 0.7 per cent on the week, in turnover worth NKr172m. BRUSSELS closed lower and Solvay was one of the main victims, falling SKr175 to SKr11,050. The Bel-20 index lost 4.07 to 1,125.56, down 1.5 per cent on the week. AMSTERDAM saw the recovery in chemical stocks continue as Akzo picked up Fl 1 to Fl 131 and DSM added 60 cents to Fl 72.80. But the troubled shipping company, Nedlloyd, shed another 90 cents to Fl 29.40 following Thursday's news of a net loss this year. The CBS Tendency index closed unchanged at 103.2, down 0.2 per cent on the week. MADRID's reawakening on Thursday proved short-lived, and block trades provided most of yesterday's Pta13.23bn turnover as the general index finished 0.52 higher at 215.29, 1.2 per cent up on the week. Utilities saw support on hopes that they would maintain their dividends, Sevillana closing Pta18 or 4.4 per cent higher at Pta426 and Union Fenosa, the day's most active stock adding Pta12 to Pta401 in 1.75m shares. ISTANBUL rose 2.4 per cent for a two-day gain of 5.2 per cent on the prospect of a tax decree favouring equity investment. The 75-share index closed 88.27 higher at 3,843.06.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- November 27                                       THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1049.18    1047.06    1046.27    1045.87 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1119.53    1118.06    1117.84    1116.84  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Nov 26     Nov 25     Nov 24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100              1048.05    1042.55    1038.83 FT-SE Eurotrack 200              1118.56    1111.41    1110.69  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1046.25    1047.51    1048.72    1049.92 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1118.96    1119.00    1121.05    1122.37  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Nov 23                Nov 20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100              1038.38               1051.29 FT-SE Eurotrack 200              1110.18               1117.40  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1050.18 ; 200 -  1122.44 Low/day: 100 -  1045.23  200 -  1116.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the preceding analyses, Duke Power Company concludes that the requested amendments do not involve a significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed technical specification amendment has been reviewed against the criteria of 10 CFR 51.22 for environmental considerations. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration, nor increase the types and amounts of effluents that may be released offsite, nor increase individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposures. Therefore, the proposed amendment meets the criteria given in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9) for a categorical exclusion from the requirement for an Environmental Impact Statement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Atkins Library, University of North Carolina, Charolotte (UNCC Station), North Carolina 28223. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422 South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC Project Director:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Herbert N.

The proposed modification would require a leak test at least once per 18 months provided the valves remain closed during that period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The proposed change does not involve a change in plant design. Failure of or leakage through a containment barrier cannot itself create an accident; therefore, this change would not increase the probability of any accident previously evaluated. Failure of or leakage through a containment barrier can, however, increase the consequences of those accidents previously evaluated. The proposed change merely revises the frequency at which the local leak rate test is performed on the containment building HVAC 36-inch supply and exhaust penetrations. The containment isolation valves for these penetrations are normally only opened during refueling outages. The stroke testing for the isolation valves has been changed to a cold shutdown frequency and, as a result, there is no mechanism present to degrade the seals and cause increased leakage through the penetration. Based on past penetration leak rate measurements, it has been determined that leak rate testing on an 18-month frequency is sufficient to identify seal degradation if the valves are not opened. However, should the valves be opened during the 18-month interval, the proposed change would require that a leak rate test be performed within 92 days. This will ensure that the leak rate for the given penetration has not exceeded the specified limit as a result of stroking the valve. Penetration leakage will continue to be measured at sufficient intervals to identify seal degradation in the 36-inch containment isolation valves. In addition, the same leakage limits will be imposed. Therefore, the proposed change will not result in a significant increase in the probability or the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) This request does not result in any change to the plant design nor does it involve a change in current plant operation. The proposed change will not change the design basis for the valves being leak tested. The valves will continue to be verified to meet the required leak rate and the safety function of the subject valves remains unchanged. Furthermore, any potential leakage through the containment building HVAC 36-inch supply exhaust and supply penetrations cannot create an accident. As a result, the proposed change cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The only margin of safety that could potentially be impacted by the proposed change to the surveillance requirement frequency is the margin concerning the offsite dose consequences of postulated accidents (which is directly related to the containment leak rate). As discussed above, this request does not result in a significant increase in the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. It has been demonstrated that the penetration leakage does not change appreciably when the valves are not stroked. Therefore, since the valves are normally only opened during refueling outages, leakage through the penetrations is not expected to change during the proposed 18-month interval between leak rate tests. Should the valves be opened during the 18-month interval, a local leak rate test will be performed within 92 days. The proposed leak rate test frequency will provide sufficient indication of seal degradation to allow the opportunity for repair before gross leakage failures develop. In addition, the proposed change involves no change to the currently established leak rate test acceptance criteria. As a result, the proposed changes do not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

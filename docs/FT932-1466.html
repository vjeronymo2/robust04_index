			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: C and W peak The market demonstrated approval of much better than expected results from Cable and Wireless, accompanied by a proposed one-for-one scrip issue, by marking the shares up to an all-time high of 780p. The stock eased marginally late in the session, finishing a net 23 higher at 777p. Turnover was a hefty 3.2m shares. Marketmakers said C and W had benefited from sustained switching into the shares from BT, which held at 432p. C and W's pre-tax profits came in at Pounds 824m, well above the most optimistic analysts' estimates, which were around the Pounds 800m mark. The 12 per cent increase in the dividend was in line with expectations. The results, plus some encouraging remarks by the company at the post-figures meeting with institutions and analysts, led to a series of profits upgrades by telecoms specialists. Current-year forecasts were being shifted above the Pounds 1bn mark. Mr Jim Ross, telecoms analyst at Hoare Govett, said he was looking for profits of Pounds 1.05bn in the current year and pinpointed two significantly favourable points in the results. He highlighted excellent cash flow numbers and noted evidence of the economic upturn in the UK in Mercury's sharply improved performance. 'The level of new line orders at Mercury is twice that of a year ago,' he said. Royal Insurance came in for strong support in a generally firm composite insurance sector, with Robert Fleming Securities and Credit Lyonnais Laing said to have been keen supporters of the shares, which closed 6 up at 295p. Bank of Scotland extended its recent good showing, the shares settling 4 1/2 higher at 153 1/2 p on above-average turnover of 5.5m. Shares in Spring Ram, the troubled building materials group, came under sustained pressure, sliding 8 to 61p. Talk of a broker's recommendation to switch out of RMC and into Redland saw the latter move up 11 to 456p and the former retreat 11 to 750p. After the fillip of last week's presentations from Guinness and LVMH - the French luxury goods company with whom Guinness has a cross-shareholding - the brewer saw some investors waving goodbye and the shares shed 7 to 478p. This time it was Grand Metropolitan's turn to woo the analysts with upbeat talk which saw the company bullish on its expectations for a growing role in the world vodka market. It also boasted of its performance with Burger King. But heads were not turned completely and GrandMet lost a penny to 425p. Allied-Lyons added 2 at 541p in a volume of 2m after Hoare Govett issued a buy note. A batch of shares traded below quote price helped to push down the level of Campari by 18 to a close of 315p. The sporting clothes company, which recently surprised the market with two profits warnings in as many months, suffered from buyers 'anxious to exit the stock', said one analyst. The confidence of investors and the City had been knocked by the warnings. They fear that after two, a third could be on the way, added the analyst. Another analyst said the brewery sector was held back by a general lack of enthusiasm and absence of international opportunity as Europe grapples with a deepening recesssion. Scottish &amp; Newcastle lost 3 at 462p and Whitbread 'A' a penny at 497p. Allied Textiles had better fortune, moving forward 10 to close at 485p in an otherwise quiet sector. Reuters climbed a further 36 to 1383p after news of the success of its Dealing 2002 forex dealing system. Telerate is the sales and marketing agent for the Minex dealing system, controlled by a consortium of Japanese banks, and has no connection with the EBS system as incorrectly reported here yesterday. A weak day in the stores sector saw Boots decline 3 to 439p, GUS 'A' shed 12 to 1717p and Marks and Spencer lose 2 to 338p. Kingfisher bucked the trend to gain 5 at 600p after its announced acquisition of the Unipart chain. But the store and retail sector was generally subdued as hopes for an early cut in UK base rates were returned to the back burner following a somewhat cool comment on interest rate prospects from a senior executive of the Bundesbank. With rumours of a bid for United Biscuits losing steam, the share price fell back 5 1/2 to 402 1/2 p in moderate volume. While United gave ground, Cadbury-Schweppes, long tipped as the possible bidder, moved up 6 to 458p. Budgens, the grocery chain, was one of the foods sector's star performers, with speculation of a bid from REWE, Germany's largest grocery retailer and holder of a 26 per cent stake in the UK company, taking up the price 4 to 45p. J. Sainsbury managed an increase of 4 to 489p while seeing active trading on traded options with the equivalent of 2.6m shares dealt. Profit-takers moved in on Ratners Group, which had rallied on Friday on talk of banking negotiations. With rumours of an announcement by the indebted company on fresh banking facilities still prevalent, the shares slipped 3 1/2 to 32 1/2 p with 6m traded. A move into the bingo leisure business by way of the Pounds 19.9m acquisition of Nudge Leisure, and a 4.6 per cent rise in first-half profits, sent the share price of First Leisure up 9 in early trading before it fell back to end a penny off on the day at 364p. Thorn EMI, recently buoyed by its decision to sell its lighting division, receded 2 to 918p. Dunhill Holdings soared 62 to a 405p close, albeit in thin trading volume, although the stock is not usually heavily traded.</p>

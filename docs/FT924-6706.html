			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Thailand urges UN caution on Khmer Rouge THAILAND yesterday urged members of the United Nations Security Council, which is considering sanctions against the Khmer Rouge for violating the Cambodian peace accord, not to come to 'hasty conclusions' or issue a resolution that might be impossible to enforce. 'I hope that such a resolution will be implementable, not one which is aimed only at threatening without being practical,' Mr Prasong Soonsiri, the Thai foreign minister, told the Financial Times. 'Thailand shares the international community's disappointment at the Khmer Rouge's intransigence on co-operating in the peace process,' he said. But he added: 'Every effort should be made and all the remaining time should be spent in finding a way to bring the Khmer Rouge back into the peace process . . . If the Khmer Rouge is allowed to remain outside the process then the conflicts and disputes remain and may even intensify.' Thailand, whose businessmen buy gems and timber from Khmer Rouge strongholds across the border, has repeatedly emphasised that it will abide by United Nations resolutions on Cambodia. However, the Thai government has also made clear that it is reluctant to impose economic sanctions and has said that any UN resolution should be compatible with Thai law. 'If the resolutions require the seizure of assets of the Khmer Rouge outside Cambodia this will affect our own domestic banking laws,' Mr Prasong said. 'Our domestic laws prohibit the seizure of assets even of Thai nationals in matters where the government only has suspicions that irregularities might have been committed.' Mr Prasong also suggested that other governments were over-emphasising the importance of the Cambodian elections scheduled for May next year as a solution to the civil war. 'We do not wish to see elections held and then all the parties concerned pack their bags and go home thinking that peace has been achieved in Cambodia, leaving the residual problems for our country to contend with,' he said. 'This would only lead to a return to square one.' The head of the UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia yesterday promised new measures to stem growing political violence in the lead up to next May's elections, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. Several people have been killed and at least 11 injured in a recent spate of shootings and grenade attacks against opposition party offices and officials. 'Free and fair elections cannot be held in circumstances where people face threats to their lives, liberty and security for attempting to exercise their political rights,' said Mr Yasushi Akashi, the Japanese head of the UN transitional authority.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Semih D. Idiz] </F>   [Text] Ankara -- The Popular [People's] Front of Azerbaijan  is seeking help from Turkey. It claims that there is a  systematic campaign of repression against it in the Autonomous  Azeri Republic of Nakhichevan by the government in Baku, the  capital of Azerbaijan.    Asaf Guliyev, the leader of the Popular front in  Nakhichevan,  a tiny republic of 300,000 people bordering Turkey and Iran,  told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN] that hundreds of their members  and supporters had been arrested, their offices ransacked and  their papers banned.    Guliyev also indicated that the Nakhichevan Parliament still  could not elect a speaker because its former speaker, Geydar  Aliyev, who went on to become Azerbaijan's president, had not  resigned.    "This is aggravating an already unstable situation in  Nakhichevan and leading to further political instability which  is making it easier for Russia and Iran to interfere in our  domestic affairs," Guliyev said.    He claimed that the reason why the office of parliamentary  speaker was not being vacated was because President Aliyev was  worried that the Popular Front, or other opponents of the  government, may occupy this position. "Any government that has  signed the Charter of Paris and claims to subscribe to it should  not be doing such things," Guliyev said referring to the  government in Baku.    He was referring to the charter regarding human rights that  was adopted by members of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Azerbaijan is a full member of  the organization and as such has undertaken to comply with the  standards set in the Charter of Paris of 1989.    Contacted by the TDN on the Popular Front claims,  Azerbaijan's ambassador to Ankara, Mamed Aliyev Novruz Ogly,  denied that there were any political prisoners either in  Azerbaijan or in Nakhichevan.    "There are over 50 parties in Azerbaijan today and some of  the most outspoken opponents of President Aliyev's are free to  express their views," Nevruz Ogly said.    "If there are any arrests, these are only associated with  non- political crimes such as murder and fraud or with attempts  at dividing the country, as in the case of the arrest of Alikram  Gumbatov, who tried to set up an Islamic republic in  Azerbaijan's Lenkoran region near Iran," Novruz Ogly added.  Indicating that President Aliyev would be arriving in Ankara  for an official visit on Feb. 8, Guliyev said this would provide  a good opportunity for the Turkish government to bring these  issues up with him.    Guliyev pointed out that Aliyev would be addressing the  Turkish Parliament as a guest of honor, only the second foreign  leader to do so -- the first was Turkish Cypriot President Rauf  Denktas. He added that they would be lobbying Turkish deputies  also on the subject of Baku's repressive measures.    Aliyev came to power last year after democratically elected  President Abulfaz Elchibey -- who was also the leader of the  Popular Front -- was ousted following a military rebellion in  June 1993.    Aliyev, who had moved to become speaker of the Azeri  Parliament during the rebellion, assumed presidential powers  when Elchibey fled Baku as rebels seeking his resignation  threatened to storm the city.    Although Turkey continued to support Elchibey, it shifted  its  support to Aliyev after he legitimized himself through a  referendum that confirmed Elchibey's ouster, and elections which  endorsed his presidency.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Lunch Hour Break" program] </F>   [Text] It seems that residents of Bolshoy Kamen will be  able to heave a sigh of relief -- the Pacific Fleet intends to  transfer the run-down TNT-5 tanker containing liquid radioactive  waste to a less populated location, possibly Pavlovsk bay, where  a whole complex of measures to prolong the tanker's life will  begin. However, it is possible that a different place will be  chosen, where the dilapidated vessel will await completion of  the construction of purification facilities, which may also take  quite a long time.</p>

Israeli heavy  artillery shelled Qabrikha, Wadi al-Saluqi, and the perimeters  of the Tallusah position. This was accompanied by raking with  machine guns. Earlier, the outskirts of al-Nabatiyah al-Fawqa  and Kafr Tibnit came under artillery fire and raking with  machine-gun fire. The area around Majdal Silm and Shaqra also  came under artillery fire. Israeli helicopter gunships also  strafed those areas.    The Amal Movement has announced that one of its groups has  attacked the Israeli position on Tallusah hill, using automatic  weapons and mortars. A 15-minute clash ensued with the  position's guards, during which the resistance fighters scored  direct hits and destroyed the observation tower.</p>

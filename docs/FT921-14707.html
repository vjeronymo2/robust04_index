			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Klepsch wins easy victory for presidency: European Parliament MR EGON KLEPSCH yesterday won a relatively easy victory over three rivals to become the new president of the European Parliament. The 1989 deal between the Christian Democrats and the Socialists - the two biggest battalions at Strasbourg - to split the presidency over the five-year life of the current parliament ensured victory for Mr Klepsch, the German leader of Christian Democrat MEPs. He won 253 votes out of 474 cast, and is succeeded as CD leader by Mr Leo Tindemans, a former Belgian prime minister. Mr Klepsch follows Mr Enrique Baron, a Spanish Socialist, in a job that has a powerful influence on the internal organisation - or disorganisation - of the Community's legislature and on its negotiations with the Brussels Commission and the Council of Ministers. Having a German presiding over the European parliament should give Chancellor Helmut Kohl extra ammunition against his domestic critics who complain that he did not win enough political concessions at last month's Maastricht summit to justify surrendering the D-mark into a European monetary union. A strong belief in consensus politics has helped push Mr Klepsch to the top of the greasy pole in Strasbourg over nearly 20 years as an MEP. But many of the UK Labour MEPs, the largest national contingent in the Socialist group, balked at what they saw as a Faustian compact with the Christian Democrats. Ironically, the price the CDs have paid for the presidency has been to turn over to the Socialists the chairmanship of most of the important committees. Close co-operation between the CDs and Socialists, who together pool 3,083 votes in the 518-member parliament, is made more necessary by the Maastricht requirement that the parliament muster an absolute majority - 260 votes - to exercise its new law-making powers. But the two big groups have taken their co-operation a stage further by supporting rule changes that would prevent smaller political groupings from cluttering up Strasbourg plenary sessions with myriad amendments. Mr Klepsch strongly backs this efficiency drive. But for someone considered a procedural expert, he has been rather cavalier about rules himself. On more than one occasion he has been caught pushing voting buttons for an absent group colleague as well as for himself. Only last week he said he had seen nothing wrong with this: it had been common in legislatures like the French National Assembly. The verb to 'klepsch' has now entered the Strasbourg vocabulary to describe such sleight of hand.</p>

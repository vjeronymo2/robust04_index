			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Bold strike on interest rates well received  -New York Wall Street is looking forward to a week of quiet reflection, a welcome break from three months of anxious anticipation about rising interest rates. It is ironic, perhaps, but equity investors, inherently concerned about tighter money, found reassurance in the Federal Reserve's aggressiveness last week. On Tuesday, the central bank decided to increase two key short-term rates by 50 basis points each. Gradualism, it seems, was not to the liking of a market which hates surprises. Instead of fostering a measure of predictability, the central bank's three previous increases in its Fed Funds target - at 25 basis points each - served to heighten concern about when the next move was coming. Last week's bold strike - accompanied by a statement suggesting the Fed had achieved its goal of moving to a policy which would neither encourage nor discourage growth - gives stocks some breathing room. Most analysts expect share prices to hold fairly steady in the next few trading sessions, as the market digests a net gain of 107 points in the Dow industrials on the week. 'The market is going to move sideways - without much direction - while waiting to assess the situation,' says Peter Cardillo, head of research at Westfalia Investments in New York. How stocks will perform after their pause is more controversial, however. Mr Cardillo sees the market waiting until next week's employment data before staging any push upward. But it is likely that the evidence will continue to point to low inflation, he says, supporting bond prices and 'setting the stage for a strong summer rally that will take stocks to new highs'. While William Raftery, technical analyst at Smith Barney Shearson in New York, agrees that share prices will finish this week with little change, he is decidedly more bearish about the intermediate outlook. 'Last week was a brief rally. Just as in a bull market there are pull-backs, in bear markets there are corrective cycles,' he says. 'They look nice for a week, but then they trip you up.' Citing underlying technical conditions and historical trends, he argues that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is heading below the 3,400 level by late summer. Mr Gregory Nie at Kemper Securities in Chicago, takes a more positive view but remains circumspect about a sustained upturn. Although the strong suggestion by the Fed that it had reached a neutral policy has coaxed many investors out of their foxholes, Mr Nie says there is still some danger of further rate rises in the near term. The continuing rise in commodity prices and the persistent weakness of the dollar could force yet another move to tighter money, despite expectations to the contrary. He discounts the chances of stocks breaking out of their trading range on technical grounds. He says the market has moved into an 'overbought' condition and cash reserves remain low.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLSON, WATERGATE CONSPIRATOR, TO VISIT PRISON MINISTRY PROJECT  </P> <P> Charles W. Colson, the Watergate conspirator who founded a prison ministry,  will visit Brea on Monday to tour a home that prisoners are refurbishing as  part of a rehabilitation program.  </P> <P> Colson, a special counsel to former President Richard M. Nixon who was known as  his hatchet man, served seven months in prison for obstruction of justice.  </P> <P> He became a born-again Christian and has since convinced even former skeptics  of his sincerity.  </P> <P> His visit to Orange County coincides with weeklong festivities leading up to  Friday's opening of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> Colson will be visiting a home on East Fir Street that is being cleaned and  refurbished by 10 inmates on furlough from Boron Federal Prison Camp and Lompoc  Federal Prison.  </P> <P> The program is sponsored by Prison Fellowship Ministries' Community Service  Project, which Colson launched in 1982. It aims to help inmates restore their  self-respect and repay society by working on projects that aid the needy.  </P> <P> The East Fir Street house belongs to a couple in their 80s. The husband is  living in a convalescent hospital until the house is remodeled.  </P></p>

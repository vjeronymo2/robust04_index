			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: JCI gold division lifts after-tax profit to R70.9m IMPROVED performances from Randfontein and Western Areas helped the gold division of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI) lift after-tax profits by 19 per cent to R70.9m (Dollars 25.9m) in the June quarter. Profits at Randfontein rose to R55.7m from R50.3m. At Western Areas profits increased steeply to R9.4m from R1.9m. Mr Bill Nairn, managing director of the gold division, said Randfontein's grade, which improved to 3.67 grams a tonne (from 3.6 grams), was at its highest level since 1987. But a 5.8 per cent decline in ore mined from underground saw total production fall to 7,817kg from 8,014kg. At the net level, the gold division's results were boosted by a R13m drop in the tax bill, associated with an increase in capital expenditure. Western Areas had an excellent quarter for production, lifting its grade by 15.4 per cent to 5.99 grams a tonne, thanks to concentration on quality ore and improved productivity. This helped convert a R5.4m working loss on gold production last quarter into a R700,000 profit.</p>

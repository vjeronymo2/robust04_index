			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Itar-Tass correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 February -- It is politicians, not the  military, who should decide the fate of the 14th Army deployed  in the Dniester Region. We are ready to withdraw it as soon as  tomorrow. This is the opinion of Russian Deputy Defense  Minister Georgiy Kondratyev.    He flies to Tiraspol today. In a conversation with an  ITAR-TASS correspondent on the eve of his trip, the military  commander said work in "hot spots" was his official  responsibility. "I should see for myself how our soldier fulfils  his duties and what he needs".    General Kondratyev plans to visit Russian units of the 27th  division of the Volga military district who, together with  Dniester Region and Moldovan servicemen, are performing  peacemaking functions in the region.    According to the deputy defense minister, his trip to the  Dniester Region is a routine one and is not connected with any  special events in the troops. However, Georgiy Kondratyev said,  there is bound to be a conversation with Lieutenant-General  Lebed, commander of the 14th Army, about his "recent comments".  The two generals will also exchange opinions of the situation  in the region.</p>

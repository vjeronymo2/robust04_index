			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 23 Apr (MENA)--A prominent Palestinian source  from Fatah, the biggest faction within the PLO, has stated that  the agreement announced yesterday between Fatah and Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] is a "political agreement" that  seeks to work out a specific formula for Hamas to participate in  institutions of the future Palestinian national authority. The  source described it as "more than just an agreement on  cease-fire and bilateral differences."    The source, who took part in the recent round of  negotiations  with Hamas leaders in Gaza, added that Hamas had submitted  proposals for participation in the Palestinian national  institutions, including the Palestinian police. He pointed out  that Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat welcomed Hamas' offer  and willingness to join the national authority, despite its  earlier opposition to the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles. He noted that 'Arafat had accepted in principle the  proposals made by Hamas in Gaza. The proposals were also  approved by Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the movement's [not further  specified] political bureau.    The source stressed that 'Arafat will soon meet Hamas  leaders  in an Arab capital, probably Amman, to work out a final  agreement on Hamas' participation in the Palestinian national  authority. 'Arafat, the source added, is convinced that Hamas'  new position represents a practical stand on the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. It shows Hamas'  desire not to be isolated from the future Palestinian national  authority's institutions, particularly since other Palestinian  factions, such as the George Habash-led Palestinian Front for  the Liberation of Palestine, have expressed a desire to join  them.    The same source said that during in its meeting in Tunis  under 'Arafat yesterday, Fatah's Central Committee endorsed the  agreement with Hamas.</p>

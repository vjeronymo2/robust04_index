			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (8): Casualty of war and peace - Aerospace and Defence THE aerospace industry is bracing itself for another unstable and grim year as it continues to adapt itself to the irrevocable decline in government defence spending and the recession in civil aviation. Restructuring is expected to lead to more job cuts in the defence sector as manufacturers grapple with the uncertainty of future defence programmes at the same time as they reduce capacity in the face of defence cuts. In the US alone, more than 100,000 people were laid off last year and the industry expects a further 36,000 to go this year. In Europe, the leading defence contractors are all in the throes of restructuring programmes which are likely to be affected by a series of important government decisions this year on the future of several new programmes ranging from the European Fighter Aircraft, the French Rafale fighter and the Swedish Gripen jet, to short range air-to-air missiles and military helicopters. With shrinking national defence markets, aerospace companies have had to place increasing emphasis on defence export sales as well as on civil aviation. But while the civil airliner market is expected to continue expanding in the longer term, it is still under pressure as it attempts to recover from the post Gulf war slump in air travel. The leading commercial aircraft manufacturers have all seen new orders drop sharply. Boeing, the world's biggest commercial aircraft maker, booked 252 aircraft valued at Dollars 20.26bn last year compared with a record 543 new aircraft orders valued at Dollars 47.69bn in 1990. Airbus, the European aircraft consortium, booked 101 new aircraft orders worth Dollars 9.4bn last year compared with 404 aircraft orders in 1990. The financial crisis of many airline customers forced the manufacturers to adjust some of their existing orders and aircraft deliveries. New aircraft orders are also expected to remain under pressure this year because many airlines are unlikely to commit themselves in new fleet renewal and acquisitions until confident of a sustained recovery in air travel. Aircraft engine makers and aerospace components suppliers have also had to adapt to the recession in civil aviation and defence spending cuts. But like the airframe manufacturers, they remain confident that the commercial side of the business will probably start recovering by the end of this year, although not to the record levels of the late 1980s. The industry expects to see a significant shift towards airlines buying large widebody aircraft rather than smaller narrow body jets during the next 10 years. Indeed, the market for widebodies and heavy thrust engines to power this new generation of big airliners has become the focus of competition between the leading airframe and engine makers. All three aircraft manufacturers - Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas - are developing widebody rivals to position themselves in this growing market. Boeing recently launched its new 777 twin engine widebody to compete against the new Airbus A330/A340 large aircraft and the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 three engine jet. Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus are also canvassing airlines over the possibility of building later this decade a new breed of jumbo aircraft. McDonnell Douglas is negotiating a landmark agreement with Taiwan Aerospace to develop its new MD12 high capacity three engine jet, while Boeing is discussing the possibility of developing a new 650 seat version of its successful Boeing 747 jumbo jet family. Airbus has already announced that it plans to challenge Boeing's dominance in the jumbo market by considering the development of a 600 seater airliner in cooperation, perhaps, with a new Asian partner. All the manufacturers are continuing to scramble to forge international alliances to improve their competitive position on the export market and spread the huge investment costs of developing new aircraft. This is particularly the case at the lower end of the commercial aircraft market where manufacturers are competing to develop new commuter and regional jet airliners. Efforts to consolidate the industry across traditional national borders are likely to intensify this year as part of the overall restructuring of both the military and commercial aerospace businesses. France's Aerospatiale and Germany's MBB launched at the beginning of this year their new Eurocopter company merging the two group's helicopter activities. Matra and GEC of the UK have linked their space operations in a new joint venture called Matra Marconi Space which is now seeking to attract other European partners. British Aerospace is actively looking for a new partner for its regional aircraft operations as part of its recovery programme launched last year after a top management crisis saw the resignation of its chairman, Professor Sir Roland Smith. But perhaps the most ambitious partnership under current negotiation is the decision of Taiwan to invest in a stake in McDonnell Douglas's commercial aircraft business.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris off 2.4%, CAC-40 breaches 2,000 Tuesday's intraday recovery was reversed as bourses faced weakness in bond and futures markets and, in the afternoon, early declines on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS could not hold above the 2,000 level in the CAC-40 and closed at its lowest point since the end of July 1993. The final kick downwards was triggered by Wall Street. But, once again, the real pressure on equities was imposed by the futures and bond markets as the CAC-40 index ended the session down 50.22, or 2.4 per cent, at 1,979.68, slightly above the day's low of 1,972. June futures finished at 1,951, with turnover in the equity market estimated at nearly FFr5bn. Analysts commented that the equity market was 'on the ropes', and that it was extremely difficult in the present climate to make an assessment of when it would be a good moment to return on the buy side. The very seasonal nature of the French market - the first quarter was traditionally seen as the period when stocks rose against the European average and summer a time of decline - was also advanced as a backdrop to the present situation. Among the fallers, UAP closed below its privatisation price, down 5.5 per cent at FFr143.80 while, against the trend, Eurotunnel put on 1 per cent at FFr32.95 as the group provided bullish estimates of traffic volume. FRANKFURT registered a new low in bund futures and fell away after an early, pre-bourse high of 2,146.62. The Dax index closed the session just 2.00 firmer at 2,129.70 and ended the post-bourse at 2,113.62. Turnover eased from DM6.7bn to DM6.4bn. Major blue chips seemed studiously inert, with big price changes confined to Lufthansa, up DM8 to DM195 in an extension of this year's speculative run, and to the engineering sector, where Deutsche Babcock moved ahead DM10 to DM247. At B Metzler, Ms Barbara Altmann said that investors were sitting on their hands; but, she added, there was beginning to be a case for selective buying with Bayer, for example, some 10 per cent off its high for the year at DM362.50 after hours, on a prospective 1995 p/e of 10.7. AMSTERDAM was buffeted by a combination of negative influences from outside the equity market. The Aex index, which at one point had fallen to a session low of 396.08, closed off 3.25 at 397.52. In spite of the overall gloom a few bright spots enlivened investors' interest. KLM, for instance, which reports its 1993/94 fourth quarter reults today, advanced 60 cents to Fl 51.90, bringing its rise on the year to date to 24 per cent. Analysts were looking for the airline to come in with a profit in the Fl 50m range. A broker's buy recommendation helped retailer Ahold to a rise of 30 cents to Fl 47.80, while ING, the financial services group, which also reports figures today, slipped 60 cents to Fl 75.30. The heavily weighted Royal Dutch also added some stability to the overall trend, the shares adding Fl 1.50 to Fl 196.30 and benefitting from a positive broker's note. ZURICH added buying of defensive stocks to the selling of cyclicals which marked Tuesday's trading, and the upshot was a rise against the general trend. The SMI index rose 8.9 to 2,731.5. Roche certificates rose SFr90 to SFr6,800, UBS by SFr17 to SFr1,212 in banks and, in insurers, Winterthur by SFr25 to SFr715. Among cyclicals, BBC Brown Boveri continued its downward career, SFr25 lower at SFr1,235, and Schindler accelerated with a fall of SFr350 to SFr8,200. MADRID followed the pricing of the Endesa and Santander issues with an above average drop in the general index, 5.62 or 1.7 per cent lower at 321.38. Turnover shot up from Pta25bn to Pta42bn. An interaction of futures, basket trading and the new issue closures was mooted as Endesa lost Pta150 at Pta6,400, and Santander Pta165 at Pta4,885. Elsewhere, Repsol and Telefonica fell Pta145 to Pta4,135 and Pta75 to Pta1,765 respectively. WARSAW fell sharply as profit-taking in second-tier stocks coincided with falls in major blue chips which had already been undermined by weak investor sentiment. The all-share Wig index declined 870.7 or 7.2 per cent to 11,166.0, while turnover dropped 36 per cent to 1,000bn zlotys and volume 46 per cent to 1.6m shares. ISTANBUL, in contrast, rose 5.2 per cent, helped by sustained buying of state companies. The composite index gained 774.36 to 15,523.46, recovering most of its losses since the start of the week.

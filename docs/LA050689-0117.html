			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL JAMBOREE;  </P> <P> ETHNIC DANCES, MUSIC PROMISE A LIVELY DAY AT THE 17TH ANNUAL FOLK FESTIVAL AT  UCLA  </P> <P> Travelers digging for their cultural roots in foreign countries this summer can  expect, among other tourist fare, various encounters with "real" ethnic folk  dancing and music.  </P> <P> Chances are -- TV and radio having done their homogenizing work -- the seekers  will be served a generous portion of canned choreography, squeaky-clean and  videotapeable.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, more fortunate stay-at-homes can enjoy the genuine article Sunday at  Music-and-Dance-on-the-Grass, the 17th annual international folk festival  sponsored by the Associates of Ethnic Arts at UCLA.  </P> <P> Bright costumes, elaborate headdresses, ancient folk instruments and fancy  footwork will hold sway from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Sunset Canyon Recreation  Center on the UCLA campus in Westwood. Admission is free.  </P> <P> Festival organizers expect about 6,000 visitors, many of whom have attended the  festival in years past. According to UCLA Coordinator Jorge Estrada, the first  50 spectators to walk through the gate will receive a free ethnic-music  recording from A&amp;M Records.  </P> <P> The rest may feel just as lucky: With the sun shining and spring breezes  blowing (in 16 years the festival has been rained out just once), the events  take place on three stages on the grass and in the recreation center, the wide  variety of ethnic music and dance reflecting Los Angeles' growing cultural  diversity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pursuit of Authenticity  </P> <P> Just what is "genuine" ethnic folk dancing? Answers vary, but it may be easier  to say what it's not. For starters, it's not dance performed solely to  entertain tourists; not traditional forms altered to suit modern tastes; not  dance offered mainly to promote a product.  </P> <P> In contrast, the performers at Music-and-Dance-on-the-Grass -- some UCLA study  groups composed of teachers and students and about 20 professional troupes --  are single-minded in their pursuit of authenticity.  </P> <P> The festival -- what Sophia Poster, president of Associates of Ethnic Arts,  calls "our gift to the community" -- is a worldwide panorama of traditional  dance and music painstakingly researched in the countries of origin, accurately  recorded on tape, film and paper, and, finally, lovingly performed by artists  who've made dance their lifework.  </P> <P> "These people are almost monomaniacal," KPFK announcer Mario Casetta said,  describing some of the troupes and their directors. Casetta, host of a  twice-weekly ethnic-music program airing Mondays and Wednesdays at 9:30 a.m.,  will be master of ceremonies in the amphitheater.  </P> <P> A day at the festival is "like having a cultural trip around the globe," he  explained. "You'll see dances that you'd be hard put to see two or three of in  an entire year," he said, "but to see them all in one day, and in one location,  is really mind-blowing.  </P> <P> "People should be encouraged to bring children," he added. "Children don't get  much of a chance to see beautiful things from other cultures and other  peoples."  </P> <P> Why does dance inspire such devotion, such "passion," as Sophia Poster calls  it? Anyone who's ever rocked at a disco or swayed to Glenn Miller knows the  answer. When all the scholarly words have been consigned to thick textbooks,  what's left is man's most basic expression of emotion -- and just plain fun.  </P> <P> "Dance is a primitive, hypnotic experience that arouses joy in people," said  Poster, 70, explaining that she devotes at least two nights a week to Balkan  dances -- a region including Yugoslavia, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.  Balkan circle dances are especially appealing because the dancers don't need a  partner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Sense of Communion'  </P> <P> "When you dance in a circle holding hands," she said, "there's a sense of  communion. Also, it's an informal dance structure, so you can step out and rest  for a while, then come back in and dance some more."  </P> <P> In fact, she said, "there are probably more people doing Balkan dancing in Los  Angeles than there are in the Balkans." The reason? Poster thinks many  countries are more interested in modernizing than in preserving traditional  culture. In Los Angeles, however, minority ethnic groups are eager to preserve  their heritage.  </P> <P> So you won't miss your favorite ethnic group, get a program at the information  desk, near the entrance where the shuttle bus leaves its passengers.  Information to the parking areas will be provided by staff manning the campus  kiosks, such as the one at the entrance to the campus on Sunset Boulevard.  </P> <P> Each group is scheduled to perform for 30 to 40 minutes in one of three  locations: the 1,000-seat outdoor amphitheater, the Buenos Ayres Room or the  Upper Meadow. Also in the Upper Meadow, half a dozen groups will lead  "participation" dances, encouraging onlookers to join in and teaching them the  steps.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, people flow freely from one area to another, stopping to buy and eat  ethnic food, dancing or watching, or just sitting on the grass.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mexico to Egypt  </P> <P> Scheduled for the amphitheater are 13 groups from such disparate cultures as  Mexico, Japan, the Middle East, Greece, Polynesia, India, Hungary, the Andes  Mountains region (Bolivia and Peru), China and Egypt.  </P> <P> Seven groups will perform in the Buenos Ayres Room (Associates board member  Carolyn Brent emceeing), including the Ebony Choraliers, traditional American  spiritual singers.  </P> <P> Ten groups are scheduled to dance on the grass in the Upper Meadow, introduced  by Maidie Taylor, a dancer and ethnomusicologist at UCLA. Persia, Kurdistan,  West Africa, Bali, Scotland, El Salvador and Nigeria are among regions  represented.  </P> <P> One of the most exciting professional troupes is Ote'a, a Polynesian troupe of  20 women and 10 men, both dancers and musicians. Jack Kinner, the troupe's  director, said his dancers, half of them of "island origin," will be performing  Tahitian dances at 2:15 p.m. in the amphitheater, wearing what Kinner says  "everyone calls grass skirts, but are actually made from the bark of the  hibiscus tree."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Courtship Story  </P> <P> "We're doing a fishing dance, also called an ote'a, where everyone moves in  unison to percussion instruments," he said -- in this case, wooden drums. "Also  an aparima set, which is danced to stringed accompaniment. It's a suite of  songs that tells a wonderful story about courtship, revelry and drinking."  </P> <P> Another unusual group is the Aisha Ali Dance Company, presenting Egyptian  dances. "Aisha Ali is unusual because her group doesn't do just belly dancing,"  Casetta said, "which is fairly common in the Middle East. She also teaches  tribal dances from different ethnic subgroups within Egypt" and has been to  that country many times to do research.  </P> <P> "She runs out into the desert to oases, to all sorts of little villages, and  she drags along equipment and records everything."  </P> <P> Casetta is hoping that Aisha Ali will perform a Gawazee Dance, which he thinks  is "really kitschy and fun. The Gawazee women are a group of women, almost like  a tribe, who travel up and down the Nile on pleasure boats entertaining people.  </P> <P> "You have to see their costumes to believe them -- they're not what you'd think  of in the Middle East. They look like something out of a 1930s revue: short  skirts, high heels and funny headdresses that look like already-folded turbans  with spangles and little glitter things. They use ancient steps, but it looks  like a vaudeville of the Nile."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fancy Footwork  </P> <P> Casetta also recommends looking for Balkan dances, which have some of the  fastest, fanciest footwork and often are set to unusual time signatures, like  nine-sixteenths. Some of the women's costumes from some Balkan countries are  sewn with gold coins, representing the women's dowries.  </P> <P> The information desk also is the place to buy scrip, which you'll need to pay  for ethnic foods being served by caterers and chefs from local restaurants. Now  is also the time to reserve a plate of what has become the festival's most  enduring tradition, Anthony Ivancich's Yugoslavian roast-lamb dinner.  </P> <P> Ivancich marinates a whole lamb the day before, filling the cavity with green  peppers, onions and garlic and rubbing the outside with more garlic, salt and  pepper. Then he embeds even more garlic slivers in the meat.  </P> <P> At the festival, he roasts the lamb slowly over coals for five hours on a spit  over his family's barbecue, which he says is traded between aunts and uncles  whenever a family gathering requires a similar traditional dinner.  </P> <P> There's only so much lamb, 50 pounds being the maximum weight before lamb  becomes mutton, so put your name on the list when you enter. Ivancich will  serve the lamb about 2 p.m., with potatoes and green salad. If lamb isn't your  favorite, however, there will be other ethnic food -- Greek, Indian, Japanese,  Mexican and Ethiopian.  </P> <P> Festival admission is free. Parking is $3 (there's almost no street parking) at  UCLA parking structures 3, 4 and 5. Free shuttle buses run to Sunset Canyon  Recreation Center.  </P></p>

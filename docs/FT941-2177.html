			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Ford near to Dollars 1bn sale of First Nationwide Ford Motor, the US car-maker, appears to be close to a sale of its unprofitable thrift, First Nationwide Financial Corporation, which has been on the auction block for the past four months. The car company is believed to have attracted two offers, each worth around Dollars 1bn. Market sources identified one of the bidders as Mr Gerald Ford, who heads a Texan thrift, Madison Financial, but has no ties to Ford Motor or to the former US president of the same name. The other is understood to have come from a partnership between Great Western Financial, a large Californian thrift, and Lehman Brothers, the investment bank which American Express is spinning off. Lehman would be involved solely to package and sell off First Nationwide's problem real estate loans. The sale of the San Francisco-based thrift would close an embarrassing chapter for Ford, which bought First Nationwide in 1985 for around Dollars 500m but has since invested more than Dollars 700m to offset real estate loan losses. First Nationwide has not been profitable since 1990.</p>

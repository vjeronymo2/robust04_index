			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Technology: Science sans sanctions - Matthew Curtin continues a series on collaborative research by looking at the effect of political change in South Africa on a state-owned research body After the African National Congress's victory in last week's historic election, South Africa's new government has plenty on its hands. Preserving and redirecting science and technology resources may not be high on its priority list just now, but in the longer term, this will be vital in regenerating the economy and raising living standards for the black population. The task is huge because policy in this area - no other African country south of the Sahara has such large science and technology resources - was biased for so long in favour of a white minority government. This recruited the private sector in its costly nuclear bomb-building programme and to match Soviet military hardware for the wars in Angola and Mozambique. These efforts, added to dubious research with a racial bias aimed at underpinning segregationist policy and strategic projects such as the development of synthetic fuel technology, had limited success. As political change drew near, a forum of government, business, trade union and community groups made progress in devising a new science and technology initiative. A central role was played by the state-owned Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The CSIR reorganised itself in a way that transformed its relationship with business and government. A report by the Canada-based International Development and Research Centre concluded that the CSIR 'has conducted what has probably been the most thorough re-evaluation undertaken by any governmentally-created research organisation in the country'. The IDRC was commissioned by the ANC to investigate science and technology policy. The report says the CSIR was restructured 'along up-to-date lines to equip itself to play a leading role in the quest to make a post-sanctions South Africa' internationally competitive in a number of fields. Brian Clark, CSIR president, says the attitude in South Africa until the late 1980s was that government was responsible for scientific research, especially high-risk projects which should be fully funded from the public purse. The approach of 'science for science's sake', with research and development unfettered by industrial strategy, mirrored that of governments in the US and UK. The CSIR, however, could see how East Asian countries had moved swiftly to the forefront of industrial activity - without a well-developed science base  -through mastery of new technology. It therefore set out to learn the 'business' of R&amp;D. 'The measure of our success would be the ability to win funding for our research and place products in the market, rather than the amount of work our researchers published,' Clark says. The CSIR earned 60 per cent of its R418m (Dollars 121m) turnover in 1993 from contract income compared with about 15 per cent in 1987. Since 1990, the CSIR's re-organisation has been spurred by factors outside its control, not least the steady reduction in defence spending, as South Africa's military commitments declined after the withdrawal from Angola and the ANC's unbanning. The government has continued to invest in capacity building but the CSIR has focused on providing a 'strict client contract service'. Half the contracts derived from the private sector last year, with the rest spread equally between defence and other government departments. The relationship between the CSIR and AECI, the Anglo American-owned chemicals supplier, demonstrates the old and new styles of the council's relationship with industry. The CSIR is proud of the joint development with AECI of a high-yield lysine, an amino acid and ingredient in animal feed, which resulted in a new R300m plant. However, AECI bought the bio-technology from the CSIR in 1989 after the research group tried and failed to interest other parties in South Africa in what was a research-driven exercise which had reached only an embryonic stage. Frank Fisher, group research and development manager at AECI, says the CSIR lysine required more work for it to be commercially viable but the core research had been done. Fisher says the relationship between the two groups is now less ad hoc. Four projects are in development, based on proposals from the CSIR whose lack of engineering and commercial expertise is offset by academic excellence. 'We can't do all the work ourselves, so collaboration is vital at the stage where projects are yet to reach the market.' The CSIR's relationship with the mining industry has also changed with the 1993 merger of the Chamber of Mines Research Organisation, an industry-funded research body, to form the group's new mining technology division. Under pressure from falling commodity prices, the mining houses decided it was more efficient to buy research for individual needs rather than fund a co-operative effort. 'The CSIR maintains links with the Chamber of Mines but there is no guarantee we will win industry contracts unless we come up with ideas which complement the mines' own research efforts,' Clark says. The IDRC stresses that although the CSIR has done well in its collaboration with industry, its efforts at providing technological support for small business and community development lack momentum, a criticism the CSIR admits is valid. Clark says the group will have to devote more of its resources to these sectors, although its contracts with the emerging black small-business sector account for nearly a fifth of sales and is the fastest growing part of the CSIR's work. The group must provide technology for the small-business sector to meet community needs while retaining its main corporate role. 'The biggest tension we face is grappling with the massive and legitimate demands on a new government for the most basic services - housing, water, electricity - but as the focus shifts from promise to delivery, we're confident anyone who can help deliver will be co-opted, not neglected.'

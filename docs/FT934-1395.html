			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Requiem for Wildlife Thursday's Royal Festival Hall Verdi Requiem was given by the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus for the benefit of the World Wildlife Fund. The conductor, Lorin Maazel, had both donated his fee and written an eloquent preface to the programme. This worthwhile pursuit should be saluted; what a pity it was not possible also to salute the behaviour of the frequently restless, chatty, cough-rackety 'gala audience' - nor, in truth, the quality of the Verdi performance itself: the gap between noble aim and trivial execution yawned wide. As so often in the past, when he has conducted this work (and others of similarly large scale) in London, it was hard to avoid constant focus on the extraordinary superficiality of Maazel's music-making. He is, after all, a paid-up member of the world's conducting elite; his facility of technique, speed of musical absorption and general breadth of command remain the stuff of legend. So the externalised, showpiece effects drawn out of the score - absurdly self-conscious extremes of dynamic, vulgar underlinings of brass-and-drum drama, lashings of 'feeling' applied to the passages of quiet sentiment and heartfelt pleading - stuck out altogether more than they might in a reading by a conductor with less directorial savoir-faire. There were a few blips of ensemble between the offstage brass and the main orchestra; for the rest, and with the above reservations firmly in mind, the playing and choral singing were representative of the Philharmonia's celebrated Verdi Requiem best. There was an odd, mismatched team of soloists - odder even than originally planned, since Claire Powell, the lightweight but very musical mezzo, came in as a last-minute replacement. The lowest voice belonged to Glyndebourne's mighty Porgy and Bess Crown, Gregg Baker, and sounded here secure but resolutely unidiomatic. The young Frenchman Roberto Alagna, hotly tipped as the world's 'next' tenor star, will surely wanted to forget this occasion, and the amount of erratic, out-of-tune delivery he contributed thereto, as soon as possible. It was left to Nina Rautio - a Russian soprano spinto of grandly impassioned authority, rich-grained in tone, only occasionally uncomfortable in changes of gear - to convey an authentic sense of Verdian style and content otherwise very largely obliterated.

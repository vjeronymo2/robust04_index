			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: Institutions back ASX reform plans Australia's institutional investors have thrown their support behind the suggestion that the Australian Stock Exchange should introduce a new listing rule for 'best practice' in the corporate governance of listed companies, writes Nikki Tait. The Australian Investment Managers Group, which represents most of the country's institutional fund managers, said yesterday that it 'strongly supported' such an initiative by the ASX, which would be modelled on the London Stock Exchange. This would require listed companies to disclose if they were not complying with the best practices guidelines incorporated into the listing rule.</p>

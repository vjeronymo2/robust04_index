			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Korea opens up Posco to foreign investment SHAREHOLDERS of Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the South Korean steelmaker, yesterday approved a proposal to allow foreigners to acquire up to 8 per cent of the state-affiliated company. Individual foreign investors will not be allowed to have a shareholding of more than 1 per cent under the amended by-law, which takes effect today. The Korean government, which controls 35 per cent of Posco, opened the company to foreign investment to try to revive the country's stock market by attracting more capital from abroad. The extraordinary shareholders' meeting also approved the appointment of Mr Hwang Kyung-ro, the vice-chairman, as Posco's chairman. He replaces Mr Park Tae-joon, who resigned last week for political reasons and becomes honorary chairman. Mr Chung Myung-sik, Posco president, is the new vice-chairman, while Mr Park Tuk-pyo, vice-president for strategic planning, becomes president. Mr Hwang said his goal was to make Posco the world's biggest steelmaker by 1996.</p>

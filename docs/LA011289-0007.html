			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVINGS SCANDAL  </P> <P> The rising indignation of taxpayers over the burden that they will bear in  bailing out failed savings-and-loan institutions, and probably a number of  banks as well, is understandable. The public has been betrayed by a culpability  that runs from dilatory regulators and complacent bureaucrats in the executive  branch of the federal government to a Congress eager to please the politically  powerful masters of the thrift and banking industries.  </P> <P> As a result, there will be an inescapable cost of close to $100 billion that  the taxpayers themselves will now be forced to pay over the next three or four  years. The cost is inescapable because the good faith of the government must  protect, within the prescribed limits of the law, the depositors placed at risk  by the profligate mismanagement of so many thrifts and banks.  </P> <P> That outrageous cost may be just the beginning. Nothing that the Federal Home  Loan Bank Board has done to address the crisis in the savings-and-loan industry  is a remedy for the underlying problem. Indeed, critical elements of the  generous and virtually risk-free deals being struck by the board with private  investors, ostensibly to cut the cost to taxpayers for the rescue mission,  raise a flood of questions about their equity and about the real commitment of  the new investors to reform and a long-term role.  </P> <P> Furthermore, both Congress and the Reagan White House, through the Council of  Economic Advisers, have been so busy blaming others that they have ignored  their own glaring responsibility, including the responsibility to come up with  real reforms. More, much more than a clean-up of management, is required.  </P> <P> Time is wasting. Even as regulators and legislators rush to their own defense,  the problem is getting worse. Some of the FHLBB interventions have eased the  interest rates that thrift institutions have to pay for new money. But they  have not deterred a continued, perilous mounting of more liabilities at a time  when the loans made by the troubled institutions already exceed the valuation  of the projects for which they were made in the first place.  </P> <P> The collaboration of Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. officials with  megabuck bailout investors in the final days of December, to assure these  investors a maximum tax benefit before the law changed on Jan. 1, raises  serious questions for Congress to pursue. Federal regulators argue that these  midnight deals were in the public interest. They also point out that they were  given few options because FSLIC reserves had fallen to only a fraction of the  obligations to depositors. It is now for Congress to find out whether the right  thing was done.  </P> <P> But Congress itself will be ignoring the public interest if it fails to do more  than conduct noisy hearings. This is not a Republican-Democratic partisan  issue. The deregulation that is at the heart of the crisis was voted by  Congress in the Carter Administration, then reinforced in the subsequent Reagan  years. It would be ridiculous to maintain any federal role, any deposit  insurance, unless regulations are restored to minimize the risks.To do  otherwise would be to force taxpayers to pick up the losses of a financial  sector more akin to a casino than the prudent institutions envisioned when  deposit insurance was invented.  </P> <P> Furthermore, Congress must look sharply at the decision of the FHLBB that its  function is to save the industry, not just to protect those with deposits up to  the federal insurance limit of $100,000. Perhaps it is cheaper to reorganize  failing institutions rather than to padlock their doors and pay off depositors.  But Congress needs to know who this grand scheme will benefit beyond the  insured depositors and the traditional customers of mortgage money.  </P> <P> The crisis has elicited expressions of outrage from the savings-and-loan  institutions that are well managed and in strong condition. But their protests  had been muted until Congress raised the prospect that all of the industry will  have to bear an increased share in the costs of finding remedies, of  refinancing the FSLIC. We see no alternative to continuing and probably  enlarging the special FSLIC assessment paid by all savings-and-loans. That need  not preclude introducing a risk-related supplementary insurance premium for the  institutions that might choose to continue dubious investments.  </P> <P> Even as the savings-and-loan crisis takes center stage, unresolved problems are  being compounded in the banking industry. The new federal budget includes  warnings about the risky rush of major banks to fund leveraged buyouts of  businesses -- a highly profitable venture only so long as economic growth is  maintained and recession is avoided.  </P> <P> A sensitive issue dims the likelihood of effective action on Capitol Hill. That  is the cozy relationship between so many in Congress, including the leadership,  and the thrift industry, which has been politically and financially helpful to  them. There will be a temptation to continue coddling the industry at a time  when it needs a reassertion of stringent controls. There will be a reluctance  to reassess whether, in fact, savings-and-loan institutions should continue to  have a protected place in the American economy today, long after they have  diversified so broadly from their historic function of providing mortgages for  home and commercial real estate.  </P> <P> In facing this crisis, Congress needs to remember what the public interest is.  There is no public obligation to bail out investors, to reduce the risk of  those rushing in with new money, to protect failed managers, to guard the  stockholders of mismanaged companies. The public obligation is to protect the  depositors within the limits of the law. And to see that it doesn't happen  again.  </P></p>

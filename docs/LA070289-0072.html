			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: THREE HUNTERS BY WILLIAM HARRISON (RANDOM HOUSE: $16.95; 250  PP.)  </P> <P> The African landscape, and Kenya's in particular, seems to inspire rare passion  in people who have lived there. In his third novel set in Africa, William  Harrison tells a tale of modern Kenya and the Kenya of the old days -- zamani  -- through the eyes of a family of legendary hunters. Chili Cavanaugh, a native  of Oklahoma, was the first American to "enter the insular society of the  big-game hunters" soon after World War I. His two sons, Coke and Lucien, born  in Africa, do their wild father proud by rejecting the discipline of the  British schools and running away to join him on safari. The three become known  as much for their reckless courage on the hunt -- their trademark is to wait  until the last possible moment before pulling the trigger -- as for their epic  womanizing. Their relationship is based on constant competition; between them,  they have divided up the range of possible masculine proficiencies, from  whiskey drinking and card tricks to opening lines with women.  </P> <P> When the story opens, Lucien Cavanaugh is an aging bachelor. He is restless:  dissatisfied with the outfitting business he has been running since big-game  hunting was outlawed, tired of his solitude and perplexed by the forces --  mainly entanglements with women -- that drove his father, brother and him  apart. In Nairobi he meets a woman doctor, Trey, who is fetching supplies for  the refugee camp she tends on the northern border. On an impulse, he decides to  drive her to the camp. As they drive, he attempts an explanation of how he fell  out with his father and brother. "Maybe it was the times," he explains. "When  the hunting ended, all the old hunters got out of sorts."  </P> <P> At the camp, they discover that a marauding leopard has been attacking and  carrying off refugees. Big cats who develop a taste for human flesh must be  destroyed, so Lucien invites his father and brother up to take part in a rare  condoned hunt. "Three Hunters" weaves together the tale of the hunt and  Lucien's musings on what went wrong in the family.  </P> <P> This is a novel of restless men and the bonds between them, a terrific  adventure story as well as a profound meditation on the intoxication of  risk-taking.  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber accord verging on collapse UNLESS THERE are some last minute negotiations, today could go down as the day which saw the beginning of the end for the International Natural Rubber Agreement (Inra). Inra - agreed between the world's main natural rubber producers and consumers - has been in force since the late 1970s. It now seems that differences between the two groups can no longer be reconciled. Arguments over pricing are at the centre of the argument. Inra members - Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast - accounting for more than 80 per cent of the world's natural rubber output say that the present agreement, Inra II has failed to lift prices to levels which give plantations and hundreds of thousands of rubber smallholders an adequate income. Producers and consumers - mainly the EC, US and Japan - agreed last November on a deadline of yesterday for any move towards some form of renegotiation of Inra II. If the consumers did not agree, said the producers, then Inra would be allowed to lapse and the producers themselves could bring in their own pricing mechanisms. Earlier this week the EC issued a statement saying it was unwilling to renegotiate Inra II. The EC accused the producers of failing to abide by price review provisions laid down in the existing pact. The EC said, however, that it would consider the question of renegotiation 'once the present situation has been corrected.' The US and Japan have also rejected any renegotiation. Inra falls under the auspices of the International Natural Rubber Organisation (Inro). Its rules make any renegotiation impossible unless the big consumers first agree. Producers have reacted angrily to the EC statement. Mr Ahmad Farouk, the producers spokesman, said the EC was the one who was breaking the agreement. Inra II expires at the end of this year but it can be extended for a further two year period by mutual agreement between producers and consumers. Mr Ahmad rejects such a move. 'How can you have an extension if there is no renegotiation?' he said. Producers also dismissed the EC's criticism concerning a planned price review earlier this year. An Inro council meeting in February ended without agreement on whether to cut the group's reference which is used to guide market intervention by the Inro buffer stock manager. Consumer led by the EC wanted the reference price cut but were opposed by Malaysia and other producers which had been benefiting from a temporary rally in rubber prices. 'Consumers are always finding excuses not to renegotiate the Inra' said an official from Thailand, now the world's biggest natural rubber producer. Inro is likely to make an announcement on the future of Inra within the next few days. The next Inro council meeting is scheduled to take place here at the end of May.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong illuminates darkening week US EQUITIES turned in midstream last week, but after a recovery on Monday and a good start to the quarterly reporting season on Tuesday - subsequently marred by disappointing progress reports from IBM and Philip Morris - New York still had enough left to lead the FT-Actuaries World Index into a 1.3 per cent gain in local currency terms. In most of the major investment blocs, the week ended less happily than it began. Europe was subdued as downgrades moved from corporate earnings to national economic prospects in Germany, France and the UK in particular; for Japan, even the bulls were saying that hopes of a further cut in interest rates, and recovery, were counterbalanced by short-term fears for the economy and corporate profits. Hong Kong, however, was more interested in a massive underdeveloped economy: China. The successful resolution of Sino-US trade negotiations pushed up the market early in the week and unsupported rumours of an early resolution to the airport financing argument kept it going to achieve the best gain of the week. Hoare Govett Asia says on Hong Kong that the pro-reform flavour of the 14th party congress in Beijing has been appreciated, and that this week the impending visit to Beijing by Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, will dictate market movements. The week's most serious underperformer was South Africa, where local institutions are not buying shares and where, further, there is evidence that they are switching out of equities and into bonds and cash. Political strife between the government and the ANC has combined with hints about higher taxes and a rise in the financial rand, which tends to depress shares in local currency terms; and it is known that some R4bn of rights issues are in the immediate supply pipeline.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 % change     % change in                % change in local currency **    sterling**  US Dollars**               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of Start of      Start of                                          1992     1992          1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +0.47   -5.79    -18.20   -10.65    +4.68        -7.30 Belgium       -0.89   -3.47     -6.19    -6.14    +8.94        -3.51 Denmark       +0.80   -5.06    -31.24   -29.26   -17.36       -26.81 Finland       +3.42   +6.98    -21.00   -14.72   -14.54       -24.33 France        +0.10  -10.53     -8.97    -5.27   +10.53        -2.11 Germany       +1.42   -7.38    -10.56    -9.75    +4.70        -7.28 Ireland       -2.27  -11.66    -26.15   -22.32   -10.05       -20.34 Italy         +4.84  +12.10    -15.42   -14.64   -14.55       -24.33 Netherlands   -0.20   -2.97     -1.25    +1.81   +18.07        +4.57 Norway        -0.65   -7.37    -32.18   -22.97   -13.67       -23.55 Spain         -0.31  -10.64    -26.58   -21.62   -19.15       -28.39 Sweden        -0.88  -12.03    -23.80   -15.85    -5.41       -16.23 Switzerland   -0.02   -1.71     +8.12   +10.57   +28.30       +13.62 UK            +0.71   -0.01     -1.93    +2.25    +2.25        -9.44 EUROPE        +0.64   -3.42     -7.01    -3.72    +3.91        -7.97 Australia     -3.25   -7.37    -14.18   -16.45   -10.52       -20.56 Hong Kong     +6.49   +5.22    +47.94   +39.46   +58.48       +40.35 Japan         +1.17   -3.22    -28.40   -22.77    -9.05       -19.44 Malaysia      +1.62   +4.15    +17.07    +8.16   +32.82       +17.63 New Zealand   -0.44   -7.64    -10.15   -16.44    -5.32       -16.13 Singapore     -0.85   -1.07     -8.74   -17.29    -5.65       -16.44 Canada        -0.52   -7.43    -10.28   -10.27    -5.99       -16.74 USA           +2.11   -2.44     +5.28    -1.05   +11.72        -1.05 Mexico        +1.80   +9.12     +4.11    -1.37    +8.08        -4.28 South Africa  -5.84   -8.97    -16.00   -18.42   -30.50       -38.45 WORLD INDEX   +1.34   -2.93     -9.21    -8.60    +2.69        +2.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on October 16th 1992.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright, The Financial Times Limited, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., and County NatWest Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

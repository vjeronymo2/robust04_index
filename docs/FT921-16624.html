			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Management: Playboy magazine promotes Old Milwaukee beer OLD MILWAUKEE beer, made by the Stroh Brewery of Detroit, has been receiving an extra boost of brand recognition with a Playboy magazine cover feature of its 'Swedish Bikini Team'. The 'team,' composed of five buxom American women in blond wigs, is an ad agency's invention for the beer maker's television commercials. The Playboy spread might seem the target marketer's dream come true. But the problem is that Stroh's 'Swedish Bikini Team' is at the centre of a novel controversy in the marketing world. Stroh is being sued by five female workers at its brewery in St Paul, Minnesota, who allege that the commercials foster a climate tolerant of sexual harassment in the workplace. They charge that they have been subjected to a pattern of physical and verbal sexual abuse, and link the commercials to it. Lawyers for the women say the Bikini Team TV commercials are demeaning to women and other advertising posters of scantily clad women have been 'directly used as tools of harassment'. The company describes the allegations as 'preposterous' and says it has a policy against sexual harassment. It has not halted the 'Swedish Bikini Team' marketing campaign, which began last spring and, if similar to others, will run for about a year. George Kuehn, senior vice-president of Stroh and its general counsel, said that the company 'had nothing to do with the appearance of the team in Playboy'. But it did nothing to stop them. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages and an end to the marketing campaign, could pose an entirely new business risk to advertising. If successful, it could for the first time link adverts to sexual misconduct in the work place.</p>

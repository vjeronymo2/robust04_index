			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kemal Balci] </F>   [Text] Ankara--A full scale political war appears imminent  as the search for an alternative government gathers steam and as  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller steps up her opposition to  "alternative names."    The prime minister, acutely aware that new models to replace  the True Path Party (DYP) and Social Democrat People's Party  (SHP) coalition government are being discussed, has accelerated  her secret political war against the powerful names who favor  change. The proposal for a parliamentary inquiry into the  activities of Yusuf Bozkurt Ozal, Kaya Erdem, and Ekrem  Pakdemirli that might lead to their appearance before the  Supreme Parliamentary Council, submitted by DYP parliamentary  group deputy chairmen on instructions from the PM [prime  minister], is an example of how this war is being conducted.    The failure of the coalition government to curb the economic  crisis has given new momentum to the search for alternatives.  Efforts to promote a True Path-Motherland coalition--favored by  the group of businessmen known as "the Barons of Istanbul"--have  intensified.    It is noticeable that solutions which foresee the removal of  the two main opponents (namely DYP chairman Tansu Ciller and  ANAP [Motherland Party] chairman Mesut Yilmaz) to the government  model called ANAYOL (Mother or Main Road), debated for more than  two-and-one-half years, are multiplying rapidly. It is also  reported that the plan had reached the final stage; the next  step was to find staff for the new government, formulate a new  program and establish a new balance of power that would change  the division of seats in parliament.  <H5>  Formulas in and out of parliament: </H5>   Two factors which appear to worry the prime minister and  bring the search for alternative government models to an  advanced stage are the "alternative economic program" prepared  by Ekrem Ceyhun, who is known to be very close to President  Suleyman Demirel, and a second program being prepared by Ilhan  Kesici, ANAP's Istanbul mayoral candidate and former  undersecretary of the State Planning Organization.    It is reported that the program prepared by Ceyhun, together  with Mahir Barutcu, could be implemented immediately if a  DYP-ANAP coalition came into being. The two programs could also  be combined, or at least made compatible, after talks between  the two sides.    However, the greatest obstacles to the DYP-ANAP unification  remain the chairmen of the two parties and this has resulted in  a "war of attrition" being waged by deputies on their chairmen.  As the actions of the conservative and religious wings of the  DYP, which originally put the future of the present coalition at  stake, continue, the idea of DYP-ANAP coalition is being openly  expressed to the PM in parliamentary group meetings.    DYP's deputy chairman Esat Kiratlioglu, responsible for  party  organization, claims that "democracy was born in the group after  Tansu Ciller came to power.    "Nobody could talk of such things in Demirel's time (as  chairman). Even then similar ideas existed but they were being  expressed secretly. Now they are being expressed openly. Let  it be this way, there is nothing to fear," he said.    Kiratlioglu said that Husamettin Cindoruk, considered to be  the leader of the opposition within the party, has always been  part of the opposing group but no longer has any followers, thus  no political power. Kiratlioglu also claims that there is  nobody strong enough to be an alternative to Ciller.    As for Ekrem Ceyhun, Kiratlioglu claimed to be aware of his  program but also thought that Ceyhun had no support other than  that of Demirel.    Kiratlioglu appeared to take an even harder line against  opposition at a press conference on Sunday [1 May], when he  accused ANAP leader Yilmaz of "calling for a civilian coup" by  encouraging establishment of a new government by anti-democratic  means. "There is a movement to destroy the True Path party as  well as remove Ciller from the prime ministry," Kiratlioglu  said. "We will not allow that. The government is standing  firm."    Kiratlioglu's approach to the issue is one of the tactics  being used by Ciller who has told her deputies that a coalition  with ANAP would result in the party losing power and its  eventual disintegration. According to Ciller it is not possible  for two parties to address the same section of the electorate  and remain viable. She asks why should ANAP be kept alive by  allowing it to share power and says that this would not, in any  way, serve the interests of the DYP. The prime minister  maintains that the present coalition government will carry on  until the general elections when the DYP will take power on its  own, wiping out ANAP in the process.    Cindoruk, on the other had, says in private conversation  that  Ciller, to whom he refers, unflatteringly, as "that girl" and  hints at her lack of experience and her political naivete, will  be unsuccessful despite her good intentions.    Cindoruk also maintains that those who had criticized him in  the past should look at the present situation and admit that he  had been right. "The government and the high officials in the  bureaucracy are incompetent. The mistake was made by Demirel  right at the beginning when he assembled a weak staff and the  mistake has not been corrected up to the present day." Cindoruk  says.    The same commotion regarding ANAYOL can also be seen in  ANAP.  Istanbul deputy Naci Eksi's criticism of Chairman Mesut Yilmaz  and demands for his resignation are interpreted as the  extensions of the search for a new government. ANAP'S former  group deputy chairman and Bayburt deputy, Ulku Gokalp, is also  critical of Yilmaz. Istanbul deputy Gurol Soylu, founder of the  party and late president Turgut Ozal's personal office director  Fevzi Isnasaran, together with Huseyin Aksoy and Engin Guner,  who was close to Ozal, are also known to be supporters of the  idea of partnership with DYP. Gunes Taner, who is not a member  of this group, was also said to support the DYP-ANAP partnership.    It is also reported that Yusuf Bozkurt Ozal has taken the  initiative to form an umbrella group for those who are  "resentful of the leaders."    Apart from these parliamentary "efforts," a new formula,  which debates the establishment of a technocrat government --  ironically known in political corridors as "government of  brains" -- to be headed by Central Bank ex-governor Rusdu  Saracoglu, is simmering. This formula is a throwback to the 1971  Nihat Erim government, when President Cevdet Sunay, in the wake  of a military memorandum, asked Professor Erim to form a  non-party government.    It is claimed that the present debate and the search for  possible names for such a government is being kept alive --  particularly at a time when political parties in parliament will  be forced to say "yes" to such a development because of military  pressures.    Pondering on possible names for "government of brains," the  Turkish media comes up with the following:    "Yavuz Canevi, Zekeriya Yildirim, Ercan Kumcu, Hasan Ersel,  Kadir Guney, Gazi Ercel, Mahfi Egilmez, Ertugrul Kumcuoglu,  Yavuz Ege, Metin Koksal, Bulent Gultekin, Salih Neftci, Kemal  Dervis, Cetin Hacaloglu, Vural Akisik, Yilmaz Karakogyunlu,  Veysi Sevig, Cem Alpar, Deniz Gokce, Taner Berksoy, Sukru Binay,  Murat Kudat, Sener Oktay, Merih Celasun, Erdogan Ertozun, Aksit  Kayalar, Gunal Kansu, Varan Tuncel." It is also claimed that  the search for a new government would be an alternative to the  "government of brains" thesis and the same names could be used  by a Motherland-True Path coalition. Ciller, meanwhile, is  trying to keep her parliamentary group united, utilize her  "foreign support" card and gives the message that "we will all  go down together" if economic prosperity is not secured. Her  aim is to prevent her deputies from launching new alternatives.  But new alternatives are sure to appear after July 5, 1994 --  the date which marks the end of the three month waiting period  which Ciller requested before results of her economic package  became apparent.</p>

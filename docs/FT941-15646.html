			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Scalfaro prepares to call election President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro last night looked set to dissolve Italy's parliament and call general elections for late March following the resignation of the eight-month-old Ciampi government. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the 73-year-old former governor of the bank of Italy and the first non-elected premier this century, handed in his resignation during a brief meeting with President Scalfaro early yesterday afternoon. The president did not formally accept the resignation. Officials said he was anxious to consult with the leaders of the two houses of parliament and other prominent politicians, first, to ensure Italy possessed a stable caretaker government in the run-up to elections. An announcement on the dissolution of parliament is expected at the weekend. Elections must then be held within 60 days. Politicians said yesterday the most likely dates would be March 20 or March 26. Mr Ciampi's resignation followed an abortive attempt by a hard core of Christian Democrats and their allies to prolong the life of the present parliament, at least until June so as hold general elections alongside European parliamentary elections. The manoeuvre was backed by some Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals plus a group of mavericks among the Radicals and Republicans - in effect those that have long dominated Italy's political life and risk oblivion in a general election. Their aim was to delay elections as long as possible to allow new parties to form, while at the same time exploiting their parliamentary privileges to protect them from prosecution in the corruption scandals. In the classic manner of Italy's byzantine politics, the move to prolong parliament took the form of a no-confidence motion tabled just before Christmas. Thus the 170 signatories hoped to remove Mr Ciampi or ensure he was forced to form a new government. This backfired when the motion began to be debated on Wednesday and it became clear the motion lacked a majority in the 630 seat house. Yesterday, Mr Marco Panella, the Radical leader who tabled the motion, withdrew it. The backers of the no- confidence motion then changed tactics and proposed a confidence motion which has yet to be debated. Such a confidence motion, however, threatens, if not carefully controlled, to undermine the constitutional justification of President Scalfaro dissolving parliament when the government enjoys the confidence of the legislature.</p>

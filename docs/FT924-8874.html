			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Bad blood in Brussels: National leaders need to make painful choices to rescue the cause of European unity The cause of European unity has always been a fragile enterprise. With the Gatt world trade talks in the balance, and the prospects for ratification of the Maastricht treaty cloudier than ever, the row last week over whether Mr Jacques Delors had sabotaged a US-EC agricultural deal was a damaging blow to an already bruised Community. Mr Delors' position as president of the European Commission appears secure, as long as Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agricultural commissioner and a lead Gatt negotiator, fails to produce unequivocal evidence to support his charges against the Frenchman. But the recrimination over Mr MacSharry's allegations will linger, fuelling the atmosphere of mutual suspicion inside the Commission and among member states, and strengthening the impression of disarray. Faced with some of the bleakest economic prospects since 1945, Europe's politicians are increasingly held hostage by domestic political pressures, whether they be from French farmers, a handful of Tory Euro-sceptics or the need to maintain high interest rates to pay for the costs of German reunification. The question being raised in Brussels is whether EC leaders will recover their nerve in time to take the decisions necessary to end the current crisis of confidence inside the Community. 'We need convincing action on the issues at hand,' said a senior EC official last Friday, warning that the future of the Maastricht treaty was at stake, 'but people are going back to the bad old days when they do not expect much from the European Community.' The Gatt debacle underlined the EC's near-paralysis. The stand-off on agricultural policy between France, tacitly supported by Germany, and Brussels, in the shape of the redoubtable Mr MacSharry, has been one of the worst-kept secrets. If weekend efforts to relaunch the EC-US talks succeed, there may still be a chance of averting a transatlantic trade war which no one wants. However, the way in which member-states have meddled in the Commission's negotiating efforts has revealed institutional weaknesses in the Community. Even if a Gatt breakthrough materialises, a host of other problems is piling up before the next EC summit in Edinburgh early next month, starting with the UK government's decision last week to delay final ratification of the Maastricht treaty until after a second Danish referendum next year. Mr John Major's decision to delay ratification caused consternation in European capitals. Most officials believed they had a solid British commitment to press ahead with Maastricht as fast as possible, without renegotiation. Mr Major was, in fact, more circumspect, leaving open the possibility of proceeding after Christmas. Despite his caveats, several European governments felt misled. The narrow Commons majority on Wednesday night in favour of proceeding with Maastricht was to their mind a victory for the treaty. In the event, the three-strong majority showed how close Mr Major had come to defeat. Yet the real importance of the British delay is that it adds to the uncertainty which has been sapping the strength of the European Community for the past six months. Ever since the narrow Danish vote against Maastricht, the EC has been engaged in internal crisis management, often to the exclusion of more pressing external matters such as a Gatt agreement and civil war in the former Yugoslavia. The Community's recent attempts at 'Euro-building' have occasionally appeared to be an uneasy mix of the very important and the very unimportant. Efforts to promote 'transparency' in the aftermath of the narrow Yes vote in the French referendum on Maastricht led to Mr Major's suggestion that EC leaders should devote a five-minute speech in Birmingham to their vision of Europe. This was greeted with gentle derision in Europe, but efforts to make 'subsidiarity' - devolving powers to the lowest appropriate level - comprehensible to the ordinary public have been equally unsuccessful. Meanwhile, leaders have found it easier to shuffle important business to one side. The turbulence in the European exchange rate mechanism in September, which led to the withdrawal of the Italian lira and the British pound and to the devaluation of the Spanish peseta, let loose shocks inside the European Monetary System which are still reverberating. Yet member-states have so far confined themselves to technical discussions, on the grounds that a public debate about reform of the ERM could unsettle financial markets and precipitate another currency crisis. Similarly, there is little public debate on the acute economic problems facing Europe - the accelerating downturn which in turn is raising questions about the common drive for economic convergence and future European monetary union laid out in the Maastricht treaty. Some preliminary work on a new growth policy is being conducted by Mr Delors and Mr Henning Christopherson, European commissioner responsible for economic policy; but even the most idealistic Europhiles in Brussels know that the burden for promoting growth lies with the member states. A pivotal test of political will centres on member-states' approval of the so-called Delors II package. This would authorise extra funding for the poorer southern members and Ireland which Mr Delors insists must be extended if they are to have any hope of surviving the deflationary impact of the drive to monetary union. The Commission's original proposal, based on 2.5 per cent annual growth, was to increase EC spending by about 30 per cent over five years. The idea was to lift spending from 1.2 per cent of the Community's gross domestic product to 1.37 per cent of GDP by 1997. But several countries, led by Germany and the UK, forced this proposal off the table last spring on the grounds that is was too ambitious at a time of budget-tightening. Now the 2.5 per cent growth forecasts look unrealistic. Therefore, in his latest proposal, Mr Delors wants to revive his idea of spreading the increase in funds over seven years, with a freeze on spending at 1.2 per cent of GDP for the first two years. Close colleagues, who describe Mr Delors as 'very bruised', believe that failure to agree a budget package could prompt another resignation threat, possibly even an irrevocable decision to quit. Such a threat may work; but it is becoming increasingly clear that countries such as Germany are hesitant about paying the high economic price for political cohesion in the Community, particularly given the unexpectedly high costs of German unification. 'The tensions between donors and recipients in the Community is one of the coming big themes,' says a US diplomat in Brussels. The next big political test for the EC will be how it tackles the Danish question. Already several member states, notably Spain, Germany, France and Ireland, are suggesting privately that Danish requests for 'legally binding' agreements on a UK-style opt-out on a single currency and an exemption from a putative common European army will have to be watered down. For all its seriousness, there is an Alice in Wonderland quality to the debate. Mr Uffe-Ellemann Jensen, the Danish foreign minister charged with explaining his country's position, is in reality presenting demands largely dictated to his minority government by opposition parties; he himself has little faith in those demands. At the same time, says one senior EC official, member states are kidding themselves if they believe they can significantly change the Danish demands, since they are almost certainly the necessary price for securing ratification next year. In this official's view, there are only three options to settle the Danish question. First, a new document setting out in explicit detail the post-Maastricht rights and obligations of Denmark to the EC, and vice versa. Such special treatment would be enormously complicated and would almost certainly prove unacceptable to the member states. The second option is the threat of divorce - an ultimatum to Copenhagen that unless it accepts a non-legally binding political declaration covering its demands, it must leave the Community. The third option is to accept the Danish terms, recognising that a good deal of what the Danes are seeking is not explicitly required by the treaty. Thus the Community, working with the Danes, would draw up a text on the basis of which the Danish people would ratify Maastricht. And one expert view is that such document could be legally binding upon the Danes, but would not require re-ratification by other members states. 'Anything can be done from a legal point of view,' says the expert. 'In the end it comes down to a political decision - and the words.' One last alternative for the member states is the Micawber option - to postpone a settlement of the Danish question until after the Edinburgh summit in the hope that something turns up. This carries great risks. Along with the Delors II package, Maastricht ratification by the 12 has a direct bearing on the timetable for the next stage of European Union in 1996 - when the Maastricht treaty is scheduled to be reviewed, and when some countries may be ready to proceed to monetary union. Approval of Maastricht and a Delors II package are also the pre-conditions for opening EC membership negotiations with Austria, Finland and Sweden. Until recently, it had been assumed that entry talks might proceed early next year despite the problems with ratification. The British delay, says one EC official, offers countries such as Spain a ready-made excuse to block the negotiations. One good reason is that final passage of Maastricht in the UK House of Lords might not be complete until well into the autumn. If Austria, Finland and Sweden are forced to wait, there is a danger that ratification of their own membership treaties will be delayed until late 1994 or 1995. This could leave them in no man's land when it comes to the Maastricht review conference in 1996 when they had, in fact, hoped to be fully participating EC members. The EC would thus risk becoming divided between members inside the Community, members with one foot outside such as Denmark and Britain, and would-be members from Scandinavia clamouring to come in. This uneasy ambiguity bears more than a passing resemblance to the unhappy and increasingly untenable position today.</p>

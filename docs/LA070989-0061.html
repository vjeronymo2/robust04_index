			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE POLES' REAL HERO IS AMERYKA  </P> <P> The Poles have a longstanding love affair with Ameryka. President Bush will  revel in the outpouring of adulation, but Poland's heart was conquered long  ago. No country in the world is as unabashedly pro-American as the Polish  People's Republic.  </P> <P> I learned that lesson on my first visit to Poland in 1964. Arriving by  coincidence on the same day as Robert Kennedy, I followed the crowds to  Warsaw's huge Old Market Square, which was packed with people. When Kennedy  emerged from St. John's Cathedral, I found myself literally lifted off my feet  by the surging crowd chanting "Kennedy, Kennedy." Twice I dangled above ground,  both exhilarated and frightened.  </P> <P> As a 17-year-old American discovering the land of his parents, I was initially  reluctant to admit that I was the beneficiary of the fallout effect, not just  of the magic of the Kennedy name but the deeper magic of the word Ameryka. When  Poles would solemnly declare that I had the "Kennedy look," something no one  had ever noticed back home, I chalked it up to their perspicacity. When young  women flashed dazzling smiles after they heard me described as an Amerykanin, I  figured that Polish women had much better taste than American high school  girls.  </P> <P> But soon I had to somewhat sorrowfully admit that other factors were at work,  since the evidence was just too overwhelming. Ameryka is associated with  everything positive and far away, and the antithesis of all that is sinister  and nearby.  </P> <P> Ameryka means wealth and success. Meeting someone who is turned out in fancy  clothes or drives a new car, a Pole will say: "I see that Ameryka has opened up  to you." A relative of mine went to a wedding in the countryside, where the  bride's father muttered as guests heaped on huge helpings of food: "Where do  they think they are -- in Ameryka?"  </P> <P> Ameryka also means a state of mind, not just of freedom but of civility in a  society based on constitutional rights that may be more mythological than real.  If a Pole demands to be treated with respect and talks back to a petty  bureaucrat, the bureaucrat is likely to bark: "What do you think, that this is  Ameryka?" The assumption about the meaning of Ameryka is shared by both parties  in such an exchange.  </P> <P> Successive attempts by Communist officials to discredit their opponents as  American puppets or agents have backfired. Solidarity's support of American  economic sanctions against Poland in the wake of the imposition of martial law  in 1981 was widely applauded, despite the government's efforts to portray  Washington as the cause of the country's economic disarray. Anti-American  posters had to be displayed on the inside of shop windows; otherwise, they were  immediately torn down.  </P> <P> By the last election campaign, Communist officials were tacitly acknowledging  reality and doing everything to obscure their true affiliation. One Communist,  an author of several books about the United States, promoted his candidacy by  posing against a backdrop of American flags.  </P> <P> Above all, Ameryka represents the forces of good versus the all-too-familiar  forces of evil at home and across the Soviet border. When Ronald Reagan began  speaking of "the evil empire," Poles were ecstatic that finally an American  President was echoing what they had been saying all along.  </P> <P> When West Germans took to the streets to protest the deployment of American  medium-range missiles, Poles contemptuously dismissed their concerns. "Better a  Pershing than a Soviet soldier in your back yard," they were fond of saying.  </P> <P> If Poles are sometimes disillusioned with American leaders, they can act like  lovers scorned. That is why Franklin D. Roosevelt, who is blamed for handing  over their country to Stalin at Yalta, arouses such wrath. But even presidents  who are perceived as weak -- Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter -- were greeted  enthusiastically on their visits to Poland. Americans may be considered  bumbling or naive at times, but any gesture of support is more than  reciprocated.  </P> <P> John F. Kennedy and Reagan, who are seen as living up to Polish expectations,  are adored. On a visit to Poland last year, I frequently encountered the  question: "Is it really impossible for Reagan to run for a third term?"  Whatever his record on other issues, Poles are firmly convinced that his  willingness to stand up to the Kremlin greatly strengthened their struggle for  freedom.  </P> <P> By serving as Ronald Reagan's vice president and visiting Poland in 1987, Bush  guaranteed himself the welcome he is getting. But, Mr. President, a bit of  advice that should not be taken amiss: They love you more for what you  represent than for who you are.  </P></p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Management: How to join an 'inclusive' club UK companies must abandon their obsession with the financial 'bottom line'. They should develop reciprocal rather than 'power-based' relationships with customers and suppliers. And they will have to be clearer about their purpose and values. Coming from a run-of-the-mill management consultancy such prescriptions would hardly appear startling. As some of the conclusions of a group of senior executives from 25 leading UK businesses, however, they are likely to make many people sit up. The Inquiry into Tomorrow's Company - whose interim report was published in London yesterday - was established just over a year ago by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce. Besides the active participation of companies spanning the industrial, service and financial sectors - British Gas, Cable and Wireless, NM Rothschild and Manpower to name but four - the project has attracted the interest and support of luminaries like Sir Adrian Cadbury, Sir John Harvey-Jones and Charles Handy. Yesterday's 35-page document* charts the relatively poor performance of the UK in an increasingly competitive global market and sets out the team's preliminary criteria for future survival and success. On the authors' own admission little of the analysis is new. Its purpose, however, is to highlight the gap between talk and action, underline the competitive threat to those who fail to take note, and stimulate further debate in the UK and elsewhere. The main thesis is that the successful company of the future will have to adopt an 'inclusive' approach. This means that relationships with all its 'stakeholders' - customers, suppliers, employees, investors and the communities in which it operates - have to be nurtured and developed. An important focus for the inquiry will be finding ways to measure the effectiveness of these relationships, so that companies are well informed about the associated costs and benefits when they are in conflict. Other features of the 'inclusive' approach are consistency of message and a recognition of interdependence. *Copies from RSA Inquiry, RSA, 8 John Adam Street, London WC2N 6EZ. Tel: 071 839-1079.

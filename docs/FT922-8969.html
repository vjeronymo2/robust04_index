			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / BCCI's UK-based creditors to reject settlement BRITISH-BASED creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International are to reject as inadequate the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 960m) settlement negotiated between the liquidator and the majority shareholder. Rejection of the deal, to be put before the High Court in London on Monday, was formally agreed on Thursday at a meeting of creditors representing British deposits after they received independent legal advice. Private criticism of the deal had been building up among creditors for some time. Officials involved in the BCCI settlement say the High Court may simply open its hearing and then adjourn it to avoid having to make an immediate ruling. The creditors' stance will pose a dilemma for Sir Donald Nich-olls, the vice-chancellor, who is presiding over the settlement hearings, as the views of creditors would be expected to carry substantial weight in any court decision. It could also mark a defeat for Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross partner in charge of the BCCI liquidation. At the heart of creditors' objections is the view that the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder of BCCI, should have far more responsibility to creditors than Mr Smouha's deal provides. The Smouha/Abu Dhabi deal would offer creditors only 30 to 40 cents on the dollar. The creditors are arguing that liquidators should not give up their claims under Dollars 3.06bn of promissory notes issued by Abu Dhabi last year when the bank was carrying out a restructuring programme. They are also unhappy at having to sign over all legal rights to claim against the majority shareholders. The likely rejection was foreshadowed by the disclosure this week of a letter to the BCCI creditors committee from the Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt and three other Arab creditor banks, which opposed the proposed Smouha deal as being inadequate. Approval for the package in the High Court is an essential first step in a series of approvals needed in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. Finally the agreement would need the blessing of creditors representing 70 per cent of the Dollars 10bn of liabilities identified to date. Allegation of fraud, Page 4</p>

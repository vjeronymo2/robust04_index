It is in this tone that Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev is preparing to hold an open dialogue  with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Vladivostok.    The Russian minister stated this today while opening a  session of the Foreign Policy Council in Moscow, devoted, in  particular, to the problems of European security, questions of  relations with NATO, and other international structures.</p>

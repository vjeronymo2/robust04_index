			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Government could scrap London bus deregulation THE GOVERNMENT is getting cold feet about its plans to deregulate London buses. Ministers are seriously considering removing legislation to implement its proposals from the wide-ranging deregulation bill, which is intended as one of the cornerstones of the next parliamentary session, starting this month. A final decision on whether or not to remove the proposals may be taken at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. The rationale for withdrawing the plans would be a desire to avoid controversy. Ministers have tried to focus the new session's legislative timetable on areas - such as law and order - which are calculated to unite Conservatives. This follows the damaging and protracted internal wrangling that accompanied the passage of the Maastricht bill through parliament. The decision on bus deregulation will be finely balanced: ministers are said to be evenly split between those who favour caution and those who wish to push ahead. Advocates of the latter course argue that bus deregulation was originally intended as the heart of the bill, which is to be piloted by the Department of Trade and Industry. Backbench discontent over the proposals erupted during the summer, with Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former Tory minister, warning that deregulation was 'a form of suicide pill' for Conservative prospects in London's council elections next May. A poor performance in these elections would prompt renewed doubts over Mr John Major's leadership. The plans to bring London into line with bus services outside the capital, which were deregulated in the mid-1980s, have also been criticised by local authorities and London Transport on the grounds they will lead to road congestion and fare rises.</p>

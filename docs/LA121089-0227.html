			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERIOR TRENDS FOR THE 1990S  </P> <P> Almost anything goes, old, and new, when it comes to decorating looks for the  1990s.  </P> <P> The following report from the Better Homes and Garden Decorator's Almanac tells  what's new, what's hot and what's just plain fun.  </P> <P>  -- Autumn colors and shapes move inside. Looks for a bounty of leaves and  berries on richly hued fabrics, wall coverings and accents.  </P> <P>  -- The jeweled tones and nostalgic charm of tapestries and needlepoints are  weaving their way back into the home. If rugs or furniture don't fit into the  budget, accent pillows add dashes of the decorating delicacy. Use them to warm  modern schemes.  </P> <P>  -- The once-chunky profiles of sleep sofas have trimmed down and shaped up,  thanks to technical advances.  </P> <P>  -- Once assigned to the porch, wicker now makes itself at home inside. New  hues, including toasty brown, give wicker visual weight to stand up to sofas  and beds.  </P> <P>  -- Part of the trend toward lush interiors, fringe, tassels, ropes and cord  are showing up on new upholstered pieces. Tie trims into an existing scheme by  edging pillows or roping up draperies.  </P> <P>  -- Move over verdigris, tin is in. Accessories pounded out of this metal are  being plugged in or painted and hung on the wall.  </P></p>

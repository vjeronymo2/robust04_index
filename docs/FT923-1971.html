			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: German bonds Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's French referendum, and despite the collapse in convergence arguments following sterling's exit from the ERM, German bond yields will almost certainly continue to be a reference point for other European bond markets. German yields should remain well below those of other states, even if a Yes vote eases pressure on the ERM. Yet this week's issue of some DM6bn bonds for the Treuhand agency, responsible for privatisation in eastern Germany, is a reminder that heavy supply is in the offing. When the various elements are totted up, Germany's public sector deficit is some 5 per cent of GNP. Official estimates that this will fall to 3 per cent by 1996 depend on projections of economic growth which look over-optimistic. Germany still lacks a credible policy to bring the deficit down, and the reconstruction bill is mounting in the east. The Treuhand is likely to be a heavy borrower over the next couple of years. As in the US, these demands for public finance can probably be met while the economy remains depressed and the savings ratio is high. But any return to trend growth in Germany could mean consumption starving the bond market of funds. If investors can be persuaded to move money from deposits into bonds, monetary growth will slow, pleasing the Bundesbank. The trouble is that the central bank's own tight money policy is keeping short-term deposit rates above 9 per cent. So selling bonds on a yield of 7.5 per cent is an uphill task. A bunching of new issues between now and the year end could exacerbate the difficulty. Germany's good inflation record provides an underpinning for bond yields, but investors should keep an eye on costs in the east.</p>

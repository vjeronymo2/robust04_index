			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Arab governments remain impassive over accord ARAB governments still negotiating their own peace agreements with Israel remained impassive yesterday at the Jewish state's historic recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. It was left to Egypt, which has enjoyed a cool peace with Israel since 1979, to embrace the move as a 'positive step'. Jordan, which expressed umbrage at not having been consulted about secret PLO-Israeli talks leading up to the deal, adopted a similar tone yesterday. 'Jordan does not have details and has not been consulted on the mutual recognition,' said Mr Ma'an Abu Nowar, the information minister, 'so I cannot make a response and join in the jollifications and happiness and wondrousness.' Syria, which felt similar hurt at having been taken off guard by the PLO, remained officially silent. It has yet to make any detailed response either to the outline agreement between the PLO and Israel on self-rule. The Lebanese government also withheld comment, although the foreign ministry repeated its doubts over how the self-rule agreement would affect the tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees living in the country. The three governments' silences, even granted the fact that Friday is a holy rest day in the Islamic world, serves as a reminder that much remains to be negotiated with Israel before the region can be said to be on the threshold of a full and comprehensive peace. Only Jordanian negotiators at the Washington peace talks, which formally ended this week, have indicated that they could be ready to sign their own outline 'agenda' with Israel by next week, although Mr Abu Nowar yesterday also cast doubt on that. Responding to comments by Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, that Israel and Jordan could sign a deal soon after the PLO-Israeli signing on Monday, he said only; 'That's a bit optimisitic, shall we say. We haven't heard any reports to that effect from our negotiators.'</p>

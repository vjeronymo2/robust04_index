Government sources claimed that Rabbani's arch rival Prime  Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, aided by powerful militia leader  Gen Rashid Dostam, a close Rabbani ally until last Saturday, and  the Wahdat militia had planned to move their joint forces into  the city to capture the Presidential Palace.    The government said opposition, who apparently gained an  edge  when Dostam switched loyalties and attacked government forces,  had hoped to replace Rabbani with Sebghatollah Mojaddedi.    The government alleged the plot called for elevating Dostam,  a former communist general, to be defence minister while  Hekmatyar would remain prime minister.    Asked to comment on the government claim, the spokesman for  Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], Haji Mangal  Hussain, said: "We have been openly asking that Rabbani must  step down. If he does so, Hekmatyar will also resign."    Opposition and government sources said fighting, which  showed  Thursday night, resumed early Friday with both sides trading  heavy artillery and rocket fire.    However, heavy snow and fog prevented either side from using  aircraft to stage attacks.    Dostam, the only non-governmental commandar to have an air  force, has been using his planes to bomb government positions in  and around Kabul.    He claimed on Thursday to have gained complete control of  the  northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.    The continued fighting has prompted Pakistan, Iran and the  UN  Secretary General's representative in Afghanistan to call for a  ceasefire and peace. Islamabad had called for a 24 hour  ceasefire, to begin at 2300 PST [Pakistan Standard Time], to  permit the wounded, diplomats and UN personnel to be evacuated  form Kabul.    "Pakistan is deeply concerned over the increase in serial  bombardment posing a great danger to the civilians living in  Kabul, and has urged all sides to hold political talks", the  spokesman said.    Opposition sources in Peshawar said Rabbani has sent his  family to Pakistan.</p>

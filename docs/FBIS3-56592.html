			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis told a news  conference that at a session today, the Latvian State Security  Council valued proposals expressed in the framework of the NATO  program Partnership for Peace. Ulmanis added that an official  letter to NATO would also be prepared, in which the wish of the  Latvian side to participate in the program will be expressed.  The issue of Latvia joining NATO is, however, to be considered  only in a more distant future.    Ulmanis believes initial cooperation with NATO can be in the  way of training and consultations. The first step toward this  cooperation from the Latvian side would be working out a unified  concept for material and technical supplies for the state armed  structures.    The cooperation program also includes the request to be very  objective and loyal in the issues of human rights, which Latvia  perceives with great responsibility. Ulmanis added that in the  framework of the proposed partnership, it would be very  important to form balanced relations with Russia.</p>

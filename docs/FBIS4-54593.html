			<p>BFN     [Text] Ostrava, North Bohemia, April 29 (CTK) -- The  government coalition, with the help of some political parties,  is starting to implement measures aimed at weakening the  Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), KSCM Chairman  Miroslav Grebenicek told journalists today. He said he believed  that the proposed amendment to the law on political parties was  advantageous mainly for small and formerly non-existent parties.  "Those who will support the amendment and thus demonstrate their  accommodating approach will be richly rewarded," Grebenicek  said. He added that at the same time these parties would make  it clear that they place power and money above the obligations  of the deputies of the legislative body which ensue from the law.    If the bill is passed and makes it possible to freely  dissolve political parties then it would be a definitive full  stop on the time in which citizens could cherish illusions about  the existence of parliamentary democracy in the Czech Republic,  he said. On the occasion of the 49th anniversary of the  liberation of Ostrava from Nazi occupiers KSCM representatives  today laid wreaths and bouquets of red carnations on the graves  of fallen Red Army soldiers in the Comenius Park and at a  memorial tank.</p>

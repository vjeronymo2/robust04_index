			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE'S TIRED OF THEIR STERLING PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> On March 24, the Clippers got beat at home by 33 points.  </P> <P> Their 11 points in the fourth quarter was the fewest points in any quarter this  season. Their 79-point total was also a season low.  </P> <P> In games elsewhere, three ex-Clippers totaled 134 points: 60 for Tom Chambers,  40 for Terry Cummings, 34 for Ricky Pierce.  </P> <P> Mr. Sterling, some people have an undeserved reputation. You've earned yours.  </P> <P> ANDREW J. BYRNE, El Monte  </P></p>

			<p>930312 FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: VNU in talks on printing division VNU, the Dutch publishing group, yesterday identified a Dutch printing company, De Boer Boekhoven, as a possible partner for its printing division. The division has been a candidate for full or partial divestment since 1990. The company was forced to concede that it was negotiating with De Boer after a Dutch newspaper reported that VNU was poised to sell a majority stake in the division to the printing company. VNU declined to comment further on the press report or on the negotiations, which it described as being in the early stages. The choice of De Boer comes as a surprise because it is smaller in size than VNU's printing division and because a foreign buyer had been expected to come forward.</p>

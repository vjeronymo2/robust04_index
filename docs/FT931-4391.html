			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Technology: Schools advise on IT Portable computers are the latest toy of many a chief executive. By May this year, they could also be the latest toy of the schoolchild. The Department of Education has allocated Pounds 2.55m for schools in England to discover for themselves the benefits of computing on the move. 'It is the largest scheme for IT in Europe,' says Fred Daly, technical director of the National Council for Educational Technology, which is in charge of the project. Daly believes the scheme could be the start of something big. He points to the US where students starting university are advised by their colleges on which computer to buy so that they can plug into the main computer network and make use of shared college facilities such as laser printers and CD libraries. 'We're just getting evidence that parents in the UK are now buying machines for their children,' says Daly. Schools - both primary and secondary - are being asked to submit proposals for exploiting the equipment, which falls into four categories. Portable computers with all the power of desk-top machines, many with Windows software, would cost about Pounds 1,000 each. With probes or sensors attached the machines could be used for gathering information. And by attaching an electronic tape measure students would be able to use the laptop for measurements outside the classroom. Palm-top machines, costing around Pounds 300 each. Some would be basic organisers, others would have all the functions of full-blown PCs, but with a smaller keyboard. 'They're very suitable indeed for small fingers,' says Daly. Low-cost wordprocessors (Pounds 150 each) which display up to eight lines of text. These would be used for a range of writing activities in the classroom. Graphical calculators, costing Pounds 30-Pounds 40 which could be used in science or maths, for example, for drawing graphs. Daly is confident that the portability of the machines will not encourage students to remove them permanently. In small-scale trials, he says, theft was not a problem. 'If teachers and children get good-quality equipment then they respond,' says Daly.</p>

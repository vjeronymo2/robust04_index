			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar by Jon </F> Snow; Gaydar in Moscow, Snow in London; from the "Channel 4  News" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Snow] Well, I've been talking to Yegor Gaydar, who  until January was Mr. Yeltsin's deputy prime minister. He was  the force behind many of Mr. Yeltsin's early economic reforms  and is still a leading member of the Russian parliament. I  started by asking him what signal he felt the amnesty was giving.    [Gaydar] It's a very, very bad signal for the Russian public  opinion. When people who had committed this type of activities  were being free again for the activity, it is a very serious  signs that the state is weak, that the criminals could proceed  with this type of subversive activities. It is of course very  bad signal for their supporters. I am almost sure that they  will try to organize once again their provocation in Moscow  during the spring, or the autumn of the year 94.    [Snow] Where do you think that will lead?    [Gaydar] I think that it will lead to the intensification of  the social and political conflict, and I could not exclude the  possibilities of a very drastic confrontation like we have seen,  for instance, in October of the year 93, or in August of the  year 91 in Moscow.    [Snow] Therefore do you think that Mr. Yeltsin is responding  correctly to what is happening?    [Gaydar] Well, Mr. Yeltsin's possibilities under  Constitution  are limited. Parliament generally is in its own rights. This  decision does not need the confirmation of the president, or  upper chamber. But of course this solution is very, very  serious threat to the stability of the country and I think that  the president will take it in mind.    [Snow] But then that means that the man that you were  serving  right up until five weeks ago is himself now in a very, very  weak position. He has a parliament that is against him, that is  allowing still more of his enemies out into free circulation,  and the outlook for his own survival must not be good.    [Gaydar] Well, of course, the position of the president are  much stronger than they were for instance in September of the  year 93. Now he has constitutional rights that clarifies very  definitely his possibilities with dealings with internal  policies. Except the amnesty, the rights of Duma to act without  the agreement of the president are rather limited. Of course we  are in a very difficult political situation, but if you compare  for instance with the situation of September of the year 93, I  would not agree with the fact that it's more difficult.    [Snow] If that internal battle does express itself in civil  war, how will the forces be arrayed? How do you see this awful  conflict mapping out?    [Gaydar] Well, to tell you truth, during my two-year  political career, I never answered a question with an if  included in it.    [Snow] Nevertheless you've had to put your neck out a little  today, by saying that you are so concerned about what happened  yesterday that you do foresee serious conflict?    [Gaydar] Well, I mean that the risk that internal political  struggle in Russia will not be held in the limits of the  existing democratic Constitution, from my point of view,  seriously increased after the yesterday solution of the  parliament.    [Snow] And that leaves Mr. Yeltsin, and people like yourself  who believe in reform on one side, and perhaps, Zhirinovskiy and  those people who have been in jail teaming up together?    [Gaydar] I couldn't exclude it absolutely. You have seen  yesterday, the big parliamentary coalition which supported this  solution. This coalition included the forces from Zhirinovskiy  to the communists to the factions that previously were regarded  as the centrists, and of course I could not exclude the  possibilities that this will be the real line of the division in  the political battles in Russia during the year 94-95.    [Snow] What should the West's reaction be? Simply go on  putting more money in where necessary, or should we be taking  some other stance?    [Gaydar] Well, first of all, let us understand very clearly  that it is the Russian internal affairs. And the possibilities  of the West to influence the events are rather limited. It is  first of all our internal battle and we will have to fight it  first of all ourselves.</p>

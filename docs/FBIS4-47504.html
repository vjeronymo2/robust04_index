Nakhmanson under the ``Signal Processing'' </F> rubric; received Dec 20,1991; UDC 621.396.96]    [Abstract] The objective of the work was to analyze the  effect of time scale transformation (TST) of envelopes of  signals reflected off moving targets on detection  characteristics when target velocities and bases of sounding  signals increase. An expression for determining losses of the  probability of correct detection due to not taking into account  the TST coefficient of envelopes of detected signals relative to  the probability of correct detection in the case of optimum  processing is derived. As expected, when TSTs of detected  signals are not taken into account detection characteristics  deteriorate. The derived results make it possible to determine  the relationship between deterioration of moving target  detection characteristics when of detected signals of envelopes  of detected signals are not taken into account during processing  on signal compression factors and target velocities.

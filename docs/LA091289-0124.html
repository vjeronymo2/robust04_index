			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'SECOND SHIFT' EXAMINES WOMEN'S PLIGHT  </P> <P> Working the second shift has a new meaning. No longer is the second shift  personified by a worker -- usually male -- going off to a job in bright  daylight, dinner pail in hand. A worker who will come home after the late news,  usually to "wind down" with TV or a newspaper before turning in at 2 or 3 a.m.  </P> <P> Oh, there are still plenty of those second-shifters, but the notion is being  updated, personified this decade by a worker -- most likely female -- coming  home to a job in the twilight, children and groceries in hand. This worker  often stays busy until after the late news, too, but requires little winding  down and has almost no time for TV or reading; she simply falls into bed beside  her already-sleeping husband when she's had enough or has done all that is  expected of her.  </P> <P> These new second-shifters are today's working wives and mothers, women who work  outside their homes as well as in, women who continue to shoulder most of the  housework, child care, cooking and shopping for their families.  </P> <P> The plight of these women, and their husbands, is detailed in "The Second  Shift, Working Parents and the Evolution at Home," a new book by sociologist  Arlie Hochschild (Viking, New York, $18.95).  </P> <P> "Most women work one shift at the office or factory and a 'second shift' at  home," Hochschild writes. That second shift, she found, amounts to an extra  month of 24-hour days each year or about 15 hours a week that such women -- and  not their husbands -- put in at home.  </P> <P> Besides wearing out the second-shifters -- "these women talked about sleep the  way a hungry person talks about food" -- balancing home, family and job strains  their marriages, robs their children and weighs heavily on their own psyches,  says the author, a sociology professor at UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> Granted, not all women are working the second shift alone. But in Hochschild's  study of 50 mainstream couples interviewed from 1980 to 1988, 20% of the men  shared housework equally, 70% did less than half but more than one-third of the  work, and the remaining 10% did less than one-third of the chores, which  included housework, cooking, gardening, household repairs and such duties as  planning children's birthday parties, sending holiday cards and paying bills.  </P> <P> "Even when couples share more equitably in the work at home, women do  two-thirds of the daily jobs at home, like cooking and cleaning up -- jobs that  fix them into a rigid routine. Most women cook dinner and most men change the  oil in the family car. . . . Women do more child care than men, and men repair  more household appliances. A child needs to be tended daily while the repair of  household appliances can often wait until 'I have time,' " Hochschild writes.  </P> <P> Hochschild's findings bear out those of earlier studies.  </P> <P> John P. Robinson, a University of Maryland researcher, found in a 1985 study of  5,000 men and women that American women with children under 5 do an average of  22.5 hours of housework a week and those with children over 5 do 19.9 hours  weekly. For every two hours women spent on housework, men spent only one,  Robinson's survey indicated. If there's good news, it's that in 1975 the ratio  was 3 to 1.  </P> <P> How men and women spent those hours also coincided with Hochschild's  conclusions. Women were doing 77% of the cooking, down from 87% in a similar  1965 University of Michigan survey, while men did 74% of the yard work and 82%  of the home repairs.  </P> <P> And a 1986 survey, conducted for Johnson Wax, found that women, both employed  and unemployed, did 84% of the housecleaning -- just one of the second-shift  duties listed by Hochschild.  </P> <P> All of these numbers support what Hochschild calls a "stalled revolution,"  caused by rapid changes in women -- in their roles in the family and society,  in their earning power and in their goals -- coupled with slower changes in men  and society.  </P> <P> The revolution continues to idle because of a "cultural veneer that disguises  how painful and confusing" it is, Hochschild said in a phone interview. The  veneer shows the double-shift woman as happy, organized, together and, most of  all, not resentful, she said.  </P> <P> "The main thing I was trying to do was to peel off the veneer," she said.  "Revolutions are messy; revolutions are confusing; revolutions are painful."  </P> <P> This one is no different.  </P></p>

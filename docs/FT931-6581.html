			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Management: When employees rate their superior - Appraising your boss More and more organisations subscribe to the fundamental ideas of performance management. All employees should be given regular feedback on their job performance. And these ratings are often tied - in some loose way  -to promotions, merit pay, sideways moves, or are used more simply for training purposes. Some organisations determine pay increments by these ratings so that salary is not decided by collective bargaining but rather by rated, individual effort. Performance management means true meritocracy. For performance management to work, appraisals need to be seen to be accurate, fair, sensitive and reliable. For most corporations, employees are rated by their bosses on criteria such as time-keeping and contribution to innovation. In effect this means once or twice a year a manager must fill out a rating form on his or her employees. Some managers may have to appraise many subordinates, which leads to certain problems - do the managers know all their staff? How much time does it take to appraise so many? What about problems of favouritism? Innovative organisations have found a simple, radical solution to these problems. In the UK, BP, British Airways and Central Television among others are changing their methods. Employees are not rated by their superiors but by their subordinates. Not top-down but bottom-up. Simple and democratic though it is, the idea puts the fear of God into many managers. What can be gained from this method? The following points have arisen from work in Cathay Pacific Airlines. Subordinates tend to know their superior better than superiors know their subordinates. They see their bosses and know their moods, foibles and preferences, their adequacies, skills, strengths and limitations and things they do and do not like doing. As all subordinates rate their managers statistically, these ratings tend to be more reliable - the more subordinates the better. Instead of the biases of individual managers' ratings, the various ratings of the employees can be converted into a representative view. If the employees have very differing views of their bosses this can present problems, but represents very significant data meriting further investigation. Subordinates' ratings have more impact because it is more unusual to receive ratings from subordinates. It is also surprising to bosses because, despite protestations to the contrary, information often flows down organisations more smoothly and comfortably than it flows up. When it flows up it is qualitatively and quantitatively different. It is this difference that makes it valuable. What are the dangers of converting the appraisal system to a bottom-up approach? Some employees might hesitate to give a frank and fair appraisal of their boss for fear of reprisal. On the other hand, employees may be unused to giving either negative or positive feedback. This can be observed by a 'halo effect' where bland, safe-ratings, half-way up the scale are given. However, an anonymous rating might lead some employees to be vindictive, for example to a boss who is pushing staff to do better. Such a rating would easily be detected however, because it would differ significantly from other ratings. There are also greater costs involved. More forms have to be processed, probably by computer programme, than in the top-down method. But there are now companies such as Pilat of Israel, or Forum (Europe), a US company, which have written the software for this type of analysis. Subordinates also need training on how to rate individuals without falling into some of the well-known traps. Training courses, paperwork and computing software cost money. Do the benefits, costs and risks outweigh the dangers and disadvantages of the bottom-up system? The fact that such innovative companies have persisted with these methods indicates they believe it has benefits. To some extent initial enthusiasm has been tempered, as in the case of BA, but it is recognised that working well, the bottom-up system is efficient and equitable. To put in place the performance management system an organisation needs to trust staff to be honest, fair and constructive. It also needs to pay more than lip service to the idea that communication is a two-way process. More importantly it needs to be willing to act on the ratings of subordinates. This takes some courage and for multinationals, real culture change. The bottom-up approach is the first step in the process of taking staff opinions seriously and allowing staff to influence the organisation. The management toast for the successful go-ahead service-related business is a good one, not 'down the hatch' but 'bottoms up'.

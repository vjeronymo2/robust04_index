			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Observer: Under fire A strong sense of deja vu at the Stock Exchange. Chief executive Peter Rawlins spoke yesterday of the 'very considerable progress' made in the past 12 months on building Taurus (the new settlement system) and developing new market trading mechanisms. This time last year he said much the same. Indeed, it seemed then that Taurus would have been launched by now, and the new market would have been created. To the outside world, not much has changed. Will Rawlins still be there, making optimistic projections, next year? With the Exchange's redevelopment plans seemingly endlessly stalled, it gets increasingly difficult to find people willing to back him. Rawlins has always said that he needs to run fast to keep ahead of the arrows aimed at his back. The pace is getting faster all the time.</p>

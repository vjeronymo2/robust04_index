			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS HIGHER PARKING PENALTIES  </P> <P> Parking illegally in Los Alamitos became more expensive this week when the City  Council approved sharp increases in fines for the most common violations.  </P> <P> Red-curb and 72-hour parking violations will increase from $19 to $32, and  parking in a fire lane will now cost $54 instead of $29.  </P> <P> Most other violations, including parking in front of a fire hydrant, parking  too far from the curb, parking on a sidewalk or in a crosswalk, and parking  within 15 feet of a public driveway, will now cost $32, up from $29.  </P> <P> Police Chief James Guess said a random survey of six other Orange County cities  showed that Los Alamitos had been charging from 10% to 105% less for these  violations than the other cities. For instance, a fire lane violation in Los  Alamitos cost $29, while in Anaheim, Buena Park and Tustin it is $56.  </P> <P> The rates were last increased two years ago, Guess said. The rate increase  approved by the council Monday goes into effect immediately.  </P></p>

They  only talk about the fate of some Israeli soldiers who were taken  prisoner in Lebanese territory. This administration is not  qualified to play a humanitarian role, Sayyid Nasrallah added.    His eminence, however, voiced the party's readiness to  discuss the fate of the Zionist soldiers and Lahdist agents held  by the party with international and humanitarian organizations  and with friendly parties that support our people's right to  resistance in return for the release of all the detainees held  in the Zionist occupation prisons.    Asked about the U.S. plan, which aims to exclude Resolution  425 from the settlement process, Sayyid Nasrallah said: At the  least, the Lebanese Government must withdraw completely from the  negotiations because the United States and Israel are seeking to  deprive the Lebanese authority of this resolution. The U.S.  plan should serve as a warning to the Lebanese authorities and  to all the people of the region. He said: We urge the  political authority in Lebanon and the Lebanese people, as well  as all forces, to realize that the only force that could be  relied on in the liberation process is the force of resistance.  He said that resistance will continue as long as occupation  continues.    In response to a question about the internal situation and  the current crises, Sayyid Nasrallah said: The government is  hatching plots against Lebanon and its people, as well as  against Lebanon's alliance with Syria. Had our people and  masses not been patient in the wake of the 13 September massacre  and had it not been for the caution exercised vis-a-vis the role  played by certain government figures, Lebanon would have  collapsed. There are people working to render Lebanon an easy  prey for the Americans and Israelis.    Sayyid Nasrallah called for the creation of a broad  opposition front based on clear-cut objectives to safeguard and  salvage Lebanon. He said: This government has made enough  mistakes, which has enabled the opposition to increase every day.</p>

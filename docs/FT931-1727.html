			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Police service MR KENNETH Clarke, the home secretary, yesterday announced details of his plans to reform the police service in England and Wales to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. As with other government reforms of public services, local managers - in this case chief constables - will be given much greater freedom to manage. At the same time, the police authorities to which chief constables are accountable will be overhauled to make them 'more powerful and businesslike'. To achieve this latter aim, Mr Clarke proposes to reduce the number of elected representatives on the 43 police authorities from two-thirds of the places to half. The balance will be allocated to local magistrates and Home Office-appointed business executives. The chairman of each police authority will be nominated by the home secretary, rather than being elected by the members. This will certainly make the chairman more powerful. But it will dilute the power of locally-elected representatives over the police service. In effect, the police service will be run by 43 quangos, with weak local control and strong direction - through the appointment of the chairman - from Whitehall. This is a recipe for the sort of divided managerial and public accountability which was responsible for the recent debacle over computerising the London Ambulance Service. The dilution of accountability could also make it harder to improve the effectiveness of policing if it weakens public confidence in the police. That confidence is essential to encourage the flow of information from the public which is needed to prevent crime and catch criminals. Restoring it needs better community relationships and more sensitive policing practices, neither likely to be fostered by a quango largely beholden to the home secretary. Apart from this change in the composition of police authorities, much of the rest of Mr Clarke's programme is commendable. Chief constables are to be freed from Home Office controls over manpower levels and capital expenditure, leaving them to decide what resources are needed according to local preferences and objectives. Performance indicators are to be published for police forces to show how successful each is in solving crime, meeting targets for answering emergency 999 telephone calls and responding to urgent incidents. And a police authority is to be created for London where up till now the police have been accountable only to the home secretary. Mr Clarke has also sensibly drawn back from leaked plans to amalgamate the 43 forces into 25 or fewer. There is no evidence that larger forces are more successful in solving crime. If mergers are necessary for some forces, they should be postponed until plans for the reorganisation of local government by Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission are ready. Meanwhile, the government should think again before weakening the local accountability of police authorities.</p>

Han Sung-ui, a ministry policy planning officer, said,  however, it would be difficult to bring in Russian weapons for  the purpose of beefing up the weaponry of the armed forces.    "If some Russian weapons were introduced, they would be used  in their experimental studies, anti-air training and the study  of Russian operational tactics and doctrine," Han said.    He made the remarks before a group of reporters in  connection  with the recent Russian offer to repay credits Korea extended to  Russia with their weapons.    Han also said the time has come for the country to  positively  promote military cooperation with Russia and Japan mainly  through the exchange of military students and top military  leaders.    The government's basic policy, he said, is to continue to  place emphasis on military cooperation with the United States.    "But, our policy also calls for cooperation with neighborly  countries in the military area as well," Han said.    He said stepped up military cooperation with these countries  will help keep them from furnishing offensive weapons to North  Korea, induce North Korea to reforms and opening, and contribute  to laying a groundwork for stability and peace in Northeast Asia.</p>

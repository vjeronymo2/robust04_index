			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Cominco posts return to profit Cominco, the Canadian metals producer, returned to profit in the first quarter, helped by lower costs at the Trail metallurgical complex in British Columbia, higher output from the Red Dog zinc mine in Alaska, and a weaker Canadian dollar. Net earnings were CDollars 2.3m (USDollars 1.15m), or two cents a share, compared with a loss of CDollars 36.8m, or 47 cents, a year earlier. Revenues dipped to CDollars 261.5m from CDollars 290.7m, but the latest figure includes a CDollars 25.3m gain from the sale of exploration properties. Red Dog's zinc concentrate production was 12 per cent higher than last year. Following numerous technical and geological problems, the mine reached its annualised design capacity in the first three months of this year. Higher zinc and lead output also helped reduce costs at Trail. The company said recent changes in water-rental rates paid to the provincial government would save about CDollars 7m a year.</p>

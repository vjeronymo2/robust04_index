			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Stormclouds gather over Croatia's Sector West AT THE heavily bombarded town of Pakrac in Sector West, one of four United Nations protected areas in Croatia, Serb and Croat farmers last week met to decide how to divide up local vineyards before the planting season. A handful of Serb and Croat families are even returning to the no-man's land running through the town. The UN will provide them with temporary shelters while they rebuild their houses. The dire economic situation in the zone, which is bisected by the strategic Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, has led to moves towards trade between local Croats and the 40,000 Serbs in the south-east pocket of Sector West. Such co-operation would seem to be a positive omen. But the status of Sector West and the other UN protected zones is still uncertain. Last week Zagreb indicated that it would approve a six-week extension of the mandate of the 14,000 UN peacekeepers in Croatia which expires next week. This was despite allegations that the international peace plan for the republic has failed. The extension will allow time for international negotiators to broker a fresh ceasefire between the Croatian and Serbian forces at talks which begin at the UN in New York tomorrow. But before agreeing to a further year of peace-keeping, the Croats are demanding the involvement of Nato troops and a timetable for the restoration of Croat government control over the third of its territory seized by Serb forces in 1991. The biggest bone of contention between Croatia and the UN is the return of 245,000 refugees to Serb-held zones. Skirmishes between Serb and Croat forces rumble on in Sector South, following last month's Croat offensive across UN lines to secure the Maslenica bridge and Peruca dam. But what UN officials most fear is the spread of fighting to Sector West. It is the most tempting target for Croats anxious to gain control over the whole of the republic -  breakaway enclaves included. In a recent nationwide address President Franjo Tudjman placed the motorway at the top of a list of Serb-held targets which his forces intend to recover. The villages in the sector bear testimony to the seven-month Serb-Croat war of 1991. UN commanders say they expect an attack on Sector West, which is divided into a larger Croat-held and a smaller Serb-held area. They point to the build-up of Croatian troops around the zone. But in contrast to the other zones, there are substantial UN forces in Sector West, including the better part of six heavily armed battalions. In Daruvar, the UN military headquarters for Sector West, Lt-Col Guillermo Lopez, the Argentine commander, said: 'We are waiting for an attack. Our order is to defend the UNPA. If it means shooting, that's okay.' Sector West is the UN's showpiece in Croatia, a model of co-operation between the UN and Serb authorities, especially compared with other zones. Croatia and Yugoslavia signed the peace plan for the republic in January 1992. The deal envisaged the disbanding of Serb militias and return of refugees but left the final status of Serb-held territory undetermined. The plan was undermined from the first, when the Serbs refused to disband their armed militia and carried on expelling Croats and other non-Serbs from the UN sectors. The Croats see the agreement as tantamount to cementing Serb territorial gains in the Serbo-Croat war, perhaps forgetting that the plan ended the war and the destruction of the eastern Croatian city of Osijek. Instead Croatia has waged what one UN official described as an 'unprecedentedly vicious campaign from the moment we arrived'. Leaders from Krajina, which covers one-third of Croatia, now claim their failure to comply with the peace plan has been justified by the Croatian offensive. The Croat offensive has certainly reversed the scant progress made thus far by the UN forces. Serb fighters acting on orders from Knin, the centre of Krajina, took back their heavy artillery, earlier placed under UN guard, in all of the zones except for Sector West. Lt-Col. Lopez said: 'They took the tanks and drove about 200 metres but turned around after our commander promised to defend the zone.'</p>

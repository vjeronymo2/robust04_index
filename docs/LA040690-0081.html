			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PANEL QUESTIONS GROWTH CURBS, POSTPONES VOTE ON GENERAL PLAN;  </P> <P> LIMITS: DEVELOPERS WANT TO BUILD 38,000 UNITS IN THE SANTA CLARITA VALLEY,  WHICH THE PROPOSAL WOULD RESTRICT.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County planning commissioners refused -- at least temporarily -- on  Thursday to approve a proposal that would sharply scale back plans to build  38,000 residential units in the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The Regional Planning Commission did not express displeasure with the basic  elements and philosophy of the proposed general plan. But the commissioners did  question how the plan, a broad blueprint for controlling development, would be  applied.  </P> <P> Is the new plan merely a set of recommendations that can be easily changed, the  commissioners asked. Or is the plan a rigid planning document that will kill  proposals for thousands of new dwelling units?  </P> <P> To help answer those questions, commissioners asked the staff of the Department  of Regional Planning to draw up guidelines on how the new general plan would be  used.  </P> <P> The proposed general plan would guide growth for 20 years in the Santa Clarita  Valley, the fastest-growing region in the county for the past four years.  </P> <P> The plan, written by the Department of Regional Planning after several public  hearings, was more than two years in the making. It must later be approved by  the Board of Supervisors. The Regional Planning Commission will take up the  issue again May 14.  </P> <P> The commissioners spent more than two hours discussing the complex and often  confusing issue. "I've discovered through our conversation that I don't really  understand what we're doing," Commissioner Sadie B. Clark said. Central to the  debate over the new general plan are 41 requests by developers to construct  38,000 houses, condominiums and apartments in the area.  </P> <P> The 41 proposals would not be allowed under the existing Santa Clarita Valley  general plan, and developers have asked that their proposals be included in the  new plan.  </P> <P> But officials with the Department of Regional Planning have said roads and  public services could not immediately support such growth. They have instead  recommended that only 12,500 units be allowed under the new plan, which would  uphold a county policy to keep the valley's population under 270,000 by the  year 2010.  </P> <P> Technically, however, developers whose projects are not included in the new  plan could come to the commission later and request amendments to the plan that  would allow their projects to proceed.  </P> <P> The question facing the commissioners, therefore, was whether they would  strictly adhere to the new plan or allow exceptions. There were no clear-cut  answers to the question Thursday. Commissioner Lee Strong said the commission  would still have to consider projects on a case-by-case basis under the new  plan. But the plan is valuable, he said, because it sets the guidelines for  growth.  </P> <P> "We're simply saying these are the rules we're going to play by," Strong said.  </P> <P> Charles Moore, principal deputy county counsel, predicted that, if the new plan  is adopted, developers will not be able to obtain plan amendments as easily as  they have in the past. "It will be a restriction on future amendments," Moore  said.  </P> <P> Officials with the city of Santa Clarita and area community groups have  repeatedly complained that the county routinely let developers amend the plan  at will. In time, the community groups charge, the plan became meaningless  because it was not followed.  </P> <P> Even the commissioners agreed that developers, and not the existing general  plan, had set the pace for growth in the area during the 1980s. Strong said  plan amendments were granted "without any understanding of how that was  affecting the entire Santa Clarita Valley general plan."  </P></p>

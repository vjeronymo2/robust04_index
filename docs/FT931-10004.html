			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: A downturn reaching to the core - David Simon has had a baptism of fire at British Petroleum. Deborah Hargreaves reports on the expected losses BRITISH Petroleum will today report a loss for last year and a sharp cut in its dividend as the company has seen a downturn in all of its main businesses. The decline in core activities, such as refining and marketing, is even worse than can have been imagined by Mr David Simon, chief executive, when he took on the post after the ousting of Mr Bob Horton last June. BP is expected to report a loss of between Pounds 350m and Pounds 400m on a replacement cost basis, which strips out the effects of stock losses and gains, but this figure could be clouded by changes in BP's accounting standards. Investment analysts expect the company to pay a dividend of 2.1p for the final quarter, making a full year pay-out of 10.5p - down from 16.8p in 1991. The company is continuing its programme of severe cost-cutting set in train by Mr Horton and stepped up by Mr Simon last August. Mr Simon is believed to have curtailed capital expenditure in the second half of last year even more than he said he would as the scale of the downturn became clear to him. Mr Nick Clayton, oil analyst at Smith New Court, expects BP to show that it has cut capital spending by Pounds 400m in the second half to leave a total of about Pounds 3.2bn for the full year. 'The company is doing all the right things in cutting costs, but it is getting absolutely no help from the external environment,' said Mr Clayton. Severe over-capacity in the chemicals sector had turned that market into a 'bloodbath'. In addition, over-production by European oil refineries has cut margins to a level of about Dollars 1 (60p) a barrel this week which means no companies are making money. Oil companies need a margin of at least Dollars 3 a barrel to make a profit on refining. Crude oil prices have remained low and this hurts BP which is more exposed to the oil price than rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell. One bright spot for the company is the pound's fall against the dollar, translating into higher revenues from crude oil sales. By the same token, BP's share price has performed strongly in the UK as US analysts have started to buy the stock. A favourable exchange rate and the round of cost-cutting has turned into a slightly higher expected income for BP for the final quarter of last year in spite of the deteriorating fundamentals. Analysts expect fourth quarter income to be between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m on a replacement cost basis which is an improvement on the Pounds 72m earned in the last quarter of 1991. However, few in the City expect the upturn to be sustained until there is a pick-up in the oil market. BP also faces initial costs for part of its restructuring programme, which aims to reduce the workforce by 11 per cent. Redundancy payments could cost the company Pounds 300m in the next six months. Cash is a key element for BP to get under control. Mr Clayton believes last year's results will point to a net outflow of Pounds 850m. Mr Simon cannot let up on his cost-cutting initiative while the fundamentals of his businesses remain so poor.</p>

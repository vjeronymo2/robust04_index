			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] and the National  Party [NP] have criticized the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] for  allowing its registration for the April election to expire. The  NP said in a statement that the IFP was isolating itself, even  from its former partners in the Freedom Alliance.    ANC leader Nelson Mandela said no party had the right to  hijack the election and the election would go ahead as planned.  Referring to a separate Zulu kingdom, he said the ANC would  never allow it.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: New York The main event for the bond market this week is Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee Meeting. The market has convinced itself that the Fed will raise rates by another half point by the year-end. A minority view says it will happen tomorrow. There is still no real evidence of inflation at the consumer level. The worry is rather that the Fed will react to recent rises in producer prices and capacity utilisation, besides the continuing surge in gold and commodity prices. The dollar also remains weak, not helped by last week's bad trade figures. Since a half point rise in the funds and discount rates is already in the price, a Fed move this week might even be seen as positive. But the market has to weather a further set of statistics this week: homes sales today, consumer confidence on Tuesday, durable goods orders on Wednesday and personal income figures on Friday. For close observers of Mr Alan Greenspan's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee last week, the danger signals may not be confined to the US. The Fed chairman talked about the strength of global expansion, implying that inflation pressures may be worldwide in character. For those in the bond market who cannot quite believe inflation's 25-year reign is really over, there will always be something to worry about.</p>

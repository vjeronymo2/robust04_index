			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: More job losses expected at GM MR Robert Stempel, chairman of General Motors, who fell ill from high blood pressure on Tuesday, was released from a Washington hospital yesterday, amid reports of fresh negotiations on job cuts between GM and the United Auto Workers union. The company, trying to return its loss-making North American operations to profit, plans to cut at least 54,000 blue collar jobs over the next few years and has run into strong UAW opposition. However, the Detroit News newspaper reported yesterday that talks had begun between the two sides on new early retirement incentives for blue collar workers. Both GM and the UAW declined to comment. GM's workforce is relatively old and stronger early retirement incentives could significantly aid its job reduction programme. The Detroit News quoted company and union insiders as saying plans included allowing some senior workers to retire early with full pension and health benefits, while others would be offered cash incentives. Such a scheme could also relieve pressure on a Dollars 4bn fund set up by GM under its 1990 three-year wage pact which guarantees laid off workers virtual full pay indefinitely. However, the fund is now much depleted. GM has faced two strikes over job cuts at parts plants in the last two months. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit agency, said yesterday its ratings of GM's debt could be lowered by mid-1993 if there were no clear signs of a turnround in the performance of GM's automotive operations. It said labour problems could intensify ahead of next year's contract talks, adding that if there were further falls in GM's vehicle market share, 'even the sweeping programme of plant closings announced last year may not be adequate to achieve a satisfactory capacity utilisation rate'.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY AIDS PROGRAM BLAMED FOR RISING CASES IN POOR AREAS  </P> <P> The number of people developing AIDS in Los Angeles County has risen twice as  fast in poor and minority communities as in more affluent areas -- an  observation that Los Angeles city AIDS officials attribute to unequal access to  AIDS drugs.  </P> <P> Dave Johnson, the city's AIDS coordinator, studied the annual rates of increase  in AIDS cases between 1986 and 1989 and found that the numbers rose at least  twice as fast in communities such as Inglewood and Compton as in areas such as  Hollywood.  </P> <P> The badly affected districts have two attributes in common, Johnson said. They  have high rates of poverty and poor access to health care services aimed at  delaying the onset of AIDS in people infected with the human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV).  </P> <P> "I refer to this report as the smoking gun," said Johnson, who submitted his  findings Monday to the county's Commission on AIDS. "We really have documented  that the lack of early treatment services coming from the county is resulting  in people getting sick faster."  </P> <P> Johnson wants county health officials to initiate an emergency public awareness  campaign on the importance of early treatment and to make available low-cost  AIDS drugs in all county health facilities, not just in the large medical  centers.  </P> <P> He wants all people who test positive for the AIDS virus at county test sites  to be referred immediately for treatment. He also wants outpatient AIDS and HIV  services at the county medical centers greatly expanded to lessen the wait for  an appointment.  </P></p>

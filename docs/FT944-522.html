			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Treasury aides told off for not mingling Senior Treasury officials have been ticked off by Sir Terry Burns, the permanent secretary, who says they have failed to show enough enthusiasm for finding out about the outside world. In a memo not intended for publication, Sir Terry says that the number of visits to companies this year by top officials has been 'very disappointing'. Only about a third of the officials whom Sir Terry has asked to visit at least one commercial organisation during 1994 have done so. The visits are part of a Treasury scheme to make its employees more aware of business issues. But many of the officials face an uncertain future in the private sector under a programme to cut a quarter of the Treasury's top 100 jobs. The memo was sent this month to about 200 senior staff. It asks people eligible for the department's 'contacts with industry' scheme and who have not been on a visit this year to arrange one as soon as possible. Sir Terry adds: 'I see the scheme as an effective way to exchange ideas and experiences between the Treasury and industry as well as a useful source of training for (Treasury) staff.' Last year about 60 of the 100 officials who were asked to go on at least one visit to industry did so. For this year the scheme was extended to include slightly lower grades, taking the total covered to about 200 people. Morale at the Treasury is poor following a review of its staff structure which requires the department to shed about 25 top jobs by early next year. Officials have until January 23 to apply for voluntary redundancy; after this, selected civil servants may be issued with compulsory redundancy notices. The scheme to promote contacts with industry, devised by Sir Terry two years ago, has been received well by companies. More than 50 leading groups - including GEC, Glaxo, Rolls-Royce and National Westminster Bank - have offered to host visits to help break down barriers between government and industry. The Treasury, explaining the background to the memo, said that many of the officials eligible for the scheme may have been too busy worrying about the other matters preoccupying the department.</p>

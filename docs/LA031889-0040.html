			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: STAYING PUT  </P> <P> Who you gonna call?  </P> <P> Come June 16, the fearsome foursome rides again, as Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray,  Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson don their silver suits in "Ghostbusters II."  Explains Hudson: "We find out there's a lot of bad psycho-reactive energy in  New York City that's threatening the universe, so we have to work very hard  against time to save the world. It's really kind of cute."  </P> <P> Then there's "Leviathan." In the just-released feature, Hudson co-stars with  Peter Weller, Amanda Pays and Richard Crenna as a group of underwater miners  who discover a sunken Russian ship. Unfortunately, this sunken ship comes with  a (surprise!) monster. "It's a thriller," Hudson says, "but there's not a lot  of gore. Really. Not too many heads get ripped off."  </P> <P> In the meantime, the Michigan native is glad not to be moving around for a  while, after a busy work schedule that's had him on the run for the last couple  of years.  </P> <P> "This is the first time in a while I haven't had a job lined up," Hudson  admitted. "In 1987 I did 'Weeds' (filming in San Francisco, New York, North  Carolina and Chicago), then 'Collision Course' (North Carolina and Detroit)  with Jay Leno and Pat Morita.  </P> <P> "Then 'The Wrong Guy' -- that kind of came and went -- with Richard Lewis,  Franklin Ajaye and John Goodman (Wyoming), then 'The Dirty Dozen 4'  (Yugoslavia) and 'Leviathan' (Italy). Then it was back here for 'Ghostbusters  II.' " JANICE ARKATOV  </P></p>

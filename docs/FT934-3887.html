			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Breaking the power duopoly Britain's two large electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, have been under almost perpetual investigation since their privatisation in 1990. Now the time is approaching for Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry's regulator, to decide whether to refer the companies to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. He has promised to announce his decision this month. The suspicion is that the two generators are using their market power to keep prices artificially high. Prices in the pool, the wholesale spot market for electricity, have increased sharply in the past three years. Is the allegation of overcharging valid? According to the generators, their prices are actually too low. The pool price is still not high enough to provide a reasonable return on assets after paying for running costs and overheads. They also argue that their market share has fallen since privatisation as new players have entered the industry. Not only has state-owned Nuclear Electric increased production, but groups with links to the regional electricity companies have built gas-fired power stations. Competition, both actual and potential, puts a cap on the prices they can charge. The generators' defence relies on the assumption that the right benchmark for prices is the 'long-run' cost of producing electricity. This is the price necessary before it would be profitable to build additional generating capacity. Such a price would clearly need to provide for a return on investment and cover overheads, as well as paying for running costs. Massive overcapacity Long-run costs would be a reasonable benchmark but for the fact that there is already massive overcapacity in the industry, as a result of which there will be no need for extra power stations to be built for several years. In a competitive industry with excess capacity, prices would be at or near short-run marginal cost as rivals sought to keep their plants utilised. Only as supply and demand came into balance would prices rise to the long-run level. It was the government's intention that a competitive market should develop when it privatised the generators. Observers hoped that the pool, which involves bidding by generators at half-hourly intervals, would encourage National Power and PowerGen to compete vigorously on price. But, in practice, the two companies have been able to increase their bid prices. This is mainly because they own all the coal-fired stations in England and Wales. These have higher running costs than the nuclear and gas-fired stations owned by competitors and so, under the complex pool system, are the last to be brought on stream as demand mounts. The two generators therefore, in effect, determine the pool price and have no incentive to set it at the short-run marginal cost. Retrograde step Professor Littlechild must scrutinise the detailed financial data to which he has privileged access before deciding whether this amounts to unacceptable overcharging. If he concludes that prices are too high, he has three alternatives: price controls; voluntary disposal of power stations; and an MMC referral. The price control option is the least attractive. Given that the market could eventually become competitive, heavy-handed regulation would be a retrograde step. A better approach would be to tackle National Power's and PowerGen's market power head-on. This would probably mean breaking the companies up, so that a larger number of competing groups owned the coal-fired stations which set pool prices. Ideally, such a break-up would be achieved voluntarily. But given that a break-up rather than simply the sale of a handful of stations would be needed, it is unlikely the generators would agree. That would leave an MMC referral as the likeliest way forward. Such a move would have its own drawbacks. It would be time-consuming and, arguably, premature given that privatisation is only three years old. The sale of the government's remaining 40 per cent stake in the generators would also have to be delayed. But if Prof Littlechild's investigation confirms that prices are too high and he is unable to secure a voluntary break-up, he should not shrink from making a referral.</p>

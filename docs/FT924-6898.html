			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Roh 'abducts' brother-in-law SOUTH KOREA'S presidential election took a bizarre turn yesterday after President Roh Tae-woo allegedly ordered his MP brother-in-law to be briefly 'abducted' to prevent him from joining an opposition party. The affair is the latest intervention by the president to keep the ruling Democratic Liberal party (DLP) from splitting just a month before the election. But the episode could damage the electoral chances of Mr Kim Young-sam, the DLP presidential nominee, as well as the reputation of Mr Roh, who earlier promised to stay neutral in the campaign as part of the country's democratic reforms. Mr Kim Bok-dong, a DLP legislator and the president's in-law, was stopped and abducted by plain-clothes policemen on Tuesday evening as he was driving to his constituency in Taegu, where he was scheduled to announce his defection to the opposition United People's party (UPP), according to an aide to Mr Kim. Mr Kim was brought back to Seoul and a breakfast meeting at the Blue House, the executive mansion, with Mr Roh. The MP later said that he would stay with the DLP, although he acknowledged his interest in joining the UPP. Mr Kim's defection posed a potential threat to the DLP. UPP officials claim Mr Kim's departure would have encouraged as many as 30 other MPs from the ruling party to join the UPP and eliminate the government's parliamentary majority. The UPP was formed this year by Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the Hyundai business group. The Blue House dismissed the incident as 'a family affair'. But the UPP and the main opposition Democratic party (DP) said the action violated the government's pledge of neutrality, with the UPP demanding the resignation of the caretaker cabinet appointed to supervise the presidential election. Members of Mr Roh's majority faction in the DLP have threatened to leave the party because of their dislike of Mr Kim Young-sam, a former opposition leader who became new DLP president this summer. Although the revolt is being staged by his political allies, Mr Roh fears a party split would allow Mr Kim Dae-jung, the DP presidential candidate, to win the election. A small group of conservative MPs left the DLP last month to form the New Korea party. But Mr Roh defused that threat by persuading several prominent Koreans, including the leaders of the Daewoo business group and the Posco steel company, not to accept the NPK's presidential nomination offer.</p>

[Spring] I would characterize them as being very good, even  excellent. I fully agree with my colleague, Russian Minister of  Foreign Affairs Kozyrev, who said that the Declaration on  Principles of Relations Between Ireland and Russia, which was  signed in December of last year in Dublin, has not remained  merely as an expression of our good intentions. Rather, it has  become an important starting point for further specific work.  During the visit by the Irish delegation to Moscow, we concluded  an inter-governmental agreement on avoiding dual taxation  between Russia and Ireland. This is very important for expanding  our business ties, and especially trade. Despite its small size,  in volume of trade with Russia Ireland has surpassed all the  countries of the African continent combined. The trade turnover  has grown most significantly during the past year--by  approximately 7-8 times. Moreover, this has been due to Russian  export.    We are very proud of the achievements of Irish business in  your country. The "Irish House" on the Arbat, the "Duty Free"  stores in the airports and hotels of Moscow and St. Petersburg,  the "Garden Ring" chain of Moscow supermarkets and other joint  Russian-Irish enterprises are operating and have won popularity  among Moscow residents. And, most importantly, Irish businessmen  have an optimistic outlook and are ready to expand their  activity in Russia. Thus, at the end of May the "Eire Rianta"  company, together with its Russian partners, is opening one of  the largest trade centers in the capital, the "Valday Center,"  next to the "Irish House."    [Correspondent] Can you name specific new projects of  economic cooperation between Russia and Ireland within the  framework of inter-state agreements?    [Spring] We are planning to step up our cooperation with  Russia on the program of technical aid by the EC [European  Communities] to the CIS country--TASIS [not further expanded],  in which Irish consultants and experts are already actively  engaged today. First of all, this concerns the development and  modernization of such sectors of the Russian economy as  management, banking, the food sector, municipal management and  the sphere of services.    During our meeting with Russian Vice Prime Minister Yuriy  Yarov, he told of the steps which Russia was taking to enter  GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade], and we offered  our expert assistance. I believe this offer will be accepted.    [Correspondent] What are the political results of your visit  to Moscow?    [Spring] Although our countries are located at opposite ends  of the European continent, the positions of Russia and Ireland  are very close on a broad circle of international problems. In  the course of negotiations with Andrey Kozyrev, with whom, I  might add, I also have good personal relations, we tried to  strengthen the existing mutual understanding. In our opinion,  Russian will play a very important and constructive role in the  future of the European continent and, as I understand from the  remarks of Mr. Kozyrev, Russia intends to do this specifically  through peaceful regulation of conflicts, economic cooperation  and active participation in the work of the CSCE [Council for  Security and Cooperation in Europe], which we, naturally,  support in every way.    [Correspondent] Upon completion of the negotiations in  Moscow, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs thanked Ireland  for its help in finalizing preparation of the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation Between Russia and the European  Union. Of what, specifically, did this help consist?    [Spring] I believe that I will not be committing a sin  against the truth if I say that, in regard to this agreement,  Ireland took a very active position within the framework of the  European Union. We understand its great importance from a  political and economic standpoint, primarily for stability in  Europe. We worked very actively in the Council of Ministers of  the EC and KEC [not further expanded], striving to conclude this  agreement. Now, we are hoping that its signing is just a  question of a few weeks.    Of course, we should not exaggerate the role which little  Ireland is capable of playing in international affairs. But, as  a participant country in the European Union, where the rule of  consensus is in effect during voting, we are sure that our voice  will be heard at the decision-making table, and that we can make  our contribution to achieving general accord and mutual  understanding.    [Correspondent] The chairman of the Russian government,  Viktor Chernomyrdin, recently announced Russia's intention to  enter the European Union. What can you say in this regard as a  representative of a EC participant country?    [Spring] I believe that this is an interesting proposal. At  the present time, a process of consolidation, or strengthening,  is taking place in the European Union. We are hoping that in  January of 1995 there will be an expansion of the EC--it will be  joined by Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Then, a period of  consolidation will inevitably follow once again. Of course, we  are conducting negotiations on acceptance with the countries of  the Vyshegradskiy group and other East European countries. If we  speak of the long-term prospects, then, when the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation with the Russian Federation is  signed, then, based on it and having normal trade relations, we  will be able to increase our ties. And after an appropriate  interval of time we will make the decision as to subsequent  steps.    [Correspondent] Considering the sad experience of the  religious-ethnic conflict in Ulster, do you believe that the  European states will be able to regulate the conflict in Bosnia  and other inter-ethnic conflicts on the continent?    [Spring] I believe that today there are sufficient grounds  to  believe that the partnership between the EC, Russia, the United  SA and the UN will bring the desired peace to the former  Yugoslavia. Ireland was one of the first to support President  Boris Yeltsin's proposal on holding talks on Bosnia at the  highest level with the participation of these four parties. It  is important to sit down at the negotiating table as soon as  possible. When a direct discussion of the problem begins, it  will not be too difficult to reach a general international  position.

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BACKS PUBLISHER OF THE MONITOR  </P> <P> I want to congratulate Tim Waters for his article (Times, May 25) about Rancho  Palos Verdes Mayor Mel Hughes trying to "gag" the publisher of the Monitor,  Enrica Stuart. It is comforting to know that there are reporters around who  will stand up and be counted!  </P> <P> The mayor said that Mrs. Stuart cannot be both a member of the press and a  member of the public. That is nonsense. The mayor conveniently ignores that  Mrs. Stuart wanted to address the council as a resident, not a press person;  she told him so twice -- I heard her.  </P> <P> The Monitor has been expressing the views of many residents on the Peninsula  and has been the only newspaper, so far, with the spunk to take on City Hall.  The paper has been publishing well-researched articles on the issues and  everything is properly documented.  </P> <P> The Monitor's articles have never gone into the personal and private lives of  anyone, they stick to the issues. The fact that the information they print  often differs from the double talk we get in City Hall is what makes it so  valuable to the community.  </P> <P> I agree with Enrica, the mayor is a "bully," particularly with women. I can  vouch for that. I am one of the many victims of his rudeness and put-down.  </P> <P> ROBERTA WATKINS  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

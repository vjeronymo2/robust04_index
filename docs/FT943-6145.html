			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Astec continues to improve with 70% rise to Pounds 7.4m Astec (BSR), the Hong Kong-based and London-listed electronics company, continued to improve its performance with a 70 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and a 10 per cent rise in sales at the interim stage. In the half year to June 24 pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.33m to Pounds 7.37m on turnover up from Pounds 136.4m to Pounds 150.3m. Astec, 48.9 per cent owned by Emerson Electric of the US, claims to be the world's largest supplier of power conversion products. Mr George Tamke, chief executive, said the improvement was achieved by the company's continued aggressive campaign to cut costs and drive down prices. 'We are continuing to move production from high cost to low cost countries and to source more of our products in south-east Asia.' He said 80 per cent of Astec's products were now sourced in south-east Asia, compared with 60 per cent last year. Earnings per share rose from 1.2p to 2.03p. An interim dividend of 0.40p (0.25p) is declared. Mr Tamke is stepping down as chief executive. He will be replaced by Mr David Farr, formerly president of Emerson Electric Asia-Pacific. COMMENT It must be a measure of Mr Tamke's success that news of his departure as chief executive knocked 2p off Astec's share price despite excellent figures. But the shock should be short-lived as his replacement is from the Emerson Electric stable. But how much more can Astec drive down costs and what will be the knock-on effect of continued cuts in personal computer prices? Already Astec is seeking to reduce its dependence on pc makers. Benefits from improved margins should now become incremental but profit forecasts of Pounds 21m for the full year suggest the group will continue to report moderate growth. At 91 1/2 p the shares are trading on a prospective p/e of more than 15 to 16. With the shares close to their 12-month high, the new chief executive has a lot to live up to.</p>

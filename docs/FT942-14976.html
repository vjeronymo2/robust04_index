			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Leading Article: Beauty's riches It is a truth universally acknowledged - and almost as widely resented - that beauty rarely goes unrewarded. But it has taken the ingenuity of academic economists to put a price on what the world's oldest profession always knew. In a paper for the US National Bureau of Economic Research, Messrs Daniel Hamermesh and Jeff Biddle have found that plain people earn 5 to 10 per cent less than people of average looks, while average lookers earn 5 per cent less than those who are good looking. This seems hard on the ugly. Yet those who believe that market forces reflect people's marginal value to society will no doubt say: tough but just. The followers of Friedrich Hayek will, on the other hand, pay a backhanded compliment to the physiologically disadvantaged by declaring that there is no moral merit or demerit attaching to rewards in the labour market. Yet both these camps, which tend to belong on the intellectual right, should be on their guard for a leftish backlash. As long as nobody attempted to quantify the adverse impact of the haphazard distribution of natural endowments, it was possible for us to live with nature's decision to confer fantastic brainpower on Einstein, exceptional tonsils on Pavarotti and a super superstructure on Marilyn Monroe. But with researchers producing extensive physical and economic data from household surveys, we may shortly confront a powerful new interest group seeking redress for physiognomical shortcomings. Mainstream opinion will demand compensation through the tax and benefit system. The left will want subsidies for cosmetic surgery. A suitable euphemism for ugly - homely? - will be sought. There is, of course, a better way. Average-looking people cannot be expected to pay taxes for those of ill mien. A hypothecated tax should therefore be levied on the beautiful in favour of the ugly. The important thing is that beauty must not pay.</p>

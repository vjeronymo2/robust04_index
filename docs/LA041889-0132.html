			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Because of an editing error the founder of the city of Torrance, Jared Sidney  Torrance, was misnamed in an article that appeared Sunday. The article also  incorrectly said that last month regional water quality officials ordered Mobil  Oil Corp. to clean up gasoline contaminating ground water around its Torrance  refinery. The cleanup order was issued in March, 1988.  </P></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Post Office chief to fight on from within The chief executive of the Post Office is determined to go on fighting for greater commercial freedom in spite of this month's shelving of the government's privatisation plans. Mr Bill Cockburn, who took a high profile in the campaign by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to win over Tory MPs to the cause of privatisation, said he did not think there was 'any mileage in grand gestures' such as resignation. Mr Cockburn, whose contract runs until September 1995, said in an interview with the Financial Times that he did not think his credibility had been damaged. He said: 'The case we were making was widely accepted. By putting it in the forefront - although it may have caused a lot of discomfiture politically - I think we were absolutely right to confront the issues and the issues have not gone away.' In spite of his concerns that the Post Office will be left behind by its competitors if current constraints are not eased, Mr Cockburn forecast that the half-year results, expected next month, would 'look very good'. He said, however, this was because the Post Office's profits were 'driven' by the levy it had to pay to the Treasury which, at Pounds 226m, was more than Pounds 40m higher than it had been last year. He is anxious that the fact that mail volume is at its highest yet should not distract attention from the organisation's declining market share. 'A business that just looks at an absolute level of growth and does not look at market share could be heading for real trouble,' he said. He intends to continue pressing the government to let the Post Office forge joint ventures - something ministers have opposed in the past. He regards airlines, technology companies and printing groups as the sort of organisations the Post Office could team up with in this way. He said he was prepared to consider joint ventures in which the Post Office would have a minority stake. He said the Post Office had no plans to raise prices after the government climbdown, although much depended on factors including the level of the Treasury's levy or external finance limit.</p>

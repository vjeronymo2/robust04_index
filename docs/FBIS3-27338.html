RENMIN RIBAO  published a special editorial extending congratulations on this  success. The two highways, whose combined length totaled 4,355  km were only paved with a low grade sand-and-pebble surface.  Since reform and opening up, the Qinghai-Tibet highway has  taken on a new look. In 1984, it was tarred and, in 1992, it  was upgraded when frost-proofing materials were added.    Although old China claimed to have left behind 120,000 to  130,000 km of highways, in fact, only 75,000 km could be used on  the eve of the birth of New China. After more than 40 years of  construction, China (excluding the province of Taiwan) had  highways totaling 1.075 million km as of the end of 1993,  representing an addition of exactly 1 million km.    Before the 1970's, China's highway construction rested  mainly  with the localities and the masses and was became popular.  Between 1951 and 1956, an additional 100,000 km were built and,  between 1956 and 1959, and average 100,000 km were added each  year. One of the reasons for the rapid development was  "popularization." Despite the comparatively low grade, what  mattered was that they could be used.    Since reform and opening up, the principles that "the better  the highway is, the richer one gets" and "the speedier one gets,  the faster one becomes rich" have generally been accepted.  Highway construction has integrated popularization and  upgrading, with the emphasis on the latter. Of the added 1  million km, expressways account for 1,145 km and first and  second grade special highways account for 7,281 km.    Despite the glorious achievements made in China's highway  construction over the past 40 years or more, and particularly  during the past 15 years of reform and opening up, and the fact  that all counties, 96 percent of towns and townships, and 74  percent of administrative villages across the country are  accessible by car, we still have a large gap compared with  developed countries. They are few in number: Each square  kilometer of land only has 11.2 m of highway. They are low in  grade: Second grade highways or higher only account for  approximately 6.2 percent of the total and village highways are  in comparatively poor condition.    What is heartening, however, is that departments in charge  of  highway construction in China have already made plans  accordingly. By the end of this century, the highway mileage  will reach 1.25 million km. The formulation of the grand plan  that four main state expressways and three important sections  which form great routes linking east, west, south, and north is  now being stepped up.</p>

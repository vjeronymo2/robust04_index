			<p>BFN     [Text] The issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM], and specifically the appeal against Greece at  the European Court on 14 June for the embargo against Skopje, is  not on the agenda of the EU [European Union] Summit in Corfu.  This was stated today by Government Spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos, who clarified that from the moment the EU Commission  chose to deal with the issue as a legal one, it has lost its  political character. As a result, he said, it does not relate  to the EU Summit.    Matthew Nimetz, U.S. special envoy on the Skopje issue, will  come to Athens next week for contacts with the foreign  ministry's political leadership.</p>

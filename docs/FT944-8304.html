			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Plague outbreak in China denied Reports of an outbreak of plague in more than 200 cities in China were a 'fabrication', although seven cases of the disease had been detected since June, an official report said. Xinhua news agency, quoting an unnamed health official, said the disease was immediately brought under control after the cases were detected in remote regions of Tibet and Qinghai province, in south-western China. The report said China had an average of 10 cases of plague a year, having tamed the disease in 1955.</p>

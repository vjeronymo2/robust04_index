He specified that the PTCDM  will lead the political movement of the peasant parties in  Bessarabia. "We think the problems of the village are to be  solved first. If the government does not do this, the crisis  will never be overcome," said Batcu, mentioning that his party  will be in opposition to the current governing forces. Tomorrow  at noon, the PTCDM will hold a press conference, in the hall of  the Journalists' Union (House of the Press).</p>

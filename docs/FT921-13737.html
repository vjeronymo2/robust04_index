			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UK Company News: NHL will save Pounds 500,000 via 6 redundancies The troubles of National Home Loans, the loss-making mortgage lender, has taken a new turn. Mr Christopher Slay, an executive director, and the five heads of its management divisions were made redundant with immediate effect, which will save about Pounds 500,000. NHL has been in the doldrums since the summer when a Pounds 200m rescue operation for its banking subsidiary had to be organised by the large clearing banks after local authorities withdrew their deposits. In November it reported a Pounds 47.9m pre-tax loss after bad debt provisions of Pounds 88.7m. The company said the six redundancies were part of moves to slim down the group while talks go ahead with possible buyers. Two German banks have been suggested as likely candidates to take a stake, in a rescue which would probably also require a call on shareholders for new cash.</p>

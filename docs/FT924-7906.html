			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Schering slips 6% to DM210m SCHERING, the German pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, suffered a 6 per cent fall in earnings to DM201m (Dollars 125.60m) for the first nine months of 1992, on turnover up 2 per cent to DM4.89bn. The company blamed the setback on lagging sales of agro-chemicals and exchange rate-induced losses by foreign subsidiaries. Full-year earnings are expected to be slightly higher once gains from the sale of Schering's industrial chemicals, natural substances and electro-plating divisions are included, the company said. The disposals were made in order to concentrate on pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals, the most profitable sectors. While pharmaceuticals sales rose 10 per cent to DM2.9bn, turnover in agro-chemicals dropped 12 per cent to DM1.07bn. Sales of industrial chemicals increased by 2 per cent to DM894m. Schering's overall sales were up 6 per cent in Germany and were 11 per cent higher abroad. Earlier this month Schering concluded the sale of its chemicals and natural substances divisions to the Witco chemicals company of New York for DM660m. It was financed by banks in the US, Germany, the UK and Spain. Last August Schering sold its electro-plating division to the Elf group in France. Mr William Toller, Witco chairman, said the company's competitive position would be greatly strengthened in Europe, where it gained two former Schering production plants in Germany as well as factories in France, Italy, Spain and the UK, in addition to plants in the US and Ecuador.</p>

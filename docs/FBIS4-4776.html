			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been learned that the war capacity of the  ROK forces, including the U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK, is  71 percent of that of North Korea, and a simulated war scenario  has come to a conclusion that in the event North Korea commits a  full- scale southward aggression, ROK forces are capable of  defending themselves for 10 days after the commencement of a war  without additional U.S. troops.    Attending a forum of ruling and opposition party lawmakers  regarding the North Korean nuclear issue held at Academy House  in Suyuri, Seoul, Chong In-kyun, president of the Defense  Research Institute explained countermeasure scenarios against  aggression by North Korea. He said, "However, approximately  350,000-strong reinforcement troops must be quickly deployed  after 10 days. The ROK and the United States have discussed a  deployment plan for immediate deterrence troops using the early  warning system to complement such weaknesses."    President Chong also said, "The immediate deterrent troops  will be Navy and Air Force troops in the initial stage. Four  hundred to 500 ultra-modern Air Force planes can take off from  U.S. bases in Japan to secure air supremacy within three days  after the commencement of the war. A carrier-based naval force  can also be deployed within a week. A substantial reinforcement  of ground forces could take one to two months but the airborne  forces and marine brigade should be deployed sooner."    Regarding the assumed damage in the first 10 days after the  commencement of the war, President Chong estimated: "The  friendly forces will lose 15 percent of the front forces and the  aggressor forces will lose 20 percent of the committed forces."    President Chong added: "Even if North Korea had nuclear  weapons, it would never use them unless it is determined to  cause common destruction. The 1,000-tonnes of biochemical  weapons are more of a threat than nuclear weapons."</p>

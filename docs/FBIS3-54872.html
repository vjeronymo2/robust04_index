The Russian-American summit is known to be scheduled for  January 12-15.    "Now it is difficult to say whether the Moscow summit will  become a tripartite one," a top-ranking official said during his  conversation with Interfax. He explained that much would depend  upon Kravchuk's position. "The reason for his presence in Moscow  is to reconfirm all commitments taken by Ukraine without any  exception," he underlined.    As the diplomat said, it means that Ukraine must confirm its  adherence to the START-1 Treaty and guarantee its joining the  NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] as a non-nuclear state. "Any  reservations or provisions set forth by the Ukrainian parliament  during the ratification of the START-1 treaty cannot be  recognized as acceptable. Neither Russia, nor the United States  would agree to this," said the diplomat.    He reiterated that President Kravchuk himself declared his  intention to submit the START-1 Treaty to the country's new  Supreme Soviet, to be elected March 27, for another  ratification. "Nevertheless, there are many unclear aspects in  Kiev's position. That is why one cannot say for sure that  Kravchuk's visit to Moscow will take place," he indicated.</p>

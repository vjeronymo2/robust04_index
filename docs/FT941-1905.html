			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: GPT wins Pounds 40m Chinese order GPT, the UK-based telecommunications joint venture between GEC and Siemens of Germany, has won a Chinese contract which it claims is the largest ever awarded for the next generation of telecoms transmissions systems. The Pounds 40m order includes equipment for a 1,400km system using 'synchronous digital hierarchy' technology, the state-of-the-art transmission backbone for carriage of high-speed data and voice traffic. GPT beat Alcatel of France and AT&amp;T of the US for the contract. Mr Peter Brown, managing director of GPT's network systems division, said its success was the result of collaboration between Siemens and GPT's UK-based development team in a Pounds 2bn joint development programme for network infrastructure. GPT has a manufacturing joint venture in Shanghai, called Sidtec, but most of the SDH equipment for the contract will be manufactured at the company's Coventry plant. China has less than one phone line per 100 people, but wants to quadruple its number of lines by the year 2000.</p>

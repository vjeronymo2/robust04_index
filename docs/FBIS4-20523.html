			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Edouard Balladur confirmed in  Toulouse yesterday that "there currently are no privatization  plans for Aerospatiale."    Talking to the deputies of the Midi-Pyrenees region within  the framework of the nationwide debate on reorganizing national  and regional authority, which should result in a proposal in the  spring on a reorganization strategy, Mr. Balladur stressed that  it was important "in the future for Aerospatiale to be able to  enter into alliances essential to its development," adding that  "the government will examine this issue in due time."    In addition, the prime minister explained that the 2  February  decision by the government to increase Aerospatiale's capital by  2 billion French francs was indicative of "its willingness" to  support this sector even under "difficult budgetary conditions."  Aerospatiale features on the list of public companies which the  government plans to privatize. However, several members of the  government have repeatedly said that Aerospatiale's  privatization is not planned before 1995.    President Francois Mitterrand himself opposes this  privatization on national interest grounds. Mr. Balladur  remarked that "he did not see any need to keep bringing up this  issue, which is not on the agenda right now and not for some  more years to come."    Speaking in more general terms, he assured that the  government is "very alert" to difficulties encountered by  [defense] companies and that he "vigorously supports corporate  reconversion processes, closely scrutinizes corporate social  plans, and strengthens national companies whenever possible."  Moreover, with regard to the more equal geographic distribution  of public research in France, the prime minister explained that  "it is not a matter of finding new research facilities in the  provinces," but "rather of defining the conditions that would  allow scientists from these regions to successfully take part in  international competition."</p>

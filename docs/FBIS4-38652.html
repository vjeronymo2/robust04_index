			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkish President Suleyman Demirel expressed his  satisfaction with respect to the negotiations held between  Chisinau and Komrat (an administrative center of the  non-recognized Gagauz republic). "We support the negotiating  process the major aim of which is to ensure that our brothers  live in their native land as citizens who respect the  territorial integrity of Moldova, and have a juridical status  which will help the Gagauz to develop," Demirel declared to the  press service of the Moldovan president on the eve of his visit  to Chisinau.    At the same time Demirel underlined that he views the  negotiations between the Gagauz population and the central  administration "as Moldova's internal affair" and hopes that  "all issues related to this problem will be solved by means of a  constructive dialogue." "We hope that the Gagauz people will  become a firm bridge of friendship between Turkey and Moldova,"  he said.    Demirel expressed hope that "the ways for stabilization  which  appeared after the nation-wide elections in Moldova will help to  solve the republic's economic problems." He also reported that  he would be glad to share the Turkish experience with the  Moldovan leaders during his scheduled meetings in Chisinau.</p>

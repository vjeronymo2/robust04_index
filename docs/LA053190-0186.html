			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Court Rules Against Caller I.D.: Bell of Pennsylvania's caller-identification  service is an invasion of privacy and violates the state's wiretap law, a state  court ruled.  </P> <P> The decision reverses an order by the state Public Utility Commission allowing  Bell to offer the service. The service would let people to know who is calling  before they pick up the phone, even if the caller's number is unlisted. Several  other regional phone companies already offer the service.  </P></p>

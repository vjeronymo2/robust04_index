			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Nova, Petronas buy 49% share in pipeline Nova, the Western Canada energy and petroleum group, and Petronas, the state-owned Malaysian oil company, are paying around ADollars 250m (USDollars 183m) for a 49 per cent stake in the Moomba-to-Sydney gas pipeline. The pipeline is being sold by Australia's federal government. Mr Kim Beazley, Australia's finance minister, said yesterday the sale was expected to raise between ADollars 520m and ADollars 540m for the government, and be completed by the end of June. Net proceeds are expected to be just under ADollars 500m. The government announced late last year that it planned to sell a 51 per cent majority interest in the pipeline to Australian Gas Light Company (AGL), the Sydney-based utility which is also the nation's largest gas pipeline company. The government invited tenders for the remaining equity. Under the deal, which has Foreign Investment Review Board approval, Nova will take a 25 per cent interest in the pipeline and Petronas, 24 per cent. In return for giving up vetoes over the sale, the Cooper Basin gas producers will share a ADollars 20m payment - of which about ADollars 10.8m will go to the Adelaide-based Santos group - while AGL gets ADollars 30m for waiving similar rights.</p>

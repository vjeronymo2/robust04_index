			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Conference issues final weapons treaty draft The 39-nation Conference on Disarmament yesterday produced the final draft of a treaty to ban chemical weapons, ending 24 years of talks, AP reports from Geneva. 'This is the end of the substantive talks,' said a senior US negotiator. 'Now it's a question of procedure.' The negotiator, said the first step would be to see which countries would approve the compromise text immediately. Some countries will be able to announce their acceptance when the committee on chemical weapons meets again on August 26. Others will have an opportunity to sign the treaty in a Paris ceremony late this year or early next year. It will go into effect when at least 65 nations have signed. It aims to eliminate chemical weapons over 10 years and provides for inspections to make sure the treaty is observed.</p>

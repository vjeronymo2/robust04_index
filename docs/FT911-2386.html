			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Arts: Giselle - Opera Garnier, Paris One hundred and fifty years ago this summer, Giselle was created on the stage of the old Paris Opera in the rue Le Peletier. To celebrate this anniversary, the Opera Ballet acquired a new production of Giselle last week. I wish I could say that the enterprise is a fitting tribute from the direct heirs of the first performers to this marvel of Romantic art, but - alas - modishness has struck its usual blow, and the staging is fatally flawed. We are faced with a schizophrenic presentation. Patrice Bart and Genia Polyakov have revived a decently traditional text. Patrick Dupond, director of the ballet troupe, has decided that a spurious 'relevance' can be found for a new generation of interpreters by ignoring the essential local colour of the old ballet - that romantic fascination with the mysterious, the quaint, which in this case is the charm of mediaeval Thuringia at vintage time - and providing austere decoration by the Breton painter Loc Le Groumellec. There results an absolute disjunction between authentic choreography which has in-built dramatic references to location and occupation - from vintagers, a game-keeper, a hunt, to a mysterious lake in which Hilarion must drown - and Le Groumellec's decors. There are monochrome back-drops of Brittany (a bleak moor for Giselle's village; a looming, misty assemblage of menhirs and megaliths for the nocturnal forest) which exist without benefit of wings, with a windowless, doorless block as Giselle's cottage, and a skeletal igloo in which Albrecht lodges. Distinguished though these might prove on canvas, they serve merely to deny the dance action, which looks lost and frigid on the Opera stage. Matters are made even worse by costuming from Myriam Teissier and Le Groumellec. The villagers are in dull, utility outfits, though Berthe has a nice line in dark blue beach pyjamas beneath her apron; the Courland hunting party is on its way to a particularly lurid drag ball. Vivid colour, insane shapes, frenetic confections in velvet - one poor fellow wears a hat like a roof, a triple-caped jerkin, and gaiters boasting a myriad silver buttons - reduce the action to hysteria. The wilful inconsistency between text and surroundings brings about a complete breakdown of Giselle as a theatrical experience. Dupond's belief is that the ballet's significance is increased when casts can relate to fresh decorative or emotional ideas - a thesis proposed in Mats Ek's hateful but consistent Swedish Giselle, whose second act was located in a mad-house. This is to ignore the fact that with an old ballet, tradition and continuing thought about the identity of roles and of the text itself will - as we see with Giselle's 150 uninterrupted years in Russia - guarantee interpretative vitality. Giselle has the best history of any classic at the Opera this century, from the 1924 staging for Spessivtseva, to the two beautiful post-war versions by Lifar, with superb decoration by Benois and Carzou, illuminated by such great interpreters as Chauvire, Darsonval, Vyrubova. (And it is significant that Mme Chauvire has dissociated herself from this present production.) It would be some compensation to report that, despite everything else, the Opera casts triumph. But there is nothing to sustain the identity of the ballet when it is so cursorily exposed and so isolated upon the stage, and the dancers, like the drama, appear lost. There is also little refinement to the production. Certain vital moments are ignored or skimped: since the interior of Albrecht's cottage is open for all to see, the hiding of his sword is futile, while the crucial fact of Giselle urging Albrecht to the shelter of the cross on her grave in Act 2 is never made clear. What can be, in a production as sensitive as that at the Kirov, a work of rare beauty which encourages the highest ideals from its interpreters, here becomes a frosty exercise in technique and ill-justified emoting. I saw two casts. Monique Loudieres danced with her customary skill, but her dramatic talents need the support (and the restraints) of a sounder staging to be seen at their best. Her Albrecht was Patrick Dupond, whom I found less than convincing. Florence Clerc made something exquisite of the second act with Charles Jude, since both artists boast a clarity of technique and style, and an emotional precision, that summoned up the spirit of the real Giselle. The supporting dancers were, of course, excellent - the corps of wilis very fine indeed - but the staging places them all at a disadvantage.</p>

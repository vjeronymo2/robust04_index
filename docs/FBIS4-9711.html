			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 30 Mar (EFE) -- Four people were injured  today, two seriously, in downtown Lima during a bomb attack by  the Maoist Shining Path gang against an Entelperu [National  Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru] office that was yet to be  inaugurated.    Sources at the hospital where the victims were treated said  the bomb injured two peddlers, one of whom lost an arm, who were  sleeping on the street near the targeted office. The other two  victims were an Entelperu guard and a pedestrian who lost an  eye. The bomb was in a black bag that had been planted by two  women.    On the night of 28 March, Shining Path members planted  explosives at four banks, three offices of the Telefonica  company, and two Entelperu offices, the latter two companies  were recently purchased by the Spanish Telefonica Internacional  company for $2.002 billion. Shining Path terrorists also  attacked a Navy facility and knocked down three power pylons in  a Lima district causing some short, sporadic blackouts in the  city.</p>

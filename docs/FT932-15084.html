			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Observer: Refurbishing the cabinet What better way to celebrate the start of parliament's new term than to dabble in Westminster's favourite sport of picking the winners and losers in the next reshuffle? Young hopefuls on the Tory backbenches will be ever more effusive in their public praise of the prime minister, ever more rude about rival aspirants. The word is that John Major has yet to decide whether his game plan will be a grand reconstruction, or a cautious refurbishment. But the latter looks more likely. Whatever else the PM does, he has to replace Tristan Garel-Jones at the Foreign Office; he bows out after the Maastricht treaty is ratified. And there is persistent talk that one cabinet minister is ready to step aside. But friends of Douglas Hurd dismiss speculation that their man is a quitter. The foreign secretary will stay at least until mid-1994 before departing for a lucrative writing and business career. Michael Heseltine's aides are equally dismissive of talk that their man has been irreparably damaged by the coal industry debacle and is going to call it a day. Norman Lamont, meanwhile, has told friends he is convinced he's safe at the Treasury until next year. None of that has dented Observer's confidence in presenting a list of front-runners for promotion. Stephen Dorrell at the Treasury is favourite to take the first vacant seat in the cabinet, but Jonathan Aitken at defence, Sir George Young at environment and Roger Freeman at transport are also showing good form. Slightly lower down the scale, David Heathcoat-Amory is a strong candidate for the Garel-Jones job, while Tim Yeo at health and Alastair Burt at social security are among others who have earned promotion. And if Major does opt for cabinet reconstruction, watch out for David Hunt, the Welsh secretary. He deserves grander things than the principality.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Mortgage lender fails NATIONAL Guardian Mort-gage Corporation, a small bank and mortgage lender, went into administration yesterday. It was the latest casualty of the recession and the rising tide of bad debts in the housing market. The bank, which had traded since 1897 and had a loan book of Pounds 10m before bad debt provisions, specialised in second mortgages for homeowners. National Guardian, based at Grayshott, Surrey, has about 1,000 depositors who are owed a total of about Pounds 10m. Most depositors are thought to have claims of less than Pounds 20,000 and will therefore be protected by the Deposit Protection Scheme. Mr Jason Elles and Mr Alan Lovett, of the Reading offices of Ernst &amp; Young, have been appointed joint administrators. Mortgages from National Guardian will not be affected by the administration order and payment should be made in the normal way. The administrators said they hoped to find an investor or partner to buy National Guardian.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Falling demand behind British Steel deficit BRITISH STEEL yesterday reported its worst annual figures since privatisation in 1988 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 149m for the year ended April 3. The final dividend is cut from 1.5p to 1p. The loss, in line with market expectations, compared to a deficit of Pounds 55m a year earlier, and reflected continuing difficult trading conditions. Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Falling demand both in the European Community and elsewhere and excess production capacity resulted in significant price reductions across most product areas.' Turnover fell from Pounds 4.6bn to Pounds 4.3bn, and a trading loss of Pounds 113m (Pounds 98m) was incurred. The latest pre-tax loss was struck after the company's share of associates' losses of Pounds 19m against Pounds 6m profits last time - and net interest. The attributable deficit was Pounds 130m (Pounds 34m) and losses per share widened from 1.7p to 6.5p. UK demand for British Steel's main finished products fell 4 per cent to 8.2m tonnes. Total sales volume slipped from 12.2m tonnes to 11.9m, reflecting an 8 per cent fall in UK deliveries and a 4 per cent rise in export volume. Explaining the dividend decision, Mr Moffat said the board had decided in November not to pay an interim dividend, but indicated that in the absence of unforeseen circumstances a final of 1p would be paid. Subsequently, said Mr Moffat, steel prices throughout Europe fell even further, but this had recently started to be reversed. 'Prices for steel products are beginning to move towards more realistic levels, although they still remain some 10-25 per cent below mid-1989.' Mr Moffat said that, overall, short-term prospects had improved but the situation remained 'fragile.' Sustained recovery was heavily dependent on the proposed restructuring of the European steel industry, and particularly on effective controls by the EC on the continued availability of state aid for some producers. With these issues still to be resolved, the recommended 1p final compares with the previous year's total of 4.5p. However, Mr Moffat warned that the reinstatement of dividend payments to more normal levels would require 'a sustained recovery in the profitability of the company as well as the continued maintenance of a sound financial position.' Looking ahead, British Steel said economic activity in continental Europe, particularly Germany, had declined in the past year and many countries were now in recession. Recovery in the UK appeared to be under way, but was likely to be slow, and the advantages of devaluation would be restricted by the weak state of most export markets. In the UK, steel-using sectors were likely to recover at different rates. Output in the automotive sector was expected to recover due to a combination of growing demand and the export potential of new UK producers. But construction output was expected to decline further this year. Overall UK steel consumption is expected to lag behind a general recovery in the UK economy. British Steel's capital expenditure dropped from Pounds 255m in 1991-92 to Pounds 197m, and numbers employed at year-end fell from 49,500 to 42,100. However, some 3,300 of this reduction was accounted for by the creation of Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer into which British Steel Stainless was merged last November.</p>

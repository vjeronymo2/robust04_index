			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. M. Chernov, Samar State Aerospace University, </F> Russia; UDC 681.325.5]    [Abstract] This article examines discrete orthogonal  transforms in Galua fields implemented without multiplications.  Algorithms in which multiplication is replaced by register  shifts are found to be more efficient. Discrete orthogonal  transforms are examined in finite fields with representation of  the input in nontraditional notation systems (e.g., systems with  an irrational base, Fibonacci codes, ``golden'' proportions, and  their generalizations) whose basis is generated by a linear  recurrent sequence.

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Administrators to fight Pounds 8m Nadir share transfer deal THE ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck International are to appear in court early next month to fight for cancellation of a transfer of Pounds 8m in shares from a subsidiary in the group to Mr Asil Nadir. Lawyers for the administrators will appear in the Isle of Man courts on July 6 to dispute the transfer of the shares held by Voyager, a Manx-registered company, which took place four days before PPI entered administration in October 1990. They will argue that the transfer of shares in A N Graphics, a Turkish printing company, was invalid because it took place at an illegally constituted board meeting held without notifying all the directors. The details emerged as the Isle of Man government prepared to acquire the assets of another Manx company owned personally by Mr Asil Nadir. Hillgate Limited, registered in the Isle of Man since 1973, is due to be struck off the island's companies' register for not filing annual returns since 1990. Under the island's company law, assets of companies struck off become the property of the Manx treasury. Mr Nadir is listed as Hillgate's major shareholder. Hillgate's assets include a Jersey-registered company, Restro, used by Mr Nadir for his dealings in Polly Peck group shares. Both are his personal companies and not part of Polly Peck. Mr Neil Cooper, Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy, said yesterday: 'We considered getting involved (with Hillgate) but on a risk-reward basis it did not seem the right way to proceed.' The Manx company was set up originally as part of a legal capital gains tax avoidance scheme. Such schemes were popular at the time particularly for takeovers and flotations. By exchanging UK company shares for shares in an offshore company in a 'paper-for-paper' transaction capital gains tax was avoided when the shares were sold to the public. Hillgate was first incorporated as Wearwell Holdings, then changed its name in 1980. In December 1990 three Manx nominee directors resigned and since then the company has been without directors and has filed no annual returns. As well as Mr Nadir's holding of 800 B shares, there is a block of 97 A shares held by a nominee company. It has not been possible to identify the beneficial owner of these shares. Meanwhile, Mr Christopher Morris, administrator to Polly Peck at Touche Ross, said yesterday that he had been in touch with the Conservative party concerning Mr Nadir's political donations. He said he will be seeking advice on the issue from the company's creditors' committee.</p>

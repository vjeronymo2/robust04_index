			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not just a case of economics Sir, David Starkie is incorrect in ascribing inadequate economic benefits to the CrossRail scheme (Letters: 'CrossRail would be folly', May 18). Few, if any, of London's great tube schemes ever showed an adequate rate of return on the capital invested in them but they made and continue to make an indispensable contribution to the life and economy of London. So it will be with CrossRail. London is a major block to through travel. It takes as long to go from Ilford to Paddington, a modest 11 miles, as it does from Paddington to Oxford which is five times further. As the commercial functions of London have dispersed to suburbs and the south-east, the need for better through services and orbital routes has increased. CrossRail is just one of the schemes that should be provided. Unfortunately the government prefers to pour money into road schemes of dubious value in the countryside rather than invest in the network of rail services London needs to maintain its position as a world-class capital. Your editorial ('CrossRail debacle', May 12) was right about the need for CrossRail. Roger Backhouse, 112 Thorold Road, Ilford, Essex IG1 4EY</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALSO WORTH WATCHING  </P> <P> King Kong's favorite leading lady, Fay Wray, plays an ex-movie star in "Perry  Mason" (9:05 a.m. Thursday on TBS).  </P> <P> James Woods, now not exactly a stranger to misfit roles, is a freeway sniper on  "Police Story" (midnight Monday on KCAL), in an episode from the mid-U70s.  </P> <P> Before there was "Magnum, P.I.," there was Lance White for Tom Selleck. In one  of the best-ever "Rockford Files" (noon Saturday on KCOP), three very different  private eyes-the very human Jim Rockford, the practically perfect Lance White  and the nerdy Fred Beamer-try to solve a murder at a private investigators'  convention.  </P> <P> Surfing footage from the documentary "The Endless Summer" was used in the  "Batman" episode "Surf's Up! Joker's Under!S (2:30 p.m. Sunday on KTTV), in  which the archvillain tries to become world surfing champ.  </P> <P> "Mork Returns" to Milwaukee on "Happy Days" (9 a.m. Monday on KTLA), where he  got his start on Earth. Richie shows him the value of human relationships by  recalling moments with his family and friends.  </P> <P> Hoss tries to prove that he did indeed see a "little green feller" at the  Ponderosa on "Hoss and the Leprechauns," a fitting episode of "Bonanza" (noon  Friday on KTLA) to be aired the day before St. Patrick's Day.  </P> <P> Richie and Fonzie are the reluctant grooms in "Shotgun Wedding," which starts  on "Happy Days" (9 a.m. Thursday on KTLA) and ends on "Laverne &amp; Shirley"  immediately afterward. The pair try to get out of having to marry a couple of  backwoods beauties by claiming that they are already spoken for-by Laverne De  Fazio and Shirley Feeney.  </P> <P> "Phyllis Whips Inflation" -- and picked up a best-supporting-actress Emmy for  it-on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" (9:30 p.m. Friday on KDOC). It was Cloris  Leachman's last regular appearance on the show (she would go on to her own  series). The plot has Phyllis forced to find work when Lars takes away her  credit cards.  </P> <P> In the re-edited pilot of "The Bob Newhart Show" (8 p.m. Saturday on KDOC),  Emily and Bob want to adopt a child.  </P></p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / British troops come under shellfire for first time in Bosnia British troops stationed in Tomislavgrad, Bosnia, came under shellfire for the first time, presumably from Serbian guns, for about an hour and a half yesterday afternoon. An officer with the British unit, one of three units of Royal Engineers responsible for maintaining a critical relief supply road over the mountains to the central Bosnian town of Vitez, said about 140 shells fell in the immediate vicinity of their base, which lies in a factory and adjacent school. No one was injured, but vehicles and equipment were damaged. One officer said: 'We've expected this for a long time. We don't know if we were the actual target because there are Croat gun positions right behind the grounds.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Zou Jiahua Issued Instruction on More </F> Quickly Expanding the Hengyang Railway Station"]    [Text] Up to yesterday, the number of deaths in the  Hengyang Railway Station tragedy on 15 February increased to 52,  three more than the 49 deaths reported by MING PAO a few days  ago. The three seriously wounded people were carried by their  friends onto a train bound for Guangzhou and died during the  journey.    The 15 February accident was the most serious railway  accident since the founding of the PRC.    Shortly after the accident occurred, Zhu Rongji and Zou  Jiahua, two vice premiers of the State Council, separately  inspected the area where the accident occurred. Zou Jiahua went  to the top floor of Hengyang's Jindu Hotel to look down at the  railway station. After that, he told the authorities concerned  to draw a serious lesson from the accident and properly arrange  the spring passenger transportation every year. He also  instructed Hengyang to more quickly complete the project of  transforming and expanding the railway station.    After the accident, the investigation group formed by the  city party committee, the city government, the railway station,  and the public utilities department reached announced their  initial conclusions, pointing out that the railway station's  backward facilities and poor management caused the tragedy. The  head of the transportation department concerned was detained and  may be brought to justice. The railway station's party  secretary, Zhu, and director, Yin, were both dismissed from  office. Two to three years ago, the Guangzhou Railway Group  Corporation formulated a plan for transforming the Hengyang  Railway Station. In order to protect economic returns, however,  the city party committee, the city government, and the railway  station kept passing the buck, and the project made very slow  progress. The city party committee and the city government  leaders, therefore, had to bear certain responsibility for the  tragedy.    The Hengyang Railway Station was built in the 1950's and  1960's, and the facilities were rather substantial when it was  completed. Along with the development of the mainland's reforms  and opening up and after the economic changes of the past 30 to  40 years, however, the railway station became rather outdated.  Over the last few years, a large number of migrant rural  laborers moved south to seek jobs, and, around the Chinese New  Year, over 1 million migrant laborers returned home to hold  family reunions and celebrate the festival. This added huge  passenger transportation pressure to the Hengyang Railway  Station. Therefore, expanding the railway station brooks no  delay.    During last year's Spring Festival, this reporter visited  the  Hengyang Railway Station and found that, in addition to the  backward facilities, the railway station was also poorly managed  and was in a chaotic condition. It was very difficult for  passengers to buy tickets, and many passengers had to wait one  or two days standing in line before they could get any. The  public security officers and military troops responsible for  maintaining order often took bribes and bought tickets for  bribe-givers by jumping the line. Last year, this reporter  witnessed a fight between two groups of security guards and  policemen.    Reportedly, there was also an economic factor behind the  authorities' unwillingness to immediately expand the railway  station -- they wanted to earn more money from the crowds of  migrant laborers. Because a large number of migrant laborers  were stranded in the railway station before and after the  Chinese New Year, they had to get accommodation and food and  might go shopping, and all such consumption would bring  substantial income to the railway station.    After the accident occurred, the authorities sent more  people  to work in the railway station, and this shortened the waiting  period and improved the order, but the railway station's  economic returns decreased.    Some local residents told this reporter that, although the  tragedy caused heavy casualties and this was unfortunate, the  accident also had a positive effect, because the authorities  learned a bloody lesson and decided to speed up the railway  station's expansion.</p>

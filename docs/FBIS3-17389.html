			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] A trial specimen of Ukraine's first  monetary unit -- the hryvna -- has been printed in Kiev. This  was done during the presentation of a bank note factory.  Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, Acting Prime Minister  Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, and Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the  National Bank of Ukraine, took part in the opening ceremony.  Our correspondent Ihor Kulinichenko reports on this event.    [Kulinichenko] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk pushed  the  button and the unit started functioning. And here is the first  product, symbolic product, so to say, coming out [word  indistinct] -- Ukraine' first monetary unit.    [Announcer] During his conversation with journalists Leonid  Kravchuk emphasized the expediency of issuing [Ukraine's] own  national monetary unit.    [Begin Kravchuk recording] The state that has its own money,  its own currency, is an independent and sovereign state. This  is why any talk to the effect that we will be independent while  we have some other currency in our state is a mere deception of  the people. You do not need to go far, here is the National Bank  chairman, ask him: Can a state be independent when it has some  other currency? [passage indistinct]    Where is Yukhym Leonidovych Zvyahilskyy? I am here with the  journalists, and when I say that the country's own currency is  the attribute of statehood, they tell me that I am a  nationalist. Maybe, this is because I am from a different  region. I have already replied to other people, including the  residents of Moscow. Because, if other another currency  [circulates in Ukraine], our bank and Viktor Andriyovych will  become a subsidiary. And the Russian Central Bank is, by the  way, setting such a condition. And this is normal. One should  not blame the Russian bank. This is a normal condition. If you  agree to use the ruble you have to become a subsidiary.    And then the deputies, elected by the people, will assemble  at the Supreme Council and they will have to make decisions on  [Ukraine's] own money, on credit policy, on taxes. And they  will be told that this does not [word indistinct] with the  interests of the Russian National Bank. This is normal.    This is why, under these conditions, the people will be  allowed to elect deputies, but the deputies will not be able to  make any [word indistinct].    This is why we all here -- myself, the prime minister, the  National Bank chairman, and all those present, came here so as  to emphasize that this is an attribute of our independence. And  any talk to the effect that there can be something else is  pretense and a deception of the people. I would not like to  arrest, as they say, attention on this very aspect, but money,  the financial and banking systems are the [word indistinct] of  such a sign. When reforms [words indistinct] we are setting up  Ukraine's own banking system. [end recording]    [Announcer] Ihor Kulinichenko told you about the  commissioning of the state bank note factory whose presentation  was attended by the president of Ukraine and other high-ranking  government officials and statesmen.</p>

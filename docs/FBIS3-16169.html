In the opinion of scientists from the  All-Russian Research Institute of the Economic Management of  Agriculture, Russia is quite ready for not only stopping grain  imports by the state, but also for increasing the exports of its  own grain.    Grain imports began in the 60's after the agricultural  experiments of Nikita Khrushchev, which ended in failure.  Between 1961 and 1965 Russia accounted for about two million  tonnes of grain a year out of the grain imported for all the  USSR republics. Consequently, the average annual per capita  level was 16 kg. However, in 1992 Russia imported 28 million  tonnes, or 188 kg per capita. In 1992, the best of the past  several years, grain imports accounted for 32 per cent of the  domestic grain output.    American farmers were the first to profit from massive  Russian grain imports: They got a stable market for their grain,  supported by the administration, for decades to come. In  addition, grain deliveries from the U.S. were usually made on  condition that Russia would pay for the freight of American  ships, which transported the grain. U.S. credits for Russia's  grain purchases, described as "aid", had to be returned with  market interest rates. A considerable part of them were  short-term credits. In short, Russia's grain imports were an  expensive undertaking for it.    The question arose: Are grain imports really so necessary  for  Russia? Statistical data show that the amount of grain per  capita of the population was continually increasing over the  past decade. Last year's per capita level of 538 kg was far  greater than 342 kg in the years, when Russia was exporting and  not importing grain. Analysing the problem, scientists from the  research institute of the economic management of agriculture  came to the conclusion that there were two reasons for the  growth of grain imports. The most important of them is that the  growth of the production and consumption of livestock-breeding  products, registered during the past several years, was achieved  through the growth of the use of grain as fodder for the stock  and the poultry. Grain imports helped to make up for the  wasteful use of part of the domestic grain output for fodder  purposes. A shortage of high-quality wheat was the second  reason for massive grain imports.    In the opinion of Russian scientists, both factors can be  eliminated in the near future with the help of corresponding  corrections in the economic policy. A considerable,  scientifically substantiated reduction of the consumption of  fodder grain will become a real way of overcoming grain  shortages.    However, the termination of grain imports by the state does  not mean that commercial structures will also stop buying grain  abroad.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Lithuanian Government has approved a proposal by  the Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Europe [as heard  -- EBRD] to carry out in Lithuania a program aimed at improving  the financial and economic state of Lithuania's industrial  enterprises. The program provides for the appropriation of up to  2 million dollars to five state companies to make them  competitive.    The Lithuanian Economics Ministry says the program has come  too late and should have been put into effect about a year and a  half ago. The main reason for this is the lack of medium-sized  and still opportune enterprises, because the Reconstruction Bank  does not want to finance very large companies.</p>

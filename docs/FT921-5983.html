			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Books: Abduction by swans - FT children's book of the month SWAN SISTER by Annie Dalton Methuen Pounds 8.99, 122 pages WRITERS of fantasy for children often lay down their themes with all the tact and delicacy of a constable in heavy boots. Children seem easy prey, being young and gullible; the silliest notions can get past them if there is a limitless cast of witches, fairies and boggle-eyed monsters. In fact, the reverse is true. Children are remarkably astute judges of the limits of truth and falsehood, and the best children's fantasy, whether written by the likes of an Alan Garner, a Philippa Pearce or a CS Lewis, is always firmly rooted in a recognisable moral universe and takes as its starting point the real world in which we all live. The fantasy may hold up a weird, distorting mirror to our reality; but without that reality, the writing will remain rootless, ineffectual and, ultimately, boring. Annie Dalton is a prolific author of fantasy for younger and older children  -an earlier book, Night Maze, was short-listed for the 1989 Carnegie Medal  -and her new novel, Swan Sister, explores profound themes in a pleasingly unpretentious style. Ellen and her mother move from London to the east Suffolk coast in order to realise a dream that her mother has long cherished: that of creating a perfect home in the secret, magical place where she herself had lived as a child. It would be a return to paradise. Unfortunately, her daughter Ellen feels unhappy from the start. She senses that this is not so much paradise as 'the shining edge of the world'. Would it not be all too easy to fall over that edge and be lost forever? A number of factors contribute to her growing sense of unease: the American jets that scream through the summer sky; the power station that casts its shadow over the little estuary town nearby; and, worst of all, the strange call of the wild swans - 'Swa-swa siss swa siss' - that seems to come bearing warning messages. A new baby is born, Lily, and Ellen's mother prepares a room for her in their cottage that seems to resemble a magic grove. But is it a friendly place? Ellen thinks not. The new baby behaves oddly; she is curiously self-absorbed and, when she grows, seems unable - or perhaps unwilling - to communicate with other people. And when the baby is christened, the swans fly over the church, calling, calling, and Ellen becomes increasingly convinced that this odd child belongs in some way to them and not to the family. She is a child of nature. Matters are made much worse by the gradual breakdown of her parents' marriage, and Ellen's discovery that her father was partially responsible for the creation of the power station that is contributing to the destruction of the environment. On the night of the child's third birthday, the swans abduct Lily. They had warned Ellen this would happen, but she had never dared to tell. After all, who would have believed her? In the company of her only friend, Misha, she borrows a boat from Marsh Mary, a woman regarded by the locals as crazed because she cares for - and talks to - nothing but birds and animals. Ellen and Misha make many trips into the marshes, searching, searching for her lost sister. They even hear the sound of Lily's voice calling to them - but the swans tell Ellen that the time is not ripe for her rescue. That does not happen until the day that Ellen's father returns from London and the family is reconciled. Why do the swans abduct the child in the first place? To compensate for the loss of their own children? Or is it because Lily is a star-child who, belonging to the visible and invisible world, understands their language? Or could it be a way of punishing the human beings for desecrating their natural habitat? All these possibilities are explored. The novel moves with remarkable ease and sureness from the world of human pain and unhappiness to that of the supernatural. The characters of Ellen and her mother are utterly convincing; the language is that of real human beings in pained conflict with each other; their motives are explored with great tact and delicacy.</p>

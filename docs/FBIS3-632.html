			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday, there was anger and exasperation among  the members of the High Council of the Republic-Transitional  Parliament [HCR-PT]. This was caused by Article 55 of the Draft  Constitutional Act on the composition and appointment of the  HCR-PCT Executive Committee. The councillors had very divergent  views on this point, for which the stakes seem to be very high.  Oscar Kambamba has a report on this session:    [Begin Kambamba recording] Yesterday's plenary session was  interspersed with moments of exasperation among the members of  the two political forces at the People's Palace during the  marathon session, which lasted from 1700 [1800 GMT] to 2300.  The Political Forces of the Conclave [FPC] and the USORAS  [expansion unknown] were completely at odds concerning Article  55 of the Draft Constitutional Act, which concerns the  appointment and composition of the Executive Committee.  Although the two parties agreed on the composition of the  committee -- a chairman, two first vice chairmen, two second  vice chairmen, two first secretaries-rapporteurs, and two second  secretaries-rapporteurs -- the same cannot be said for who would  fill the posts. What really divided the two sides was deciding  on the procedure for appointing the HCR-PT chairman.    The FPC feels that the HCR-PT already has a legitimate,  [word  indistinct] chairman. As Mr. Mutumbo said, to think otherwise  would imply blackmail and, as parliamentary practice demands,  only a vote could settle the differences. Mr. Kamanda, the  co-chairman from USORAS, was apparently exasperated by a  violation of the protocol agreement, in view of the fact that  the HCR-PT chairman is appointed from this institution, and if  this aspect is not taken into account, it could lead to a  bothersome precedent and create unstable conditions for  continuing the talks. In other words, the USORAS members, who  rejected a vote on the issue, were calling for a consensus.    Speeches upon speeches were made, but none of the proposals  put forward were adopted. Thus, around 2300, the two opposing  sides, without reaching an agreement, adjourned the session to  sleep on the issue until today. Prior to this, it took two  hours of discussion to amend and adopt Article 90 on the  inviolability of the head of state's person, who shall not be  penally responsible for acts undertaken in the exercise of his  duties, except in case of high treason. The same article also  provides for the responsibilities of the prime minister and the  other members of government. In all, there are only three  articles left for deliberation. Apart from Article 55, there is  Article 76 -- which provides for the election of the prime  minister by the CNS [expansion unknown] for USORAS and by the  HCR-PT for the FPC -- and, finally Article 116, which covers the  transitional and final provisions. Agreement on these three  articles could divide the participants and possibly jeopardize  everything if they do not relax their stands. [end recording]</p>

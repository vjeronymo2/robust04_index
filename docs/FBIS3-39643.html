			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Official opposition leader Miltiadhis Evert met  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou at 1400 today in the Maximos  Palace. Afterward, Evert told correspondents that he and the  prime minister discussed the sphere of our national issues,  which are intense these days. Evert said he could not detail  the discussion. He said: I will say only that New Democracy, as  a national party, will keep the national front firm. The  official opposition leader noted that he was not satisfied with  all the answers and thoughts raised in his talks with the prime  minister.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos stressed: The Greek  Government will not brief foreign governments on its decision  [concerning relations with Skopje], which was made within the  framework of national sovereignty and with great wisdom. But  the spokesman did say that Foreign Ministry Secretary General  Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis will brief the permanent members  of the UN Security Council. Venizelos made it clear that  humanitarian aid is excluded from the trade blockade of Skopje.  The blockade includes shipments that are in transit through  Greece unless such transport involves items from diplomatic,  United Nations, and CSCE missions on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]    Greece warns that stronger measures will be implemented  unless Skopje's intransigence is bent. Greece is also preparing  to refute--on a political and legal level--the objections by the  European partners and the United States. The main axis of the  Greek argument will be that Greece follows international law.  Reference will also be made to the articles of the European  Unification Treaty that give member countries the right to  invoke action for reasons of particular national interest.    Reportedly, there is already a report at the prime  minister's  office and at Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' office. It  was prepared by the legal department of the Foreign Ministry and  includes the arguments the Greek representatives will put  forward abroad and with international organizations.</p>

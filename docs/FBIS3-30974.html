			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The TV "Wiadomosci" and "Panorama" programs carried  reports yesterday on the signing of an accord between the board  of the Jastrzebie Coal Company [JSW] and the Trade Union of  Miners of Poland [ZZGwP], which was to end the strike at the  seven mines of this company. Unfortunately, the miners at these  mines are still on strike.    Meanwhile, as Romuald Boszko, press spokesman of the protest  staff at the JSW, has reported, the signing of this accord has  no significance with regard to the course of the strike. The  strike is directed, the press spokesman stressed, by the protest  staff, the composition of which does not include the ZZGwP. The  protest staff, on the other hand, does include three other trade  unions: Kontra, Solidarity, and Solidarity '80. The dispatcher  at the State Hard Coal Agency in Katowice has confirmed that the  work forces have not commenced work at any of the JSW mines.    Beginning at 1500 today, additional talks will take place  with the protesting miners at the provisional headquarters of  the JSW. As we discovered at the board of the company, a  consensus has been reached on 95 percent of the proposals.  There is still a lack of accord with regard to compensation for  the time spent on strike.</p>

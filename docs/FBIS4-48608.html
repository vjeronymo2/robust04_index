			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tyrone August] </F>   [Text] The integration of 30,000 soldiers, including  Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing;  (MK]) and Azanian People's Liberation Army [APLA] members, into  the SA National Defence Force [SANDF] is a key priority of  Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise During the next few years.    The integration will cost 1 billion rand for one year alone.  "In order to integrate them successfully, we've got to train  them and bring them up to equal standard," Modise said.    "This is another way of affirmative action, giving those who  did not have the opportunity to catch up with those who had all  the opportunities."    In an interview yesterday, Modise said the British army  would  play a role in overseeing their training and would also  participate in adjudicating the integration.    The integration of MK, APLA and other former homelands  armies  would inflate the size of the SANDF initially, but the standing  force would finally consist of between 67,000 and 70,000  soldiers.    "Naturally people will be very concerned about what happens  to those who are going to be rationalised," he said.    "We are looking at the creation of a service brigade."    Those who will lose their places in the SANDF will be given  vocational training to prepare them for civilian life.    Modise said the SANDF would no longer play a policing role  inside the country once stability was restored. He said the  police, assisted by the community, should be able to cope.    He also ruled out the possibility of a military role outside  the country. "We have our own problems," he said. "I don't  think we are ready for that role.    "We are still in the process of reorganising our army and  building it."    Regarding speculation about the SANDF intervening in Rwanda,  he said: "We have not been approached and, even if we are  approached, we won't accept.    "You cannot play a peacekeeping role where there is  conflict.    "The conflicting parties must first agree and only then can  a  peace-keeping role be played."</p>

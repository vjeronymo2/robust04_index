The meeting, which started yesterday, discussed the  relationship between the administrative and legislative organs  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the method of  forming the first regional government and the method and time  for the election of the administrative commissioner and how to  form the administrative council and its functions and the  establishment of a consultative committee after 1997.    Leader of the group said after the meeting that as the  British side has shut the doors to talks, the preparatory  committee will do solid work and start a new "stove" according  to the guidelines of the Basic Law and ensure a smooth  transition of power and the long-term stability and prosperity  of Hong Kong.    The committee members urged the Chinese Government to  publish  as soon as possible the truth of the Sino-British talks and  clarify the facts distorted by the white paper published by the  British side on Feb. 24.    They said that it was merely an illusion for the British  Hong  Kong authorities to attempt to carry the framework it has  arranged over July 1, 1997 deadline.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Clearing the way for a rally in gilts - Capital &amp; Credit While other government bond markets remain beset by inflationary fears and interest rate uncertainty, sentiment in the gilts market has turned more positive, with many analysts calling for a modest rally in the fourth quarter. Last week, for example, Kleinwort Benson cut its 10-year gilt yield projection for the year end from 9 1/4 per cent to 8 1/2 per cent, the level at which the gilt started the year. The main reasons for the more upbeat appraisal are the better-than-expected inflation outlook, and the Bank of England's more comfortable funding position. The latest inflation data for July showed the underlying rate, excluding mortgages, has hit a 27-year low, in spite of the fact that the UK is in its ninth quarter of growth. The small rise in unit wage costs in particular 'paves the way for very low RPI inflation data during the next few months,' according to Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson. However, Mr Callow concedes 'the market will remain fearful of a sudden up-tick in British inflation' and 'continue to demand a high yield relative to inflation'. Meanwhile, the funding pressures on the Bank of England have been subsiding. If the official forecast of a Pounds 36bn public sector borrowing requirement is maintained, the Bank needs to sell Pounds 2.5bn of gilts a month for the rest of the year. However, analysts now expect that the PSBR could come in lower, at about Pounds 30bn, reducing the average size of monthly auctions to a relatively modest Pounds 2bn. Technically, the gilts market could benefit from a favourable cost of carry, which means that holders of gilts can earn an attractive margin by funding their positions at the short end of the market, because of the large differential between short and long-term rates. However, although the spread between 10-year gilts and bunds has narrowed to about 150 basis points, the gilts market has yet to show any sign of a sustained rally. 'You won't see it in the prices, but the undertone has distinctly improved,' says Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. 'The drag on the market is thin trading due to the holiday period and malaise about other European and US bond markets.' The bearish conditions afflicting the world's bond markets will hold back potential gains in the gilts market: if economists have learnt one lesson this year, it is that economic fundamentals do not necessarily outweigh strong market trends. In addition to their concern about the broader outlook for the world's bond markets, international investors are also nervous about the currency. 'International investors have years of history of being burnt by sterling, and seeing sterling weakness doesn't help,' says Mr Shepperd. The pound's weakness has also rekindled uncertainty about the timing of an interest rate hike, although many analysts still believe that tightening will not start until next year. Some analysts, though, remain cautious, noting that 10-year yields have already fallen below 8 1/2 per cent and warning against pinning hopes on the latest spate of data. 'I think that the market is attaching a bit too much importance to the latest inflation statistics,' says Mr David Miles, senior UK economist at Merrill Lynch, who expects a rate hike before year-end. Nevertheless, there is a growing expectation that gilts will outperform other bond markets in the final quarter of 1994. 'We have been warming up to the gilt market over the last couple of weeks and have done some switching from German bonds to gilts in our global bond portfolios,' says Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed interest at Gartmore Investment Management. 'This is partly to close off a negative posture - but so far this year German government bonds have outperformed gilts by about 13 per cent and we feel that it is time to switch back (to gilts).' So when is a rally likely? One possible spur is the Budget, due to be presented on November 29, which is widely expected to be positive for the gilts market. How far ahead of the Budget - if at all - the market will start discounting any good news is harder to call.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Misys and RM talk over new proposal Research Machines and Misys were locked in talks last night over a new proposal from the latter for the educational computer group. Misys, the acquisitive computing services company, made an initial approach on Wednesday afternoon, making a conditional Pounds 38m cash offer of 235p a share for RM, which is due to come to the market in the next two weeks. RM - its shares are likely to be priced at about 170p - rejected the Misys offer out of hand, saying it seriously undervalued the company and that the cultures of the two groups were too different. Misys' second proposal, tabled yesterday, is thought to involve it taking a significant stake in RM. Neither company was available for comment. RM's flotation is set to raise Pounds 30m, although none is to be new money for the company, which has about Pounds 6.5m in the bank. The intention is to improve the profile of the 21-year-old company, which is relatively unknown outside the UK education market. Last year, RM reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.52m on turnover of Pounds 66.2m.</p>

Last year left a lot to be desired. The year  was marked by an economic recession and numerous international  conflicts. Therefore, according to Soares, it is necessary to  fight for peace and for the value of the family. The president  did not forget East Timor. Maria Rui reports:    [Rui] The year 1993 will not be missed. That is how Mario  Soares opened his 12-page address to the diplomatic corps  accredited in Lisbon. Soares also spoke about Timor, and of the  wars and hunger in the world. The president did not forget the  various crises, from the economic crisis to the one concerning  family values.    [Soares] "The year 1993 will not be missed. It was a  difficult year in which numerous conflicts emerged and  developed, some showing a rare level of violence, in various  continents. The year was also marked by a deep and persistent  economic recession, which not only affected the weaker nations  -- and how -- but also did not spare the major world pillars of  development. Two-thirds of humanity, almost at the end of this  millennium, unfortunately continue still subjected to the  darkest of hungers, to epidemics and various diseases."    [Rui] It is necessary to fight, Mario Soares said. To fight  against the crisis of civilization, as Pope John Paul II said to  fight to defend the family. It is a crisis of values. It is  also necessary to fight against the invading power of money and  the dazzle of easy material success. It is therefore necessary  to preserve the family.    [Soares] "Therefore it is necessary to encourage and dignify  its existence without forgetting that this implies fighting  against poverty and giving each family, particularly the  economically weak ones, adequate living and housing conditions  and the basic means necessary to ensure that children, who  continue to be the world's hope, can be spared the scourge of  marginality, violence, delinquency, malnourishment and drugs."    [Rui] The president's last words went to East Timor.  Portugal continues to seek a solution to end Indonesia's  military occupation of Timor with a view to the territory's  self-determination.</p>

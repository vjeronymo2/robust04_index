			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Letter: Real marginal costs of cars need taxing solution (1) Sir, Alex and Sue, in Richard Tomkins' article 'When fare is not fair' (January 29), need lessons in economics. The true cost by road of their 230-mile round-trip to Birmingham from London is not Pounds 11, but Pounds 41, making rail travel at Pounds 46 almost economic, They should consider the following: Pounds 11 for fuel, Pounds 5 for car servicing (230 miles is 4 per cent of the 6,000 mile service interval which will cost Pounds 120), Pounds 2 for road tax (2 per cent of 12,000 mile annual mileage) and Pounds 23 depreciation. The depreciation charge assumes car life of 80,000 miles while its value declines from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 2,000 - ie 230 miles is O28 per cent of the car's life. On this basis, we need better education rather than further taxes on car owners and society to make rail traffic a viable alternative on cost grounds.

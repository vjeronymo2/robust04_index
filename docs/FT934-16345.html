			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Franc fears for Belgian social pact talks: The country faces a challenge with possible effects far beyond its borders MOST OF the time, it does not seem to matter to many people inside Belgium, let alone outside the country, what its government gets up to. But if the country's 18-month-old centre-left coalition fails to meet the latest economic challenge to its authority, the repercussions could be felt far beyond the kingdom's borders. Government, employers and unions are trying to negotiate a 'social pact' - a consensus on how to improve companies' competitiveness, reduce labour costs and create jobs. This is not the usual search for a traditional Belgian compromise, the cornerstone of daily political life in this complex country. The last time the Belgian government set itself a similar target was in 1944. This time, the stakes are much higher. Government forecasts indicate that if nothing is done about generous welfare payments, the country's social security deficit could rise to more than BFr70bn (Pounds 1.3bn) next year. That in turn would have repercussions for the country's national budget deficit, which was nearly 7 per cent of gross domestic product last year. It must come down to 3 per cent in 1996 if Belgium is to meet the Maastricht treaty's criteria for founder membership of a European monetary union. Public debt, meanwhile, stands at more than 120 per cent of GDP, compared with Maastricht's aim that it should be moving towards 60 per cent. However, it is the short-term consequences of failure in the social pact negotiations which most frighten Belgian economists, government officials and central bankers. They fear failure could prompt a final speculative assault on the Belgian franc, which has been under increasing pressure on the exchange markets. Since early August, when currencies of the European exchange rate mechanism were allowed to fluctuate more widely against the D-Mark, Belgium's central bank has stuck to its strict policy of shadowing the German currency. But weekly reaffirmation of this policy by the central bank has not prevented rumours circulating about possible devaluation of the Belgian franc. 'Something must come out of (the social pact negotiations), because otherwise there will be chaos on the exchange markets,' says Mr Diederik Thibaut, an economist at Kredietbank in Brussels. Even the faintest prospect of devaluation has prompted a bout of concern within the EC and in neighbouring Luxembourg, which is part of a 71-year-old currency association with Belgium. Some 40 per cent of the Grand Duchy's imports come from Germany, and Luxembourg is already examining just how much of the economic pain of devaluation it could bear before questioning the future of the currency association itself. The weakness of the Belgian currency is also worrying senior Commission officials, because depreciation would undermine the central core of currencies which surround the D-Mark, and cast further doubt on the timetable for European economic and monetary union. Belgium's recent history on budget negotiations only adds to outsiders' concerns about the social pact negotiations. When the government was forced to find a further BFr110bn to prop up the country's public finances in March, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's pugnacious prime minister, had to offer his resignation - formally rejected by the late king - to persuade the coalition partners of the seriousness of the matter. On this occasion, however, the Belgian government believes that the sheer weight of responsibility - at a time when Belgium holds the presidency of the EC - will be enough to prevent the negotiations breaking down. The biggest taboo which government, unions and employers will have to confront is the future of Belgium's system of wage indexation, which pegs wage increases to price increases. Scrapping the system altogether would be politically impossible for the socialist members of the coalition. But it is clear to all economists that if Belgium is to regain a competitive advantage the mechanism will have to be amended. Possible solutions to the problem include freezing the indexation process, or removing from the price index items such as tobacco, alcohol and fuel. The latter proposal - which already seems to have some support from the French-speaking socialist coalition members - would avoid the benefit of new indirect taxes being undercut by an increase in inflation and, consequently, wages. The government is confident that, if a social pact is achieved, it can meet the Maastricht targets on the budget deficit and do enough to convince its EC partners that Belgium would be a worthy member of a currency union. And Mr Dehaene, a veteran of several hard-fought compromises, has already warned that, if the negotiations fail, the government will act on its own to tackle the problem of labour costs, unemployment and the looming deficit.</p>

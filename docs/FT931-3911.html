			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / French attack shellfish French fishermen yesterday renewed up their protests against rising fish imports by ransacking two refrigerated depots in the port of Saint-Brieuc. The fishermen emptied crates of South African and Australian shellfish on the the floor leaving the contents to rot, Alice Rawsthorn writes from Paris. Meanwhile a number of French fishing vessels from Bayonne were damaged when they blockaded a Spanish patrol boat in French waters. The French authorities agreed to pay compensation to the owners of the damaged boats.</p>

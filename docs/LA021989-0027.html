			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A MOSCOW BOY GOES BACK TO VISIT THE OLD FRIENDS AND FRIED STURGEON  </P> <P> Walking past the National Hotel as a Moscow boy, I wondered what it would be  like to see my country as a Western outsider, staying at a fine hotel, being  chauffeured around in Volgas, eating sturgeon and caviar, buying chic clothes  at the foreign currency store and, after a week or two of pure joy, going back  to the West.  </P> <P> When I turned 14, my parents and I emigrated. Last fall, as an American  citizen, I returned to Moscow to look up my friends, most of whom had not heard  from me in 15 years. I wanted to see the look on their faces as Pavel Goldberg  from America appeared at the doorstep unannounced. I also wanted to see my  hometown as a foreigner and to demonstrate to my wife, an American, that my  stories are deeply rooted in reality.  </P> <P> At the Sheremetyevo Airport we got into a Volga and headed for the National. It  is not a posh hotel. The carpet runner lay crooked in the hallway, walls were  unevenly spackled, beds were coffin-like, long and narrow. There were two  television sets, neither of which worked. Dish towels served as bath towels and  the toilet ran. In New York a room like that would go for about $75 a night. In  Moscow, $140.  </P> <P> On Gorky Street, stucco was falling off the Stalin-era buildings. Cement was  chipping off the movie theater Rossiya. Chunks were falling off the statues  that surround the Socialist Realism skyscraper at Krasnaya Presnya. To protect  pedestrians, the statues were covered with nets.  </P> <P> At the zoo, the bird house, the aquarium and the terrarium were gone. The bear  and tiger "grotto" had overgrown with tall grass. There was no wolf, no panda,  no Ussuri tiger. Two woolly Caucasus sheep dogs sat on the far side of the moat  looking dignified, as dogs do even in ridiculous situations.  </P> <P> Then we went to see Sasha, a childhood friend.  </P> <P> As children, Sasha and I were fascinated by foreign cars and politics. In 1968,  when we were both nine, Sasha told me that Brezhnev had to be a fool and a  bully to invade Czechoslovakia. I agreed, noting that a genius wouldn't become  a general secretary. Our political analyses were never impressive; our  conclusions were.  </P> <P> Sometimes Sasha and I went to the U.S. Embassy to look at cars. Ford Country  Squires captured our imaginations more than any other model. The car seated  seven, and if its speedometer was correct, it could do more than 100 miles an  hour.  </P> <P> Within five minutes the adult Sasha and I were talking as if I had gone on a  month-long vacation, returning with some big-ticket items I didn't own before.  Like a house on Capitol Hill and a bright red 1987 Volkswagen.  </P> <P> "Convertible?" Sasha asked.  </P> <P> "No, a GTI with a sunroof."  </P> <P> "Oh, a beefed-up Golf."  </P> <P> "Basically. Just more power."  </P> <P> My old friends spent hours discussing their fear of narod, the people. In fact,  narod now seems to scare them more than the government used to.  </P> <P> There was a prevalent fear of the simple folk taking pitchforks and torches,  shouting, "Death to the infidels!"  </P> <P> The Jews said they expected to be the targets. The intelligentsia expected to  be targets, too. So did my friends who joined the party.  </P> <P> Still, no one claimed to know much about "the people." Their impressions of  public sentiment seemed based entirely on quotations from local drunks, people  standing in queues at the GUM department store or Tatar street sweepers.  </P> <P> My Moscow friends are surgeons, lawyers, economists, diplomats, engineers. One  runs a cooperative employing 30 workers; every six months he fires 10 for  laziness or incompetence.  </P> <P> Those of my friends who joined the party were apologetic. "I really haven't  changed," one assured me. "I still do not rule out emigrating." To prove that  he was not "one of them," he launched into a nicely structured tirade on  Mikhail S. Gorbachev's errors and lack of sincerity.  </P> <P> Everyone had a friend or a relative in the West. A scientist said that he has  friends in every state on both coasts of North America.  </P> <P> At one gathering I was asked how much our trip cost. I said that it would be a  little over $6,000, but it would be tax-deductible since I am gathering  material for my next book. I went on to explain tax deductibility but was told  not to bother. Everyone knew.  </P> <P> My Moscow friends are yuppies without Alfas and condos. My businessman friend  owns a VCR he purchased for 4,000 rubles, about 20 times the average monthly  salary. Another friend already has a VCR, but for the past couple of years he  has dreamed about acquiring a Krups coffee maker and a pair of L.A. Gear  running shoes. Luckily, our shoe size was the same and the hard-currency store  carried Krups.  </P> <P> "That's what we live for," one friend explained. "It's an escape from the rude  waiters, long lines and the bastards at work."  </P> <P> Sasha's favorite book, and mine, is Bulgakov's "The Master and Margarita." This  established, we got into Sasha's car and headed for the Cafe Margarita, a  cooperative by the Patriarch's Ponds, the place where Bulgakov's devil descends  on Moscow, starting the magnificent story that captures the spirit of the city  at the onset of Stalinism.  </P> <P> A chair blocked the entrance. We positioned ourselves at the doorway and spoke  English loudly, counting on the Russians' legendary subservience to foreigners.  </P> <P> Half the tables in the cafe stood vacant. Shady-looking characters lounged at  other tables. No one paid attention to us.  </P> <P> "Excuse me," I said finally in Russian. "Are you open?"  </P> <P> "Sanitarni chas," said a voice from Cafe Margarita -- sanitary hour. Sanitary  hour is usually devoted to scrubbing floors and killing mice and roaches in the  kitchen.  </P> <P> The Peking restaurant on the Mayakovsky Square was closed for dinner; it was  dinner time. The Sofia was catering weddings. The Japanese restaurant at the  hotel and shopping mall developed by Armand Hammer was closed. The Russian  Restaurant at the same place was doing only "special service." Two other  restaurants were closed because the waiters were having dinner. The only place  that would have us was Sadko, serving heavily breaded sturgeon, pan-fried, then  pan-fried again, with eggs.  </P> <P> We drank some cognac and Sasha told me that at one point he wanted to become an  architect, then decided that his country has no use for elegance. He became an  engineer. He liked engineering, but hoped to make a movie some day.  </P> <P> "So, Sasha, how come you haven't sold yourself?" I asked  </P> <P> "It's the upbringing," Sasha said. It seemed that in the past 15 years  preservation of self-esteem was Sasha's chief obsession. He had been approached  by the party -- offered substantial payoffs for little compromises.  </P> <P> He always refused, telling himself that it never stops at one concession. "You  say, 'Glory to the Communist Party!' at some silly meeting, then you join their  glorious Communist Party because it's good for your career and because you need  money, then you feel like a pig because now they own you, then you drink  heavily to feel less like a pig, but feel more like one instead."  </P> <P> The apartment where I was born was being renovated as headquarters for a  cooperative that services medical equipment. "PLEASE DON'T HESITATE CALL TO  US," said an advertisement in English.  </P> <P> The courtyard where I played as a child had been dug up. An overflowing  dumpster dominated the landscape. Construction rubble and unopened bags of  cement lay on both sides. My wife, Kirsten, took some pictures.  </P> <P> "You can't photograph here, it's a military installation," said an old man I  couldn't recognize.  </P> <P> "That's right, I can see the missiles," I said.  </P> <P> "That's right, missiles." He wanted to know why foreigners were taking  pictures.  </P> <P> "Have you lived here long?" I asked.  </P> <P> "About 50 years."  </P> <P> "Then you might remember me. I am Pavel Goldberg from apartment 40."  </P> <P> "Where do you live now?"  </P> <P> "In Washington."  </P> <P> "Are you happy?"  </P> <P> "Yes."  </P> <P> "And the family?"  </P> <P> "They are happy, too."  </P> <P> "That's all that matters."  </P> <P> "Shall I tell them you said hello?" I wanted to know the old man's name.  </P> <P> "Tell them you saw Ivan Stepanych who used to work for the organs of State  Security. Tell them I am still alive."  </P> <P> A woman in her mid-20s sat by a school, watching her toddler play with a German  shepherd. I asked her if she knew what had happened to the mangled street  before us.  </P> <P> "It's gone," she said. "Even the bread store. There was always something tasty  there. Now they've dug a hole, brought over a construction trailer, put up a  concrete fence and built themselves a sauna."  </P> <P> We stood looking at the mysterious construction site, watching soldiers go in  and out.  </P> <P> "I wish I could leave," the woman said. "I'd go anywhere."  </P></p>

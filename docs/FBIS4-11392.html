			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lima, 25 Apr (EFE) -- Colombian Foreign Minister  Noemi Sanin de Rubio announced in Lima today that Colombia and  Peru will step up the joint struggle against drug trafficking.    The Colombian minister, who is paying an official visit to  Peru, said cooperation between the two countries in this field  will be increased through the signing of new agreements.    In comments to the media, she said there is "great  cooperation" between Colombia and Peru in the anti-drug field.    Sanin de Rubio commented that cooperation in the struggle  against drug trafficking also includes the legal aspects, and  disclosed that she had made a proposal in this regard to her  Peruvian counterpart that will be assessed.    The visiting minister said Peru and Colombia are engaged in  the struggle against drug trafficking and that they need each  other, as well as the international community's cooperation  because this problem cannot be fought alone.    Sanin arrived in Lima on 23 April. On 24 April, she visited  Cusco, where an indigenous Inca empire's capital is located, and  the Inca citadel of Machupicchu. [passage omitted]</p>

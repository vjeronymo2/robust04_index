			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH'S SENTENCE IN IRAN-CONTRA FIASCO  </P> <P> I have been following the Iran-Contra trial closely since its inception and now  as it comes to a close, my predominant feeling is one of deep mistrust of those  who run our country. The judicial system has failed, as well, in engendering  confidence in the public. U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell admits that Oliver  North was acting only as "a low-ranking subordinate . . . (to) a few cynical  superiors" (Part I, July 6). The court did not have the nerve to name those  superiors and could not muster the power to bring them to the stand.  </P> <P> I am a public schoolteacher and must seriously consider how I will present this  part of our history to my students. I will name those superiors who  intentionally violated the Boland Amendment and international law, lied to the  press, Congress and the public, contradicted their own stated policy towards  Iran, and worse, were responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent  Nicaraguans: former President Reagan and President Bush.  </P> <P> MARTA FISCH  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

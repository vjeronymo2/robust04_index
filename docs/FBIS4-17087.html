			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] The well-known diplomats David Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg arrived in Moscow today. This evening they had  talks with Andrey Kozyrev.    [Correspondent Mikhail Aleksandridi] A news conference was  held after their talks. [passage omitted]    [Aleksandridi] In Thorvald Stoltenberg's opinion, regular  consultations between the co-chairmen of the Coordinating  Committee and the Russian side had played an important role in  the quest for a peaceful solution of the Bosnian problem.  However, in the existing situation, David Owen thinks, it is  necessary in order to attain this goal to employ a  carrot-and-stick policy, that is to combine the threat of armed  pressure with the lifting of the anti-Serb sanctions in the  event of the Serbs preferring peace to war.</p>

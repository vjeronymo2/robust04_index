			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>   [Text] Fuzhou, China, May 30 (AFP)--Southeast China is  booming, and nowhere more than in Fujian where the government is  straining to keep the economy on a leash. Austerity is a taboo  word in wealthy Fujian, which posted a 25 percent growth rate in  1993, double the national average and displeasing to the central  government. The two economic engines in the coastal region, the  capital Fuzhou and the special economic zone of Xiamen, have  forecast respective growth rates of 17 and 27 percent in the  face of futile government calls to limit growth to 9 percent.    "This rhythm suits perfectly the needs of our city," said  Xiamen deputy mayor Zhu Yayan, who is in charge of economic  matters.    For most of the province, planning called for a modest and  politcally acceptable 11 percent growth. "The forecasts are in  general on the low side. We didn't foresee such a rapid rise  for last year," said Wang Dexian of the Fujian planning  commission.    And when Wang and other provincial officials reel off the  impressive list of projects in store for Fujian in 1994 and  subsequent years in the fields of construction, transport,  energy and telecommunications, it is difficult to imagine growth  coming back into single digits soon. The province's cities seem  to work 24 hours a day, and factory after factory appears in the  countryside.    "Public investment will undoubtedly be less important this  year than last, but it's difficult to pinpoint an amount," said  Wang Wengui from the communist party in Fuzhou, a city in which  growth topped 33 percent last year, among the highest in the  country.    The most difficult task facing authorities here is to  control  expansion in the private sector, which is playing an  increasingly important role in increasing the wealth of Fujian  residents. Joint ventures now account for over half the  province's industrial production, and have left state stores  back in the stone age of Chinese commerce.    The frenzied pace of economic development has authorities  deeply worried not only about inflation, but of the lapse in  social order that uncontrolled inflation could spark. But the  authorities know that official attempts to dampen down the  economy could anger traders and the public alike. The public is  already fed up with power cuts that regularly hit stores,  restaurants and Xiamen's increasingly popular video games rooms.    "We must satisfy the population," Zhu said in the face of an  inflation rate of over 20 percent for the first part of 1994.    "Our sincere wish is to avoid consumer panic like in 1988,  and we have already taken macroeconomic control measures," said  Zhen Longyang of Xiamen's economic commission. "For certain  essential goods such as pork and several types of vegetables we  have established ceiling prices, and have started stockpiling  grain, oil and cotton," she said.    "Our politics are summed up in three words: Reform,  development, and stability," Zhu said, refusing to enter into  the debate curently taken up in Beijing about the importance of  stability in relation to the other two goals. And if it is  suggested to him that Fujian's rapid growth will only widen the  chasm between China's rich and poor areas and so affect the  country's stability, Zhu answers: "Deng Xiaoping has fully  explained that some have to get rich before others."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- Following are the highlights  of a communique adopted at a ministerial meeting of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  Wednesday [8 June]:  <H5>  Promoting Growth and Employment </H5>    -  Where the economic  recovery is not yet sustained, eased monetary policy should be  maintained or the scope for further easing should be exploited  as far as possible. Where possible, fiscal measures will be  implemented as necessary to ensure sustained noninflationary  growth led by strong domestic demand.   <H5>  Strengthening the Multilateral System </H5>    -  Member countries  undertake to do everything to ensure the new World Trade  Organization (WTO) will enter into force on the targeted date of  Jan. 1, 1995.    -  Member countries undertake to avoid any  trade-restrictive or destructive measures that would contradict  the letter or spirit of the new rules and disciplines under the  WTO, and to conform to multilateral dispute settlement  procedures.    -  The OECD will actively support the preparatory  committee and the WTO in implementing the Uruguay Round  agreements and their work programs.    -  Members undertake to resist  protectionism in all its forms and continue to work toward  further trade liberalization, proper functioning of market  mechanisms and deregulation.    -  The OECD will also contribute to  strengthening the multilateral system by continuing to monitor  and analyze the progress of regional integration to ensure that  it continues to complement and strengthen the multilateral  system.   <H5>  The Role of the OECD in an Evolving World </H5>    -  Member  countries welcome South Korea's intention to make a formal  application for membership this year with a view to becoming a  member by the end of 1996.    -  Members welcome the intentions of the  Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to make formal  applications for membership.    -  Members welcome the declaration on  cooperation as well as the agreement on privileges and  immunities signed on Wednesday between the OECD and Russia which  marks the firm intention of both parties to deepen their  existing active cooperation and policy dialogue.    -  The OECD will  continue to broaden its knowledge and understanding of China.  Possibilities for dialogue and cooperation will be explored  with China and developed where mutual interests exist.    -  Member  countries look to the informal high-level meeting with the  dynamic nonmember economies, to be held in Tokyo in October  1994, as a major opportunity jointly to explore ways to develop  dialogue.</p>

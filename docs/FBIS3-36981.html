The proposal to include the issue into the Friday agenda was  made by LDPR member Aleksey Mitrofanov, but was rejected.    During a recent tour of former Yugoslavia, Zhirinovskiy  warned the West that he would view any air strikes on Bosnian  Serbs as an attack on Russia and pledged full support to the  Serbian population.    Also on Friday another Duma faction, the Party of Russian  Unity and Accord, released a statement calling for a Russian  veto on air strikes if the issue is discussed in the UN Security  Council.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Five-fold increase at Renault RENAULT, the French state-owned motor group, saw its pre-tax profits rise five-fold to FFr5.44bn (Dollars 1.13bn) in the first half of this year, from FFr962m in same period of 1991, thanks to a strong performance from its car division. In spite of the depressed state of the European car market, Renault managed to raise its market share from 9.9 per cent to 10.5 per cent in the first half. It sold 767,000 cars during the period, its highest sales figure for more than 10 years, bringing its share of the French market to 30 per cent, the same as its arch-rival, Peugeot-Citroen. However, Renault warned that the downward trend in the motor market could accelerate in the second half. The group said it was confident of achieving higher earnings in 1992 than in 1991, but cautioned that profits for the second six months of the year, could be lower than in the first. Overall sales rose by 14 per cent from FFr83.23bn to FFr94.83bn. The car division showed the fastest growth, with an 18 per cent increase in interim turnover from FFr67.17bn to FFr79.46bn. The commercial vehicles division came under pressure in the difficult economic climate with sales falling by 4.2 per cent to FFr12.96bn from FFr13.52bn. Renault managed to increase operating income to FFr5.32bn from FFr1.52bn and to reduce financial charges, thanks to a decline in net debt, to FFr422m from FFr685m. Exceptional charges fell to FFr5m from FFr518m. The contribution from Renault's financial companies rose to FFr810m from FFr582m. This includes Renault's share in Volvo, the Swedish motor group with which it has formed a partnership, which represented a FFr307m loss.</p>

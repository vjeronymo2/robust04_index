			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK'S FIRST VICTORY IS A SHUTOUT;  </P> <P> EL RANCHO DOES NOT COMPLETE PASS, HELD TO 98 YARDS IN OFFENSE  </P> <P> Saddleback High is no longer winless in high school football, thanks to a 12-0  victory Friday night over El Rancho High of Pico Rivera in front of 2,500 at  the loser's field.  </P> <P> "The first two weeks we were forced to play catch-up," said Saddleback coach  Jerry Witte. "In both games, we were down 14 points by halftime."  </P> <P> But the Roadrunners (1-2) needed just four plays before their defense asserted  itself against the Dons, last year's Division IV runner-up. El Rancho (1-2) ran  the ball three times on the game's opening possession, then attempted a punt.  </P> <P> Saddleback's defense got to kicker Keith Garcia first, Victor Davis blocking  the kick and Bobby Collins gathering in the ball at the five and scoring.  </P> <P> That from the defense that had surrendered 45 points in Saddleback's first two  games of the season -- 24-7 to Ocean View and 21-0 to Santa Ana.  </P> <P> That same defense held El Rancho to 98 yards in total offense and kept Art  Rodriguez, the Dons' starting quarterback, from completing a pass in seven  attempts. His only completion of the night (14 yards to Juan Quintana) was  nullified by a penalty.  </P> <P> It was also the same defense that intercepted Rodriguez once, sacked him once  and picked off his back-up, Jim Arellanes, late in the game.  </P> <P> But the defense wasn't the only operative Saddleback unit. Its offense amassed  225 yards, with J.J. Fejeran getting 78 yards of it on 16 carries.  </P> <P> Junior quarterback Paul Delgado passed for 102 yards, completing 9 of 14 with  one touchdown and two interceptions.  </P> <P> The touchdown pass covered 28 yards to Juan Acuna, midway through the second  quarter to give Saddleback a 12-0 lead.  </P> <P> "We tried to take the pressure off him (Delgado) by running the ball," Witte  said. "And I think we did a good job.  </P></p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Smaller Cos Tst raising up to Pounds 72m Lloyds Smaller Companies Investment Trust, a split capital trust, is aiming to raise up to Pounds 72.1m after expenses, via an offer for subscription on the main market. The trust will have three classes of shares. The dividend shares will be entitled to all the income from the trust, but will be repayable at only 1p per share. The capital shares will receive no income but will be entitled to all the income. The two shares will be packaged together for the purposes of the offer and will be sold as a unit at 100p each. Up to 75m packaged units are on offer. The third class of share is a special share held by Lloyds. Should the trust be taken over, or should the management contract be lost by Lloyds Investment Managers, Lloyds will exercise the special share to ensure that its name is removed from the trust. The trust will invest in companies within the bottom 10 per cent of market capitalisation of the London exchange, and expects to have a yield of 4.9 per cent. The minimum application is for 1,000 packaged units and dealings are expected to start on February 13. The trust is capable of being placed in a Personal Equity Plan.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Young Group sells mine stake option to Peabody for Dollars 6.6m YOUNG GROUP, the coal mining company, has sold an option to buy its stake in Carbonar, the Venezuelan coal company, to Peabody, the US coal company owned by Hanson, for Dollars 6.6m (Pounds 3.72m). The option is exercisable any time during the next year, giving Peabody time to investigate Carbonar's operations. During that time, Peabody will lease mining equipment to Young - allowing the company to accelerate its coal production. Peabody, one of the largest US coal companies, producing about 90m tonnes of coal a year, will also advance Young Dollars 500,000, which will be used to buy out minority shareholders in Carbonar, lifting its 51 per cent stake to 100 per cent, and settle liabilities relating to the company. Mr Brian Calver, Young's chief operating officer, said he expected Peabody would exercise the option. The deal will help Young to increase production and profit from the company, which will mine at least 200,000 tonnes of coal in 1992. Last year, the company had unexpectedly low output from Venezuela after equipment failed. Mr Calver denied that the deal was a preliminary to making a bid for part of British Coal, which is due to be privatised shortly. It was simply 'cleaning up'. He pointed out that any packages of British Coal for sale would be more likely to cost tens of millions of pounds. Young Group underwent a financial restructuring earlier this year after an unexpected fall in profits and cash flow problems led to its shares, quoted on the USM, being suspended. Mr Calver said he was still planning to sell one or two small opencast mining sites in the UK, but otherwise had no further important plans for restructuring.</p>

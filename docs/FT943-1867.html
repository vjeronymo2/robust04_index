			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Portillo attacked for opposing paternity leave Labour yesterday attacked Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, for opposing European proposals to introduce unpaid paternity leave. Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow employment minister, warned that British fathers could be left as the only ones in Europe without the right to spend time with their newborn children. At a meeting with European ministers in Brussels today Mr Portillo will oppose a plan to allow either parent three months off work without pay after the birth or adoption of a child. His opposition could necessitate the use of the UK veto. Paternity leave was blocked by the UK in 1985, but it has now been taken up by the Germans, holders of the European presidency. Ms Clwyd condemned the government's opposition as 'a slap in the face for British fathers and families'. She said: 'How can the Tory party call itself the party of the family when Michael Portillo wants fathers in the UK to be the only ones in Europe without the right to spend time with their newborn children?' The employment department said: 'The government believes that the UK's rights on maternity leave are good already and this directive is an unnecessary intervention in matters between employers and employees.' If the matter is pushed to a vote, Britain may be forced to use its veto to block the directive. The other 11 member states would then have to proceed under the Maastricht social protocol, from which Britain has opted out. Today's meeting will also consider plans to force ex-patriate workers on short-term contracts to accept local pay and conditions while abroad. Mr Portillo will insist the idea, proposed by Germany, is protectionist and unfair, shielding employers in high-cost member states from competition from abroad.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN CHINA;  </P> <P> PROTESTS FOR DEMOCRACY;  </P> <P> DESPAIR, ANGER OVER KILLINGS ENGULF BEIJING RESIDENTS  </P> <P> Bewildered Beijing residents, venturing out Sunday to view the damage or  huddled nervously in darkened homes, despaired over a feeling that the clock  had been turned back to earlier oppressive times.  </P> <P> Many were angered and sickened by the extent of the bloodletting early Sunday  at Tian An Men Square. They railed at the government for its cruelty and for  disgracing China.  </P> <P> "This is a crime that cannot go unpunished. We in China have let these things  happen too often. There is never an end," said Song Weiming, a resident of the  Qianmen district, a block south of Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> For many, there was a feeling of deja vu in the bleak appearance of Beijing a  day after government troops gunned down hundreds of pro-democracy students and  other civilians.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Back to Bicycle Bells  </P> <P> Motor vehicles all but disappeared from the streets, taking Beijing back to the  days when the tinkle of bicycle bells was a dominant sound.  </P> <P> Few stores were open; the relative abundance that had enlivened Beijing streets  in recent years seemed to have evaporated at a stroke. Commerce was limited to  vegetable stands set up by traveling farmers.  </P> <P> Power went out in large sections of the city, making a gray and stormy  afternoon even grayer. It was not clear whether the government had ordered a  blackout or whether electricity lines had been damaged by the overnight  violence.  </P> <P> "It's like the Cultural Revolution," said Zhao Lao, an elderly resident of the  Hepingmen district less than a mile from Tian An Men. "Or worse, like war."  </P> <P> Besides the concern over the disruption of daily life, residents appeared to be  burdened by a fear of chaos and repression not known for almost 20 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assault a 'Great Victory'  </P> <P> Government rhetoric added to the atmosphere. Official Chinese radio referred to  the massacre in Tian An Men Square as a "great victory," saying that the  violence was caused by a "gang of thieves bent on throwing the whole country  into confusion."  </P> <P> The army's "heroic acts and glorious exploits have won fervent praise and  strong support from the masses," the broadcast concluded.  </P> <P> In strongly worded posters, the government also ordered residents to sit at  home, an order ignored by many who wanted at least to escape the heat of their  crowded homes.  </P> <P> "We hoped to leave behind the days when the Chinese people could be flogged and  beaten like animals," said Zhao Yi, Zhao Lao's son, who works as a tailor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Affluence and Fear  </P> <P> Zhao Yi lives in a hutong, the typical winding alleyway that is the  characteristic style of old neighborhoods in Beijing. With the combined income  of his two brothers and their wives, Zhao was able to buy a refrigerator as  well as an electric fan and floor heater for his home, all goods available to  many Chinese in the recent years of rising economic growth and consumption.  </P> <P> "But what does all this mean if they are shooting people outside your door?"  Zhao asked. "Our government is completely bankrupt."  </P> <P> A few doors down the alley, Liu, who said he is a stage actor, asked a visitor  how it would be possible to emigrate to the United States. "I never thought  this way before, even during the Cultural Revolution, when I saw my father  beaten and humiliated just because he was a teacher," Liu said, shaking his  head.  </P> <P> "Now I see there is no hope for China."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Smoldering Jeep Carcass  </P> <P> Just a block from the hutong at the corner of West Qianmen and South Xinhua  streets, passers-by gaped at the smoldering carcass of an overturned jeep.  Behind it, a pair of twisted buses that army tanks had pushed out of the way  blocked the intersection.  </P> <P> Some of the street crowd walked up to touch the scorched jeep. One middle-aged  man put his 3-year-old child in the seat of a bus and snapped his picture.  </P> <P> "Does this happen in foreign countries?" a young bicyclist asked a foreigner,  observing the scene.  </P> <P> "Is America going to do anything about the killing?" asked another.  </P> <P> "What will happen next, do you think?" a third inquired.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rifle Fire Echoes in Square  </P> <P> Just then, a sharp rat-a-tat-tat of rifle fire echoed down from Tian An Men  Square. Sightseers and loiterers scurried for cover. It was the kind of scene  played out all around the square: Groups of bicyclists and pedestrians would  approach; some would yell at soldiers to go home; more troops would arrive and  fire, spreading panic down the adjacent streets.  </P> <P> "This is too scary," said a young father, clutching his baby daughter. "Now we  do not know who is in charge. I used to follow these things but I just don't  know. I am confused, totally confused."  </P> <P> Rain began to fall, and thunder punctuated the sound of gunfire. The crowd on  Qianmen Street began to disperse, exposing a line of troops looking on  impassively in their rain ponchos, rifles held across their chests.  </P></p>

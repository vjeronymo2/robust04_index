			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIXIELAND IS ALIVE AND KICKING IN THE VALLEY  </P> <P> There are certain musicians who have been playing it for more than half a  century. But ask them exactly what Dixieland music is, and they are hard  pressed for words.  </P> <P> Some say it's a style of music, defined by the number of instruments played --  at least five, but perhaps six or seven. Others will tell you that real  Dixieland must make use of the bass and tuba. Others insist that it's the banjo  that defines the music.  </P> <P> Trying to figure out where the Dixieland sound originated can be just as  perplexing. Was it conceived in the South by black musicians who improvised  together? Or did it begin on the streets of New Orleans during parades and  funerals? Perhaps it was really born on the shores of the Mississippi. Or in  the heart of San Francisco.  </P> <P> No one seems to know for sure.  </P> <P> "Dixieland is a misnomer," said Dick Miller, cornet player with a group called  the Jazzin' Babies. "It connotes five or six guys sitting around playing a  dozen tunes people know."  </P> <P> One thing is sure, though. Dixieland music is happy music. It will bring you up  when you're down.  </P> <P> Margaret Teagarden, treasurer of the Valley Dixieland Jazz Club, says it even  helps her clean house: When she turns on Dixieland jazz, her cleaning chores  get done a whole lot quicker.  </P> <P> In the San Fernando Valley, fewer than half a dozen venues offer this type of  jazz. Still, those who regularly attend the restaurants and clubs that feature  Dixieland will not be dissuaded. They have too good a time.  </P> <P> For the last 12 years, the Jazzin' Babies have been playing Dixieland every  Wednesday evening at the Red Vest Pizza Parlor in Sylmar. The tradition began  when Dave Dolson, then a police captain in the Foothill Division of the Los  Angeles Police Department, formed the group and needed a place for the band to  jam. A clarinet and soprano saxophone player, Dolson has since moved to  Montana, where he is the police chief of White Fish. However, the Jazzin'  Babies play on.  </P> <P> The group is composed of Rosy McHargue, saxophone; John Innes, an original  member of the band, on trombone; Larry Fisher, drums; Jimmy Green, banjo;  Miller, cornet; Don Romig, tuba, and Patrick Gogerty, piano.  </P> <P> In the narrow aisles, a few courageous couples often hop to their feet and  dance to their favorite tunes, while young children chase one another across  the floor or compete on the electronic video games in the rear of the  restaurant.  </P> <P> After an evening on the playing field, members of local softball teams also  like to relax -- and eat -- while the Jazzin' Babies entertain with pieces from  their 300-song repertoire.  </P> <P> On Sunday nights, two other spots in the Valley feature Dixieland -- Casey's  Tavern in Canoga Park and My Brother's Place in Northridge.  </P> <P> Six years ago, when Lee and Jean Casey opened their neighborhood bar on Sherman  Way, they were especially interested in establishing a jazz nightspot. Lee, a  systems designer for Teledyne, and Jean, a secretary, had always enjoyed  traditional jazz but had trouble finding it. So now, every Sunday from 6 to 9  p.m., Casey's features the Jelly Roll Jazz Band.  </P> <P> "People get to hear good music, go home, go to bed and get up and go to work on  Monday," Lee Casey said. "It's a good way to start the week."  </P> <P> For those who are looking for Dixieland jazz, plus atmosphere and a varied  dinner menu, My Brother's Place is the answer. Since taking over the restaurant  in the early part of October, brothers Rick and Don Rann have made quite a few  changes. They've relocated the stage, rearranged the tables and moved the dance  floor.  </P> <P> One thing they haven't altered is the Sunday night performance, from 7 to 10,  by Bob Ringwald's Great Pacific Jazz Band, with Dick Carey, piano; Bob Havens,  trombone; Don Nelson, soprano sax; Ringwald, banjo; Ray Templin, drums; Jack  Wadsworth, saxophone, and Zeke Zarchy, trumpet.  </P> <P> Ringwald, 48, started his band about 11 years ago with the intention of helping  to preserve jazz music, which he refers to as "a truly American art form." And  although the band doesn't play strictly Dixieland music, they perform many  arrangements from the early days of jazz, including some by Louis Armstrong.  </P> <P> Eighteen years ago, Ringwald helped establish the Sacramento Dixieland Jubilee,  which is now held every year over the Memorial Day weekend. Since then, he  said, jazz festivals have boomed. Festivals in many cities include the Los  Angeles Classic Jazz Festival on Labor Day weekend and the San Diego  Thanksgiving Dixieland Jazz Festival.  </P> <P> Besides playing live music, Ringwald is also involved in his own radio program  -- one of three Dixieland broadcasts in the Los Angeles area. "Bob Ringwald's  Bourbon Street Parade" airs on KCSN (88.5-FM) Saturday afternoons from 3:05 to  5. (The other programs that feature Dixieland music are "After Hours" on KPCC  in Pasadena (89.3-FM) Tuesday through Friday from midnight to 2 a.m. and  "Traditional Jazz With Bob Epstein" on KLON in Long Beach (88.1-FM) Sunday from  5 to 7 p.m.)  </P> <P> Ringwald thinks that records are a good way to expose the younger generation to  the old tunes. Traditionally, a majority of listeners have been older. And many  of the musicians are also up in years -- McHargue of the Jazzin' Babies is 87;  Carey and Zarchy of Ringwald's band are 73 and 74 respectively.  </P> <P> However, Ringwald noted that young people are learning to appreciate this style  of jazz. This same trend is being witnessed at the Valley Dixieland Jazz Club  and the Santa Clarita Dixieland Jazz Club.  </P> <P> "Five years ago, most of the people in our audiences were older people," said  Bob Gatineau, president of the Santa Clarita jazz club. "But now younger people  -- age 30 and up -- are starting to go for this music." Every year at the L.A.  Classic Jazz Festival, "the crowd seems to be getting younger and younger.  There's a tremendous amount of interest in traditional jazz."  </P> <P> The Valley Dixieland Jazz Club also reports an increase in the number of  younger patrons.  </P> <P> Although these clubs, both nonprofit organizations, meet only once a month,  they provide jazz enthusiasts with alternative spots to enjoy Dixieland. The  programs, each lasting about four hours, are set up much the same way.  </P> <P> Musicians who are interested in performing sign up at the beginning of the  show. A musical director assigns individual musicians to groups, which are then  given an opportunity to jam. In addition, each month a featured band is hired  to perform as part of the afternoon's entertainment.  </P> <P> Gatineau said attendance at the Santa Clarita Dixieland Jazz Club's monthly  meetings averages 250.  </P> <P> Between 250 and 300 attend the Valley Dixieland Jazz Club's get-togethers.  Patrons are welcome to dance, and they do. An open bar and food concession  offer refreshments.  </P> <P> "Everyone's there to have a good time and enjoy the music," Gatineau said.  "It's a gay, happy, toe-tapping music. When you look into the audience, you see  the people stomping out there -- whether they're dancing or sitting down."  </P> <P> Casey's Tavern is at 22029 Sherman Way, Canoga Park. (818) 992-9362.  </P> <P> My Brother's Place is at 9545 Reseda Blvd., Northridge. (818) 886-5841.  </P> <P> Red Vest Pizza Parlor is at 12639 Glenoaks Blvd., Sylmar. (818) 362-1536.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita Dixieland Jazz Club meets from 1 to 5:30 p.m. on the fourth  Sunday of every month at the Elks Lodge, 804 Pico St., San Fernando. Admission  is $3 for members, $5 for the general public. (Annual membership is $10.)  </P> <P> The Valley Dixieland Jazz Club meets at the Knights of Columbus Hall, 21433  Strathern St., Canoga Park. Admission is $5 for members and $7 for the general  public. (Family membership is $15 a year.)  </P></p>

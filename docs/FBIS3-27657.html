			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Chengbin (1327 2110 2430)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Zhang Junsheng, deputy  director of XINHUA's Hong Kong branch, stated here this evening  that Britain's unilateral move to publicize the contents of the  Sino- British negotiations is for the purpose of deceiving the  Hong Kong people and misleading public opinion. He said that  the publication fully shows that Britain has constantly not  abided by its diplomatic accords, and that China certainly will  respond accordingly.    Zhang Junsheng made the above statement when interviewed at  a  spring reception given by the social work department of XINHUA's  Hong Kong branch.    Zhang Junsheng said: The Sino-British negotiations on Hong  Kong's 1994-95 elections were conducted between representatives  sent by the Chinese and British governments. Now the  negotiations have broken down and Britain will publicize the  contents of the negotiations. Although we are not against their  publication, the contents of the negotiations should not be  publicized until the two countries have held diplomatic  consultations, because it was clearly stated beforehand that the  contents of the negotiations are confidential. Without holding  any diplomatic consultations, Britain has now taken a unilateral  move to compile and publicize the so- called "white paper" in  which it has said what it wanted to say for the purpose of  deceiving the Hong Kong people and misleading public opinion.  Is it not very clear that Britain has violated diplomatic  norms? Is it not very clear that it has not abided by its  diplomatic accords?    Zhang Junsheng said: The so-called Sino-British disputes  that have continued for more than a year are caused by Britain's  failure to abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration, by its  own promise that the development of Hong Kong's political system  must converge with the Basic Law, and by the memorandum of  understanding and accords reached between China and Britain.  Now it has unilaterally publicized the contents of the 17  rounds of negotiations. Is it not very clear that Britain has  not abided by its diplomatic accords?    Zhang Junsheng said: "We expected that China and Britain  could cooperate very well on the issue of Hong Kong, but now  Britain has seriously undermined the foundation of cooperation.  Under such circumstances, Britain still acts as if nothing has  happened. Is this not an act of deceiving others as well as  itself?" Zhang Junsheng stressed time and again that Britain's  unilateral move to publicize the contents of the negotiations is  for the purpose of deceiving the Hong Kong people and misleading  public opinion, and that China certainly will respond  accordingly.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Measures aim to restore confidence THE package of emergency measures announced yesterday by the Japanese government cover a range of fiscal and regulatory areas aimed at boosting the economy. The aim is not only to accelerate public works spending, but also to stimulate spending by introducing special loan programmes and easing regulations. The Economic Planning Agency, which issued the programme, appeared equivocal, however, about the actual state of the economy. It said employment and spending were firm, and corporate profits remained high by historical standards. None the less the economy was slowing and the agency wanted to arrest any further deterioration in business and consumer confidence. The package was thus aimed at boosting confidence over and above stimulating the economy. The measures are: Central government will 'front load' its public works programme by spending 75 per cent of the annual budget in the first half of the year. Normally 68 per cent of the budget is spent in the first half. Mr Masaru Yoshitomi, director general of the EPA co-ordination bureau, said central government spending would rise by 15.7 per cent compared to fiscal 1991 during the first half of the year, an increase of Y1,500bn. Front loading was responsible for two-thirds of this increase. Local government, whose public works spending is about twice that of central government, was expected to follow a similar programme, although the amount could not yet be quantified. Electricity, gas and telecommunications would increase budgets and bring forward spending schedules. In the electricity industry, capital spending would be increased by Y300bn to Y4.3bn, with Y1,000bn previously budgeted for the second half moved to the first. The telephone companies would increase spending over budget by Y90bn to Y1,290bn. A variety of lending programmes would be introduced to support companies investing in labour-saving devices. Money would be lent at 5.9 per cent, compared to current rates of 6.0 per cent to large companies, while loan rates to small and medium companies would be cut from 5.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent. Private spending would be supported by promoting shorter working hours, including a five-day work week for civil service employees. Long distance telephone rates are to be cut. Housing loan ceilings from the government Housing Loan Corporation are to be raised and, in an effort to stimulate demand for vehicles, the building of car parks is to be promoted. In addition to lower loan rates for labour saving investment, a variety of credit and insurance schemes are to be improved for small businesses. Measures are to be taken to improve the operation of the stock and bond markets. The government is to pursue flexible implementation of monetary policy. This is a thinly veiled hint that the Bank of Japan should cut interest rates. Mr Yoshitomi was in no doubt about the importance of the programme. 'By these measures we still expect we can achieve 3.5 per cent (economic growth),' he said. Mr Yoshitomi said that, compared to previous government emergency packages, the government was catching the downturn in the economy before it became serious. He therefore believed the measures would take rapid effect. He said that while it would be impossible to quantify precisely the impact of the measures, the process of corporate inventory adjustment was expected to peak by September, and that economic recovery would begin afterwards. A possible supplementary budget to make up for a dip in spending expected in the second half of the fiscal year would be considered only after the emergency measures had been given time to work.</p>

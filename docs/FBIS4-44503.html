			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Chang Hai-lin (1728 3189 3829): "Government To </F> Find Out Crux of Strange Economic Situation -- Mixed First  Quarter Economic Indicators Reflect Unclear Economic Situation"]    [Text] During the first quarter of 1994, the various  economic indices were mixed. The growth of exports slowed down,  but industrial production was up. The gap between revenues and  expenditures is inconsistent with the situation in trading, and  the economic situation is unclear. Hsueh Chi, deputy director of  the Council for Economic Planning and Development, Executive  Yuan, described the current economic situation as "strange and  changeable" on 22 April. He decided to invite the Central Bank  of China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of  Finance to join their efforts in finding the crux.    Hsueh Chi pointed out first that our exports in the first  quarter this year only rose 0.4 percent over 1993, and we rank  at the bottom of the four small dragons in Asia. "The global  economy is gradually reviving, but our country shows little  momentum. It is unusual," he added.    Hsueh Chi said that the current economic situation in our  country is extremely strange and changeable. No one is able to  make head or tail of it. For example, the growth rate of exports  for the first quarter of this year not only failed to exceed  that of the same period last year, it actually dropped a great  deal, and fell far below the 4.63 percent estimated by the  Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.    Second, the annual growth rate of export orders during the  fourth quarter of 1993 amounted to 4.9 percent. Although it was  not very high, it often indicates the exports for the first  quarter of this year. It should not be as low as 0.4 percent.  Hsueh Chi said that the reason as to why there are more  merchandise ordered than that actually exported is perhaps  because of the situation whereas orders are placed to Taiwan,  while merchandise is shipped out from a third country.  Nevertheless, we will have to verify what actually happened.    Third, the exports growth rate during the first quarter of  1994 is the lowest one since the third quarter of 1990, but the  industrial production index is the highest since 1992. If there  are less demands abroad, how can we still maintain a high growth  rate in industrial production? Both the Ministry of Economic  Affairs and the Council for Economic Planning and Development  simply do not understand.    The fourth question raised by Hsueh Chi is that the export  orders for textile products received in March this year rose  nearly 20 percent as compared with those in February. Since the  textile industry in which a great many factories had already  moved out of the country can still receive more orders, why are  other industries in our country less competitive?    Li Kao-chao, Director of the Economic Research Department of  the Council for Economic Planning and Development, also pointed  out a strange phenomenon. That is, there was no loss of momentum  in exports in last March, but exports in March this year showed  a decline of 5.2 percent as compared with the same period in  last year.    In addition, there is a big gap between the favorable  balance  of foreign exchange earnings and outlays and the favorable  balance of customs imports and exports. The Central Bank of  China fails to understand this. Right now, it is checking to see  if it is because of the interference from other cash outflowing  channels, which creates the gap between total volume of export  orders and the growth rate of exports.    In face of the unclear situation in trading at present, the  Council for Economic Planning and Development will hold a  consultation committee meeting next week and invite scholars to  discuss the "current situation in trading and outlook." Hsueh  Chi hoped that all economic research departments of the Central  Bank of China, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic  Affairs and the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and  Statistics would vie with one another to find out the cause of  disease in the current economic situation. Right now, the  Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the  Ministry of Economic Affairs are studying and analyzing the  situation.    Hsueh Chi pointed out: It may not be difficult to find the  problem in our current economic situation. It is possible that  minor issues which had been ignored in the past have become  today's big problems.</p>

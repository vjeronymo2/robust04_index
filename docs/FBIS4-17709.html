			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] President Lech Walesa has said in  Vilnius that the Polish-Lithuanian Treaty has put an end to the  past.    [Correspondent Prygon] Lithuanian President Algirdas  Brazauskas had a similar view and expressed the hope that the  treaty will prove to be sufficiently substantial to be  beneficial to both our states and nations. Thus, the principle  that in Polish-Lithuanian relations we should look into the  future rather than the past has been reiterated. Poland and  Lithuania are linked by similar interests in the economy and  foreign policy. For this reason, and despite the fact that Lech  Walesa is still skeptical about the Partnership for Peace  program, he thinks that we should, I quote, turn this  partnership into a great factor for security for Europe. He  added that there is no free Poland without a free Lithuania.    Lech Walesa supports the idea put forward by Algirdas  Brazauskas yesterday for a meeting between the heads of the  Baltic states and the heads of the Visegrad Group.    Asked about the rebroadcasting of the Polish Television  First  Program to Lithuania, Lech Walesa said he will do everything he  can to ensure that as many programs as possible reach Lithuania.  He admitted, however, that there are technical difficulties.  It is possible to overcome them, in the same way as we can  overcome the situation at our border-crossing points. At the  same time, he expressed the hope that by the year 2000 we will  not be divided by a border.</p>

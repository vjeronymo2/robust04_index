			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Facing the realities STERLING and Euromark futures again fell sharply yesterday, reflecting the growing belief that official policy will be eased on the continent more slowly than expected, writes James Blitz. In European cash and futures markets, the dominant sentiment is that central banks will ease credit policy before the end of the year. The UK government has put increasing emphasis on the need for growth, the Bundesbank is faced with the reality of German economic stagnation, and the Bank of France, which cut one of its key repo rates this week by 1.5 percentage points, is confident that the intense speculative selling of the franc on the foreign exchanges is over. But when will the next round of rate easing come? Throughout this week, markets have started to think that the easing will occur later than had been expected, firming rates. Yesterday, German 3-month money was trading at 8.85 per cent, 10 basis points above the rate of the Bundesbank's most recent injections. The December short sterling contract fell another 26 basis points from its opening level, to close at 93.34. And, although 3-month French francs are nearly 200 basis point lower than they were a month ago, they are, at 9 3/4 per cent, still 90 basis points above the 3 month D-Mark cash rate. 'There is still room for a move downwards in French rates,' said one London-based commercial bank dealer yesterday. However, recent policy signals from the Bundesbank have injected a strong note of caution. Officials in the German central bank reiterated this week that inflationary pressures in the German economy remained high. And the continuing debate in the German government over whether to meet the growing fiscal deficit through tax hikes or a cut in lending to eastern Germany may make the Bundesbank's final decisions on rates more drawn-out. A UK fund manager said yesterday that if German rates are not lowered again soon, the recession will force the Bundesbank to reduce them in the New Year at speed. 'That will not be good for the stability of the D-Mark or the European exchange rate mechanism,' he said.</p>

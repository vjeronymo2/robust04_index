			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The Fair Trade Commission  is investigating a Korean sales agency's complaint of unfair  business practices against the U.S.-based multinational rubber  and tire firm, Goodyear.    The government agency under the Economic Planning Board,  whose ruling carries binding force, will announce a decision by  the end of this month.    Pusan-based Daeyang Corp. filed a complaint against Goodyear  Korea last February, charging the American company with ceasing  to supply goods after the former refused to pay a large  honorarium and unilaterally breaking off their contract.    According to Daeyang's statement, Goodyear Korea demanded 50  million won for letting the provincial company open sales  outlets in Pusan and South Kyongsan Province.    When it refused, Goodyear stopped supplying products and  terminated its contract with Daeyang.    Goodyear Korea flatly denied Daeyang's charges, saying the  demand for an honorarium concerned just one of its salesmen who  has already been sacked over the matter.    It explained that Daeyang had failed to submit orders and  present a business blueprint, a requirement under the contract,  as reasons for breaking ties.    The rights and wrongs will be determined by the Fair Trade  Commission later in the month, but industry observers say the  case sends a warning to Korean businesses vying to sell foreign  brands.</p>

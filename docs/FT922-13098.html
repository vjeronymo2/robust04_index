			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Amax plans aluminium smelter in Iceland AMAX, THIRD-LARGEST of the US aluminium producers, is determined to build a Dollars 1bn, 210,000-tonnes-a-year smelter in Iceland, said Mr Alan Born, chairman. He said Amax would need the metal for its fabricating operations in Europe. At present the US group swaps primary aluminium with European producers who need metal in the States so that Amax can avoid paying the 6 per cent tariff levied by the European Community. Mr Born said it was clear that the opportunity for metal swaps would become more limited as demand for aluminium grew in Europe but production capacity remained static. Aluminium from the so-called Atlantal smelter would enter the EC free of tariff under present arrangements with Iceland. The future of the Atlantal project has been in some doubt since last November when it was shelved because of low aluminium prices and because finance was not available on acceptable terms. However, Mr Born told the Association of Mining Analysts in London: 'The question is not if we will build the smelter but when we will build it.' He suggested construction would start between 1995 and 1997, depending on market conditions. Amax has a 40 per cent stake in the Atlantal consortium with Hoogovens Aluminium of the Netherlands and Granges, part of Sweden's Electrolux group, each owning 30 per cent. Mr Born suggested conditions in the aluminium market would improve gradually but that there would be little further improvement in prices until London Metal Exchange stocks were substantially reduced and 'we have hard evidence that Russian metal exports are decreasing'. Unless the aluminium price increased by another 10 cents a lb fairly soon, more European capacity would have to close, he said. Mr Born said consumption of aluminium by the automotive industry was increasing and conservative estimates suggested this would boost demand by 1m tonnes annual by the year 2,000. That would require five new smelters. Amax based its estimates on an assumption that the use of aluminium in the average north American car would increase from 160 lb to 240 lb.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As many as 900 fighters of the Tajik opposition have  accumulated on the Afghan territory on the border with  Gorno-Badakhshan (Tajikistan's autonomous region), the press  bureau of the Russian border forces reported to INTERFAX  Wednesday [22 June]. According to the press bureau, the  greatest number of fighters has been registered in the Afghan  kishlaks (villages) of Andzhiz, Yapur, and Veski.    Since 18 June, Russia border guards prevented five attempts  of the armed groups of the Tajik opposition to penetrate the  border from the Afghan territory on the sections of the Pyanj,  Moskovskiy, and Khorog frontier detachments.    According to available information, leaders of the Tajik  opposition have ordered the fighters of the so called  Kumsangirsko-Pyanj and Kulyab fronts to conduct a series of  subversive acts against the frontier detachments of the Pyanj  and Moskovskiy frontier detachments and against the civilian  population living in Tajikistan's Khatlon Region.    Leaders of drug and mafia circles have made two attempts to  block the military cantonment of the frontier detachment and one  of the detachment's posts on the territory of Gorno-Badakhshan  since 18 June.    According to the press bureau, the command and leadership of  the Russian frontier forces in Tajikistan are undertaking all  appropriate measures to guard and defend the border.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: LWT The millionaire moguls of the television sector have again demonstrated their penny pinching skills, enabling LWT to widen half-year trading margins by 7 percentage points to 26.6 per cent. Despite a minimal rise in advertising revenue, LWT's assault on costs produced a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits. However, the scope to trim costs further is diminishing. Earnings growth will increasingly depend on pushing more work through its studios and boosting advertising income. But both tasks will be tough in today's sticky trading climate. Moreover, when the preferred shares convert next month, the dividend cover is likely to be set at between two and 2 1/2 times. That is hardly generous for such a cash generative business. LWT's recent share price rise, though, owes more to speculative appeal than trading outlook or prospective yield. Granada's acquisition of a 20 per cent stake at a premium price seemingly emphasises LWT's worth as a bid target. Yet this theory may prove suspect if, as Sir Christopher Bland, LWT's chairman, believes, the balance of probability has now swung against a change of rules permitting the big nine franchises to devour each other. On this view, many television shares, including LWT's, look decidedly heavy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major Rusi Gochev, leader of the Rakovski </F> Bulgarian Officers Legion, by Nikolay Grudev; place and date  not given: "Rusi Gochev: Defense Ministry Invented Officers'  Putsch"]    [Text] [Grudev] Major Gochev, has the officers' legion's  putsch ended?    [Gochev] I think that the conflict was invented in and  staged by the Ministry of Defense. The scandal was prompted by  collecting signatures for our petition. It started at the  Khaskovo Garrison. However, our petition did not attack the  ministry or the government. It was intended for parliament and  invoked not only the budget, but also the Law on the Defense and  Armed Forces.    [Grudev] However, the Army budget was adopted and the 37  billion leva requested by the legion was not allocated....    [Gochev] It is mere rumor that we requested 37 billion leva.  The almost 13 billion that were allocated is the defense  minister's problem. Parliament has in effect refused to assume  responsibility for the situation in the Armed Forces and for the  defense of the state. The buck was passed to the Ministry of  Defense and not without the help of the new members of the  minister's cabinet.    [Grudev] Whom do you have in mind?    [Gochev] Deputy Minister Boyko Noev.    [Grudev] What responsibility do you mean?    [Gochev] According to the existing law the Armed Forces'  payroll is determined by the Council of Ministers following the  proposal of the Defense Ministry. Now I understand why the  parliament was not in a hurry to adopt the new Law on Defense.  According to the draft law it is the National Assembly that  should determine the size of the Army. This awkward issue was  transferred to the executive.    [Grudev] The legion has been accused of requesting higher  wages for the officers through a higher budget.    [Gochev] In our petition we do not mention at all any  request for higher wages. However, a bigger budget would  facilitate the improvement of the Bulgarian military's social  situation. Nevertheless, this is not the most important issue.    We demand kerosene so that our aircraft can fly and continue  their training. We demand money for properly functioning  equipment and for improving the Army's combat ability.    [Grudev] Who is interested in this?    [Gochev] Obviously, there are political forces interested in  the future development of the Armed Forces. The experts know  the price of preserving the army and they have expressed their  opinion. Perhaps this irritated many people.    Now Deputy Defense Minister Boyko Noev has said several  times  that Bulgaria does not need an army of more than 55,000  soldiers. This is absurd. Against the background of this  position I do not know whether this is precisely what the new  budget was aiming at. I do not know whose policy this is.  However, those who adhere to it should publicly explain their  position. The defense minister should ask his deputy, Noev,  what and whose this policy is.    [Grudev] What do you intend to do with your petition? How  many signatures have you collected?    [Gochev] Before the holidays it had been signed by 3,200  officers and sergeants. We have stopped counting. Now we  expect the penalties. The accusations of planning a putsch have  evaporated. Now we will ask those who accused us to apologize  publicly.    [Grudev] Will the petition be handed to parliament as you  promised?    [Gochev] This is absurd in the existing situation. Those  who signed the petition signed it with their three names, their  military serial number, and the unit in which they serve. We  cannot be sure that someone will not decide to begin the  "reform" by dismissing those who have signed the petition. So  we will only announce the final number of those who have signed  the petition.    [Grudev] How will the legion act if there are cuts in the  Army?    [Gochev] In any event, we will insist that those who will be  dismissed from the Armed Forces for various reasons will be  granted all forms of security provided in law. We have already  heard that instead of the financial compensation that they are  entitled to, they will receive securities. The officers are  already calling these "pieces of paper." This would be the  ultimate mockery of the Army.</p>

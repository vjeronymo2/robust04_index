			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NASH PHOTO GIFT TO L.A. COUNTY MUSEUM  </P> <P> Pop singer Graham Nash has decided to auction his widely acclaimed collection  of photography, but he won't take all the money and run. A generous portion of  the proceeds will go to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the  acquisition of non-traditional photographs.  </P> <P> A sale of more than 450 works from Nash's collection, scheduled for April 25 at  Sotheby's New York, is expected to bring more than $2 million. Nash intends to  recoup his investment -- an amount that has yet to be determined by his  accountants. Once he has recovered his costs, he will split his profit with the  museum. In addition, Nash will donate about 140 of the most up-to-date  photographs to the museum.  </P> <P> Why is he selling?  </P> <P> "I love the thrill of the chase and the energy of new fields. In the '60s that  energy was in rock 'n' roll. In the '70s, it was in collecting photography,"  said Nash, who rocked to fame in the '60s with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.  </P> <P> During the '80s, Nash said, his interests turned from photography's historical  spectrum to contemporary works done with experimental techniques including  computers. He has collected up-to-the-minute photographs, but now he will turn  that job over to an institution that can handle the job professionally.  </P> <P> Nash's gift of about 140 works from the '80s will give a considerable boost to  the museum's small collection. The auction proceeds should put the museum on  the map as a collector of contemporary photography. While photography prices  have risen dramatically along with the rest of the art market, photographs are  still relatively affordable. Nash's money gift -- which could total several  hundred thousand dollars -- will be significant.  </P> <P> The musician could have gifted an institution that has a bigger and better  photography collection, but he opted to aid a local museum that has only begun  to establish its commitment to photography. "The County Museum of Art has been  criticized for not doing enough for photography. Instead of criticizing, I'd  rather help," Nash said.  </P> <P> "We are delighted and very grateful, particularly at a time when gifts to  museums are very hard to develop. Graham Nash's generosity will go a long, long  way to help us build a mature department of photography," said Earl A. Powell,  director of LACMA. The museum's photography collection currently covers a broad  of history but is strongest in post-1945 work, Powell said.  </P> <P> The Nash auction will be "the most important single-owner sale of photographs  ever to come to auction," according to Beth Gates-Warren, director of Sotheby's  department of photographs.  </P> <P> Nash's collection is unusually broad, reaching from "Feathers," an 1845  cyanotype by British photographer Anna Atkins (valued between $5,000 and  $8,000) to Duane Michals' 1973 triple portrait of Andy Warhol ($2,000 to  $2,500). Nineteenth-Century images include works by Julia Margaret Cameron and  Peter Henry Emerson. Twentieth-Century pieces encompass the visions of Lewis  Hine, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Edward Steichen and Harry Callahan.  </P> <P> "Graham Nash began collecting so early -- in the early '70s during the  formative years of the market -- that he was able to acquire pieces that you  don't usually see at auction. He traveled a great deal, he was in touch with  book and photography dealers and he had a lot of people looking for him,"  Gates-Warren said.  </P> <P> Prime among the pieces in the upcoming sale are works by Paul Outerbridge,  whose abstract still lifes, female nudes and surreal images are widely admired  by photography collectors and critics. A 1927 self-portrait of the artist in a  mask and top hat -- a striking image that has never appeared at auction -- is  expected to bring at least $60,000. Two other Outerbridge works, "Saltine Box,  Version II" and "H.O. Box" (which comes with a drawing of the same subject),  are each estimated at $50,000 to $75,000.  </P> <P> A self-portrait by Steichen is valued at $30,000 to $50,000; his portrait of  Gloria Swanson is expected to bring $10,000 to $20,000. The image that  persuaded Nash to start collecting photographs, Diane Arbus' "Child With Toy  Hand Grenade in Central Park," also will go on the block, at an estimated price  of $12,000 to $18,000.  </P> <P> Nash said that Arbus' image of a scrawny, grimacing kid holding a war toy as if  it would explode any minute is a great example of photography's "power to move"  human emotions. That famous picture turned him into an acquisitor, but he was  already primed for action by his father who was an amateur photographer and by  his own earlier interest in 19th-Century photographs of North American Indians.  </P> <P> Gates-Warren characterized the Nash collection as focusing on "human nature"  and reflecting Nash's ironic sense of humor. "He is a photographer himself. He  has a very good eye and sense of composition, but he also feels a lot of  empathy with the subjects of his photographs," she said.  </P> <P> Nash's collection was shown at UCLA in 1981 as part of a traveling exhibition.  </P></p>

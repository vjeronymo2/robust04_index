			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE'  </P> <P> I am a hemodialysis patient who depends on dialysis three times a week to  survive.  </P> <P> Medicare has informed us who dialyze at home that Congress has cut costs by 50%  on Method II dialysis which will affect many dialysis patients like myself.  This will mean going back to a unit where the care is not as good as what you  receive at home. What upsets me is reading in the paper where President Bush  has approved salary increases of up to 35% for top government workers and yet  has done nothing to solve this Medicare crisis. All I can say is where is the  justice by doing this?  </P> <P> DEBORAH CARRILLO  </P> <P> Lakewood  </P></p>

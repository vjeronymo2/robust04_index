			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Svirin] </F>   [Excerpt] Beijing, 18 May -- A visit to China by a Russian  parliamentary delegation led by Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the  State Duma, ended today. The legislators from the Russian  Federation made their last stop on the way from Beijing to  Moscow at the Shenzhen free economic zone in the south of the  country, which is always being called "the experimental  laboratory of the Chinese reforms and openness policy."    The visit, which took place at the invitation of the  Standing  Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, has been  successful, Ivan Rybkin said before leaving Shenzhen by air. In  an interview with this ITAR-TASS correspondent he noted that  careful familiarization with the situation in China would  certainly help Russians be more attentive to the experience of  their great neighbor and "to adjust their approach to reforms."    For example, he explained, Russia is interested in the  working of the Shenzhen legislators, who have been granted by  the "superior body" -- the country's parliament -- the right to  draw up and pass acts of legislation independently. Of no less  importance is the legislation itself, thanks to which China has,  in the reform years, attracted to the zone foreign investment to  the tune of $14,400 million. This topic, as well as bilateral  economic cooperation, will be discussed during the forthcoming  visit to China by Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian  Federation Government.    In the words of Ivan Rybkin, an understanding has been  reached with the leadership of the free economic zone concerning  a visit by a group of Russian members of parliament to Shenzhen  through the channels of "people's diplomacy," and also on  sending some of our industrialists, business people, and bankers  there "to enhance their qualifications."    "There is no doubt about the desire of the Chinese side to  develop mutually profitable cooperation with Russia, and the  friendliness of the officials who received us was sincere," he  assured journalists.

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: MOSCOW;  </P> <P> A VISITOR FROM BEIJING  </P> <P> China's Premier Li Peng, who is now in Moscow, is expected to reach agreement  with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders on troop  reductions along the Sino-Soviet border and expanded economic ties.  </P> <P> Li's visit, which runs through Thursday, is an outgrowth of Gorbachev's visit  to Beijing last May, which ended 30 years of Chinese-Soviet estrangement.  </P> <P> Although still ideological foes, both sides need better relations. China lost  international trade after the Tian An Men massacre last June. And the Soviets  are eager to demobilize tens of thousands of men on the Chinese border and put  them to work as Gorbachev rebuilds his economy.  </P></p>

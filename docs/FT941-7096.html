			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Gardiner to face 92 Group contest Sir George Gardiner, Conservative MP for Reigate, is to be challenged as chairman of the rightwing 92 Group. With nominations for next month's elections due to have been submitted by last night, MPs familiar with the process said Sir Anthony Durant, the MP for Reading West, was expected to emerge as Sir George's principal challenger. Ballot papers will be sent out next week. The challenge follows group members' vociferous condemnation of the way a meeting with Mr John Major was handled, after the prime minister had been angered by publicity suggesting that he was being offered terms for his survival as leader. A delegation of 92 Group MPs emerged chastened from Mr Major's Commons office within minutes of arriving to demand urgent changes, although Sir George insisted that it was not 'a brush off'. The very fact that an election is being held could be interpreted as a sign of diminished confidence in Sir George, as ballots are held only at members' discretion.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Russia restores import tariffs Russia is to reimpose import tariffs on a range of imported foodstuffs next month, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, said yesterday. Mr Gaidar said the tariffs would be low - but the move is a further sign of an increasing tendency on behalf of the government, including reformist leaders like Mr Gaidar, to protect Russian industry from foreign competition at a time when the demands of industrial lobbies are being pushed hard. Mr Gaidar, as head of the Russia's Choice political group, is particularly vulnerable to calls for protection - having already promised the commercial banks relief from competition from foreign entrants to the Russian banking market. A gathering of business leaders in the Enterprises for a New Russia group which supports the Party of Russian Unity and Agreement, yesterday called for further protection for the fledgling private businesses - and for a relief from taxes which, the group's leaders said, sometimes surpassed the level of profits. Mr Gaidar said that 'with a responsible majority' in parliament, inflation could quickly be brought down to around 15 per cent a month from its present levels of more than 20 per cent a month. At the same time, the budget deficit for the last quarter of this year, which it had been hoped would be contained to Rbs5,500bn is set to grow to more than Rbs10,000bn, according to Mr Oleg Soskovets, another first deputy prime minister. Part of the increase, he said, was because of miners threatening to strike over unpaid wages, and to make good the debts of enterprises. The cabinet is now showing considerable signs of disarray, as ministers  - who have become leading figures in competing political group - find themselves unable to keep their differences out of the business of government. Two leading ministers - Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for finance, and Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, are clashing over which of them now has responsibility for talks on debt and on relations with the international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The latest opinion poll for the election, from the All-Russia Centre for Research into Public Opinion, suggests Russia's Choice has a strong lead of 25.7 per cent - with the Yabloko bloc of Mr Grigory Yavlinsky at 17.9 per cent, the Communist party on 6.6 per cent, the Democratic party on 6.4 per cent, and the remaining nine parties far behind.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DION: THE WANDERER FINDS HIS WAY HOME;  </P> <P> NEW ROCK ALBUM EXORCISES YEARS OF DRUGS, INSECURITIES  </P> <P> Well, I was wise in my own eyes  </P> <P>  I awoke one day and I realized  </P> <P>  You know this attitude comes from cocaine lies.  </P> <P>  -- Lyrics by Dion and Bill Tuohy  </P> <P> On the day after he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Dion  DiMucci sat in an Italian restaurant near Times Square and spoke about how  drugs almost ruined his life.  </P> <P> Dion, 49, had recently completed his first secular album in a decade, and on  the record's key moments he sounds as if he's still exorcising some of the pain  he felt in those drug-plagued years. Titled "Yo Frankie," the album is due  Tuesday from Arista Records.  </P> <P> But Dion's words at the restaurant didn't represent yet another tale of how  someone struggled all his life to achieve fame, only to get involved with drugs  and see the success all slip away.  </P> <P> In Dion's case (DiMucci has always been known professionally by just his first  name), the involvement with drugs began well before he broke onto the pop scene  in the late '50s with such classic hits as "A Teenager in Love" and "The  Wanderer."  </P> <P> Raised on the mean streets of the Bronx, Dion turned to drugs and gangs in a  search for confidence and self-esteem.  </P> <P> He was hooked on heroin at 15, survived an overdose at 16 and eventually formed  a vocal group, the Belmonts, that was named after an avenue in the  neighborhood. The quartet's snappy "I Wonder Why" was a hit in 1958 for tiny  Laurie Records, and Dion was off on a hectic pop merry-go-round that lasted  more than a decade.  </P> <P> With the Belmonts and then on his own, Dion registered a dozen Top 10 hits. He  was rivaled perhaps only by Bobby Darin as the '50s' most compelling young  white singer outside of the Southern brigade of Elvis and Jerry Lee.  </P> <P> Columbia Records was so impressed in 1962 that the industry giant signed Dion  to a five-year contract for $500,000 -- a staggering commitment, considering  that RCA had paid less than $50,000 seven years earlier for Elvis Presley's  contract.  </P> <P> But it was a confusing period for Dion. He loved rock 'n' roll, but industry  hotshots kept telling him that rock was just a fad -- kid stuff. If he was  serious about a career, they said, he'd have to move over into the adult pop  arena.  </P> <P> Even back at Laurie Records, he had been encouraged to sing old pop standards,  including "Fools Rush In" and "One for My Baby," and dress up in a sport jacket  and a silk ascot for the cover photo of his first solo album.  </P> <P> The pressures and the drugs had caught up with Dion by the mid-'60s, turning  his life into a nightmare darkened by thoughts of suicide. Alienated, Dion  moved to Florida in 1968 with his wife and baby daughter in hopes of rebuilding  his life.  </P> <P> "I made $2 million by the age of 22 . . . had 10 top 10 records . . . was at  the height of my profession," Dion said about those early days during the  restaurant interview.  </P> <P> "I had all the bases covered. . . . Fame, fortune and romance. I had even  married my childhood sweetheart. But I was empty. I was looking out the  penthouse window and saying, 'What the hell is wrong?' What I finally  discovered was that I had others' esteem, but I didn't have self-esteem."  </P> <P>  Schools gave me nothing needed  </P> <P>  To my throne, I proceeded  </P> <P>  Every warning went unheeded.  </P> <P>  Yeah, king of the New York streets  </P> <P>  -- From Dion's "King of the New York Streets."  </P> <P> Dion was at an unpretentious family-style restaurant to shoot a video for his  new album. The idea was to show him in the old milieu which is reflected in new  songs such as "King of the New York Streets."  </P> <P> The restaurant is several miles from the Bronx intersection of 187th Street and  Cortina Avenue -- the real center of Dion's world in the '50s. But the  atmosphere was similar enough for the video. You get a sense there is sometimes  trouble in this neighborhood, too, when you notice that the Guardian Angels  hotline number is written in much bigger letters on the wall near the pay phone  than the police department's emergency number.  </P> <P> Despite his tough-guy past, Dion seemed unusually patient and soft-spoken. He  appeared very much at peace with himself.  </P> <P> Wearing his ever-present cap, Dion smiled warmly when some restaurant employees  asked for an autograph. Back home in Boca Raton, Fla., where he lives with his  wife and the youngest of his three daughters, he can go weeks at a time without  anyone recognizing him.  </P> <P> But Dion is part of the pop history of New York. When he stepped outside the  restaurant for a photo, a man in his 30s spotted him immediately. The passer-by  said he had read in the paper about the Hall of Fame dinner and asked if Dion  was going to have a new album soon.  </P> <P> "Yeah, pretty soon," Dion said. "Hope you like it."  </P> <P> "Well, I still love 'The Wanderer.' Got anything like that in it?"  </P> <P> "These are new songs, but yeah," Dion replied. "There's a song like 'The  Wanderer' but it's like about a guy bragging about his girl, not about  himself."  </P> <P> "Sounds cool," the fan said as he reached into his pocket for a piece of paper.  He, too, wanted an autograph.  </P> <P> Dion fell in love with country music at an early age, and before he was in his  teens he sometimes sang at social clubs and local bars. Later, Dion fell in  love with rock 'n' roll -- both the rockabilly sounds coming out of Memphis and  the doo-wop vocal harmonizing associated with New York street corners.  </P> <P> In his 1988 biography, "The Wanderer," Dion described the excitement of having  his own hit record. "One minute we were four mooks on the street, the next,  everyone wanted to get close to us. . . . You never wanted it to stop, and the  only way to keep it going, it seemed to us, was to smile, sing and try to sort  it all out later."  </P> <P> There was a vocal swagger in his most memorable recordings, including "The  Wanderer" and "Ruby Baby," that defined New York cool so well that Lou Reed --  the epitome of New York cool to later generations of rock fans -- reminisced at  the Hall of Fame induction dinner about how much Dion's records meant to him.  </P> <P> Almost immediately after their first hit, "I Wonder Why," Dion &amp; the  Belmonts were on Dick Clark's "American Bandstand" TV show and touring the  country with Buddy Holly and Richie Valens (he turned down an offer to join  Holly, Valens and the Big Bopper on the fatal 1959 plane ride).  </P> <P> It's hard to imagine those years being anything but thrilling, but the memories  eventually became painful for Dion. He felt such shame about the period that he  refused to sing the early hits.  </P> <P> "When the light finally shined through, I realized the shame had nothing to do  with the songs," he said in the restaurant. "To be honest, I think the shame  was way before I even started drugs. I think it came from my whole background.  I just never felt right about myself.  </P> <P> "There was never a word of praise in my house. . . . A lot of demeaning talk  and criticism. I never felt good about myself -- and the success didn't change  things."  </P> <P> The turning point in rebuilding his life, Dion said, came shortly after he  moved to Florida in 1968.  </P> <P> "I had simply run out of excuses," he said. "I was using a lot of drugs,  drinking heavily and I just looked up to the heavens and said, 'God, help me'  and He did. In a split second, the compulsion and the obsession to drink and  drug came right out of me.  </P> <P> "I started to read the Bible and different spiritual writings and I started to  see that my values came from how much God loves me, not from how many records I  sell."  </P> <P> After embracing Christianity in 1968, he gave up drugs and continued to make  records. The poignant "Abraham, Martin and John" was a Top 10 hit in 1968, but  his folk-flavored albums for Warner Bros. in the '70s went largely unnoticed,  and Dion spent most of the '80s singing and recording on the gospel music  circuit.  </P> <P> The return to the pop world began on an emotional night in the summer of 1987.  Some old friends at a New York radio station asked Dion if he wanted to be part  of an oldies show at Radio City Music Hall.  </P> <P> His first instinct was to say no, but Dion saw the evening as a way to make  peace with himself and his past. It was time to stop blaming the songs for his  early pain.  </P> <P> Mitchell Cohen, now vice president of East Coast artists and repertoire for  Arista Records, was in the audience that night and later contacted Dion.  </P> <P> "For me, that evening was like coming full circle," Cohen, 38, explained in a  separate interview. "Dion was the headliner on the first rock show I ever saw .  . . 1961 at the Brooklyn Paramount. It just struck me that night (at Radio  City) that he was still a performer with a tremendous amount of vitality and  commitment.  </P> <P> "When we got together later, he said he was doing some songwriting and he gave  us the impression that he was ready to take another shot."  </P> <P> With English rocker Dave Edmunds as producer, Dion went into the studio last  year and recorded "Yo Frankie." He wrote or co-wrote seven of the 10 tunes.  </P> <P> Some of the tracks seem too polished and predictable, but the heart of the  album -- including the playful nostalgia of "Written on the Subway Walls" and,  especially, the wry introspection of "King of the New York Streets" -- bursts  forth with a sense of triumph and survival.  </P> <P> The album's most poignant moment may be Dion's version of a tender 1974 Tom  Waits song. Though it was written as "San Diego Serenade," Dion likes to think  of the tune as "New York Serenade" because, he said, it seems to summarize so  well his feelings about not realizing what you've got until it's gone.  </P> <P> The song's opening lines:  </P> <P>  Never saw the morning till I stayed up all night  </P> <P>  Never saw the sunshine until I turned out the light  </P> <P>  Never saw my hometown till I stayed away too long  </P> <P>  And I never heard the melody till I needed the song  </P> <P>  Dion's early hits alone would have been reason enough for record executives at  the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction dinner here in January to give the  singer a standing ovation when he walked on stage to accept the honor. But the  executives' applause also seemed to acknowledge Dion's struggle.  </P> <P> Sitting in the restaurant the next day, he said: "Last night was great because  . . . you are in the business 30 years, and songs are like a diary in which you  share yourself with people. . . . Your love, your hates, your joys, your  dreams. The applause was like everyone saying, 'Hey, you touched us' . . . . It  was a validation after all those years of people telling me in the beginning  that my music and all rock 'n' roll was somehow illegitimate."  </P> <P> Dion, who's looking forward to touring this summer, paused. He seemed to want  to make sure the reporter didn't think that music again was becoming the way he  measured his worth.  </P> <P> "I feel very grateful," Dion said finally. "I've been married to the girl of my  dreams for 25 years and we have three healthy children that love me. The music  is only part of me. It just happens to be what other people see.  </P> <P> "I can't tell you all the times I've had people look at me like I was an  8-by-10 glossy of someone who existed 10 or 20 years ago. They are talking to  an image that they think they know. It's like Bob Dylan said: 'Just because  they know my record, they don't know me.' The important thing for someone in  this business is to realize that distinction . . . not to get into thinking you  are that 8-by-10 glossy."  </P></p>

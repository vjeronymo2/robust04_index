			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / From Prussia with love: New Year's Day in Berlin, a plot is hatched against sterling SAVAGELY, Rathbone stamped his feet. The night was cold, growing colder. High above the Brandenburg Gate, the moon glowed hazily, casting an eggshell sheen across the clouds, as if a cosmic decorator had splattered a tin of white paint around the Berlin sky. The second day of January was a crazy time to call a board meeting of the European Central Bank, Rathbone reflected fiercely. But then 2002 had been a crazy year. And crazy men were running European money these days. They talked of unity. Didn't they know everything was falling apart? Rathbone gazed across the floodlit Reichstag square to the hulk of the bank headquarters. Central, the staff called it. Their chairman, Mercator von Stabil, had summoned the representatives of the 33 states making up European monetary union to Berlin. Impatiently crushing his cigarette, Rathbone pondered the events of the past 12 months. As the Bank of England's accredited observer at Central, he had suffered a nerve-wracking time following the birth of the EuroMark at the Potsdam Convention. Central had moved into the old Reichsbank building. The Germans had chosen the shareholders. England was not among them. The Germans were, after all, paying most of the bills. And the costs were mounting. Forging monetary union among the 'Europe of 33' - stretching to Ukraine and Konigsberg, down to Bulgaria across to Wallonia and Flanders, and then south to Piedmont and Lombardy - had proved more onerous than expected. Scotland, lured by the offer of Robert Burns's head on the smaller denomination notes, had decided to join, not long after the 1999 Act of Disunion. England had its consolation prize: observer status at Central, thanks to its presidency of the Zweitesonderleistungsuntergruppe, the Zslugs, which consisted of other peripheral nations such as Wales, Albania, Moldova, Macedonia and Mezzogiorno. Rathbone had moved to Berlin a year ago. In London, the Bank of England, now independent, was shedding staff. Better a hard currency posting on Berlin Station than fresh uncertainty in the City, his wife had said. A few weeks later, she had left him for the Citibank options merchant with the liquid crystal signet ring. With a spasm of anger, Rathbone recalled her parting jibe. 'Once a field man, always a field man.' Rathbone scanned his miniaturised range-forward directory. At Threadneedle Academy, he had learned his trade well. Stealth. Intrigue. The long years in Signals and Targeting; the cover-up techniques in Supervision. He gripped his official pass, allowing him through the Central guardpost. He had access to the Data Rooms. He could even attend lower-grade meetings, where von Stabil and the others regarded him with the amused condescension the English used to reserve for their butlers. Rathbone's chief adversary was Gustav d'Exchange, the French managing director, who dyed his hair and dropped puns from the corner of his mouth. He did not need their sympathy. He had his wire taps. The infra-red sensors, linked to the high-powered battery in his Jag. The network of microfilm drops in no-man's-land. And then there was Sum. Rathbone's mouth moistened at the thought of her. The governor of the Bank of Estonia, a member of the Central board. He had once asked Control, should he call her governess? Sum Fluuctuatin had won acclaim for her currency model work at Tallinn. She liked Englishmen. Especially, thin ones with a wounded look in their eyes. Who used to admire the deft and elegant way she would slip into a more comfortable parity. Sum's office on Central's executive suite shared a connecting door with von Stabil's. Rathbone smiled mirthlessly. His secret - and hers. Control knew more about what went on at Central than its own shareholders. It was almost as if England had opted for monetary union after all. Dawn crawled through the city's snow-covered towers and rooftops. Rathbone watched the fleet of Mercedes drawing up outside Central. He counted to 33. Then he moved fast, sheltered between the lumbering Diskontsatz, the governor of the Bank of Slovakia, and old O'Flynn from the Vatican Bank. The delegations jostled through the portals up to the sixth floor boardroom. A huge chamber like a brightly-lit car park, hung with coloured blodges of modern painting. Rathbone squeezed into one of the individually-tiled marble lavatories, where governors were often closetted. Rathbone gasped. Into the boardroom strolled a figure never before indicated on Sum's computer lists: Rodney Slyde, the chief executive of the Bank of England] Dimly, Rathbone could recall the old pre-independence governors: noble characters of lordly bearing. Turn to Page XVI Tinker, tailor, soldier, currency speculator continued from page I Slyde was not like them. He had a face like a young crocodile, and a nose for business. Slyde had made his name in privatisation. English banknotes, with the new dragon motif, were now printed in Hong Kong. What in the name of Montagu Norman was Slyde doing here? On his ultra-sound intercept, Rathbone strained to pick up the conversation. Von Stabil's accented words sent fear jangling through him. 'We are so pleased, Mr Slyde, that you agree our little plan. We sell all our English government bonds. The Commonwealth join us. Sterling sinks. We offer a conversion rate. 1 Mark for 35 English pounds. You will have a seat on the board] At last, true Europeans you will become] Your interest we have it, in our hearts]' Von Stabil's eyes glistened, a sea of cunning; his words took on a pantomimic ring: 'The time, Mr Slyde, we must fix. I opine: January 6]' Rathbone reeled. That day, the markets would be preoccupied by the Wise Men's annual report. Central planned to take over the pound] To force England into monetary union] To think that Slyde would descend to this treachery] Suddenly, a whiff of camphor told Rathbone he was no longer alone. D'Exchange appeared in the doorway, flanked by Sellem Lowe, central's chief trader, hired from the City's vilest currency pits. 'My dear Rathone,' intoned D'Exchange, 'You are well beyond your limits. At this stage, intervention is obligatory]' Rathbone winced at d'Exchange's nasal drawl. 'Lowe, deal with him]' Grinning, Sellem drew his concealed hedging instrument. Crude. But highly effective. Rathbone was aware of mist descending, as suddenly as the stop of a heartbeat. The throbbing became less insistent. He was in Swapp's Bar] His old haunt, run by Karl Swapp, an ex-Polski Bank man, whose corpulent frame Rathbone could now discern, oozing like a flow of lava from a battered armchair. Sum must have dragged him here with the aid of Marginali, the southern bank chief with a reputation for instability. Rathbone recognised the usual crowd. There was Vendor, the out-of-work Belgian bond salesman. Bleache, the sallow money laundering expert. Window, the Nederlandsche Bank functionary whose all-too-open discounting facilities had caused such trouble] Swapp rolled over. 'You haf problems, Mr Rathbone?' he inquired. 'I know zese central bankers, zey all same. Since zey left gold standard, zey drifting.' Swapp spat: 'Zey want to get you down] To discredit you] Zey want to crush your value]' Weakly, Rathbone tried to realign his thoughts. He could try to make the Embassy at Karlshorst, but the road would be under multilateral surveillance. He could call up the old allies in Washington, but, of late, Reserve had turned to reluctance. He must get on to Slyde] But a stifled scream from Sum told him: again, too late] 'You always were a fool, Rathbone,' the chief executive purred, striding into the dive, flanked by pink-coated henchmen. 'Of course, we do not act alone. I am no more independent than the rest of them here. I was on the phone to the government at Blenheim Palace this morning. Do not believe the wording in the treaty. We all take instructions]' Rathbone's brain flicked through all the training manuals he had ever read. If there was a time for a U-turn, this was it] He pictured Sum beside him at the Bank's safe house at Roehampton. All thought of rebellion ebbed away. He took the girl's hand, and led her from the bar. No-one intervened. Outside, the traffic stilled. The countdown had already started. At least, they would never have to worry about exchange rates, any more.</p>

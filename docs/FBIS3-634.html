The National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA] rebels continue to  prepare a large-scale attack on the city of Cuito. The local  press learned this from Captain Jorge Regresso, spokesman of the  Angolan Armed Forces command, in the region.    According to the source, over the past few weeks, Savimbi's  men have been carrying out constant movements of troops and war  materiel from Andulo District and Huambo Province. They have  also been planting mines, and kidnapping and assaulting  civilians.    Jorge Regresso also said that more than 16 night flights,  carrying large quantities of war materiel to Andulo, were  registered from January to March.</p>

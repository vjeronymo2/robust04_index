The winds have been unfavorable for them ever since the  Right returned to power and Edouard Balladur became prime  minister. The reversal in their fortunes, however, probably  occurred one year earlier, in the regional and cantonal  elections of March 1992. The regional election had been a  psychological blow; the departmental election, a political blow.    At a time when it is holding its ninth party congress--two  months before the cantonal elections, four and one-half months  before the European elections, and 15 months before the normal  date of the presidential election--the party of the far right is  seeing all the indicators of its popularity and credibility move  from the black into the red, so to speak.    The poll conducted by SOFRES [French Opinion Polling  Company]  for LE MONDE and RTL [Luxembourg Radio Television system]  reveals a sharp decline in the attraction that the National  Front exerts on public opinion. Support for Le Pen's ideas has  dropped 13 points since the previous comparable poll--published  in our columns in October 1991--which heralded what might be  construed as an hour of glory for Le Penism following six months  of the administration of Edith Cresson.    Over a period of 27 months, that support has dropped from 32  percent--a record--to 19 percent, a rating that takes the Le Pen  movement back to its level of October 1987 or September 1990.  The decline in this support had already been recorded in a June  1993 poll taken by SOFRES for the provincial press[.sup]1[/]  (Poll taken from 5 to 8 June 1993 of a sample consisting of  1,000 persons): this poll gave the movement a 23 percent rating.  The three-year decline is continuing today and reflects--in the  same proportions--the increasing repulsion felt toward Le Pen's  theses.  <H5>  Partisan and Racist </H5>   Of the voters on the right side of the spectrum, 29 percent  said they were "in agreement" with Le Pen's ideas--a spectacular  drop of 25 points from the figure obtained in the October 1991  poll. Among the voters on the left, the "disagreement"--which  had reached its lowest point in 1991 (84 percent) and rose to 88  percent in the June 1993 poll--now stood at 91 percent.    Within the electorate as a whole, Le Pen continues to record  a very high level of disapproval for the positions he has taken  on all of his favorite issues (see accompanying table). Among  RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-French Union for Democracy]  voters, however, he continues to enjoy strong support on three  issues: immigration, the defense of traditional values, and law  and order.    On the other hand, these same conservative voters do not at  all appreciate those of Le Pen's positions that concern them  directly and--in fact--appreciate them much less than does the  electorate as a whole. For example, his criticism of the two  majority parties is disapproved by 75 percent of French voters  as a whole and by 85 percent of the voters of the right, while  his criticism of the Balladur administration is disapproved by  76 percent and 84 percent, respectively.    An even more serious problem for the president of the  National Front is the fact that his supporters are confused by  the attitude he has adopted toward the government--an attitude  that they feel reflects the absence of a policy line. Whereas 7  percent of them believe the party of the far right and its  leader support the administration and 11 percent believe the  opposite, 68 percent perceive neither support nor hostility (14  percent have no opinion).    When invited to express their preference, one-third of the  Le  Pen voters say they would like to see their party support  Balladur (compared to 14 percent of French voters as a whole)  and 7 percent would rather have it oppose him (compared to 6  percent for all French voters), whereas 47 percent express  indifference (compared to 65 percent for all French voters) and  14 percent have no opinion (compared to 15 percent for all  French voters).  <H5>  Increased Presence in the Field </H5>   Above all, these figures reflect the existence, among the  public, of a certain lack of interest--perhaps temporary,  perhaps definitive--in a party that had dreamed of elevating its  status in French society, as had been promised by Bruno Megret,  delegate general of the National Front, during the period  between the controversy of the Islamic veils in October 1989 and  the elections of March 1992.    Paradoxically, although these figures reflect a decline in  support and interest on the part of the public vis-a-vis the  National Front, they are accompanied by an increased attitude of  apprehension toward that party. Following a period during which  opinions remained stable (October 1987 to June 1993), more  French voters than ever (73 percent) now regard Le Pen and his  movement as a threat to democracy.    The Le Pen movement is seeing its influence undermined  simultaneously by a lack of support on the part of some and by  mistrust on the part of others. This is all the more disturbing  for the leader of " French France" in that his party is  perceived to be more partisan (85 percent compared to 78 percent  in 1991); more distant from the people (60 percent compared to  49 percent); more racist (87 percent compared to 81 percent);  and less capable of governing (86 percent compared to 76  percent). This general decline, however, is accompanied--in the  field--by an increased presence of Le Pen cadres in anticipation  of the cantonal elections of next March. Moreover, Le Pen can  always tell himself that in October 1987--six months before the  presidential election in which he obtained 14.39 percent of the  votes--public support for his ideas was at the same level as  today.  <H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5> <H5>  Figures and Table of Organization </H5>   The National Front claims to have 80,000 members. A total of  1,650 de jure delegates (members of the Political Bureau and of  the Central Committee; members of regional councils; European  deputies; and departmental secretaries) and officials elected by  the departmental federations are scheduled to participate in the  ninth party congress, to be held from 4 to 6 February.    The Jurisdictions. The delegates to the party congress  directly elect the president of the National Front. They also  vote for the members of the 100-member Central Committee, and  the president can personally appoint 20 additional delegates.  The Central Committee then proceeds to elect the Political  Bureau from a short list submitted by the president of the  movement.    The Leaders. Jean-Marie Le Pen has held the post of  president  of the National Front ever since the party was created in 1972,  and is the sole candidate to succeed himself. He is surrounded  by a vice president (Dominique Chaboche), a delegate general  (Bruno Magret), and a secretary general (Carl Lang), all  appointed by him. This executive bureau is scheduled to be  "confirmed" in office. The political bureau, which by statute  consists of 30 members, is to be "enlarged," probably to 35  members including Samuel Marechal, director of the National  Front Youth organization. For his part, Roland Gaucher has not  requested reappointment either to the Central Committee or to  the Political Bureau.    The Elected Officials. The National Front has 10 European  deputies, who are members of the technical group of the European  right-wing movements (14 seats). Although the party has no  deputy or senator in the French Parliament, it won 239 seats in  the 1992 regional elections--an increase of approximately 100  seats over the figure for the preceding election in 1986.  Between the two elections the party lost more than one-quarter  of its regional elected officials [as published]. It counts in  its ranks three members of departmental councils (one in La  Manche, one in Alpes-Maritimes, and one in Bouches-du-Rhone) and  claims slightly fewer than 1,000 members of municipal councils.  In a by-election, it lost the only city with a population of  more than 10,000 that it governed: Saint-Gilles, in Gard  Department.    Table 1.

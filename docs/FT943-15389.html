			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mannesmann chief fires final salvo at critics Anxious shareholders yesterday heard Mr Werner Dieter refute what he called 'grotesque' charges that he had lined his own pockets while chief executive of Mannesmann, one of Germany's largest companies. Speaking to the annual meeting for the last time before his planned resignation, Mr Dieter insisted he would not allow himself to become the victim of a press smear campaign. He told shareholders he had received an anonymous letter in November warning him that a campaign would be launched against any attempts to become chairman of the supervisory board, the non-executive board which oversees management. The Dusseldorf state prosecutor began an investigation last week into allegations in Der Spiegel, he weekly news magazine, that Mr Dieter forced Rexroth, a Mannesmann subsidiary, to buy products at inflated prices from Hydac, a company largely owned by Mr Dieter's family. The allegations have attracted prominent press coverage, coming on the heels of a variety of other scandals this year. In an unusual move, police were called to be on hand at yesterday's meeting because of Mannesmann management fears that left-wing extremists would try to interrupt proceedings. As it happened, their presence was unnecessary. Mr Dieter, 64, has been chief executive of the group since 1985. He will be succeeded by Mr Joachim Funk, the finance director. Although Mr Dieter goes on to become an ordinary member of the supervisory board, he said he would seek the board chairmanship once external auditors had presented their report into the allegations. Turnover for the year was expected to reach DM30bn (Dollars 19.1bn), up from DM27.96bn in 1993 when the group lost DM513m. Turnover in the first six months was up 10 per cent to DM14.3bn, exceeding analysts' expectations. Orders in the same period totalled DM16.8bn, 19 per cent higher than a year ago. The group's D2 mobile telephone network, one of two in Germany and the group's fastest growing unit, now had 700,000 customers, up from 580,000 at the end of May, the meeting heard. The links between Rexroth, an engineering company, and Hydac, which makes magnets and hydraulics accessories, 'were interesting for both companies', Mr Dieter said. Mr Dieter had held a 30 per cent stake in Rexroth, but sold this when he moved to Mannesmann. This, he said, was proof that he had sought to avoid a conflict of interest. However, several small shareholders said any suggestion that Mr Dieter might have benefited from his position as chief executive should rule him out of a position on the supervisory board.</p>

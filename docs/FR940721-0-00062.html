			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mazda stated that it believes proposed calculation method would impose too much burden on manufacturers, and recommended that NHTSA permit manufacturers to use U.S./Canadian parts content of a specific representative model within a carline, e.g., best selling model, as the parts content of the carline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA does not disagree with the concept of permitting simplified procedures for estimating U.S./Canadian content, if such procedures would always ensure reliable results. However, the procedures suggested by the commenters, which are based on either a high volume configuration or best selling model, would not appear to always ensure meaningful results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, as discussed above, vehicles within a carline may be assembled in both the U.S./Canada and a foreign country. If the high volume configuration or best selling model was produced in the U.S./Canada and the rest of the carline was produced in a foreign country, content calculations based on the portion of the carline assembled in the U.S./Canada would not be representative of the carline as a whole. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes it would inappropriate to permit simplified procedures that could produce unreliable results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Procedure for Determining Major Foreign Sources of Passenger Motor Vehicle Equipment (Section 583.7) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the NPRM, item two on the label, listing the main foreign sources of a carline's equipment, is necessary only if one or more foreign countries (i.e., countries other than the U.S./Canada) individually contribute at least 15 percent of the value of the carline's equipment. If there is one such country, the manufacturer must list that country and the percentage by value that originated in that country for the carline. If there are two such countries, the manufacturer must list those countries and the percentage by value that originated in those countries for the carline, in descending order of percentage. Manufacturers need not list more than two such countries. As with the first item on the label, much of the information that manufacturers need to calculate the information for the second item must come from parts suppliers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA proposed a specific procedure in &sect;583.7 of the proposed regulation for determining major foreign sources of passenger motor vehicle equipment. The section specified the same procedure for determining the value of items of equipment as &sect;583.7, and also specified procedures for determining the country of origin of items of equipment and for determining the percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment which is attributable to individual countries other than the U.S. and Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA noted in the NPRM that the statute does not specify how country of origin is determined for purposes of item two on the label. The agency tentatively concluded that the simplest method would be to specify one country of origin for each item of equipment, using the country from which the greatest share of value originated for the item of equipment. The agency noted that this is the method that Congress prescribed for the only other country of origin calculation in section 210, i.e., country of origin for engines and transmissions in section 210(f)(12). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford commented that due to differences in calculation methods for U.S./Canadian and foreign content, it would be possible for the sum of the domestic and foreign label values of a vehicle to be either over 100 percent or zero percent, thereby causing confusion to consumers. That company suggested an alternative method for determining country of origin which, among other things, would attribute the total value of outside supplied equipment that contains less than 70 percent value added in the U.S./Canada to the country other than the U.S./Canada which contributed the greatest amount of value to that item. Ford stated that if the agency did not adopt its recommendation, it should clarify that the sum of U.S./Canadian content is considered one country, to preclude the classification of an item of equipment that is more than 50 percent U.S./Canadian to be classified as a foreign item of equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chrysler argued that the proposed regulation could result in an anomaly. It stated, among other things, that under the proposed method for determining country of origin, the country of origin could be the U.S. or Canada in situations where U.S./Canadian content is less than 70 percent. Chrysler recommended an alternative method for determining foreign country of origin. The method would only consider passenger motor vehicle equipment that contains less than 70 percent valued added in the U.S./Canada, and would consider the foreign value of the equipment to be its value multiplied by the percent of content that originated outside of the U.S. and Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota stated that a ``greatest share of value originated'' test for purposes of item two on the label would represent a new and different test that is inconsistent with all other origin tests in use. Toyota stated that it believes that imposing this test would result in more work for suppliers with no benefit to the consumer. That company stated that if this test is used at all, it should be confined to instances in which the country of origin of passenger motor vehicle equipment, as determined for Customs purposes, is unknown and cannot be determined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW commented that with regard to foreign parts content calculations and country of origin certification, NHTSA should incorporate an alternative means to allow manufacturers with existing, substantial business records to use these records as proof of foreign content to comply with the requirements. That company argued that without such an alternative, NHTSA would be imposing an unnecessary burden which would be increased further due to language barriers. BMW stated that it already has a system in place to handle customs duties and preferential treatment of goods with Germany and the EC jurisdiction which provides information on more than 400,000 active BMW parts. That manufacturer stated that by using the parts database and by inputting the appropriate parameters for a given group of vehicles, it can receive information that could be utilized to complete the calculations for the foreign parts content of Item Two on the label. BMW stated that while the wording of the definition of country of origin for customs purposes does not match the language in the NPRM verbatim, the practical use of either definition essentially would be the same for calculating the foreign content of Item Two. BMW acknowledged that circumstances would not be precluded where the country of origin would be different given the two definitions, but argued that these exceptions will not influence the accuracy of the calculated percentages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, the agency has decided to make changes in &sect;583.7 to prevent the possibility that the specified U.S./Canadian content and major sources of foreign content for a carline will together exceed 100 percent and to provide greater flexibility concerning determination of country of origin for purposes of item two of the label. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the first two items on the label provide parts content percentages for the U.S./Canada and for up to two major sources of foreign parts content. For example, a label might indicate the following parts content percentages: U.S./Canada, 50%; Japan, 20%; and Mexico, 15%. Since the label does not purport to indicate all sources of content, the percentages are not expected to add up to 100%. However, the agency agrees that consumers would be confused if the numbers added up to more than 100 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One way to prevent the numbers from adding up to more than 100 percent would be to specify a procedure for determining country of origin for item two of the label that is more closely tied to the statutory method for determining U.S./Canadian content. However, such a procedure would necessarily be very complicated, given certain aspects of the procedure for determining U.S./Canadian content, e.g., the roll-up, roll-down provision for outside suppliers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Section V also obligates Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. to distribute within 60 days from entry of the Final Judgment, a copy of the Final Judgment to all officers and employees responsible for approving, disapproving, monitoring, recommending, or implementing any hourly rate or part price or discount, as well as any officer or employee who succeeds to such a position, and briefing those persons annually on the meaning and requirements of the Final Judgment and the antitrust laws and advising them that the defendant's legal advisors are available to confer with them regarding compliance with the Final Judgment and the antitrust laws. Further the Antitrust Compliance Officer must obtain from each such officer or employee, annual written certifications stating that he or she: (1) Has read, understands, and agrees to abide by the terms of the Final Judgment; (2) has been advised and understands that his or her failure to comply with the Final Judgment may result in conviction for criminal contempt of court; and (3) is not aware of any violation of the Final Judgment that has not been reported to the Antitrust Compliance Officer.

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Scottish TUC rejects incomes policy UNIONS yesterday reinforced their opposition to wage restraint under a Labour government amid controversy over whether Labour's proposed national economic assessment (NEA) would amount to an incomes policy. Unions voted nearly unanimously at the Scottish Trades Union Congress to reject 'incomes policy in whatever shape or guise it may be advocated', but to support Labour's policy review, which advocates an annual economic assessment involving unions along with employers and the government. Labour has specifically rejected an incomes policy, but some unions fear union particpation in the NEA may lead to the introduction of wage restraint. Yesterday, Usdaw, the shop workers' union, was the only union not to support the motion, on the ground that a national minimum wage under a Labour government would be a form of incomes policy that would help low-paid workers across the economy. Open conflict was avoided when the UCW communication workers' union agreed not to force a vote on a separate motion calling for synchronisation of pay bargaining. The vote followed controversy on the issue last week, when leaders of the AEU engineering union said Labour's plans for a national economic assessment were unsatisfactory as they stood, because they could interfere with collective bargaining. The unity at the STUC was established after negotiations between unions on the form of the motion opposing wage restraint. Before agreeing with the STUC general council not to force a vote on the UCW motion, Mr Alan Tuffin, the union's leader, said that he wanted to 'lay the ghost to rest that somehow this is a recipe for incomes policy or wage restraint'. He said that, if unions were not willing to discuss pay as part of a national economic assessment, their calls for new policies, such as increased spending on training by Labour, would amount to a list of demands that were 'undeliverable', and would lead to disillusion. Mr Ron Todd, TGWU general secretary, said his union would oppose any form of incomes policy. However, he said that unions should stop 'looking under stones for things that are not there' by associating an economic assessment with wage restraint. Mr Garfield Davies, Usdaw general secretary, said a national minimum wage would amount to a helpful form of incomes policy. Wages front, Page 14</p>

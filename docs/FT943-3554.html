			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rise in UK base rates unsettles the Continent It was a day of contrasts among the Continent's markets yesterday. FRANKFURT fell back sharply during an active session. The Dax index sank 30.54 to 2,154.61, moving within a range of 2,140.66 and 2,154.66 during the day. In the post-bourse the Ibis-indicated index gained slightly to 2,155.99. Of the 30 DAX stocks, declining issues outnumbered advances by 26 to 4. Turnover amounted to DM5bn. Lufthansa was actively traded on news, within market expectations, that it was to offer 7.64m new ordinary shares to existing shareholders at a price of DM160. Shareholders would be able to buy one new share for every four held. The airline's shares improved DM3 to DM200. The government is not taking part in the rights issue, so reducing its stake from 51.4 per cent to about 41 per cent. The 3.9m shares which the government will take up will be sold to investors at home and abroad, excluding the US, via a syndicate of international banks led by Dresdner Bank. Bayer dropped DM6.50 to DM368.50 on news that it had paid Dollars 1bn for the right to acquire the North American over-the-counter pharmaceuticals activities of Sterling-Winthrop from SmithKline Beecham. The acquisition includes the right to use the Bayer name in North America, lost some 75 years ago. PARIS overcame a weak opening, following the rise in UK interest rates, on an improvement in the bond market. The CAC-40 index added 17.96 at 1,966.79. Turnover was light at FFr2.5bn. There was further negative news for Saint-Gobain with reports that an executive of a subsidiary was to be questioned by magistrates. However, the shares made ground on expectations of good first-half results being reported on Thursday, firming FFr4 to FFr640. MILAN was lower, awaiting today's meeting between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, and the trades unions over pension reform, and depressed by the UK's move on interest rates. The Comit index weakened 13.70, or 2.1 per cent, to 648.83. Goldman Sachs, which is keeping its rolling 12-month Comit index target unchanged at 800, said it continued to expect the strong earnings momentum and slightly more attractive valuation to support a 17 to 20 per cent total annual return for equities, even though the short term prospects were suffering from a high level of uncertainty over the government's fiscal policy. Olivetti, L52 or 2.6 per cent lower at L1,954, continued to be pressured by worries that first-half results might disappoint the market, and the investigation into the awards of state contracts. Cir, the industrial holding company, gave up a further L47, or 2.4 per cent, to L1,936. Against the trend, Ciga, the luxury hotels group, rose L12 to L1,088. At the weekend, ITT-Sheraton fixed its public buy offer for 367m shares at L1,102 a share. The offer begins next Monday and if successful would leave Sheraton with 70 per cent of Ciga. ZURICH was closed for a local holiday, but prices overcame early weakness in active Basle trading after Wall Street's firm opening. The SMI index, down 17.6 early in the day, finished 0.9 higher at 2,643.0. Banks led the uptrend, with CS Holding putting on SFr7 at SFr563 after the group said it was withdrawing its offer for Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein. UBS bearers were SFr4 higher at SFr1,209. Insurers and industrial shares mostly closed with marginal losses. Registered shares in Sandoz fell SFr5 to SFr670. AMSTERDAM was broadly lower, although some gains were seen during the session, particularly from Heineken, up Fl 3.60 at Fl 248.10, following the strong performance on Friday. The AEX index finished 1.38 down at 411.81. MADRID, returning from a long holiday weekend, dipped 2.1 per cent as it caught up with Friday's losses in other European markets. The general index fell 6.46 to 298.72 in slim volume of below Pta20bn as the market awaited today's Spanish and US inflation data. Among heavily hit banks, Santander and Argentaria each fell Pta100 to Pta5,120 and Pta5,210 respectively. DUBLIN drifted lower in thin volume and the ISEQ overall index closed 10.76 easier at 1,909.34. One analyst commented that the Irish central bank had no need to follow the interest rate lead from London on economic grounds, and would, indeed, be anxious to demonstrate its autonomy. STOCKHOLM advanced strongly, with heavy demand seen for Astra. The Affarsvarlden general index gained 9.4 at 1,450.3. Good demand for Swedish bonds and a firmer krona led to a decline in interest rates and provided support for the bourse. Astra saw turnover of SKr800m, or some 28 per cent of the day's total of SKr2.9bn, and the 'A' shares rose SKr3 to SKr186 while the 'B' finished SKr4 up at SKr185.

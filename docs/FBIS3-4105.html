With the general urban plan as  guidance and through unremitting efforts, the reply calls for  building Beijing into a famous city of history and culture and a  modern international metropolis with a flourishing economy,  social stability, various public utilities and services,  infrastructure, and an ecological environment of the highest  world level.    The official written reply of the State Council stresses  that  Beijing is the capital of our great socialist motherland and is  the political and cultural center of the whole country.    It is necessary to give prominence to the characteristics of  the capital, give play to its strong points, energetically  readjust the structure of production and the layout of land use,  promote the development of high and new technology and tertiary  industry, and endeavor to bring about unity in economic results,  and social and environmental benefits. The State Council  reaffirmed: Beijing should not develop heavy industry any more,  especially not industries which consume a lot of power and  water, take up a lot of land, involve much transportation, lead  to serious pollution, or cause a lot of troubles for the people.    It is necessary to control the population and the scale of  land use. By 2010, the registered population of Beijing  Municipality should be limited to around 12.5 million (the  number of those in the urban area should be limited to around  6.5 million). The key to control of the population in the urban  area lies in controlling the increase in the number of people  moving in.    It is necessary to earnestly protect and improve the  ecological environment of the capital. It is necessary to build  and perfect the urban greening system, to promptly and strictly  protect and implement plans for green areas which separate  groups of urban areas, to ensure sufficient green spaces in  urban areas, and to form a rational urban framework and  development pattern. It is necessary to continue to grasp  firmly work to prevent atmospheric, water, and noise pollution  and pollution caused by industrial waste and garbage. It is  necessary to strictly control the development of polluting  industries in urban areas, especially in water sources and the  windward side of the city. Regarding existing polluting  projects in the urban area, it is necessary to make  readjustments and gradually move them away. It is necessary to  resolutely meet the requirements set in the plan concerning  layout structure, density, stringent controls, and so not to go  beyond the limits set.    Beijing is a famous ancient capital and is also a city noted  for its history and culture. Its urban planning, construction,  and development must be able to protect the history, culture,  traditions, and the entire pattern of the ancient capital, and  to give expression to the organic integration of the national  traditions, local features, and the spirit of the times. It is  necessary to make great efforts to raise the level of planning  and design and to create a good image for the capital of our  great motherland.    It is necessary to speed up modernization of the urban  infrastructure. The State Planning Commission will take the  lead in holding joint discussion with departments and localities  concerned as soon as possible to work out construction plans for  major projects to lead water from the south to the north; to  pipe natural gas from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia to Beijing; to  build the Beijing-Tianjin Canal; and to work out steps for  implementing these plans. It is necessary to step up  implementation of the strategy for the development of  transportation in Beijing, to make great efforts to develop  underground railways, light railways, and other mass transit  public facilities, to further improve the expressway system, to  construct modern transportation facilities, and to form as soon  as possible a modern, comprehensive transportation network.</p>

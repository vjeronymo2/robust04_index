			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  apparently broke no new ground Wednesday [1 June] in a cautious  return to the trade negotiating table for the first time in  three and a half months.    The day's talks on insurance trade, the most promising of  three priority areas, consisted of confirming progress made  before bilateral trade "framework" talks broke down in February,  a Japanese official said.    Both sides expressed caution, but there were indications the  U.S. was ready to ease its hard-line stance in the insurance  talks that conclude Thursday in Tokyo.    "I gather there's an atmosphere of optimism that we are  going  to move forward," a U.S. official said. "The U.S. is going to  be more flexible but we're not going to throw everything  overboard."    But the official, who asked not to be named, said the  Americans were sticking to their main positions, adding, "we'll  just have to see how things go in this first round -- whether we  move forward or just get stuck."    The Japanese side was also cautious, with one Finance  Ministry official saying both sides remain apart on the pace of  liberalizing the foreign-dominated "third sector" of insurance  that includes accident, nursing care and disease coverage.    Washington is urging Tokyo to go slow on deregulating the  sector, with U.S. officials stressing in the past the need for  "prudent" regulation. But Japan sees the go-slow demand as an  attempt by the U.S. to hold its lead.    Nonetheless, insurance was an area that both sides have said  was nearer to agreement than other priority areas -- government  procurement and automobiles and car parts -- as it is less  likely to revert to bickering over whether U.S. demands amount  to "numerical targets."    The framework talks broke down on February 11, when then  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton  could not agree on the "objective criteria" called for in the  framework accord signed last July.    In restarting the talks, the U.S. side said that although it  wants a "results-oriented" agreement, it is not seeking  market-share "targets." But Tokyo's concerns remain.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said Wednesday that the  "Japan-U.S. gap has shrunk considerably" but that no sectoral  agreements have been reached.    Answering questions in the House of Representatives budget  committee, Kakizawa expressed a "fear that something like a  request for numerical targets could emerge."    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, whose ministry is  responsible for the insurance talks, vowed his "utmost efforts"  to reach a framework agreement in time for a July summit of  major industrial nations. But he told a regular news conference  he did not know the details of the day's insurance talks.    Asked if both sides could wrap up an agreement on insurance  in two days, lead U.S. negotiator Ira Wolf, assistant trade  representative for Japan and China, smiled and said, "We'll see."    The Japanese team is headed by Eisuke Sakakibara, deputy  chief of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau.    The two countries are to resume the auto and parts talks  Thursday in Washington and the talks on Japanese Government  procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications Friday  in Tokyo.</p>

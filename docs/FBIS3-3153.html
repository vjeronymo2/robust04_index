			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Liu Yu-mei; from the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Chien Fu yesterday [16 March] said  that former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has played a very  important role in the history of development of human society in  the 20th Century and is a cross-century historical figure. He  is convinced that the current visit to Taiwan by Gorbachev will  be able to promote exchanges and understanding between China  [Republic of China] and Russia. In addition, in light of  newspaper reports on Russia's largest opposition party hoping to  invite President Li to visit Russia in April, Minister Chien Fu  said yesterday that President Li could not accept the invitation  to visit Russia due to the short notice and the stand of the  Russian opposition party. The following is a report by Liu  Yu-mei:    [Begin recording] [Liu Yu-mei] According to newspaper  reports, Chairman Zhirinovskiy of the Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia, which is Russia's largest opposition party, has  openly invited President Li to visit Russia to attend its party  convention scheduled to begin on 2 April. Foreign Minister Qian  Fu answered a question yesterday morning raised by a legislator  at the Legislative Yuan on whether President Li would go to  Russia as invited. He said he did not see any invitation  document from Russia and only learned the information from  newspapers. He said: However, judging from the situation, a  head of state cannot make preparations to go abroad in just two  weeks. We should also consider whether the Liberal Democratic  Party, as an opposition party, can provide all facilities for a  visit by a head of state. Therefore, President Li could not  possibly go to Russia as invited in early April. As for  Zhirinovskiy's revelation that the Russian Government may adjust  its policy of selling airplanes to China [Republic of China],  Chien Fu, in answering an interpellation by legislator (Yin  Yao-peng), said Russia has developed a phobia of communists  [k'ung kung cheng] and that it is also impossible for Russia to  sell weapons to our country.    [Chien Fu] The Russian Government has developed a high  degree of phobia [k'ung chu cheng] with regard to Communist  China [chung kung]. Asking Russia to sell weapons to us at  present is almost impossible. It is almost impossible. It  seems to me the so-called invitation may be (?just a report)  [words indistinct]. It is unlikely to have much positive  (?meaning). Therefore, I do not want to spend too much [words  indistinct].    [Liu Yu-mei] As for the visit by former Soviet leader  Gorbachev and his wife next Sunday, Chien Fu praised Gorbachev  as a historical figure. His opening and reform policy has  promoted the democratization of the Soviet Union. Through his  visit to China [Republic of China] and meeting with President Li  to exchange opinions and make contacts with various circles of  the country, he can further understand Taiwan's experiences in  development. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will do its best  to coordinate Gorbachev's activities during his visit.    This is a report by China Broadcasting Corporation reporter  Liu Yu-mei at the Legislative Yuan. [end recording]</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Norstead is owed Pounds 10m say receivers The problems of Olympia and York's Canary Wharf development and the effects of the recession on the construction industry have been blamed for the appointment of receivers at Norstead Group, mechanical and electrical contractors. The group is owed about Pounds 10m, including Pounds 2.5m for work on Canary Wharf, said Mr Ian Turner, an insolvency partner at receivers Grant Thornton. The unquoted family-owned company, which grew into one of the largest independent building services companies in the UK only broke even on a turnover of Pounds 24m in the year to March 1992, its poorest trading in recent years.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Nato hopes to avoid row in search for new leader Nato will this week start the difficult task of finding a secretary-general to replace Mr Manfred Worner, who died on Saturday, with leaders of the alliance desperate to avoid the kind of public arguments which dogged the succession to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. The two names most frequently suggested as possible replacements are Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian foreign minister and currently UN peace mediator in former Yugoslavia, and Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Italian prime minister. Nato's involvement in former Yugoslavia means that Mr Stoltenberg's experience would be useful, and Norway has never held the top Nato job. Italy has held the post just once and Mr Amato has avoided the corruption scandals which have felled many Italian politicians. Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister who was a candidate to replace Mr Delors, has also been mentioned for the Nato job, but his private office said that he was unlikely to be a candidate. Mr Sergio Balanzino, the deputy secretary-general, will head the alliance until a successor is found. Nato is no stranger to disputes over who should be secretary-general. A bitter row broke out when Mr Worner was appointed to the job in 1988. The task is complicated because the change comes at a critical time for the alliance. The prospects for peace in Bosnia are deteriorating and the relationship between Nato and its old Warsaw Pact adversaries is evolving rapidly. Finding a candidate quickly with sufficient standing to guide Nato through these changes will be difficult. However, officials in Brussels are keen to act fast. 'Nato has seen what the Commission went through and will want to avoid a repetition,' said one diplomat. With most politicians and Nato ambassadors on holiday, a meeting to discuss a successor cannot be organised before September. As Nato officials pondered possible successors, tributes to Mr Worner flowed in. President Bill Clinton described him as a 'true and loyal friend' of America. Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, said: 'He was one of the greatest (personalities) of German and international politics.' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said he was 'a great servant of Nato'. Early indications were that a successor was unlikely to be German since Nato has traditionally rotated its top job among member countries. For the same reason, Britain is unlikely to provide a candidate as Lord Carrington was Mr Worner's predecessor. Whoever is chosen will have to deal with the issues of Nato membership for eastern European countries. Nato is also likely to be involved in rapid reaction forces outside its traditional areas of operations in Europe and this will need delicate diplomacy. Obituary, Page 2</p>

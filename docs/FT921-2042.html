			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: GRE Although the market clings to the idea of a takeover bid for Guardian Royal Exchange, investors would be silly to get carried away. The lack of much domestic mortgage guarantee exposure, to be sure, makes the company a more attractive target than Royal. But it is still hard to imagine an aggressive suitor stepping out from the ranks of wounded UK composite and preoccupied continental insurers. That leaves the question of whether yesterday's 12 per cent jump in GRE's shares was justified by evidence from last year's results alone. The answer is quite probably yes. The apparent determination to make rate rises stick and polish underwriting skills smacks of a company prepared to sacrifice market share. Pre-tax losses may have increased by one third in 1991 to a mind-shuddering Pounds 210m; but, thanks to a Pounds 30m tax credit and the 41 per cent dividend cut, the year end solvency ratio of 43 per cent is enough to keep GRE out of the casualty wards. Given the nature of general insurance risks, the effort to demonstrate an underlying improvement in second-half UK underwriting results is less convincing. At best, things look to be going from worse to bad. Doubts will persist about the quality of GRE, but a 15 per cent discount to net assets and 7.3 per cent historic yield provide fair value in the short term.</p>

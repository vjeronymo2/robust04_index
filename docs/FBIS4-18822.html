			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The next government will be finalized shortly.  At Pontida, Umberto Bossi obtained the go-ahead from the  Northern League to form a majority government with Forza Italia  and the National Alliance. Silvio Berlusconi said in Rome that  the next government would be a centrist one, but Gianfranco  Fini, stressed that the next government would be a center-right  one. From tomorrow the delegations from the Freedom Alliance,  comprising Forza Italia and the Northern League, and the Good  Government Alliance, comprising Forza Italia and the National  Alliance, will begin work in order to choose the Chamber of  Deputies and Senate speakers. Our correspondents have the  details. [passage omitted]    After having injected his followers with hefty doses of  Northern League pride, Umberto Bossi announced that at the next  European and local elections in June, the Northern League would  field its own candidates running under its own symbol. [passage  omitted]    [Begin Berlusconi recording, shown addressing Reform Party  congress] The task that this government faces is extremely  difficult. We have inherited a disastrous situation. I have  begun to look closely at the state account books. I am looking  at them as though they were company books, and let me tell you,  the situation is sickening. [end recording] [passage omitted]    [Begin Marco Pannella recording, addressing Reform Party  congress] The Northern League was the first political  organization, which along with us, asked for that which today  Forza Italia, Silvio Berlusconi, and the country is saying is  the best method. [end recording]    [Correspondent Margherita Ghinassi, over video] As far as  Silvio Berlusconi is concerned, Marco Pannella is turning out to  be an indispensable ally. He is the catalyst for those  parliamentarians elected on reform lists, and he has the support  of certain socialist, liberal, and environmental factions. He  wants to be the left-wing extreme of the future government  majority. Berlusconi agrees with him. He wants to have a link  with Mario Segni's Pact for Italy, and with that faction of the  left which, he says, does not want to have anything to do with  the Party of the Democratic Left. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent Mauro Mazza, over video] Gianfranco Fini is  not worried by this business of forming a centrist government.  In fact he appears happy because at the end of the day, he  explained, it will be Silvio Berlusconi who will steer a center  course. However, the coalition will be made up of this center  and the right, where Fini believes, the space for the National  Alliance will be even greater. Tomorrow, the negotiations will  be more serious. There will be talks on the next Chamber of  Deputies and Senate speakers. It appears probable that both  speakers will come from the Freedom Alliance.    The Freedom Alliance now appears ready to get off the  ground.  Pierferdinando Casini from the Christian Democrat Center Party,  said finally things were running smoothly. He commented that  Bossi had finished chasing after rainbows. [passage omitted]    The Left is attempting to put something together. Ottaviano  Del Turco, the secretary of the Italian Socialist Party,  suggested that an intelligent opposition must be formed to fight  those that he called the illusionists and mountebanks of the  Freedom Alliance.    The leader of La Rete, Leoluca Orlando, called for the  establishment of a great, democratic united party.    The Party of the Democratic Left and its representative  Fassino, welcomed the invitation of Mino Martinazzoli to take  part in a united way in the 25 April demonstrations [Liberation  Day]. Fassino said that the new alliance could get off the  ground then.</p>

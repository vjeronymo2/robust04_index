			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Swedish budget deficit forecast to rise sharply SWEDEN'S huge budget deficit looks set to climb to SKr195bn (Pounds 21.7bn), 13.8 per cent of the country's gross national product, in this financial year that ends next July 1, according to Carnegie Fondkommission, the Swedish investment company, writes Robert Taylor from Stockholm. Faced with mounting demands for financial support from the crisis-ridden banking sector and the cost of escalating unemployment, the Swedish government's current forecast of a SKr160bn budget deficit in the 1992-93 financial year is regarded by Carnegie as unrealistic. It believes that between now and July 1, 1993, the government will need to increase its borrowing requirement to SKr255bn on the assumption that there is no new round of spending cuts and the krona remains at its present fixed exchange level against the Ecu. Of this, some SKr60bn will be allocated in loans to banks and social funds and will be recoverable. This forecast may add to revived anxieties on the money market. Last week the central bank intervened and increased liquidity with its decision to buy SKr45bn of treasury bills.</p>

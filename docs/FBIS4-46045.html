			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 17 (AFP) -- French Defense Minister  Francois Leotard said Tuesday that the scientific community  believed additional nuclear tests were essential in order to  develop the capacity to simulate tests in the laboratory.    Leotard, speaking on French radio, said that "the scientific  community tells us that we need a few more tests," and added  that he had not met a single scientist who believes otherwise.    "France must acquire as quickly as possible -- perhaps in  seven, eight or 10 years -- the capacity to simulate tests that  would allow us to test the effects of a nuclear explosion,"  Leotard said. "That is essential for our country if we are to  remain a major power."    He said those opposed to nuclear testing are generally  "politicians," an apparent reference to President Francois  Mitterrand who is against France resuming nuclear [sentence as  received].    Mitterrand, who has exclusive powers to order tests, wants  to  stand by a moratorium observed by all the United Nations  Security Council members except China.</p>

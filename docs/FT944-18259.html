			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (7): Europe satellite wars may get even more intense - The latest campaigns In the next few months, Europe's satellite television wars are likely to become even more intense with the launch of two large new satellites by the main operators - Societe Europeenne des Satellites and Eutelsat, the European satellite organisation. SES, the Luxembourg-based company that runs the Astra satellite system, hopes to launch its fourth dedicated television satellite at the end of this month. It will be a huge satellite, capable of transmitting 16 channels of television using existing analogue technology plus two transponders set aside for experimenting with digital television. There will also be 40 transponders, designed to provide back-up if any of Astra's existing three satellites were to fail. If all goes well, the satellites should be operational by next January. Next month, Eutelsat plans to launch its 16-channel television satellite called Hot Bird 1, to intensify the challenge to Astra. The satellite will be able to broadcast television channels throughout Europe as well as in most of North Africa and the Middle East. Eutelsat's strategy is to create 13 degrees east as the 'hot' position to be. Hot Bird 1 will join an existing Eutelsat satellite and there are plans to launch Hot Bird 2 in 1996. The users of Hot Bird 1 will include MTV, NBC Superchannel TV 5 and the newly launched European Business News. The two satellite systems have developed in a rather complementary way. So far, Astra has been the dominant supplier of subscription channels such as movie channels in Europe. Eutelsat has tended to concentrate more on carrying advertising backed channels such as Euronews or NBC Superchannel, delivering channels to cable networks and community systems. Astra channels were available by mid-year in a total of 53.1m European homes, 36m of them through cable networks and 16.7m through individual dishes and communal aerial systems. Eutelsat services, as of April, were available in 38.3m cable homes, 2.2m homes served by community aerials and 2.8m homes with their own dishes. Even SES directors concede that the competition between the two systems will become more intense as satellite channel operators consider launching digital television services. The great advantage of digital, as opposed to analogue television, is that once a television picture is turned into digital a large number of channels can be squeezed into the capacity formerly occupied by one. The broadcaster can choose to have a smaller number of extra channels and instead broadcast in a widescreen format or provide a high definition picture. National Transcommunications, the privatised transmission and research division of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority, has recently been demonstrating its digital compression system, which squeezes eight television channels into a single transponder. Star TV may launch the first 150-channel systems in Asia and Europe before the end of next year. On its new Hot Bird 1 Eutelsat offers broadcasters the opportunity simultaneously to transmit a channel in both analogue and digital form at no extra cost. Eutelsat says that tests of the new system earlier this year demonstrated that the analogue channel could still be received by 80cm dishes while the simultaneous digital channel provided pictures that exceeded normal broadcast quality. Astra is planning to devote both its fifth and sixth satellites entirely to digital television if the market demand is there. Much will depend on decisions taken by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and his ally, Mr Leo Kirch, the German media entrepreneur. The two would like to have eight channels, it is believed, on the new analogue Astra 1 (d) satellite. The aim would be to launch 'near video-on demand' - giving over a number of channels to a selection of recent hit movies. Showing times are then staggered, so that the viewer is never far away from the start of the movie of his choice. In return for a large number of channels on the new analogue satellite, the company is implicitly seeking a commitment to lease capacity on the new digital satellites. If digital television is to be launched soon in Europe, it will require close co-operation between the manufacturers of the special receivers needed, the satellite operators and the satellite broadcasters - particularly the owners of movie and sports channels. 'We want to nurse them through into digital and they want us to nurse them through to digital,' was how one of those involved describes the negotiations. Particularly for News Corporation, the decision to launch digital television across Europe - and with it pay-per-view services - could involve the investment of hundreds of millions of pounds. Astra has always described itself as technology-neutral and will dedicate its fourth and fifth satellites wholly to digital services only if that is what the market wants. Recent internal feuds at SES, and a failed attempt to remove Dr Pierre Meyrat, the Astra director-general, have clouded the issues. It is not yet clear just how rapid the move to digital television will be but it is certain - as long as the new Astra and Eutelsat satellites are successfully launched - that the television choices available to European viewers will continue to increase.</p>

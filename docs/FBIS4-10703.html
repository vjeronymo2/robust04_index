			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on communique by Manuel Camacho Solis, Chiapas peace </F> and reconciliation commissioner, to the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN) General Command dated 15 April; from the  "ACIR Radio News" newscast]    [Text] The Office of the Chiapas Peace and Reconciliation  Commissioner issued the following communique a few minutes ago,  addressed to the EZLN General Command. I am going to read the  whole communique. It is a bit long, but you should be informed  in detail.    Just when progress is being made, the communique states, to  facilitate a return to dialogue, to the negotiations aimed at  finding a political solution to the situation in Chiapas, the  regrettable attack on the military checkpoint on the road to  Chicoasen has been carried out.    The message of concordance with facts [mensaje de concordia  con hechos] of the past few days are:    1. The three branches of the Chiapas government, Manuel  Camacho says, have given clear signs they are preparing the  Chiapas State's response to the commitments for a worthy peace  in the established terms and within the scheduled calendar of  events. This paves the way for in-depth institutional changes  that will provide answers to the problems you have presented.    I repeat, this is the communique Manuel Camacho Solis sent  to  the EZLN General Command.    2. The National Human Rights Commission has recommended  to the attorney general of the republic the charges against 16  of the 21 people being held at the Cerro Hueco Jail for their  alleged participation in the early January 1994 incidents be  dropped. Juan Carlos Santoyo reported on this yesterday.    The third point in Manuel Camacho's communique to the EZLN  states:    3. The Chiapas government and the indigenous and peasant  organizations that form the COIC [expansion unknown], signed a  very important commitment yesterday to suspend all illegal  occupation of lands and to study the situation of each property  until a fair and satisfactory solution for all parties involved  is reached.    4. The Mexican Bishop's Conference has called on the  mediator, commissioner, and the EZLN to immediately resume the  dialogue.    5. Prominent citizens who are committed to peace and  involved in nongovernmental and human rights organizations are  demanding the resumption of dialogue as soon as possible.    6. In the past few hours additional efforts to reach  agreements have been made in the hopes of finding a quick  solution to the problem of those who were recently expelled from  (San Juan Chamula).    7. The Mexican Army has strictly abided by its commitment  to a cease-fire and has done all it has been asked to do to  strengthen the political solution to the problem.    In conclusion, Manuel Camacho Solis' communique states: We  are keeping our word. Once again a strategy of messages of  concordance with facts is being drafted to facilitate the return  to the dialogue and negotiation. In this context, Camacho Solis  adds in this communique to the EZLN it is very important that  the EZLN clearly state its position regarding this morning's  incident. Camacho is obviously referring to the incident that  occurred just outside Tuxtla Gutierrez [words indistinct]. The  Mexican Army, Camacho added, is still determined to cease all  fire. This commissioner respectfully suggests:    Within the current political situation, and after the  decisions I have mentioned have been made, it is highly  recommended you issue a statement that will leave no doubts on  the EZLN's position in light of the attack on the military  checkpoint. This is necessary, but I do not believe it is  enough. What the people are demanding is the resumption of  dialogue and negotiations to find a political solution to the  conflict, Manuel Camacho states.    Camacho concludes by stating: Despite the risk all of this  represents, and even in light of a possible provocation, your  decision favoring a dialogue will be a clear sign of your  willingness to find a political solution and a worthy peace in  Chiapas.    [Signed] Sincerely yours,    Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis    [Date] 15 April 1994.</p>

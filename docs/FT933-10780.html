			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Deutsche Bank buys units from Treuhand THE Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern German industry, has sold a portfolio of businesses to Deutsche Bank, which will manage, restructure and ultimately attempt to sell them. The sale represents a novel approach by the Treuhand, which has now sold more than 12,000 of the 14,000 enterprises under its control, though with some difficulty owing to Germany's economic downturn and the poor condition of some of the businesses. Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, has taken control of 13 enterprises, mostly in the construction and electrical sectors, through Deutsche Industrie Holding, a wholly owned subsidiary which specialises in eastern German investments. DIH has agreed to guarantee 1,100 jobs and to invest more than DM80m (Pounds 31.10m) in restructuring the enterprises in its portfolio. The sum paid to the Treuhand is undisclosed. The construction enterprises include Leipziger Beton Union, Naunhofer Kieswerke and Chemnitzer Bauhoff. The arrangement will allow the Treuhand to concentrate on privatising the most difficult of eastern Germany's remaining enterprises, including the brown coal fields, utilities, and the chemical sector. Several scandals, involving abuse of funds, have dogged the Treuhand over the past two months. This led to the establishing of a new division charged with monitoring all contracts signed with the Treuhand since it was set up in 1990. DIH, set up in November 1991 as part of Deutsche Bank's strategy of strengthening its position in the five new eastern states, has so far acquired stakes in enterprises totalling DM46m, and has committed DM74.2m of investments as well as guaranteeing 2,300 jobs in these companies. Deutsche Bank itself has invested DM3.5bn in 349 branches in eastern Germany. Deutsche officials say they expect returns on their investments to take several years, largely because eastern Germany has lost its markets in eastern Europe, the modernisation of the infrastructure is a lengthy process, and growing unemployment is reducing consumer spending.</p>

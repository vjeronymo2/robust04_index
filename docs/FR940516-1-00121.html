			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The levels of the proposed emission standards under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule are in large part driven by the aggressive timeline of Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. EPA agreed to promulgate Phase 1 small SI engine standards to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realize early emission reduction benefits while a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive long-term program will be developed for Phase 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Achievability of Proposed Emission Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that the proposed Phase l emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are the lowest standards for Class I&hyph;V engines achievable by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996 model year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The engines covered by this proposed regulation are divided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into five classes with unique emission standards proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each class. The lowest level of emission standards achievable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was determined for each class of engines. The unique standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each class are driven by differences in emission reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability of engines with different combustion cycles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different displacements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class I and II engines represent nonhandheld engines that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in large part, use 4-stroke combustion cycle engines, as opposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Class III&hyph;V engines which represent handheld engines that, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large part, use 2-stroke combustion cycle engines. Within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time constraints for compliance with this rule, Class I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines will be capable of achieving a lower HC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  composite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standard and lower CO emission standard than the Class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III&hyph;V engines are capable of achieving. Furthermore, within each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion cycle type, the larger displacement classes will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of achieving lower HC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , HC, and CO emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. A full discussion of the technical rationale for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these limitations is set forth in the draft RSD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's belief that the proposed emission standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Classes I&hyph;V are the lowest achievable standards is based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission data provided on nonoptimized prototype configurations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of engines that meet the proposed standards, technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussions with manufacturers, and EPA analysis of information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on technologies collected from a range of sources. The following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a summary of these analyses. A complete analysis is provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the draft RSD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has compiled emission data on selected Class I&hyph;V engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and prototypes that were tested at either an independent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry laboratory and met the proposed emission standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These prototypes represent the greatest degree of emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control technology achievable given the aggressive timeline for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earliest possible introduction of these engines into commerce at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable cost (one of the parameters for achievability listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in CAA section 213(a)(3)). Data was compiled and reported on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three Class I engines, two Class II engines, one Class III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine, two Class IV engines plus one data point representing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate of 27 Class IV engines, and one Class V engine plus one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data point representing the aggregate of 18 Class V engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These data and the specific technologies used on each are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented in Chapter 1 of the draft RSD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional support for the proposed emission standards being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lowest achievable standards is provided by EPA's analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary of confidential discussions with manufacturers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on technologies collected from a range of sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA used this summary information to compile and predict the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected percentage usage of each emission control technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Class I and II engines, EPA predicts that manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will use different combinations of the following technologies:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carburetor enleanment and/or modifications; fuel system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications; ignition timing modifications; valve system and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valve timing modifications; combustion chamber modifications;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling system modifications; some conversion from side valve to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overhead valve engines; and some conversion from 2-stroke to 4-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stroke engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Class III, IV, and V engines, EPA predicts that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers will use combinations of the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies: Carburetor enleanment and/or modifications;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carburetor limiter cap installation; fuel system modifications;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion chamber modifications; port timing and scavenging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications; cooling system modifications; and some conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 2-stroke to 4-stroke engines. The estimated percent usage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of each technology by engine class is presented and discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the draft RSD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the technologies listed, the use of catalytic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converters, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and air injection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology may occur on a limited basis or not at all in the 1996  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model year. EPA estimates that manufacturers will meet proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase 1 emission standards without the use of catalysts. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some manufacturers are developing low efficiency catalysts in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case some marginally acceptable engine family should need this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology to meet the standards. If catalysts were to be used,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA estimates that their use would occur on no more than 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of Class I engines and one percent of all Class II&hyph;V  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines. EPA requests information on the likelihood that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalyst, EGR, or air injection systems will be used and, if so,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any additional information on percent usage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Proposed Emission Standards Are Lowest Feasible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that three specific emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies, while allowing engines to meet lower standards than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those proposed today, cannot be developed within the timeline of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule or at reasonable cost. Technologies such as high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency catalytic converters, low cost fuel injection systems,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and low cost electronic control systems are currently either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available on only a limited basis or are in the early design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phase. These technologies cannot be used on the vast majority of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines by the proposed implementation date. These technologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the potential to develop much greater emission reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than those technologies determined to be achievable for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. As discussed in Chapter 1 of the draft RSD, a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical barriers and safety issues must still be overcome  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before standards can be set that would reflect general or blanket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of these technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Some say it is necessary to Taiwan's survival.    Others ridicule it as a quixotic scheme; they see it as an  impractical plan.    Does Taiwan indeed have an opportunity to become a regional  headquarters for transnational businesses?    What are Taiwan's advantages and disadvantages for becoming  an Asia-Pacific operations center?    What major changes are needed to attain the goal?    A large market holding hidden vitality lies along the  Pacific  Rim of the Asian continent. This area has an annual 6 percent  economic growth rate, and forecasts call for one-half of the  world's gross output to come from here by 2040. Transnational  businesses in advanced nations are anxious to establish a  bridgehead here.    At the same time, Taiwan, which is a way station in the  area,  is working hard to break out of an economic development  stalemate by importing high value-added industries to accelerate  internal transformation and to stimulate the desire to invest.  In 1992, however, outside investment in Taiwan for the year fell  to a new four year low of only $1.5 billion.    A "national construction program" that seeks to vault Taiwan  into the ranks of a modern nation, the Asia-Pacific Operations  Center Plan, took shape during the surge to accelerate internal  transformation and stimulate investment.    The Asia-Pacific Operations Center is no new topic. This  hope  has attracted businesses from many nations to set up regional  headquarters in Taiwan. Very many businesses long ago began to  plan tactical alliances whereby their Asia-Pacific branch  corporations engage in procurement, production, marketing,  technical assistance, research and development, and the  collection of information.    Economic considerations aside, as a result of these tactical  alliances, Taiwan will make itself a part of the global economic  network, which will enable it to improve its international  standing and national security.    This is not a bad tactical conception; the question is  whether the tactic is feasible.    To go from Europe and the Americas to Southeast Asia and  Mainland China does not require going via Taiwan. Countries  other than Taiwan -- notably Singapore and Hong Kong -- can  provide added value that Taiwan does not provide.    Just what value does Taiwan add as a springboard for  cooperation with the west?    Can existing administrative regulations be reformed in time?  Can the necessary infrastructure be put in place rapidly?    These are the requirements for Taiwan's success as an  Asia-Pacific Operations Center.    People generally believe that Taiwan's professional  scientific and technical brain power will serve as a solid  contingent that will permit Taiwan to become a research and  development [R &amp; D] base, and a technical support base for  Asia  and the Pacific. Universal education and training in  mathematical concepts will permit Taiwan to turn out highly  capable engineers at low cost.    According to a global competitiveness survey that the Swiss  International Management and Development Institute (IMDI) made  in 1992, Taiwan obtained 732 United States patents during 1990  for first place among developing countries. Taiwan also far  exceeds major competitors such as Singapore and Hong Kong in R  &amp;  D and manpower investment. During 1992, a total of 5,157  doctorate and masters degree holders returned home, but their  skills were not needed in Taiwan, thereby creating a new dilemma  of self-induced unemployment.    Taiwan has a large number of people who work with their  hands  to match the engineers who work with their brains.    It is small but fast, hardworking, medium and small  businesses that have gloriously created the picture of Taiwan's  economic growth. From Taipei to Taichung, and from Yunlin to  Pingtung, they have expanded contacts into a closely knit  industrial network that has become an asset that cannot easily  be duplicated in the Asia-Pacific region.    "As an Asia-Pacific manufacturing center, Taiwan is  certainly  a turnkey," Stanley Shih, chairman of the board of Acer Computer  Corporation, says with conviction.    Given its geographic position and its role as a cultural  intermediary, Taiwan can become a bridge for the United States  and Japan to enter this region, particularly the China mainland.  Yeh Ying [5509 7727], director of the commercial section of the  American Association in Taiwan believes this to be Taiwan's most  powerful "trump card."    Taiwan, which has ample foreign exchange reserves, lags  behind Japan in investment in the Asia-Pacific region, it is  true, but it is far ahead of Mainland China. This still  expanding Chinese network is strengthened by a common language  and culture. Because of Taiwan's experience in managing the  mainland and the 70 percent Chinese Southeast Asian market,  economist Soluo [phonetic] suggests that Chinese business can  "use Taiwanese younger cousins to do business with mainland  older cousins." Shanwen Computer general manager, Liu Shangen  [0491 1472 2704], affirmed Taiwan's capability in a more  humorous manner. He said, "Taiwan understands very clearly even  the art of doing things through the back door."  <H5>  One Upgrade and Four Kinds of Expertise </H5>   It is because Taiwan holds advantages in geographical  location, and in manufacturing and technical capacity that 11  international firms that have been producing in Taiwan for many  years have signed a tactical partnership letter of intent with  the Ministry of Economics.    For example, Motorola Electronics has not only established  an  electronic parts manufacturing center in Taiwan, but it has also  set up a massive circuit research and development center to  design products for Japan and South Korea. AT&amp;T also plans to  cooperate with Taiwan firms to contract the building and  operation of telephone communications hardware abroad. Phillips  of Taiwan controls the entire operating process from design to  marketing of four major products including illumination  equipment, electronic components, monitoring equipment and  telecommunications, and information processing services.    However, in planning an Asia-Pacific Operations Center,  Taiwan will not be content with being only a production and  technical assistance support base. If it is also to function as  an entrepot and as a financial center, Taiwan will have to make  one upgrade and become expert in four fields.    The one upgrade is improved science and technology. The four  fields of expertise are personnel, money, goods, and information.    Taiwan has, in being a good foundation for developing and  bringing forth new technology, and this is the road it must take  to improve competitiveness. If it only concentrates on existing  production and technology, Taiwan will be relegated to the  status of a large export processing base. However, "What  conditions must we have to build new and sophisticated  industries" that bring in high technology? The general manager  of Taiwan's International Standard Electronics, Mao Yu-nan [3029  3254 0589] came straight to the point in posing this question.    In addition to upgrading domestic R&amp;D capabilities, we  must  take the opportunity to bring in high science and technology  brain power and high level professional talent. We also have to  create an overall environment to match. Although Singapore's  level of science and technology and its technical manpower  cannot match Taiwan's, it has well-developed financial and  economic regulations, and a high quality living environment that  attracts scientific and technical talent from abroad.    Although Taiwan is more friendly toward foreigners than  other  developing countries (including Singapore and Hong Kong), and  does not practice discrimination (according to the IMDI  appraisal), overall living conditions are not as good.    Since signs are not in English, foreigners in Taiwan are  reluctant to wander the streets. In Japan, all one has to do is  dial the telephone, and emergency translation service in various  languages is available 24 hours a day. Whenever it rains in  Taiwan, people walking along the sidewalks in Taipei may step  into mud holes. During free time on weekends, foreigners do not  know where to go sightseeing. Traffic jams and air pollution  problems exist as well. Consequently, a consulting company that  Federal Express hired to make an evaluation listed Taipei as a  "hardship city" for foreigners to live in.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

One of the main proponents of the Asia-Pacific Operations  Center plan, Taiwan University Law Department Professor Hsu  Hsiao-po [1776 1420 3134] says candidly that if Taiwan fully  protects intellectual property rights, "more foreign businessmen  will be willing to introduce technology." Taiwan, which is  well-versed in the application and commercialization of science  and technology can increase its technological innovation  opportunities by increasing the sources of technology.    If Taiwan becomes a general headquarters for the Asia and  Pacific region, managers will shuttle back and forth to meetings  in various countries; technicians will be on the move to help  other areas solve problems that suddenly come up in the research  and development and production process. Personnel from other  countries will also congregate in Taiwan for training.  Flexibility in the free entry and departure of personnel is  necessary to the operation of transnational businesses.    However, Taiwan currently regulates foreign white collar  labor very strictly, thereby impeding channels for attracting  outstanding brain power from abroad. Despite his holding a  doctors degree from a French university and having formerly  worked in the United Nations, a Japanese lawyer who founded a  practice in Germany was still unable to obtain a resident's work  permit for Taiwan.    After a distressing two months wait, his wife -- a Republic  of China citizen -- had to resign her job in Taiwan, and as of  the time he boarded a plan, the Japanese lawyer had still  received no explanation from the unit concerned.    A lawyer in the Legal Affairs Office commented that Taiwan's  employment law and associated regulations are "completely  divorced from reality."    In addition, foreigners resident in Taiwan must file a  report  every time they leave the country, small children included.  Furthermore, a Taiwan transit visa is available in only a small  number of countries, and it is valid for only a five day stay.  Even South Korea, which is very security conscious, has  increased the period to seven days. Several times when the 3-M  Corporation in the United States held a conference in Taipei,  high ranking officials of the corporation were unable to attend  because their visas were not processed in time.    In Singapore, by contrast, so long as an alien holds a work  permit, he or she is free to enter and leave the country freely  during the period of its validity. Even local military age males  need only notify the authorities concerned by telephone, and  they can pick up their bags and leave the country.    Not only are procedures for entering and leaving Taiwan  onerous, but Taiwan is not competitive even in the movement of  goods.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4: Taiwan Laws Not Up to Date; Many Restrictions                     |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Taiwan Ranking    |Hong Kong Ranking |Singapore Ranking |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Legal standards o-|;8                |4                 |1                 |  |f finance and ban-|                  |                  |                  |  |king institutions |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Protection of int-|7                 |5                 |1                 |  |ellectual propert-|                  |                  |                  |  |y rights          |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Government contro-|5                 |1                 |2                 |  |l and troubling o-|                  |                  |                  |  |f businesses      |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Compatability of  |12                |4                 |1                 |  |environmental law-|                  |                  |                  |  |s with business c-|                  |                  |                  |  |ompetitiveness    |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Extent to which a-|6                 |3                 |1                 |  |nti-trust laws pr-|                  |                  |                  |  |event unfair comp-|                  |                  |                  |  |etition           |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Openness of the p-|5                 |1                 |2 Source of Data: |  |ublic sector towa-|                  |                  |Swiss IMDI, "Worl-|  |rd foreign compet-|                  |                  |d Competitiveness |  |itive bidders on  |                  |                  |Report, 1992"     |  |contracts         |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 5.

Taiwan's administrative and building efficiency have  suffered  in the political tumult of the past several years. This is the  main reason for the backwardness of Taiwan's infrastructure.  Volume of cargo handled today in Kaohsiung's seven ports is only  63 percent that of Singapore and Hong Kong. Although Kaohsiung's  civilian piers load or unload 27 standard cargo containers in 10  hours, thereby running neck-and-neck with Singapore and Hong  Kong, the government piers handle only 13.    Kaohsiung port still uses the longshoreman management  methods  of 1971 to figure wages. Consequently, some people draw more  than NT$100,000 per month in wages. Worse yet, after they  retire, their job is passed on to their son in a longshoreman  "hereditary system."    During July 1993, more than 50 ships waited to get into  port,  each ship waiting one to two weeks, the loss per day averaging  $6,000. This caused the poor reputation far and wide for  Taiwanese ports    Slowness and high charges have, in fact, damaged the  utilization rate of both Taiwan's airports and harbors.    Although Taiwan's manufacturers break their necks to meet  deadlines, cargoes are held for at least one or two days before  clearance at Chungcheng Airport. In advanced countries, customs  examinations are figured in hours. The average scheduled landing  fee for an airplane in Taiwan is $2,430. At Hong Kong's Kaitek  Airport, where an airplane takes off or lands once every two  minutes, the fee is only about half that.    Taiwan's future goal is the development of light, fragile,  short, and small products, and the U.S. Federal Express is  discussing a plan to establish a hub in Taiwan that can make the  most of Taiwan's strength in being able to act quickly. The  administrative efficiency and infrastructure problems relating  to the movement of people and cargoes are crucial to whether  Taiwan can become an Asia-Pacific Operating Center. In addition,  the associated flow of money and information require even  greater effort.    Two years ago, the national finance and banking conference  reached a decision to set up an Asia financial center, but so  far nothing has appeared but publicity; no real action has been  taken. Financial control limitations, inconvenience in moving  money into and out of the island, insufficient financial  commodities, and the lack of skilled financial personnel are old  problems that hurt the effective use of funds. Likewise, they  impede Taiwan's becoming an Asia-Pacific Operations Center.    The uncertain quality of Taiwan's telecommunications and the  lack of competitiveness of charges cloud the Asia-Pacific  Operations Center plan even more, and they are also constitute a  stumbling block for Taiwan's entry into telecommunications in  which the exchange of graphics is the mainstream.    A large number of obstacles and doubts about whether "we can  or cannot" face us in proceeding with the Asia-Pacific  Operations Center. No wonder that some entrepreneurs take a "I  couldn't care less" attitude about it, and throw invitations to  panel discussions into the waste basket without reading them.    Taiwan University's Three Principles of the People Institute  assistant professor Tu Chen-hua [2629 7201 5478] and six other  members spent an entire year travelling around the United  States, Hong Kong, and Singapore making comparisons to complete  the report on "the feasibility of establishing an Asia-Pacific  Operations Center in Taiwan" that the Ministry of Economics  commissioned them to make. Their 300 page-thick evaluation  employs various indicators to point out that the overall picture  for Taiwan is not optimistic. However, if it is to be  established, nevertheless, "the focus from top to bottom will  have to be on making a more international and freer frame of  mind in Taiwan, including the frame of mind of the middle level  civil servants responsible for implementation, and the public in  general, and well as amending regulations.    Tu Chen-hua warned that the results of the study show that  the biggest obstacle to moving ahead with this plan stems from  the lack of a full international outlook on the part of middle  level civil servants who oppose change. This includes government  officials lacking a professional background.    In order to become a regional operations center, Taiwan must  be a customer-oriented organism that provides services around  the clock.    At Kaohsiung Port, which supposedly operates around the  clock, repair personnel could not be found in the middle of the  night. At Chungcheng Airport, the Customs does not clear cargoes  after Saturday noon. Obtaining a clearance requires payment of  NT$3,000. During an emergency once, China Airlines had to land  at a small airport in Kaohsiung after midnight only to be  refused. It had to turn back to Hong Kong where the airport is  not open around the clock, but which is flexible.    "What can be done to make the whole country aware that  Saturdays and Sundays are not days off in an Asia-Pacific  Operations Center?" is a question that Hsin-kuang Textiles  general manager Hu Ch'iao-jung [5170 0294 2837] spelled out  world by word at a panel discussion.    The public in general also faces the challenge of an  internationalization of their frame of mind. The understanding  of the managerial level of Taiwan firms about trans-national  culture, and their international management experiences are far  behind those of places like Hong Kong and Singapore where  English is commonly spoken throughout society.    In 1992, America-Taiwan Telecommunications began to send  technical personnel from Taiwan to Indonesia, Thailand, and  Mainland China to prove assistance. However, general manager Yeh  Tsu-yu [5509 4371 4416] found that these technical personnel had  adjustment problems in the places to which they were sent. They  were not accustomed to short temporary duty assignments outside  Taiwan. "This is a psychological process everyone must go  through. They must develop their own international frame of  mind," he said. The greatest frame of mind transformation  required is for government to go from regulation orientation to  task orientation.    The evaluation report that the Ministry of Economics  commissions recommends at great length 50 administrative  measures and legal regulations in need of amendment. In addition  to citing regulations related to the corporation law, the  employment law, the income tax law, and foreign exchange control  regulations, it cites Singapore's leasing and tax concessions as  an example in emphasizing that amendment of laws should  emphasize benefits to be gained more than guarding against harm.    Taiwan laws, which are a legacy of the Japanese system that  came from Germany, emphasize guarding against harm. However, Law  regulating commerce are based on the British and American legal  systems." If Taiwan's laws are to be internationalized in the  absence of people having this background, how can a law  amendment draft be produced? is a question asked by Hu  Ch'iao-jung who is a legal scholar.    Most multi-national firms have set up operations centers in  Hong Kong and Singapore to look after the southeast Asia market.  Since it first began to promote a regional headquarters plan in  1986, more than 40 large firms have established a base in  Singapore. These firms include IBM, ICI, Ch'i-i [1142 8381],  Hsin-li [2450 0500], and International corporations.    Taiwan is getting a late start. Only by offering something  special can it win out over the competition.    "We have to do well the things that they (Singapore and Hong  Kong) do not do, gradually besting them. This is the only  tactic," says Stanley Shih, chairman of the board of Acer  corporation, which has set up a regional center in Singapore,  but whose headquarters remains in Taiwan. According to Stanley  Shih, Taiwan is still the best choice for R&amp;D and for  managing  production. "At least, we should persuade foreigners to set up  dual centers." Taiwan does not have to be a center in which  everything is done including production, R&amp;D, finance and  banking, the entrepot trade, and marketing is done. "If we just  get going, we can become a champion although possibly not being  first in every particular," says Mao Yu-nan metaphorically.    The process of training to be a champion in 10 areas  requires standards for judgment. "At least, objective data for  judging each area is needed to determine whether we are  approaching our vision; otherwise, it is only an illusion," says  Mao Yu-nan unceremoniously in pointing out priorities.    During one of its visits to Singapore, the evaluation team  that the Ministry of Economics commissioned brought back a 1  meter high stack of data and material in which even the added  value produced by each employee at Singapore's airport was  figured and reported. Even if there is only a slight decline in  telecommunications competitiveness indicators relative to other  countries, the Singapore telephone bureau readjusts its business  tactics every year to catch up.    Taiwan does not care about such data at all; it does not  look  at specific indicators.    The Asia-Pacific Operations Center provides an orientation,  but even more necessary is coordinated overall actions. Hong  Kong Chinese University Professor Weng Sung-jan [5040 2646 3595]  points out the importance of intangible competition indicators.  Are foreigners happy about travel in Taiwan? Is bribery serious?  "Maybe the international image needs adjustment!"    As an Asia-Pacific Operations Center, Taiwan will have to  compete not only with Hong Kong and Singapore, which are a step  ahead, but its competitors will also include Thailand and even  Pudong in Shanghai, which are itching to compete.    Taiwan Phillips, which arrived in Kaohsiung 20 years ago,  developed from simple processing into an international  production center, and today it is a self-established fully  functional operations center. Speaking as a person who has  experience, Director General Lo I-ch'iang [5012 4135 1730], who  is a staunch proponent of the Asia-Pacific Operations Center  Plan states with conviction: "When Taiwan does something better  than others, why won't other countries come? We have to decide  ourselves."    It is the time for Taiwan itself to make a decision about  the  Asia-Pacific Operations Center.</p>

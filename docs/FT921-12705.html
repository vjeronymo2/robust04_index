			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Data General returns fall well below expectations DATA GENERAL'S stock lost 23 per cent of its value yesterday when the manufacturer of mid-range computers reported much lower than expected earnings for its first fiscal quarter. The company blamed competitive pressures on pricing for the decline. For the first quarter, it reported net income of Dollars 4m, or 12 cents per share, down from Dollars 12.4m or 41 cents in the same period last year. Wall Street analysts had been projecting earnings of around 47 cents per share for the first quarter. The stock tumbled Dollars 4 to Dollars 12 at yesterday's close, from a Wednesday close of Dollars 16. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 294.8m, down from Dollars 311.7m for the same period a year ago. The company said first quarter revenues from the Japanese market were Dollars 16m lower than during last year's first quarter, following the sale in 1991 of its Japanese subsidiary. The sales and earnings decline represents a setback in Data General's financial recovery. The company returned to profitability in fiscal 1991 after four years of heavy losses, during which operations were severely cut and the company developed a new 'open systems' product line. It said sales of its 'open systems' product line continued to grow during the first quarter, but that prices declined. 'We have been able to maintain profitability despite continuing weakness in the worldwide economy and very competitive pricing pressures,' said Mr Ronald Skates, president and chief executive. 'Our expectation is that industry-wide pricing pressures, which had a significant impact on the past quarter's results, will not abate for some time,' he added. 'We remain very cautious about the remainder of 1992.'</p>

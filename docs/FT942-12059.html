			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Election threat to Ecuador reforms Opposition parties yesterday won a convincing victory in Ecuador's mid-term congressional elections, threatening the future of President Sixto Duran Ballen's economic reform programme. The president's Republican Unity party lost six seats in Congress and together with its ally, the Conservative party, now commands only nine of the 77 congressional votes. The overwhelming winner of the election is the opposition Social Christian party, with 25 seats or one-third of the power in parl-iament. President Duran insisted that 'a couple of representatives less in parliament won't change the course of my government'. The president added that even without a legislative majority during his first two years, he had begun restructuring the country. In order to continue and advance his state modernisation programme the president must forge alliances with opposition parties, notably the Social Christian party. Its leader and 1992 presidential candidate, Mr Jaime Nebot, indicated that his party supported a reduced state sector but at the same time would demand more social compensation for those affected by reform. To move ahead with the privatisation of strategic sectors of the economy, the government will require congressional approval of pending legislative proposals. According to opinion polls, the outgoing Congress was the most unpopular since Ecuador returned to democracy in 1979. As a result, voter apathy was considerable. If Ecuadoreans approve the proposal to elect congressmen for four years, as stipulated in the plebiscite to be held on July 31, these could be the last mid-term congressional elections. Critics argue that months of campaigning significantly impedes the legislative process.</p>

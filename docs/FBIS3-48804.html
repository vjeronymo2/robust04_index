			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yoshio Suzuki, researcher in BOJ Information </F> Service Department, and deputy director, Executive Office,  Central Committee on Savings Public Relations: "Household  Economy Becomes Cautious, Reflects Sluggish Economy--Results of  1993 `Public Opinion Survey on Savings and Consumption'"]    [Text] The Central Committee on Savings Public  Relations (executive office is Bank of Japan [BOJ] Information  Service Department) recently announced the results of the 1993  "Public Opinion Survey Regarding Savings and Consumption." This  survey has been conducted once a year (latter part of June to  latter part of July) since 1953, targeted at regular households  nationwide with two or more household members (6,000 households,  return rate 68.5 percent) in order to grasp the actual state of  savings, consumption, and life awareness. Below, we would like  you to view the major characteristics of the results of this  survey.  <H5>  Average Amount of Savings Held and Composition by Category </H5>   The average amount of savings per household for households  with savings was 13 million yen, the highest in the past, but it  was no more than a small increase of 3.3 percent compared to the  previous year (12.59 million yen). Moreover, the median amount  of savings (the amount of savings of households positioned in  the middle when ranking households with savings in order of the  amount of savings held) was 7.32 million yen, a slight increase  of 1.0 percent compared to the previous year.    In the component ratio by category for amount of savings,  "deposit savings" was the largest, accounting for 50.2 percent,  next in order were "insurance and annuities" (25.3 percent),  "negotiable securities" (14.4 percent), and "loans and money  trusts" (6.4 percent). Moreover, viewing these by annual income  level, a special characteristic was that deposit savings  accounted for over half in the low income level, but the  percentage of negotiable securities was high and the percentage  of deposit savings was low for those with annual income over 7  million yen.  <H5>  Reasons for Increase in Amount of Savings Held </H5>   Viewing the reasons for the increase in savings (multiple  answers), the percentages for "increase in earned income" (43.2  percent) and "higher percentage of savings because of earned  income" (34.1 percent) continue to be high, but with the recent  economic trends, while the percentage of households indicating  "increase in earned income" has continued to decline for three  years, households indicating "a higher savings percentage" have  greatly increased (27.8 percent previous year to 34.1 percent)  and the condition of stressing savings even amidst the leveling  off of income stands out in relief.    On the other hand, a few households indicated "dividend and  interest income" (11.1 percent), "extra income from inheritance,  retirement pay, etc." (5.8 percent), and "increase appraised  value of stocks" (2.0 percent), etc.  <H5>  Selection Criteria for Savings Categories </H5>   The percentage was greatest for households indicating  "security" (43.5 percent) as the most important criteria in  selection of savings category and next in order were "fluidity"  (27.1 percent) and "earnings" (25.2 percent).    Comparing this with past surveys, up until 1991, the  households indicating "security" had dropped back because of the  progress of financial deregulation and the surge in interest  preference awareness, and household indicating "earnings" had  increased; however, since 1992, a complete change has been noted  with "security" increasing (most recent bottom 37.0 percent in  1991) and "earnings" declining (most recent peak 29.1 percent in  1991).  <H5>  Savings Objective </H5>   Regarding savings objective (multiple answers of not more  than three items), the households that consider "preparation for  illness or disaster" continues to be the greatest with 70.9  percent, followed next by "funds for old age" (50.1 percent),  "children's educational expenses" (35.8 percent), "no particular  objective, but peace of mind when saving" (23.5 percent), and  "home acquisition or enlargement/remodeling funds" (19.1  percent), and this order has not changed since 1987.    Viewing this by the age of the head of household, 1)  "preparation for illness or disaster" has the greatest weight  for all levels, but the trends can be surmised that 2)  "children's educational expenses," "home acquisition or  enlargement/remodeling funds," "funds to purchase durable  consumer goods," and "funds for travel and leisure" have  comparatively great weight in young households, and 3) "funds  for old age" is high for elderly households.  <H5>  Reasons for Selection of Financial Institution </H5>   Regarding the reasons for selection of the financial  institution (multiple answers of not more than three items),  households oriented toward geographic convenience continue to be  great with "because there is a branch or ATM in the neighborhood  and it is convenient" (73.4 percent) being overwhelmingly the  greatest, and in addition, not a few households indicating  "because the branch network extends nationwide" (28.5 percent).    Amidst this, a special characteristic of this survey is that  "because the management is healthy and reliable" at 37.0 percent  surpassed the previous year (28.4 percent) by 8.6 percentage  points.    In addition, "because salesman was enthusiastic and image is  good" (11.5 percent) and "because they sell commodities with  high earnings" (9.5 percent) follow.  <H5>  Demands for Improvement in Service by Financial Institutions </H5>   Looking at demands for improved service by financial  institutions (multiple answers), demands for expanded business  hours are the strongest, with "extension of weekday window  closing time" (44.8 percent) and "expansion of ATM functions on  Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, and extension of operating  hours" (42.0 percent), etc. They are followed by "rate service  for deposit and loan interest rather than spending on the cost  of gifts such as tissue paper" (35.1 percent) and "shorter  waiting time at window" (34.6 percent).    Recently, there have been quite a few demands seeking a  close  relationship with financial institutions such as "providing  information closely linked to lifestyle" (19.6 percent),  "establishing window where you can easily have consultation"  (19.2 percent), and "expanding communication with customers,  which has been neglected with automation" (15.0 percent).  <H5>  Thoughts About Financial Deregulation </H5>   Looking at the thinking in regards to financial deregulation  (multiple answers of not more than two items), there has been a  gradual increase in those who appreciate the merits or  significance of deregulation such as "choice of financial assets  is broad and advantages are great" (19.0 percent) and "approve  since fair markets have been formed" (15.2 percent).    Although households complaining of lack of information have  decreased compared to last year (52.8 percent) such as "the  deregulation process and details on commodities are unclear"  (43.9 percent), besides being rather large as before, many  indicate "apprehension about the increase in mergers and  failures of financial institutions" (24.9 percent) and "risk  increases because there are limits to an individual's  information-gathering capability and there are no advantages"  (24.8 percent).  <H5>  About Consumption Expenditures </H5> <H5>  1. Consumption Expenditure Trends </H5>   Viewing the increase or decrease of consumption expenditures  for the past one-year period, while the percentage of households  that consider that "consumption has increased compared to the  previous year" (44.3 percent) has dropped compared to last year  (45.9 percent), households that consider that "it has decreased  compared to the previous year" (13.4 percent) have increased  from last year (10.8 percent), and the attitude toward  consumption lately has become cautious. Moreover, regarding the  next year, households that will continue a cautious attitude  about consumption spending at about the same level as up to now  have increased.  <H5>  2. Consumption Expenditure Decreased Expense Items </H5>   Looking at the specific expense items where consumption was  checked along with the aforementioned changes in consumption  trends (multiple answers with no more than three expense items),  in the past one-year period, many households decreased spending  on items such as clothing (64.5 percent), cultural education and  entertainment or social (50.5 percent), durable consumer goods  purchases (43.5 percent), or food (36.2 percent). Moreover, in  the next year period, they plan to decrease expense items about  the same.    With regard to clothing expenses, durable consumer goods,  and  cultural education and entertainment or social expenses among  these items, they are already possessed to a certain extent and  it is believed that they are being held in check because of  their weak essential character, but it is inferred that they are  being held in check because they can be held in check.  <H5>  About Life Planning </H5> <H5>  1. Status of Establishing Life Planning </H5>   Regarding life planning, 42.7 percent of the households  considered that "they are establishing life planning," and,  together with households that say that "they will establish life  planning in the future" (34.5 percent), they amount to slightly  less than 80 percent, and it can be said that the perception of  the importance of life planning continues to be strong.    Incidentally, on this point, the Central Committee on  Savings  Public Relations conducts without charge "computerized diagnotic  life planning" in order to help people who are trying to  establish life planning, and users have reached 8,000 to 9,000  per year, with a trend of further increase.    On the other hand, regarding items that households which are  establishing life planning considered important when  establishing it (multiple answers of no more than two items),  the greatest were households which consider "funds for old age"  (50.8 percent), followed next by "a life that is distinguished  by planning" (31.6 percent), "children's educational funds"  (31.2 percent), "home acquisition or enlargement/remodeling  funds" (22.8 percent), and "funds for children's marriage" (13.4  percent).  <H3>  2. Connection Between Life Planning and Household Account  Entries </H3>   Regarding the important household account entries with  establishment of life planning as the basis, households which  "enter it" (25.8 percent) and households which "sometimes enter  it" (19.7 percent) are 45.5 percent if combined, but no great  change has been seen in the past few years.    However, looking at the connection between household account  entries and whether or not there is life planning, households  who "are establishing" life planning amount to about 60 percent  of the households which "enter it" in household accounts, and it  amounts to slightly less than 90 percent if households which  "plan to establish one" in the future are included. As opposed  to this, households that "are establishing" life planning are no  more than about one-third (34.1 percent) of the households which  "do not enter it" in household accounts, and it is no more than  about 70 percent if households which "plan to establish one" in  the future are included.  <H5>  Awareness About Living Standards in Old Age </H5>   Regarding "preparations for life in old age," in addition to  many households indicating it as the most important item for  life planning, it also follows "preparation for illness or  disaster" as the objective of savings, and it can be said that  concern about living standards in old age is very high.    Therefore, let's look at the awareness of "living standards  in old age" and its background, dividing households where the  head of the household is under 60 years of age and households  where he is over 60.    A. Looking at the awareness of "living standards in old age"  in households where the head of the household is under 60, the  percentage of households that think that "there is not much  concern" is no more than about a third (35.6 percent), and the  majority of the households consider it "somewhat of a concern"  (62.0 percent).    On the other hand, viewing the awareness of "living now" in  elderly households with the head of the household over 60,  households that consider that "living without much concern"  amounted to over 70 percent, and it can be inferred that their  awareness contrasts with households where the head of the  household is under 60 years old.    B. Behind this awareness of living standards in old age,  households which considered that it is "because there is an  annuity or insurance" (61.6 percent) were the greatest in those  that "have no concern" among households with the head of  household under 60, followed next by "because there is  retirement pay" (33.4 percent), and "because the price of goods  has not gone up so much that the prospects for living are  difficult to see" (22.2 percent).    On the other hand, the percentage of households which  consider that it is "because of insufficient savings" (77.9  percent) or "because annuities or insurance is inadequate" (59.5  percent) was quite high in households that "have concern," and  indicated next are "because retirement pay is not enough" (35.9  percent) and "because a large increase the price of goods is  possible" (25.9 percent).    C. Looking at the source of funds necessary for living  (multiple answers) in households with the head of the household  over 60, households that indicated "public pension" (66.4  percent) and "income from employment" (53.6 percent)  respectively accounted for over half. They were followed next by  "individual or corporate annuity" (15.3 percent), "taking from  savings" (11.1 percent), "real estate income" (10.6 percent),  and "interest or dividend income" (10.3 percent).    Recently, comparatively few households indicate "support  from  children" (7.5 percent), and, moreover, as opposed to the  percentage gradually declining since 1984 (18.7 percent),  households that indicate "income from working" has increased  since 1989 (from 37.3 percent at most recent bottom in 1989 to  53.6 percent in 1993), and the independent orientation of  elderly households can be inferred.</p>

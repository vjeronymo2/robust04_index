			<p>BFN     [Text] Tskhinvali, 21 Apr -- Russian troops deployed at the  Russian-Georgian border, stepped up controls at the Roki tunnel  near Buron village. Representatives of narcotics businesses,  who used to smuggle vast amounts of narcotics, opposed this  step. Making the controls tougher also caused discontent among  the Ossetian separatists.    An IBERIA correspondent was told at the headquarters of the  Georgian peacekeeping troops deployed in Tskhinvali that the  Ossetian population of Tskhinvali had held a rally where they  demanded that the Russian border troops be moved from the  northern border of the so-called South Ossetia because the  presence of the troops there means demarcating the state border  between Russia and Georgia.</p>

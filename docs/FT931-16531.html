			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities One notable feature of the UK equity market since Black Wednesday has been the way second rank stocks have outperformed the FT-SE 100 index. The performance is all the more remarkable given the heavy representation of defensive utilities in the FT-SE 250. In part that reflects the easing of interest rate pressure and hopes of domestic economic recovery - both of which benefit smaller stocks more. But there is a market cycle too: maturing bull runs often see investment trickling down to benefit smaller companies. While the trend may be intelligible, it is less certain that it is justified. The domestic recovery will be weak, so that the higher hopes for earnings recoveries may not be fulfilled. Dividend cover is also low and there are plenty of nasty surprises still to work their way through from the recession. On the other hand the gathering US recovery and rising dollar will particularly benefit blue chip stocks. Their balance sheets and dividend cover are also stronger, giving them the better dividend growth prospects. Inevitably there are some smaller companies which will do well, and the heavily depressed share prices through the recession mean that there will be some substantial rebounds. But the 13 per cent rise in the FT-A Contracting and Construction sector in December smacks of indiscriminate buying, when stock selection is all.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, in order to crack down on pirated  compact discs [CD's], various quarters of Guangdong province  carried out a major sweep against shops selling pirated CD's.  In Shenzhen alone, nearly 50,000 pirated CD's were seized.  Despite the operation, however, many shops are still open for  business. Ng Kit-man reports from Shenzhen:    [Begin recording] [Ng] Although it is illegal for people to  bring pirated CD's from Shenzhen into Hong Kong, for the past  six months at least, it has been possible to buy a CD for a  little less than 20 yuan, only one-tenth the price of a genuine  CD, and many Hong Kong residents have purchased pirated CD's  here a few times. In view of the serious situation in CD piracy,  Guangdong launched a large-scale crackdown yesterday in various  parts of the province, including Shenzhen. Over 200 people from  Shenzhen's Culture Bureau, Industry and Commerce Bureau, and  Public Security Bureau raided CD shops and seized approximately  24,000 pirated CD's and nearly 30,000 laser disks, audio tapes,  and video tapes.    Today, we have visited a shop known to sell pirated CD's and  have found that many shops are open and are still selling  pirated CD's. At the Shenzhen Railway Building, where pirated  CD's have always been available for purchase and which was an  important target in yesterday's crackdown, many shops are still  open and are stilling selling pirated CD's following the  crackdown.    [Ng] How much do your CD's sell for?    [First unidentified shopkeeper] 15 to 20 yuan per CD.    [Ng] Are they genuine or pirated?    [First shopkeeper] They are homemade and genuine.    [Ng] Some shops are finding it difficult to continue their  business and say that they will close when they have sold all  their stock.    [Second unidentified shopkeeper] Many shops have closed, and  nobody is placing new CD orders. This is all that I have  available for sale, and I have decided to close the business  when the stock is all sold.    [Ng] Ng Kit-man from Shenzhen, ATV. [end recording]</p>

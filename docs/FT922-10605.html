			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australian sales were resumed this week after the Easter recess and prices were generally unchanged or a little easier. The Wool corporation's market indicator slipped 4 cents from its pre-Easter close of 590 cents a kg. on the first day, and another 4 cents on the second day. Although these are small movements they do not encourage the placing of new orders but firms in the trade who can manage to wait to do so. The Australian stockpile, still over 4 million bales, is a factor in all market calculations, present policy means that disposal is continuing at a very slow rate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 24/5/1994 -- Members of the  Foreign Policy Committees of the two chambers of the Romanian  parliament had talks Tuesday, 24 May, with the Chinese  parliamentary delegation led by Zhan Yue, member of the  Permanent Committee of the Chinese People's National Congress,  vice-president of the Foreign Policy Committee.    The topics approached during the talks, which both sides  described as a "friendly working meeting," were mainly  concerning the parliamentary relations between Romania and  China, Romania's relations with the countries in its area,  primarily with the Republic of Moldova, the Commonwealth of  Independent States, and the Ukraine, Romania's relations with  Russia, the situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina, and human rights.    Speaking of the reformist process under way in China, Mr.  Yue  said this was concurrently taking place in both the economic and  political spheres. As to the latter, he presented the progress  made in consolidating democracy in his country, and made a point  of saying that China would not copy other countries' experience,  but build its own starting from its specific conditions.    Relative to Russia's situation, Mr. Yue said his country  wished this could improve, and that the Russian-Chinese  relations were normal.    A subject of interest for the Chinese side was Romania's  position to the situation in former Yugoslavia. Ruling party  Senator Sergiu Nicolaescu, chairman of the Senate's Foreign  Policy Committee stressed that the evolution in Yugoslavia  should be watched most carefully now that "some cherish the  ambition of restoring the frontiers of pre-war Europe." Nicolae  Ivanciu Valeanu, chairman of the lower house's Foreign Policy  Committee, pointed out that Romania does observe the embargo  ruled against former Yugoslavia, but that the Romanian  Parliament adopted a statement according to which Romania would  never, whatever the way, interfere in the conflict.    Both sides voiced their hope that the traditional friendly  relations between Romania and China would consolidate  irrespective of the changes that might occur in the  international situation.</p>

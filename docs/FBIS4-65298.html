			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F> Bossi by Alessandro Caprettini in Rome; date not given: "I Won  Using the Partridge Strategy"]    [Text] Rome -- The partridge strategy. This is how  [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi laughingly defines the  tactics used to take possession of the Viminale [Interior  Ministry] without meeting any resistance and above all without  allowing [President] Scalfaro to knock down the [Interior  Minister] Maroni's aim for the Viminale. "I learned about this  from some hunter friends of mine," he explains. "Never keep  still and in the firing line. Jump from one side to the other  before they can shoot you."    [Caprettini] Okay, you feel like joking. Could you explain  instead why Scalfaro gave the go-ahead on Maroni in the end.    [Bossi] I am not joking at all. I realized that there is  some prejudices against the League. My problem was to move this  from the Interior Ministry to the Justice Ministry. This is  where the partridge strategy comes into play. I let go on one  position and took on another making them believe that I would  never let go. At that point somebody decided to shoot...and hit  [Justice Minister] Previti!    [Caprettini] Are you satisfied with the results of the  assault on the government? Five ministries and good ones too?    [Bossi] Satisfied, where? Since when? We got a lot less  than what was due us.    [Caprettini] Come on Bossi, be serious!    [Bossi] I am. Tell me: Do you know what really counts in  these things?    [Caprettini] What?    [Bossi] The money! And I do not have even one ministry with  a spending budget! (At this point Bossi starts laughing, and  shows instead that he is really satisfied with how the talks  with [Prime Minister] Berlusconi, [National Alliance leader]  Fini and Scalfaro went). Understand? Not even one ministry  with a spending budget.    [Caprettini] You have enough to console yourself with  though.    [Bossi] Yes. I like the idea that we were given the planning  ministries; ministries with which you can build the future of  the country. We have ministries that are a guarantee, Interior,  Industry, and Budget. We have the Institutional Reform Ministry  that will guarantee a federalist change and we have an  international range with the Community Policy Ministry.    [Caprettini] With the Interior Ministry in your hands will  you give up plans for a local autonomy ministry?    [Bossi] An autonomy ministry is still necessary because the  municipalities must have a reference point.    [Caprettini] What do you say to those people who are turning  up their noses at the sight of Maroni in the Interior Ministry  and who are saying that they fear for the unity of the country?    [Bossi] That on the outside it may seem a miracle that a  federalist force like the League obtained an Interior Ministry  in a centralist state. But the League played the game with all  its heart and those who have a heart win. In the end they  brought us the Viminale on a silver platter.    [Caprettini] But is the unity of Italy guaranteed or not?    [Bossi] There is not even any need to underline this. Ours  is a federalist country. The centralist logic made the sense of  that history disappear.    [Caprettini] Do you consider yourself a winner or not in the  challenge of the ministries?    [Bossi] The winner was the desire for change that comes from  the grassroots of the country. And we wanted to satisfy this  desire for change.    [Caprettini] Last question, but one of those that count.  Bossi, how long do you think this government will last?    [Bossi] It is a government that will last if it does things.  If, however, it does not do these things. Well, we will see.  For me, this government is like a formula-one car that has just  left the factory and that is getting ready for its test drive.</p>

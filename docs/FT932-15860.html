			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Michelin gloomy despite profit MICHELIN, the world's largest tyremaker, is to launch a another cost-cutting plan in spite of a profit of FFr79m (Dollars 14.6m) in 1992. After losses of FFr4.8bn in 1990 and FFr699m in 1991, last year's small profit came on worldwide sales which were steady in terms of volume, but fell by 1.2 per cent in value to FFr66.8bn because of the decline in the US dollar and several European currencies against the French franc. Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, the finance director, said the group was aiming to save FFr3.5bn over the next two years. He did not rule out further job losses, particularly in Europe. The company made 16,000 redundancies in 1991-92 and introduced short-time working in its French factories. Michelin forecast that, if the second quarter of this year showed no improvement over the first quarter, it would record a loss for the first six months of 1993. In spite of the poor economic climate, sales of replacement tyres can increase as car and truck owners use their existing vehicles longer instead of buying new ones, Michelin said. The fall in the European market in the second half of last year offset the upturn in the US market and virtually wiped out its first-half profit of FFr820m. The company is paying a FFr1.60 dividend on its fully-paid A shares. and FFr1.50 on B shares. With its Uniroyal-Goodrich operations in the US, Michelin claimed to have maintained last year its 20 per cent share of the world market, against Bridgestone with 16.5 per cent and Goodyear with 16 per cent. The company's gloomy predictions for 1993 helped send its shares down in early trading on the Paris bourse, even though Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere yesterday ruled out any early capital increase, a possibility that had recently depressed Michelin stock.</p>

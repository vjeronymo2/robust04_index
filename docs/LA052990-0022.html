			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOLL HITS 22 AS ARMENIANS, SOVIETS CLASH;  </P> <P> NATIONALISM: TROOPS BATTLE MILITANTS OUTSIDE A MILITARY BASE. THE SCALE OF  VIOLENCE IN YEREVAN IS CALLED UNPRECEDENTED.  </P> <P> The death toll grew to at least 22 in gun battles in the Armenian capital of  Yerevan as militants armed with machine guns and Molotov cocktails fought  Soviet troops, casting a deadly pall on Monday's ceremonies marking the  Transcaucasian land's brief independence.  </P> <P> "Instead of independence day celebrations, we have a day of mourning," the  republic's Communist Party leader, Vladimir Movsisyan, said as he went on  television to appeal to his people for calm and to lament a "tragic day for  Armenia."  </P> <P> Word of the first shoot-out, at the train station in Yerevan, surfaced Sunday  when state-run Soviet media reported that six armed militants had been killed  in an attack on Soviet internal security troops. But details of a far deadlier  gunfight outside a military base, in which at least 15 people, including a  soldier, died, became known only later.  </P> <P> Another Armenian was reported killed in Yerevan by gunfire from Soviet troops  early Monday. Though Armenia has been locked since 1988 in an often brutal  territorial dispute with the neighboring Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, never  had death and violence on such a scale intruded into the city of 1.2 million,  and many of its inhabitants were admittedly bewildered and bracing for more  unrest.  </P> <P> For Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet president, who already faces widespread  discontent over his economic reforms and a pro-independence movement in the  Baltic republics, it was another possible crisis to preoccupy him as he leaves  today for Canada and a summit meeting in Washington with President Bush.  </P> <P> "This clash with the military is unprecedented; nothing like this has ever  happened before in Yerevan," Levon G. Airamyants, deputy chief of the political  information department at Armenia's Foreign Ministry, said by telephone. "The  people are stunned."  </P> <P> Leaders of nationalist Armenian groups such as the Karabakh Committee called  the gun battles a provocation to discredit the grass-roots Armenian National  Movement, which scored an impressive victory in recent parliamentary elections  against Communist Party candidates and was planning this week to nominate its  slate for municipal offices.  </P> <P> But Col. Gen. Yuri Shatalin, in Yerevan to direct Interior Ministry troop units  charged with keeping the peace, placed the blame for the violence squarely on  Armenian authorities, saying they have long been in cahoots with the armed  extremists whose actions they are now deploring.  </P> <P> "Bloodshed in Yerevan is the result of overt connivance of the republican  leadership and law enforcement agencies with illegal armed groups," Shatalin  told the official news agency Tass. "They did not devote proper attention to  the fact that a major part of the militant armed formations are concentrated in  the capital of the republic, that they drive around the city in stolen cars,  carrying captured weapons."  </P> <P> He demanded "resolute measures" to seize their arms, but such a step would be  politically dangerous for the Armenian leadership. The armed groups have  flourished in the two-year feud with Azerbaijan about jurisdiction over the  disputed Nagorno-Karabakh district, and they are regarded by many Armenians as  a sort of national guard protecting them from Azerbaijani attack.  </P> <P> On Monday afternoon, as many as 100,000 people rallied in Yerevan in a somber  mood to commemorate the two years of Armenian independence in 1918-20, before  Russian Bolsheviks, aided by their Armenian sympathizers, took power and  proclaimed the rocky homeland north of Turkey a Soviet republic.  </P> <P> Fearing that troops angered by the Sunday violence might attack them,  organizers of the ceremony scratched a planned march to the grave of the first  chairman of the Armenian Parliament.  </P> <P> Though accounts of what happened Sunday at the military base were still  incomplete, versions offered by Armenians conflicted with Soviet accounts.  Rafael A. Popoyan, a Yerevan activist who has furnished reliable information in  the past, accused the soldiers of firing first, and apparently at random.  </P> <P> "By 4 or 5 p.m., a large armored column, 16 armored personnel carriers in all,  started to move from the interior troops' garrison on the outskirts of Yerevan  toward the center," Popoyan said by telephone. "Residents tried to stop the  column by putting heavy trucks in its way and hastily building barricades."  </P> <P> Those actions didn't work, Popoyan said, and the convoy entered central Yerevan  via Erebuni Boulevard, "where it suddenly started shooting at people who were  passing by and at windows, killing many people," he claimed. His account could  not be independently verified.  </P> <P> The Armenian National Movement reported that the dead included a 13-year-old  girl and that 30 civilians were injured in the cross-fire.  </P> <P> The Tass account was completely different. It said about 50 armed militants  blockaded the barracks of an Interior Ministry regiment by seizing a hill that  commanded the area and climbing into the attics of nearby buildings.  </P> <P> They blasted the base with firearms, including machine guns, killing the unit's  deputy commander, a Lt. Col. Chekmarev, Tass said. In the return fire, 14  militants were reported killed and 36 wounded.  </P> <P> Karen Shakhnazaryan of the official Armenpress news agency in Yerevan said the  Armenians were armed with Molotov cocktails and submachine guns, presumably  stolen from military or police arsenals. State-run Soviet television news  showed footage of armed Armenians bobbing and weaving as they ran for cover.  </P> <P> After the convoy left the base, armed columns of militants converged on the  center of Yerevan, where reinforcements of internal security troops were also  being sent, Popoyan said. More moderate Armenians negotiated the withdrawal of  the armed irregulars, and, according to David Motevosayn of the Armenian  National Movement, the deputy chief of Yerevan's military garrison pledged that  troops would not be used further under any circumstances.  </P> <P> But Armenian activists accused the deputy chief of breaking his word only hours  later. At 6 a.m. Monday, Popoyan said, "armored personnel carriers drove around  the city at breakneck speed."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, soldiers reportedly shot up the headquarters of the Armenian  National Movement. No one inside was hurt, but a 24-year-old man was killed as  he slept in his parked car in front of the building, Popoyan said. "For some  reason, the soldiers towed the car with its dead occupant to the (Armenian  Communist Party) Central Committee building and left it there," he added.  </P> <P> Though Tass repeated official contentions that the Interior Ministry troops at  Yerevan's train station had fired only when attacked, Leon Grogoryan of the  Armenian Foreign Ministry's press department claimed that the soldiers shot  first.  </P> <P> "An armed group entered the building and demanded the MVD (Interior Ministry)  people hand over their arms. But the MVD people disregarded their order and  opened fire," Grogoryan said.  </P> <P> Popoyan also noted that if the militants had fired first, they must have been  terribly poor marksmen since, according to Tass, none of the soldiers were  killed while six Armenians were.  </P> <P> However, official Soviet reports said that 10 of the soldiers were wounded, and  Armenpress reported Monday that one had died, though that report could not be  confirmed.  </P> <P> Popoyan said that according to the most recent information possessed by the  Armenian National Movement, 23 Armenians were killed in Yerevan on Sunday, nine  innocent civilians caught in the cross-fire and 14 militants carrying arms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms have unleashed fierce ethnic tensions  in the Transcaucasus region, suppressed for decades by the Kremlin. Passions  are running high in Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh -- a predominately Armenian  enclave that is inside neighboring Azerbaijan and is administered from the  Azerbaijani capital, Baku. In the last two years, hundreds have been killed in  clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the territory. Last year,  Gorbachev brought the enclave under Moscow's direct rule. But his later  decision to hand it back to Baku has turned Armenian nationalist anger on the  Kremlin.  </P></p>

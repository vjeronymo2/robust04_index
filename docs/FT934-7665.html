			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (20): Pain in the provinces - Bold plans to sell-off state industries WHILE the debate goes on in Beijing, the reform of state industry is a painful struggle in the provinces between factories and the local government officials who have traditionally ruled over industry. A year ago, the Chinese government introduced 'regulations on the transformation of the operational mechanism of state-owned industrial enterprises,' which were supposed to clarify the rights and responsibilities of factory managers, and contribute to the gradual commercialisation of the state sector. But a government research team dispatched to review the impact of the regulations has found that local machinery and other industrial departments are reluctant to let go of their control over the factories, particularly those not large enough to have a network of influence in Beijing. Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice-premier, was expected to raise this issue at a meeting of the Communist Party's central committee which began last week, and also wanted delegates to approve the widespread auctioning of small and medium-sized state factories, intended to shift some responsibility for loss-making companies away from the state. Mr Zhu is concerned by a separate obstacle to the party's attempts to turn state industries into corporate entities, similar in responsibility, if not ownership structure, to a western company. Chinese ministries and their myriad, sometimes loosely-linked departments and branches have been spinning off new companies at a remarkable rate, again blurring the lines between government and industry. One reason for the backlash against Mr Zhu's efforts to cool the economy is that it has hurt these newly-emerging companies, involved in everything from property development to the personal computer trade. The government departments were annoyed that bank lending slowed just as they were reaching for their piece of the action. But these government departments and their corporate ventures are competing unfairly against established companies and other new entrants. They are often responsible for issuing business licences, a privilege they are prone to abuse, and they control state funds for their industry, which is naturally kept in the corporate family. In the longer term, the government is planning to shift the welfare functions away from state factories, for example, by encouraging home ownership and establishing a public insurance scheme that will cover the cost of welfare benefits. These reforms remain experimental, and, as a northern Chinese factory manager complained, he has to pay market rates for raw materials, and still provide all the old social services. If the responsibilities of Chinese companies become more corporate, then the government will be able to introduce an ownership scheme, proposed by a group of young Beijing economists, which would create four distinct types of shareholders, and ensure that the companies can still be called state-owned. Shares will be held by a state investment fund, linked to the present departments responsible for industry, and there will be cross-ownership by suppliers and friendly companies similar to the Japanese keiretsu system, as well as sales of shares to employees and investors.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by `gb.': "Insecurity Policy"] </F>   [Text] The increase in key interest rates in the United  States was accepted calmly by international financial markets on  Wednesday [25 May]. But it takes little imagination to picture,  within a few weeks, new excited discussions about a further hike  in the interest rate--possibly soon--with all its concomitant  phenomena such as temporary distortions on the international  interest rate markets. The problem of U.S. monetary policy is in  its concept, difficult for the outsider to understand. Hardly  any analyst at present can recognize in the U.S. economy any  signals of an increase in the inflation rate. For years the  Federal Reserve in Washington has no longer attached great  importance to intermediate targets such as the money supply.  Instead, it has based its decisions on the course of the  economic cycle, and lately also on the exchange rate. That,  however, is a two-edged sword, because a monetary policy based  on the business cycle or the exchange rate can be afflicted with  great uncertainties. The U.S. example demonstrates well how a  monetary policy, hardly comprehensible to outsiders, can cause  uncertainty on the markets. This may serve as a warning to all  those who recommend that the Bundesbank, for the sake of a  short-lived economic effect, deviate from its policy based on  the longer term.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Tokyo takes big step to financial deregulation The approval by the Japanese ministry of finance yesterday for the banks - Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Fuji, Sanwa, Sakura and Mitsubishi - to set up securities offshoots is a substantial relaxation of the country's strictly controlled financial system. It is the latest stage of a gradual dismantling of barriers between banks and securities companies. The government has suggested further deregulation of the financial system may follow in the next few years. To protect existing brokers, the banks' securities offshoots will be not be able to trade in equities but will be restricted to corporate bond issuance. The first banks permitted to run broking businesses - long-term credit banks  -started operations late last year. The ministry announced then that commercial banks, the country's largest banks, would be permitted to enter the market by the end of 1994. Since then, the banks and the ministry have been discussing the structure and financing of the planned subsidiaries. Earlier this week the ministry approved the final details. The move is crucial to the banks' long-term profitability. Japanese corporations, in the past heavily dependent on bank lending, have recently turned increasingly to securities issuance for finance. While that business was barred to banks they risked losing customers to the brokers who hitherto held a monopoly. Small and medium-sized brokers are likely to be the principal losers. They have already lost business to the securities units of the long-term credit banks, and will cede substantially more to city banks. They are continuing to lobby the authorities to keep banks out of equity trading. The larger brokers are also seeking a share in the banks' own activities. But as long as the banking sector remains weak, such a move seems unlikely. When banks are permitted to conduct the full range of broking business, further consolidation of the financial sector is likely as unprofitable brokers are rescued by banks and larger brokers. That process will further remove barriers between the two sectors. One name that will not immediately be joining the list of new securities companies is Sumitomo. The world's largest bank failed to submit an application to the ministry because of a disagreement over the new company's proposed name.</p>

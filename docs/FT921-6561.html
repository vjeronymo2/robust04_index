			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Telegraph up 5% to Pounds 40.5m The Daily Telegraph yesterday unveiled pre-tax profits of Pounds 40.5m for 1991 - up more than 5 per cent despite the recession. Mr Conrad Black, chairman, said that efforts to contain costs and increase circulation revenues had helped to offset a 12.5 per cent decline in advertising revenues. Profits were also boosted by investment income which rose from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 8.1m. Turnover amounted to Pounds 219.1m, a fall of Pounds 2.9m. A final dividend of 4.5p, payable from earnings of 25.4p (17.8p) per share, gives a 9p total.</p>

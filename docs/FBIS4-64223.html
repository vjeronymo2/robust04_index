			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn/New York -- Bonn diplomats have reacted "very  coolly" today to criticism by New Zealand concerning Germany's  application for a seat in the UN Security Council. It is known  that Germany wants a permanent seat in the highest  decisionmaking body of the United Nations -- this has been  repeatedly pointed out by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel -- and the Federal Government "is in close  contact with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on this  issue," a short statement stressed.    It was apparently considered embarrassing that, first, the  criticism came from New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon,  and, second, that McKinnon made his statement on Wednesday  evening [27 April] as acting president of the Security Council.  He described Japan as a "logical candidate" and expressed  reservations vis-a-vis Germany, pointing out that there would be  "too many white faces" if the Germans joined the UN Security  Council.    The implementation of Germany's claim, which results from  the  changed world political map, will be difficult and only possible  on a long-term basis because a decision must be made by the  General Assembly -- after the presentation of the structural  reform that does not yet exist. The secretary general is not  entitled to vote. The 15-nation body has had five permanent  members since 1945: The United States, Russia, China, France,  and Great Britain. These five states also enjoy the right of  veto in all decisions.</p>

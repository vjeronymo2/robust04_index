			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Paul Silvani report: ``Police Makes Important FLNC Arrests </F> Near Bonifacio'']    [Excerpts] Ajaccio -- Fourteen heavily armed Corsican  nationalists were arrested in the night of Sunday 27 to Monday  28 March, when they were preparing to blow up a luxury tourist  venue near Bonifacio (Southern Corsica). Several members of the  commando are well-known members of the FLNC [Corsican National  Liberation Front]-Historic Channel, a source close to the  investigation in Paris explained. They apparently include a  journalist from the Marseilles press and a wanted nationalist  who went underground after being sentenced in absentia for a  murder committed on Christmas day 1988 in a bar in Ajaccio.    Should the operation mounted by the island's gendarmerie and  police, backed up by the RAID [Research, Assistance,  Intervention, and Dissuasion Unit of the national police force],  in the night of Sunday 27 to Monday 28 March in Bonifacio be  seen as a kind of tit-for-tat response, as is being suggested in  Corsica by some observers who think that the government has so  far tried to play for time by handling the nationalists  carefully? On 16 February, the FLNC-Historic Channel announced  the end of the truce in assaults which it had observed since 22  June 1993. [passage omitted]    However, the first major operation by the FLNC in Corsica  failed on Sunday 27 March because of the steps taken by Police  Chief Jean-Pierre Lacave. Several dozen men were asked to take  part in a major assault intended to destroy the village of  Piantarella (26 residential apartments) built in the tourist  venue of Sperone, which contains the island's only big golf  course. The operation seems to have been meticulously organized  and the deployment of these men involved the use of land and sea  resources. But police headquarters had specific information  which justified the dispatch of the RAID to Corsica.  <H5>  Impressive Arsenal </H5>   In all, 120 police and gendarmes were involved. First, four  individuals responsible for neutralizing the guards were  detained, then 10 others who were to plant explosives in the  development. Shots were exchanged without anybody being injured.  Some members of the commando group were probably able to flee.  During the day, two vehicles, one of which had been set on  fire, and an 11-meter motor boat, also set on fire -- it had  probably been used to bring some of the commandos to the spot --  were discovered in the area. An impressive arsenal was seized:  60 bottles of butane gas, around 60 kg of explosives (dynamite  and plastic explosives), six assault rifles, and 10 handguns,  grenades, and detonators.    The success of this operation, the first of its kind since  Corsica has suffered clandestine nationalist violence, suggests  that following the lengthy period of dialogue launched by Pierre  Joxe and continued by [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua, the  government is now determined to put an end to erroneous methods  which do not have the public's approval. The supporters of the  FLNC, who are found within Cuncolta Naziunalista and its  satellite organizations, gathered outside the Ajaccio police  headquarters where the 14 people detained are being held. In  the night of Monday 28 to Tuesday 29 March, they were dispersed  by the police, who used tear gas in response to stone-throwing  and trash can fires. The detained activists will be transferred  to Paris to appear before the 14th section of the public  prosecutor's office responsible for terrorist cases.</p>

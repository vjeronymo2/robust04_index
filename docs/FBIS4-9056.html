All the accused arrested during last  September have been subject to barbarous tortures.    The Serbian Attorney's Office of Pristine accuses them of  acting against self style Yugoslavia since the second half of  1990 until their arrest, that they have allegedly attempted to  put at stake "constitutional order" by "the use of force" in  order to secede the territory of Kosova from Yugoslavia and  create "the special state" of Kosova and annex it to the  Republic of Albania. They are accused of allegedly forming the  Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Kosova. The indictment  also says that they have allegedly formed military staffs at  commune level. In this context the indictment mentions the  names of the premier of Kosova, Dr. Bujar Bukoshi, of the  minister of defence of Albania, Safet Zhulali and others. It  also mentions some relations with the foreign world.    On April 18, the first day of the trial, the indictment was  not read at all and the whole sitting dealt with numerous  remarks by sixteen defence attorneys, who pointed to the  numerous violations of the legal provisions and of the Serbian  laws themselves during the penal procedure and investigation.  Especially, the attorneys said that during investigation they  have been barbarously tortured to force them utter statements.  The attorneys demanded the exclusion from this trial of the  deputy public prosecutor, Jovica Jovanovic.    Following the remarks and demands of the attorneys, the  trial  was postponed for an indefinite time.    The accused were brought to court on April 18 escorted by  Serbian police forces, which were in great number also around  the court building.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (8): Echoes of a golden age - The Semitic Heritage WITH the curtain about to rise on Expo '92 at Seville, Spain intends a tour de force bridging ancient splendours with the promise of an auspicious future, writes BARNET LITVINOFF. But first a stigma had to be expunged, for Seville and the Quincentenary recall not only the epic of Columbus but also the historic crimes perpetrated upon the two proud communities that shared this homeland with the Christians. Three developments in quick succession followed each other in the early days of January 1492: the last Moorish kingdom ceased to exist; Columbus received the official sponsorship he had sought so long; and professing Jews were given the alternatives of conversion or departure from Spanish dominion. Influential Jews, notably Abraham Senior, the Crown Rabbi of Castile, and the 'converso' Luis de Santangel, Treasurer of the Royal household and the man who persuaded Isabella to grant Columbus her assent, employed every argument to annul the edict. In vain. Catholic hysteria swept the land on Granada's extinction. The decree was to take effect on March 31 with four months grace allowed for the people to liquidate their affairs. In the event, some 150,000 Jews departed, of whom about 20,000 (the very poor, of course) disappeared in transit, either dying of starvation or sold into slavery. Senior himself led 50,000 or so into the Church, the king and queen standing as godparents at his baptism. Off went the Jews, the majority in temporary sojourn, at a price of eight cruzados per head, to Portugal. A warm welcome awaited many others in Turkey and the Low Countries, where they revived their fortunes. The expulsion of the Jews in 1492 coincided with the institution of a regimen of brutal oppression against the Moors, until they too were driven out of Spain in 1609. Theirs was a lingering agony of persecution with the proscription of the Arabic language, until they too were expelled in 1609. Some 275,000 Hispanic Moslems took to the Maghreb. The Jewish presence in Spain dated back to Roman times; the Arabs to AD 711. Both Semitic races had produced philosophers, scientists and poets to cross the divide separating east and west. Little wonder that the present government of Spain felt honoured to host the first direct negotiation between Israelis and Arabs last year. By a paradox, all three peoples, Catholics, Moslems and Jews, before their incompatibility was declared, cohabited in relative harmony for many centuries. In contrast with their golden age of science and culture, the rest of Europe dwelt in a medieval chiaroscuro rife with lawlessness and illiteracy. While Toledo gave the hallmark to Jewish achievement, Seville on the banks of the Guadalquivir rivalled Granada and Cordoba in grace and purposeful activity. Toledo is being reclaimed as a cultural and spiritual centre for Sephardic Jewry, while Seville (in Arabic Ishbiliya) will extend a welcome to scholars from the Islamic world. Seville was the principal port of the Spanish-American connection and enjoyed the monopoly of all Atlantic trade for 200 years following the expedition of Columbus. One might have thought, therefore, that this city and its hinterland would have flourished ever afterwards. But Seville's prosperity, attracting entrepreneurs from all Europe, could not endure. Situated deeply inland on the river, it suffered a gradual silting and the spread of marsh. Cadiz supplanted Seville as the leading port early in the 18th century, precisely as Antwerp stole the role from Bruges in earlier days. Seville's present population of 700,000 is half the size of Cadiz. Nevertheless the authorities hope to revive its fortunes by renewing the Ibero-American bond which gave the city its unique position in mercantile history. Expo '92 is making the association with Latin America one of its major concerns. In this it includes Portuguese-speaking Brazil and the proliferation of Hispanics in the US. Transatlantic investment is being encouraged as well as cultural exchanges and, of course, more visits from the general public. Spain believes it will thus bring an extra dimension to its participation in Europe. One Spanish characteristic is a preoccupation with the national past, almost a neurosis. The Inquisition was inaugurated in Seville in 1478, originally against Papal opposition: this cruellest of tribunals - hands chopped from the 'guilty' preceded the consignment of living men and women to the pyre - was not directed against Jews and Moslems who openly professed their faith. By Catholic doctrine they were doomed for perdition anyway. The Inquisition sought out heretics, mainly converted Jews who, having accepted baptism, were believed to be practising their Hebraic rites in secret. A person (and they included Catholic priests) might be arraigned on the strength of information brought to the tribunal by an aggrieved servant, even an estranged relative. There indeed existed such closet Jews (closet Moslems were much fewer) who proclaimed their true identity and followed the overtly orthodox into exile on the Edict of Expulsion in 1492. Superstition has it that a curse was laid upon Seville as the place where in 1480 the Inquisition was begun in Spain. It was also established in Portugal and subsequently in the colonies overseas, surviving, with chastisement of Protestants, too, until 1820. King Juan Carlos has just joined hands with the President of Israel at a service of reconciliation in Madrid's synagogue: atonement for the infamy of his ancestors. So be it. Jews have not forgotten that General Franco, a fascist dictator, refrained from joining Nazi Germany in the Second World War, and protected refugees succeeding in finding a haven across the Pyrenees.</p>

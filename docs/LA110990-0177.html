			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NEPAL KING REDUCES HIS POWERS  </P> <P> King Birendra, whose grip on absolute power was shaken by a springtime  pro-democracy uprising, today enacted a constitution reducing his powers.  </P> <P> The new document establishes a constitutional monarchy patterned after the  British model and declares the Himalayan nation a multiparty democracy.  </P> <P> It abolishes the old system under which political parties were banned and the  king ruled with a nonpartisan legislature that routinely approved measures  favored by the monarch.  </P> <P> "I feel very much elated on such a historic occasion for which the people have  been aspiring and have laid down their lives," Prime Minister Krishna Prasad  Bhattarai told a news conference.  </P> <P> The draft of a proposed constitution was completed two months ago, but  enactment bogged down in a tug-of-war between the palace and Bhattarai's  fledging government over how much power the king should retain.  </P></p>

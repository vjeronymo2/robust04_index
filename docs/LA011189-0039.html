			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVENGE CITED AS MOTIVE FOR 4 HOMICIDES  </P> <P> A key prosecution witness testified Tuesday that he heard convicted cocaine  trafficker Adel (Eddie Nash) Nasrallah vow to "have the people on their knees"  for having robbed him of $1 million in drugs, money and jewelry in 1981.  </P> <P> The witness, Scott Thorson, said at a Los Angeles Municipal Court preliminary  hearing that Nash told him he sent his bodyguard, Gregory D. Diles, to a home  in Laurel Canyon to retrieve the loot.  </P> <P> A short time later, two of the alleged robbers and two other people were found  beaten to death in the home on Wonderland Avenue.  </P> <P> Nash, a 59-year-old one-time Hollywood nightclub owner, and Diles, 40, are  accused of the four murders in retaliation for the robbery at Nash's Studio  City home on July 1, 1981.  </P> <P> It is one of the oldest pending mass murder cases in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> In 1982, the late pornographic movie superstar John C. Holmes was prosecuted in  the slayings and acquitted. Afterward, officials said they knew the identities  of the killers but lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute them.  </P> <P> But murder charges were filed against Nash and Diles in September, 1988, after  prosecutors came up with new information, primarily from Thorson, a former  lover of the late entertainer Liberace.  </P> <P> Thorson, 31, is an inmate at Los Angeles County Jail awaiting trial on charges  of receiving stolen property.  </P> <P> He testified Tuesday that he met Nash in mid-1981 and began visiting his home  frequently to buy cocaine. He said Nash was "very upset" about the robbery and  had sent Diles out to find Holmes, whom Nash suspected of being an accomplice  in the theft. A short time later, Thorson said, Diles returned with Holmes.  </P> <P> "Diles had him by the back of the neck," the witness recalled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Eddie Was Screaming'  </P> <P> Standing outside Nash's bedroom, Thorson said, he could hear Nash threatening  Holmes and banging him against the wall.  </P> <P> "Eddie was screaming at the top of his lungs," saying he would have Holmes and  his family killed unless Holmes took Nash to those who had robbed him, Thorson  testified.  </P> <P> "I'll have those people on their knees," Nash vowed, according to Thorson.  </P> <P> When Nash, Diles and a disheveled Holmes emerged from the bedroom, Thorson  said, Nash told Diles and Holmes to go retrieve the stolen goods.  </P> <P> "When I'm through with them, they'll never steal again," Thorson quoted Nash as  saying.  </P> <P> Later, apparently after the killings, Thorson said Nash expressed his regret at  the "bloody mess."  </P> <P> Thorson quoted Nash as having said that "the whole thing had gotten out of  hand."  </P> <P> According to Thorson and other witnesses, Holmes had participated in the  planning of the robbery of Nash's home. The actor died of complications of  acquired immune deficiency syndrome in March, 1988.  </P> <P> Two of the other robbery participants were not in the Wonderland Avenue home  when the killings occurred and are expected to testify if Municipal Judge  Marion L. Obera finds sufficient evidence to order a trial for Nash and Diles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Survivor Recalls Little  </P> <P> The homicide victims were William DeVerell, 42 and Ronald Launius, 37, both of  whom had participated in the robbery; and Joy A. Miller, 46, and Barbara  Richardson, 22, who were apparently visiting the Laurel Canyon home. Launius'  wife, Susan, was seriously injured and says she remembers little of the attack.  </P> <P> Thorson sued Liberace in 1982, claiming that in return for being the  entertainer's former live-in chauffeur, travel secretary, animal trainer and  lover, Liberace promised him $70,000 a year for life, plus up to $30,000 a year  for pet care and use of one of his homes.  </P> <P> Liberace, who died in February, 1987, of complications of AIDS, denied there  was such an agreement. The suit was settled in 1984 out of court.  </P></p>

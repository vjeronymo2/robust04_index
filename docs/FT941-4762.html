			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Berlusconi goes on the offensive over Fininvest Italian media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi yesterday claimed he was being subjected to an 'unprecedented campaign of political aggression', reacting to reports his Fininvest empire was being scrutinised by Milan magistrates. Mr Berlusconi accused the magistrates of permitting a rumour campaign suggesting illicit payments had been made by members of Fininvest. For the past 48 hours the Italian press has been carrying a series of leaks, clearly coming from the magistrates, suggesting arrests of at least five Fininvest officials are imminent. The reports have been linked to investigations into illicit payments allegedly made in connection with the purchase of players by Mr Berlusconi's AC Milan football club. Mr Berlusconi's attack underlined the increasingly politicised investigations of the magistrates. It also coincides with a rise in the temperature of the poll campaign, which Mr Berlusconi is hoping to win with the Forza Italia movement.</p>

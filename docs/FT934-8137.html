			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (2): China, Korea lead the pack - Developing Asia is the world's only growth area CHINA, South Korea and Indonesia are starting to emerge as the countries in Asia which will depend most on electricity from nuclear power stations. Taiwan, which also has strong leanings to nuclear power, may become bogged down in political and environmental wrangles. SOUTH KOREA still qualifies technically as a developing country under World Bank and Asian Development Bank criteria, but this is fast changing as its economy starts to mirror that of Japan and as its electricity supply programme approaches Europe's typical capacity level of one kilowatt per head of population. The state-controlled Korea Electric Power Company, with its near monopoly, plans to add 27,805MW in new capacity between now and 2001, says Kepco. The national plan calls for another 10,000MW between 2001 and 2006. This means 37,000MW of new power over the next 13 years on top of the present 24,120MW. The nuclear programme has advanced rapidly, largely because of Korea's dependence on imported fossil fuel to power its grid and its industries. Like Japan and Taiwan, it took the Middle East oil price crisis to boost the nuclear programme, led initially by US Westinghouse and General Electric technology and, more recently, Framatome of France, GEC of the UK and Atomic Energy of Canada. At the end of 1992, Korea's nuclear capacity stood at 36 per cent of the national mix; 17.5 per cent was coal; 22.7 per cent oil; 12.1 per cent liquefied natural gas; and 5,969MW (10.2 per cent) consisted of hydro and pumped storage. The anticipated power plant construction bill between now and 2006 is estimated at Dollars 36bn. Oil, the dominant fuel in 1970 - at 76 per cent - will have been almost eliminated. CHINA last year commissioned its first nuclear power station, a 300MW pressurised water reactor at Qinshan, southwest of Shanghai. This autumn, the first of two 950MW pwr units, built at Daya Bay north of Hong Kong by the Anglo-French consortium of Framatome and GEC Alsthom, began generating electricity, 70 per cent of which will be distributed by Hong Kong's private sector utility China Light &amp; Power. The second unit starts up next year. The project is significant as the largest joint-venture of any type carried out with China, being 75 per cent owned by the Chinese government and 25 per cent by the CLP. The plant is operated by the Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company. China's nuclear authorities, grouped mainly under the China Nuclear Electric Energy Industry Company, say they plan a further 11 power stations by 2003. Two are earmarked for the Daya Bay region, though no firm negotiations have yet taken place. Four 1,000MW reactors are planned for Dongping. Given their proposed size, they will be western-supplied. Two 1,000MW reactors, possibly Russian-suppled, are being considered for Liaoning. The Qinshan complex will see two new domestically supplied reactors, each of 600MW, reflecting China's determination to develop its own nuclear technology. These proposals point to a Chinese nuclear power capability of 11,312MW by the second half of the first decade of the next century. This will be a small but significant proportion of its overall capacity, now 180,000MW, of which 70 per cent is coal-fired and the rest mostly hydroelectric. China's overall plans are to add 15,000MW of capacity a year through the end of the century. INDONESIA has only 30MW of experimental nuclear capacity at Serpong, Java. But the government wants to build a commercial capability of 7,000MW, starting with several 600MW reactors to be built on the Muria Peninsula. The country has scarcely 10,000MW of conventional capacity, and with oil reserves running down it is diversifying quickly into coal, natural gas and nuclear. An evaluation by the New Japan Engineering Consultants group should be completed by the end of this year, with the first nuclear projects going to tender by 1995. The tendering will take several years and, say Energy Ministry officials, first power could be produced by 2005 if the programme were maintained. Indonesia's PLN state utility, the National Atomic Energy Agency (BATAN) and the energy ministry are examing designs from General Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries/ Westinghouse/Atomic Energy of Canada and Nuclear Power International/Framatome. No decision has been made on the choice of reactor type. Elsewhere in developing Asia the picture is less certain. TAIWAN hopes to double capacity to 30,000MW by 2000. Nuclear capacity at present is about 30 per cent of total capacity and is located at three sites around the island. Plans to add at least 2,000MW at a proposed fourth site are going too slowly, say impatient officials. Bids are due in early December, but it is feared that the anti-nuclear lobby may hold sway with the project being shelved again, as happened in the late 1980s. This will disappoint Nuclear Electric of the UK which is partnered with Westinghouse of the US to offer a duplicate of its Sizewell B pwr. THAILAND'S Electricity Generating Authority this month was pressed by the World Bank to abandon its nuclear plans as too costly. Thailand was urged to increase its efforts on natural gas, and to consider nuclear only as a last option. Like many other countries, the Authority is facing demand pressures, and plans to boost capacity to 20,000MW from its present 11,000MW. Its present nuclear plans are at an early stage. INDIA'S and PAKISTAN'S plans remain more problematical given that neither country has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Chinese engineers plan to build a 300MW reactor in Pakistan, which would be that country's second, after an old 130MW Canadian General Electric reactor in Karachi, for which parts are no longer available through conventional sources. India, with 1,700MW of nuclear, most of it home grown, still plans to boost this to 10,000MW, but development is at a low ebb, given western refusal to supply technology and equipment.

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Russia learns the painful dictum of cash on delivery: An issue 'at the centre of the reforms' MR VIKTOR Ratnikov, director of Moscow's Babayev chocolate factory, says life has improved greatly since July 1, when Russian enterprises were ordered to deliver goods only if customers paid for them. It is a principle accepted readily enough in the west. But for Russian market reformers, the issue of the day remains billions of roubles in unpaid bills accumulated by thousands of factories around Russia. They came about when state-owned enterprises, which account for 90 per cent of economic output, continued to trade with each other after prices were liberalised in January, even when they did not have enough money to pay for goods. The government's expectations that managers would behave rationally and cut costs and prices proved unfounded. Other problems were a slow banking system, a cut in funding for ministries which had ordered goods in advance, and the absence of a tried and tested mechanism for declaring enterprises bankrupt. The arrears reached Rbs3trillion (thousand billion) by the end of June, accounting for more than half the country's industrial production of Rbs5trillion for the first half of the year. By the end of July, they were back down to Rbs1.19trillion. The amount fell as enterprises demanded payment, as mutual debts were cancelled out and as some enterprises received fresh injections of working capital from the government. 'This issue is at the centre of reforms,' says Mr Alexander Mozhin, a senior Russian official who handles relations with the International Monetary Fund, which has set budget and inflation targets to achieve financial stabilisation. 'Either you give enterprises extra credit with the dangers of deteriorating into hyperinflation . . . or you accelerate reforms which increase unemployment.' Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman who believes it is his job to support production in the absence of western-style capital markets, has already made his choice. He caused a storm of protest among more radical reformers in the government when he issued an order to finance net arrears remaining after the authorities worked out which inter-enterprise debts cancelled each other out. Under pressure from the government, Mr Gerashchenko revoked the order, which according to one of his deputies, Mr Sergei Ignatiev, would have cost anywhere between Rbs500bn and Rbs1.5trillion in new credit. But at least Mr Gerashchenko put at the top of the agenda a problem which had been allowed to fester before his appointment in July. The key challenge now is to teach enterprises a lasting lesson which will make them change their behaviour in future. The government's critics warn of social instability and a loss of Russia's industrial base if large-scale unemployment is allowed. The radicals in the government argue that there can be no growth without financial health. 'One of the dangers in trying to clean up arrears is that you fail to create disincentives for the accumulation in arrears in future,' Mr Richard Erb, the IMF's deputy director, cautioned in Moscow last week. 'Progress in implementing bankruptcy procedures will be important to make clear to enterprises that they are responsible for the credit standing of enterprises they are dealing with.' At a meeting of regional governors, two senior ministers publicly disagreed over the issue. In one corner was Mr Anatoly Chubais, the radical deputy prime minister responsible for privatisation, who said that the net arrears were to be the exclusive preserve of a debt managing agency. Such an agency, the solution favoured by the IMF, would reimburse net creditors by selling off the debts or property of the net debtors, dove-tailing neatly with plans to begin privatisation of large and medium-size enterprises. In the other corner stood Mr Vasily Barchuk, the finance minister, who wants to clear up the problem as quickly as possible because indebted enterprises do not pay taxes and worsen the budget deficit. He said the agency would take far too long to start up and he advocated a one-off indexation of enterprises' working capital to bring it back in line with rapidly rising prices. He was overheard saying later that he needed 'one trillion (roubles)' for his project, compared with the Rbs300bn which the government has told the IMF it needs to spend on indexation of working capital in the second half of this year. The enterprises see indexation as necessary because the cash they had to operate became almost worthless after the explosion of prices in January. But the problem is that it is difficult to make sure enterprises will not use the money to raise wages or to keep producing large inventories of unsaleable goods. Stressing his commitment to an anti-inflationary policy, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, denied any fundamental differences in approach within the government. The solution, which is already emerging, is turning out to be a messy compromise. While Mr Chubais pursues the agency idea, perhaps making some headway in rationalising and privatising enterprises, the central bank will continue to provide new money over and above budget revenues, with as yet unmeasurable consequences for a supposedly strict monetary policy.</p>

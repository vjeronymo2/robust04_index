			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Recovery 'faltering' in west Midlands Economic recovery in the west Midlands appears to be flagging as fewer manufacturing companies report growth in domestic orders and service companies confront sluggish export demand. These points emerge from a survey of business performance covering 652 companies, which was carried out by the west Midlands regional group of Chambers of Commerce and is published today. The survey said the proportion of manufacturing companies reporting increased domestic orders slipped to 37 per cent in December 1993 from 40 per cent in September. However, 32 per cent of manufacturers said export orders were up, compared with 30 per cent in September. For service companies, the position was reversed. The proportion of companies receiving more domestic orders in December than in September was 38 per cent. Three months previously the proportion had been 35 per cent. But only 27 per cent of service companies reported higher export orders in December, compared with 34 per cent in September. The pattern of orders suggests companies are carrying substantial amounts of unused capacity into this year. The survey showed that, in December, 20 per cent of manufacturers and service companies were working at full capacity.</p>

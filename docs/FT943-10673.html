			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Appeal at MMM offices An elderly Russian woman gestures pleadingly towards the closed offices of the MMM finance company in Moscow yesterday. On the right is a second world war veteran, wearing a high-ranking decoration and a covering for his head against the sun. The affair of the company, which is swaying between life and death, took another step into uncharted territory yesterday when a group of people claiming to be simple shareholders took out newspaper advertisements attacking the government for destabilising their company. MMM, a scheme which lured millions of Russian investors with promises of 3,000 per cent annual returns, suspended trading in its shares last week after a crisis of confidence led to a collapse in the price. Its share price tumbled to Rbs1,000 from Rbs115,000 the level to which it had climbed from less than Rbs2,000 in February.

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour details education plans LABOUR BROUGHT education under the election spotlight yesterday by spelling out how it would allocate Pounds 600m in extra funding for schools and colleges. At a national news conference held at Salford University, Mr Neil Kinnock said policies, such as assisted places schemes, had created a two-tier system that 'mocks the idea of the classless society that the Conservatives say they want.' Labour would raise investment in schools. 'It's time to get back to basics - more qualified teachers, new books, better buildings,' he said. Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, dismissed the extra cash, arguing that it was no guarantee of raising standards. He said the Pounds 600m boost promised compared with the Pounds 4.8bn extra spent by the Conservatives in the two years he had been education secretary. Setting out Labour's additional spending programme, Mr Jack Straw, the education spokesman, said Pounds 448m of the Pounds 600m put aside in the shadow Budget for the next 22 months had been allocated to England. The remaining Pounds 152m would go to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and also included an undisclosed figure for contingencies. He detailed the programmes set to benefit from the new funding as follows: school repairs, attracting the largest sum of Pounds 130m for capital spending, plus Pounds 30m to eliminate outdoor lavatories; a further Pounds 120m for new school books, calculated at Pounds 10 per pupil, almost doubling the existing allocation; new classroom equipment for older children at a cost of Pounds 40m; Pounds 20m each for cutting the size of larger classes, a national reading standards programme and the creation of student housing and hardship funds; a further Pounds 10m on hiring 'mentors' to advise new teachers in their first years at work; an already announced Pounds 68m childcare programme, also funded from the Budget windfall. The education manifesto, entitled 'It's Time to Modernise Our Schools', reiterates Labour's commitment to provide nursery education for all three-year-olds or four-year-olds whose parents want it by the year 2000. It also pledges to switch Pounds 50m in funding allocated to the City Technology Colleges into the nursery system. Mr Straw said Labour would 'steadily increase' investment in education.</p>

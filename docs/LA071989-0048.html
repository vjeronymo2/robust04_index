			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SMOKING BAN ON U.S. FLIGHTS IS WEAKENED  </P> <P> An attempt to ban smoking on all domestic airline flights suffered a setback  Tuesday when a North Carolina congressman succeeded in watering down the  proposed bill to instead merely extend the current smoking prohibition on  flights of two hours or less.  </P> <P> Declaring that an "equitable solution" requires that we "have all the facts  before enacting permanent legislation," Rep. Tim Valentine (D-N.C.) won  approval from the House Public Works and Transportation Committee's  subcommittee on aviation for extension of the current ban, which expires next  April.  </P> <P> However, Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), author of the original measure, said  that he hopes to restore tougher prohibitions to the legislation when it comes  before the full committee later this week.  </P> <P> Calling cigarette smoke a health hazard and the "worst sort of indoor  pollution," he maintains that a ban on all domestic flights is justified. The  Environmental Protection Agency, the American Medical Assn., the surgeon  general, the National Academy of Sciences and the Assn. of Flight Attendants  have endorsed such a ban.  </P> <P> Congressmen from tobacco-growing states have contended evidence is lacking that  second-hand smoke poses a problem on airliners.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Deputy Jacek Uczkiewicz, member of the </F> Supreme Board of Social Democracy of the Polish Republic and  delegate to the 45th Session of the Council of Europe  Parliamentary Assembly, by correspondent Grazyna Zwolinska;  place and date not given]    [Excerpts] Last Friday saw the conclusion of the  45th Session of the Council of Europe [CE] Parliamentary  Assembly. Among the members of the Polish delegation was Sejm  Deputy Jacek Uczkiewicz, a member of the Supreme Board of Social  Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] and secretary to the  Wroclaw Voivodship SdRP Executive Committee. He took part in  the proceedings as assistant Assembly member. [passage  omitted]    [Zwolinska] The Polish delegation went to Strasbourg in an  incomplete composition, did it not? The Democratic Union took  umbrage and withdrew its participation....    [Uczkiewicz] I was present throughout all of the stages of  completing the makeup of our delegation. Consequently, I am  able to tell you that the reasons given by the Union in its  official statement are not entirely correct. Judging from my  observation of the behavior of the Democratic Union deputies, I  would risk stating that they were predominantly motivated by the  fact that our delegation as a whole refused to approve the  recommendation of Hanna Suchocka to the function of deputy  chairperson to the Assembly. In the end, her place was taken by  Tadeusz Iwinski, head of our delegation and representative of  the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD].    [Zwolinska] What do you mean when you say "her place was  taken"?    [Uczkiewicz] That was the result of a democratic vote. In  any case, one of the Assembly's ruling principles is that the  composition of any given state's delegation should faithfully  reflect the political configuration of forces in that state's  own parliamentary assembly. By boycotting the Assembly session,  the Democratic Union expected to encourage the entire European  Community to boycott the Polish delegation in turn. However,  our delegation was received entirely normally by the Assembly,  whereas the Democratic Union's move was interpreted as a gesture  directed against the Assembly's principal idea.    [Zwolinska] Who interpreted in in that way?    [Uczkiewicz] The delegates gathered at the Assembly, headed  by Miguel Martinez, who is currently chairman of the CE. He  actually mentioned the subject of the vacant seats in the Polish  delegation's composition during a meeting he had with us. He  expressed a most critical opinion about the Union's position,  which he saw as an expression of a failure to understand the  democratic nature of the rules of the game. He deemed it  regrettable that the Democratic Union attempted to play its  internal games at the expense of the CE and its Assembly.  [passage omitted]    [Zwolinska] Did the Polish delegation maintain a high  profile in Strasbourg?    [Uczkiewicz] It was one of the most numerous and most active  delegations there. Parliament members representing other  countries generally agree that Poland can play an important role  in the process of political expansion of Europe's borders and in  the blurring of the distinction between East and West Europe.  And it is worth remembering that the terminology based on this  distinction is still widely used--even in CE documents.    [Zwolinska] Thank you for talking to us.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Acropolis shut again Visitors hoping for a closer look at the Acropolis in Athens were disappointed yesterday after an unemployed man threatened to commit suicide.  The Acropolis has been closed since October 5 because of a guards' strike. The culture ministry guards, who want higher pay, decided on Friday to open the site for three days after a court ruled their walkout was illegal.  They will consider today whether to resume their strike. But police sealed off the monument after a man scaled scaffolding and threatened to jump.</p>

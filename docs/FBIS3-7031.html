			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group  called "a security-related ministers meeting" on March 21 to  deliberate on "the policy toward the North" and adopt "a  decision" to restart the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises  and deploy Patriot missiles in a short time in South Korea after  "consultation" with the United States.    Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says this is  virtually  a declaration of total confrontation and a declaration of war  against the North.    Noting that the situation of the Korean peninsula has been  brought to a very dangerous phase by this reckless act of the  puppets, the analyst says:    The projected resumption of the "Team Spirit," a test  nuclear  war for "a forestalling attack" on the North, and an early  deployment of Patriots in South Korea are aimed at intentionally  throwing a snag in the way of the solution to the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula, pushing ahead with war preparations in  real earnest and, further, unleashing another war against the  North.    In actuality, the puppet army forces were put on "emergency  alert" shortly after the puppet rulers made the reckless  provocative declaration. We cannot but take a very serious view  of this. No matter how desperately such fools as Kim Yong-sam  may try to overpower our people with something like the "Team  Spirit" and Patriots, they can never frighten our people.    We will decisively cope with the South Korean puppets' moves  of confrontation and war and resolutely defend the security of  our socialist homeland and nation.    The United States had better look squarely at the reality,  clearly mindful that it has nothing to get and beneficial,  though it gives a shot in the arm to such fools as Kim Yong-sam.    It must act with discretion, knowing well of our people whom  it is dealing with.</p>

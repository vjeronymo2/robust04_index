			<p>BFN     [Text] Joe Clark, UN secretary general's special  representative in Cyprus, is attempting to bring changes to the  21 March document for the confidence-building measures [CBM's].  This is the upshot of Clark's speech at the Carnegie Institute  of Washington.    Commenting on Clark's speech, Government spokesman Ioannis  Kasoulidhis said that the document accepted by the Greek Cypriot  side refers only to the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the  guard posts south of Famagusta and control of the road by the  United Nations.    In his speech at the Carnegie Institute, Clark had said that  the area that will be used for access to Famagusta could be used  by the Turkish Cypriots, something that is not mentioned in the  UN document. He had also said that with the confidence-building  measures, Turkish Cypriots will have the right to travel by air  to other countries and will also be able to charter flights to  transfer passengers and cargo. Clark also had said that the UN  asks various countries to give landing and take-off rights to  one Turkish Cypriot airline.</p>

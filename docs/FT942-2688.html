			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (20): Group D - Nigeria Nigeria's Super Eagles are first-time qualifiers for the finals, but they go to the US ranked seventh in the world and fresh from victory in the African Cup of Nations in April. At last, it seems, technical adviser Clemens Westerhof has welded a match-winning combination out of the dispersed talents that make up Nigerian football. Success has been a long time coming for Africa's most populous nation, which has so often failed to live up to its potential. The Super Eagles squad is made up mainly of overseas-based professionals. The outstanding talent is probably Rashidi Yekini. A striker of stupendous power, who plays for Vitoria Setubal in Portugal, Yekini is the African Footballer of the Year and was top scorer in both the 1992 and 1994 Nations Cups. At 31, he is nearing the end of his career but he could be one of the tournament's most exciting talents. - The Eagles' midfield, featuring Sunday Oliseh, Austin Okocha and Mutiu Adepoju, is the rival of any in the world. Their most suspect department is the defence. Benedict Iroha, a goal scoring defender, is a definite for the side. But the rest of the back line are untested against a world class attack. Nigeria's most difficult fixture will be against Argentina, who were ambushed by Cameroon in the opening game of the 1990 World Cup. Bulgaria and Greece are unlikely to offer much obstacle on the way to the second round. Nigeria's ambitions are much higher. - Football is almost a religion in Nigeria, and the authorities know that success in the US could help keep the lid on a disastrous economic situation. If harmony continues to reign in the Nigerian camp, the Super Eagles could coalesce into a squad to astonish the world.</p>

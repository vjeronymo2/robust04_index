			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Observer: Absolut tonic Here's a salutary lesson for all academics who think their research might earn them an extra bob or two on the side. Carl Hamilton, of the Stockholm Institute of International Business, has just been booted out after agreeing to publish his PhD thesis on the marketing of the Absolut brand of vodka. It was commissioned by Absolut's maker, the state-run Vin and Sprit AB. The company is cross because the thesis reportedly contains confidential information. More sensitively, Hamilton also reportedly credits Absolut's huge popularity to clever US advertising, rather than to Vin and Sprit's own efforts. Lesson one of life: never bite the hand that feeds you. Unless of course you know a fatter hand is just around the corner.</p>

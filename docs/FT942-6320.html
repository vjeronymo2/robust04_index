			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / UK Company News: RJ Kiln seeks fresh capital for syndicates RJ Kiln, the highly rated Lloyd's agency, and John Head &amp; Partners, a private New York-based investment partnership, are discussing the possible injection next year of fresh capital to support syndicates managed by Kiln. Kiln, which is also in talks with other potential investors, is preparing for a fall of up to 20 per cent in the number of Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - at Lloyd's and could be looking to make up a shortfall of about Pounds 100m, according to Mr Andrew Fleming-Williams, a director of Kiln. The agency is one of a number keen to launch a new so-called 'dedicated' vehicle for the 1995 year. This would channel corporate capital solely to its own syndicates. Last year John Head &amp; Partners, which specialise in the insurance industry, invested Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) in a new Bermuda-based insurance company, Partner Re. Mr Head is also a significant investor in Sphere Drake, a London-based insurance company listed in New York, and Integon Insurance, a US motor insurer which specialises in non-standard risks. Many Names are expected to leave Lloyd's later this year after the insurance market's fourth consecutive year of losses. Lloyd's, which reports its results three years in arrears, earlier this month announced a deficit of Pounds 2.05bn for the 1991 year. Mr David Rowland, chairman, said he expected Names would need to pay between Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds 1.7bn in cash this year. With the amount of capacity supplied by Names set to fall from its present level of Pounds 9.3bn to Pounds 7.5bn, agents will be under pressure to generate extra corporate cash. But with UK institutions unlikely to provide sufficient backing for a new wave of Lloyd's investment trusts, such as Limit and CLM, the emphasis is likely to be on the new dedicated vehicles which allow for a closer relationship between investor and syndicate management. Hiscox Group formed a dedicated vehicle last year and Brockbank is among those agencies examining the option. Agents will hope to persuade Stock Exchange regulators to relax current rules which would make it difficult for 'dedicated' funds to be listed on the SE on the grounds that they do not have a three-year trading record.</p>

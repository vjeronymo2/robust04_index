			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> SIGN SIZE LIMIT CHANGED  </P> <P> The City Council this week slightly increased the maximum size of political  signs allowed on residential property.  </P> <P> Last month, the council introduced an ordinance limiting signs to 4 square  feet. But last week, Councilman Richard Alexander said that a standard size  political sign is larger than that.  </P> <P> The council Monday night agreed to increase the maximum allowable size sign to  4.3 square feet.  </P> <P> Resident Ed Little, who spoke at the meeting, said large political signs  constitute "pollution" in residential neighborhoods. He described a sign made  of three 4-by-8-foot boards that he said stood in his neighbor's front yard and  insulted him.  </P> <P> But Councilman James Boulgarides warned that the ordinance would cut off a  means of peaceful citizen protest and would limit First Amendment rights. "I  think this (ordinance) is a form of political censorship," Boulgarides said.  </P> <P> Another speaker, resident Tom Hammons, suggested applying the same size limits  to business properties. Mayor Paul Jacobs and Councilman Steven Gourley agreed  to introduce such an ordinance soon.  </P></p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson restructures capital and makes Pounds 2.1m placing OWEN &amp; ROBINSON, the jewellery and sports footwear retailer, has announced plans to overcome its high level of debt and accumulated losses and finance development by raising Pounds 2.1m through a placing and open offer. Mr Alan Gaynor, chief executive, said that the company had done as much it could to 'get a grip on the losses' but it would be unable to move forward without a capital reconstruction. The company also reported pre-tax losses for the year to January 31 of Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 2.92m) on turnover of Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 26.3m). The reconstruction involves the agreed conversion into equity of Pounds 2m of debt held by Hill Samuel, the company's principal banker, Pounds 1.35m of loan notes held by two principal shareholders and Pounds 1.1m nominal of A preference shares. It is proposed to convert the Pounds 8.2m nominal convertible preference shares at a rate nearly six times greater than the existing provisions and make a capital reduction involving the elimination of the share premium account and the capital redemption reserve and consolidate the present 1p shares into 20p shares. Mr Gaynor and Mr Mike Smith, finance director, are being given options over a total of 1.05m shares at 27p. Credit Lyonnais Laing is placing or will subscribe for 9.25m new shares. Existing shareholders are being offered the shares at 27p each on the basis of 171 for every 100 new shares. As a result of the changes Mr Gaynor said that gearing would be cut from 2,200 per cent to 35 per cent. The loss for the year was after exceptional charges of Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 832,000). Losses per share were 7.6p (12.88p).</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Defiant PM vows to see job through Mr John Major yesterday shrugged off the latest bout of Conservative speculation about his leadership, insisting that he would not be forced out of Downing Street by poor results in the local and European elections. 'I have got things I wish to do, and I am going to go on doing them,' Mr Major said. 'I will go when people least expect it. But I have got a lot to do yet.' Mr Major's defiant stand, in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel, followed a renewed outbreak of leadership manoeuvring by supporters of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and of Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary. Friends of Mr Portillo said he was attracting increased support following an appeal last week for Conservatives to heed the concerns of the 'quiet majority'. However, few MPs think that Mr Portillo could win a leadership battle against Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, or Mr Heseltine. Supporters of Mr Major appeared more concerned about the threat from Mr Heseltine, who has emerged as favourite to win if a leadership election is held later this year. Sir Archibald Hamilton, a former defence minister, appealed to Mr Heseltine to stop his supporters openly canvassing Conservative MPs. He said: 'If Michael Heseltine has not, as he says, claims to the leadership, I think it would be a very good idea if he told those that are working for him that this was the position and would they back off.' Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said reports of leadership manoeuvring were 'nonsense'. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said speculation was 'unreal'. Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Hurd said: 'The prime minister is a man of steel. He is going to go on, and people are going to want him to go on.' The government's election difficulties may be compounded this week by a row over potential cuts to the armed forces coinciding with the release of the annual defence white paper. The paper is expected to attempt to minimise the impact of defence cuts on the local elections on May 5 and the European elections on June 9. But ministers are close to approving sweeping cuts identified by more than 30 defence working parties set up last year by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence minister. The cuts, which will include civilian redundancies, property sales, vehicle leasing and a reduction in the number of senior officers, are expected to be announced in June after the European elections.</p>

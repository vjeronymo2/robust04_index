			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- There is no plan to  bring North Korean escapees currently sheltering in China,  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Wednesday. "Right now, the  most urgent issue is with those who have escaped from logging  camps in Siberia," Han said in a press conference with foreign  correspondents.    Seoul announced this week it will accept all North Koreans  who fled the logging camps in Siberia and seek resettlement in  South Korea. The number is estimated at as many as 500.    The decision focused new attention of another group of North  Koreans who have fled the home government and are in flight  throughout China, seeking a way to the South. "We have no  particular plans to actively seek return, coming of those in  China, simply because we don't have the kind of requests that  were made in connection with the loggers in Siberia," Han told  reporters.    Pyongyang and Beijing have an agreement that says the two  sides will repatriate any illegal entrants from the other side.  Officials here have said they are concerned any exposure of  such North Koreans in hiding in China will risk their personal  safety.</p>

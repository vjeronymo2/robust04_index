			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: Streetlamps on the road to progress - A new study on the role of universities THE IDEA OF THE UNIVERSITY by Jaroslav Pelikan Yale Pounds 20, 238 pages This spring all three senior officers of Yale University - President, Provost and Dean - resigned because of the financial and political pressures put upon them; in a separate crisis the President of Columbia University has done likewise. These great academic institutions represent only the most visible examples of the troubled state of American higher education. The stresses are equally serious in British universities. During the last dozen years the government has cut resources and simultaneously pressed universities to increase student numbers. Inevitably, standards are falling. The relabelling of polytechnics as universities is a symptom of the change: higher education is becoming factory-like, with volume and throughput as governing concepts and the minimising of unit-costs as the aim. We live in the Age of Accountancy, and ledgers determine agenda: universities are being pressed to cut staff, squeeze larger numbers of students into crumbling campuses, reduce library budgets, make university terms longer and degree courses shorter. What can be expected from this? Something utterly different from the vanishing ideal of a higher education, and something far less good. The hard-headed will ask, so what? Money is not in limitless supply; why should society not get value for its money in universities as elsewhere? Why not indeed. But what value should we get? This is the question that Jaroslav Pelikan, sets out to answer. His excellent book could not be more timely. Pelikan, a distinguished scholar and university administrator, has as its aim a fresh assessment of the role and value of the university in society. His conclusions are extraordinarily important because of the presures on universities on both sides of the Atlantic from left and right alike. His discussion takes the form of a meditation on John Henry Newman's The Idea of a University Defined and Illustrated, originally presented as lectures in the 1850s when Newman was setting up the Catholic University of Dublin as its first Rector. Utilitarians had argued that the value of knowledge resides in its use as a means to such ends as controlling nature and creating wealth. Newman asserted that knowledge is an end in itself, worth pursuing and having for its own sake; and that the university is the home of this disinterested quest. Pelikan agrees, and adds that treating knowledge as an intrinsic value must be understood in a wider context of intellectual virtues. These include freedom of enquiry; intellectual integrity; good-mannered debate; tolerance of differing opinions; rationality as a supreme value; and preparedness to submit the conclusions of enquiry to public assessment. The object is not to impose or defend given ideologies or moralities, but to strive, with utmost respect for truth, towards increased understanding of humanity and the world. It is obvious that the pursuit of knowledge on these terms is an intrinsic good. When one adds the instrumental good - the fact that enquiry yields a host of scientific, social and cultural benefits and produces trained minds and professional skills to serve the community - it is obvious likewise that the pursuit of knowledge is an absolute good. But the setting in which enquiry occurs is all-important. Universities provide that setting because they uniquely combine four activities: research, teaching, collecting the materials of scholarship, and publishing the outcomes. If any one of these mutually necessary activities ceases, the others are immediately impoverished and soon nullified. Pelikan argues that universities can only function if all four activities are maintained, and at the best standards. The present crisis in higher education stems from the fact that they, and the conditions of enquiry they sustain, are under threat from financial cuts, from internal and external political hostility, and because the wider public no longer understands the importance of having universities. Pelikan is neither star-struck nor a special pleader. He is swift with the lash when universities deserve it. Universities and dons can, and sometimes have, let themselves and society down. But the contribution they make is not a luxury. Without having in its midst a continuing search for knowledge and understanding, conducted in freedom and with vigour to the highest standards of excellence - and producing successive generations of reflective, knowledgeable, literate minds - a society is dead. By reconsidering Newman's views Pelikan gives a thoughtful, eloquent restatement of the university ideal, reminding us at this crucial moment in the history of higher education that to cut facilities and standards in the universities is to switch out the streetlamps on the road to progress.</p>

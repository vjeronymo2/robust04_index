			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> TRAUMA TROUBLES: Orange County once had five trauma centers; with the closing  of Fountain Valley Regional Hospital's center, it now has three (B1). . . .  Since 1980, the centers have reduced the mortality rate in "preventable deaths"  from 70% to under 5%, according to research by Dr. John G. West, a St. Joseph  Hospital surgeon and trauma expert. . . . If another center closes, a potential  disaster looms because of the domino effect on other aspects of medical care,  West says, adding: "No way two trauma centers can do it."

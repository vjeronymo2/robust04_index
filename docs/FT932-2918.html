			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (12): Teams of experts ponder the options - Discount schemes One of the many criticisms that UK businesses used to make of telecommunications services in the UK was that the price of a call was the same regardless of whether you were a residential customer running up bills of Pounds 50 a quarter, or a multinational corporation generating millions of pounds a year of revenues for BT. This is no longer the case. Since 1991, BT and Mercury have been offering a sliding scale of discounted telecommunications services, and large users have been buying telephone calls for as much as 20 per cent less than the infrequent caller. But the introduction of discounts has brought with it a new problem: deciding which discount scheme is best, and predicting in advance the level of spend on telecommunications services over a period of three months. Even when it is clear which of the packages offered by one operator is best, it can be difficult to compare discount schemes offered by BT on one hand, Mercury on the other, and increasingly, cable television companies and other competitors. Large companies have telecommunications managers and teams of experts who can work their way through the different options and decide what mix of services suits them best. But the small and medium-sized business, where telephone services have only ever merited the same care and consideration as gas, electricity or water supply, often lack the expertise and resources to make the right choice. Those companies which make the wrong choice, or make no choice at all, may lose the opportunity to make savings on one of their biggest items of expenditure and one which will rise as we move towards an information-based society. BT introduced the first bulk discounts in 1991. Mercury, which was offering discounts of between I0 per cent and 25 per cent on all long-distance and international routes, was stealing some of BT's biggest accounts and the former monopoly needed a defence. BT's discounts apply on a site-by-site, or a multi-site basis. A company which houses all its operations under one roof would choose a site-by-site discount scheme. But for businesses with many different sites dotted around the country each generating a small amount of traffic - for example a chain of shops - a multi-site scheme could prove more attractive. The site-by-site discount packages are called Option 15, Option 45, Option 50 and Option 70. For quarterly payments ranging from Pounds 3.40 to Pounds 275, users qualify for discounts on BT's basic call charges of between I0 per cent and 16 per cent. Residential and small business users usually opt for Option 15 or Option 45 because their quarterly spend is not high enough to make it worth their while paying the high up-front cost to qualify for maximum discounts. Option 2000 is BT's multi-site discount package. With this tariff option there are discounts on total call charges generated by several sites. The same principle applies as with the other Options packages; users qualifying for discounts of between 14 per cent and 16 per cent in return for up-front quarterly payments of between 14 per cent and 16 per cent. For every BT Option, Mercury has a discount scheme of its own. For Options 15, 40, 50 and 70, read Frequent Caller Programme Levels One, Two, Three and Four, all of which offer higher discounts on basic Mercury prices the greater the quarterly payment. Mercury has a set of discounts for its directly connected customers on the one hand, and indirectly connected customers on the other. As a rule, large users are connected directly - they have Mercury lines running into and out of their premises - and small to medium-sized companies take indirect services in which case they are connected by BT lines as far as the local exchange, but connect to Mercury for long-distance and international calls. For directly-connected sites, Mercury offers discounts averaging 5.7 per cent to 8.8 per cent in return for quarterly fees of between Pounds 300 and Pounds 700. Indirectly connected customers get discounts of 11.5 per cent to 17.4 per cent for national calls, and 18.3 per cent to 20.9 per cent for international calls after paying site fees of Pounds 5 to Pounds 450. Mercury has another discount package called its Corporate Plan which is for multi-site businesses and to compete with BT's Option 2000. Deciding which combination of discount packages is right for your business is not easy. A niche has been created for independent consultants to provide expert advice, and there is increased demand for reports such as the Octagon Guide to Telecommunications Tariffs and the Guide to BT and Mercury Business Telephony Tariffs published by Infrastructure, Technology and Communications (ITC), a London-based consultancy. The Octagon guide concludes that Mercury 2100 - its directly connected service - is the cheapest telephone service. 'Mercury savings over BT,' it says, 'are up to 9 per cent, after taking account of the best BT or Mercury options, rental charges and option charges.' ITC's key findings are that Mercury savings for single sites are between 5 per cent and 15 per cent for directly-connected sites, and up to 10 per cent for indirectly-connected sites. On a multi-site basis, Mercury savings to BT range from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Medium to large businesses, however, will often require a mixture of BT and Mercury services and of single-site and multi-site discount packages. The savings on basic call charges for a company that mixes and matches different discount schemes is substantial. Prudent management of telephone services is fast developing as an effective means of cost control.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- The Korean People's  Army [KPA] soldiers are performing feats of labor at socialist  construction sites.    The People's Army soliders mobilized in building the  Pyongyang-Hyangsan express highway have almost completed the  laying of the roadbed in the section of one hundred and scores  of kilometres. They are pushing ahead with the construction of  many difficult and complicated structures including bridges and  tunnels at an accelerated pace.    The soldiers in charge of the construction of a Ungna  suspension bridge across the Taedong River flowing through  Pyongyang are stepping up the project of the bridge extending  hundreds of metres at the final stage.    The People's Army soldiers have undertaken many other major  objects of the country. Among the monumental edifices built by  them in all parts of the country are the February 8 Vinalon  complex, the February 8 cement complex, the February 8 Chiktong  youth coal mine, the Taechon power stations, the West Sea  Barrage, and the Pyongyang-Wonsan express highway.    The Grand Metro, the February 8 House of Culture, the ice  rink and other monumental architectures in the capital were also  built by People's Army soldiers.    In recent years they completed with credit scores of large  construction projects such as the Pyongyang-Kaesong express  highway and 800-kilometre-long waterways on the west coast.    It was at the time of the construction of the February 8  vinalon complex that the People's Army soldiers created the  "Vinalon" speed by building 50 odd structures with a plottage of  500,000 square metres in a short period.    When they took charge of the construction of the west sea  barrage in which four billion dollars were invested, they  performed feats by completing it in a matter of five years,  which would have taken dozen of years by the established method  of construction.    Many heroes and order recipients emerged from among the  people's Army soldiers in the whole period of socialist  construction.</p>

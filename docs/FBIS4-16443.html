			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "`Decembrists' Now Have </F> Political Platform and Boris Fedorov Has His Own Draft Law"]    [Text] Yesterday the "12 December" parliamentary group  published its political platform signed by all 26 "Decembrists."  The group will now be called the "12 December"  Liberal-Democratic Union.    The "Decembrists'" political platform is based on two  fundamental principles: loyalty to liberal-democratic values  and a "healthy" conservatism. As we know, the group's leader,  Boris Fedorov, had previously opposed "the political extremism  of some democrats." In the document on offer the idea of  conservatism is reflected in the interpretation of individual  elements of social policy (the conservation of the system of  free state health care with the gradual development of  compulsory medical insurance; the recognition as valid of all  awards of the USSR and the retention of their benefits by heroes  of the Soviet Union and holders of the orders of Glory) and in  the view of global questions of statehood. The "Decembrists"  proclaim loyalty to the conservation of the Russian state's  unity, putting forward the following slogans: "No to  self-determination, yes to self-management," "no to a  single-channel tax system," and "we are for unity of status,  equal rights and powers for all components of the federation."  The thesis of the defense of the Russian-speaking population's  rights outside Russia "by all means accessible to the state" has  been put forward.    The "Decembrists" are by no means put out by the fact that  there is already one liberal-democratic party in Russia. They  insist that they are the true liberals and democrats since they  consistently defend the principle of the freedom of the  individual and a strong state as a guarantee of the individual's  prosperous existence.    The main thesis of the economic platform is: "We are in  favor of a firm ruble. Inflation in 1994 should be reduced to  1-3 percent a month." In addition the "Decembrists" advocate  financial discipline, are opposed to the issue of all kinds of  benefits, and favor a realistic budget, "a one-off reduction of  taxes by 15-25 percent to encourage business activity with the  simultaneous reduction of state expenditure, and a reduction in  the amount and types of taxation."    Social policy, the "12 December" group members believe,  should be built on the intensification of targeted support for  poor strata of the population.    As for big-league politics, the attitude toward political  parties and movements is outlined as follows. "Russia's Choice"  and "Yabloko" are "potential allies." But "we are in favor of  greater pragmatism and a less politicized approach." The  Liberal-Democratic Party -- its leadership is "shaming Russia"  and its name "does not reflect the essence of that leadership's  activity." We are in favor of cooperation with "Women of  Russia." We are in favor of collaboration with the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord. But only with individual "members  close to us in their views." Here it is stipulated that "the  position of part of that party's leadership contradicts Russia's  interests and does not promote the attainment of civil accord."    In an exclusive interview with IZVESTIYA, Boris Fedorov  specified that it is primarily the national-state policy of that  "part of the leadership" which the "Decembrists" do not like.  Obviously the group disagrees with that part (and they  undoubtedly have Sergey Shakhray in mind) also on the question  of the political amnesty, which is sharply denounced in the  document.    As for the Communists, "we will not accept the majority of  their ideological dogmas" but "we see among them sensible people  with whom we can cooperate on specific programs." The  "Decembrists" see the Agrarian Party members as potential allies  although they "do not agree with their present approaches toward  economic policy."    The document also outlines the attitude toward the  government: "We are not in the opposition." But only "as long  as there is a chance of the government continuing constitutional  transformations." The idea is also expressed of supporting a  coalition government if "the coalition is based on consistent  market reforms and loyalty to democratic principles and the  principles of a social state."    The "Decembrists" oppose early presidential elections.    Commenting for IZVESTIYA on the aims of the publication of  the political platform, Boris Fedorov noted that the main thing  "is to agree within the Duma." But he did not rule out the  possibility that in the future the proposed theses could become  the basis for the political platform of the "Decembrists'"  party. But that is obviously a question for the quite remote  future: At a press conference devoted to the platform's adoption  both Fedorov and Khakamada stated resolutely that they will not  set the tasks of creating a party in the immediate future. But  work will nonetheless be conducted in the regions, for the  members of the union represent the most diverse territories.    "This is not another Moscow elite get-together at which only  his staffers stand behind the leader," Boris Fedorov stated.    At the same time observers note that if you combine  Fedorov's  prestige and "Mrs. Khakamada's ability to earth up people" the  party could be successful.    It is true that its electorate remains a serious question  for  the future party. The problem is that it coincides very much  with the electorate of Gaydar's party. Fedorov himself has said  on this subject that anyone who wants to come to us can come.  This must be understood as meaning good riddance to anyone who  does not want to.    At the press conference convened yesterday to present the  "Decembrists'" political platform the group's leader also  sharply denounced the Russian Government's signing of the  agreement on the unification of the Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems.    And to ensure that in the future the authorities have no  opportunity for making decisions so easily on the unification of  monetary systems or of conducting monetary reforms, Boris  Fedorov suggests adopting a new law on the Central Bank which he  has written. The main difference between this version of the  law and the current one is that Fedorov himself believes it  leaves less room for voluntarist actions by the Central Bank  leadership. And a dual-level system is proposed for the bank's  management -- trough the council of directors and an observation  council -- which in the author's opinion will block the adoption  of pointless, unconsidered decisions.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: WOMAN HELPS TO PRESERVE HISTORY  </P> <P> To preserve history, one must first save the paper it is written on, and Jane  Mueller, a preservation librarian, is an expert in that lonely field.  </P> <P> "People don't understand that there are things that can be done to preserve  those important documents," said the Buena Park woman, who has mastered the  fine art of paper preservation.  </P> <P> With modern methods, paper can be preserved indefinitely, Mueller said.  </P> <P> She has shown others how it works in two free paper preservation workshops held  at the Fullerton Library in August and earlier this month.  </P> <P> She may hold more.  </P> <P> "It appears there is somewhat of a resurgence of history keeping, and people  are holding it intact by preserving it whether the material is a family  document, a news clipping or grandfather's scrapbook," she said.  </P> <P> She demonstrated how to relax, de-acidify, clean and encapsulate paper and  photographs by wrapping them with tape and polyester plastic.  </P> <P> Older methods -- such as gluing keepsakes to newspapers that are bound with  shoelaces -- are sometimes successful, Mueller said, although archaic.  </P> <P> "A lot of those papers were then stored in old chests," keeping out moisture  and air, she said.  </P> <P> "I want the public to know that someone cares about their documents," said the  one-time seamstress.  </P> <P> Mueller attended Cypress College and Cal State Fullerton, earning a degree  after 12 years.  </P> <P> "I was also raising children and had a house and husband to take care of," she  explained.  </P> <P> Because few firms handle small jobs, most document preservation occurs at home,  Mueller said.  </P> <P> While history has always been her interest, Mueller's work with the Santiago  Library System Heritage Project "is really where it all started."  </P> <P> She developed a computer database there of Southern California local history  collections.  </P> <P> But before that, "I liked working with my hands, and that included making  paper," said the former fourth-grade substitute schoolteacher.  </P> <P> "I really enjoyed teaching and remember saying to myself, 'Gosh, I don't know  what they are paying me for.' "  </P> <P> But she also enjoyed working with paper and finding a way to preserve history.  </P> <P> "I think I was past 40 before I really got fully interested in history," said  Mueller, 60. "I guess it takes time for people to acquire that interest."  </P> <P> Tape-recorded oral histories are another way to permanently store historical  keepsakes. "When you have a recording of a voice it provides you with a better  sense of history and time by hearing the actual voice," Mueller said.  </P></p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): Surge in support may be too late for Democrats - Republicans threaten to win control of US Senate The good news for Democrats eight days before the US mid-term elections is that a few closely watched races may be turning in their favour. The bad news is that the trend may not be enough to stop big Republican gains, including control of the Senate. President Bill Clinton, fresh from a successful Middle East tour, with more good economic news to tout and with an improvement registered in most public opinion polls, hits the campaign trail in earnest today. He will focus on tight contests where his presence, previously scorned by many Democratic candidates, may now make a difference. In California yesterday, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic incumbent not far ahead of Congressman Michael Huffington, received an endorsement from Mr Richard Riordan, Republican mayor of Los Angeles. She hopes this will have a comparable impact to that given to Mr Mario Cuomo, New York's Democratic governor, after receiving an unqualified nod of approval last week from Mr Rudolph Giuliani, Republican mayor of New York City. Mr Cuomo has at least pulled level with Mr George Pataki, his Republican opponent. Ms Feinstein's lead over Mr Huffington had slipped from nine points to three in the latest Los Angeles Times survey. But this was taken before the Republican congressman, who has made curbs on illegal immigration a centrepiece of his campaign, admitted employing a British nanny in the US without proper immigration papers. In Pennsylvania, Senator Harris Wofford, the Democrat, was endorsed by Mrs Teresa Heinz, widow of the popular Republican senator killed in an aircraft crash in 1991. She said his opponent, Congressman Rick Santorum, was 'short on public service and even shorter on accomplishment'. In Virginia, Mr Oliver North, the Republican candidate running Senator Charles Robb about even, was battling to overcome criticism from Mrs Nancy Reagan, wife of the former president, who accused Mr North of lying to and about her husband. But the bad news for Democrats stems from an analysis of all the polls in the 35 Senate races due to be decided on November 8. The Democrats, with a 56-44 majority, can afford to lose no more than six seats to retain control. Two seem lost already. In Maine, where Senator George Mitchell is retiring, Republican Congresswoman Olympia Snowe holds an apparently insurmountable lead over Congressman Tom Andrews. In Ohio, where Senator Howard Metzenbaum is also retiring, Lt Gov Michael DeWine, the Republican, seems sure to beat Mr Joel Hyatt, Senator Metzenbaum's son-in-law. Arizona, being vacated by Senator Dennis DeConcini, had also seemed a lost cause, though one poll last week found Congressman Sam Coppersmith, the Democrat, pulling to within five points of Congressman John Kyl. Ten other Senate contests are either leaning Republican or too close to call. Of these, the seven endangered Democratic seats include four defended by incumbents - Ms Feinstein, Mr Robb, Mr Wofford and Mr James Sasser in Tennessee - and three left open by retirement, in Michigan, Oklahoma and the second seat in Tennessee, formerly held by Mr Gore. The polls are not always reliable. But, together with anecdotal reporting in the US press, they tend to suggest that virtually everything will need to break right for the Democrats to cling on to the Senate.

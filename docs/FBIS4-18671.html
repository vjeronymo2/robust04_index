			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 7 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister  Francois Leotard called Thursday [7 April] for evacuation  procedures to be set up for the eventuality of crises "in black  Africa and North Africa" with or without the agreement of local  governments.    Commenting on the fighting in Rwanda following the death of  the Rwandan and Burundi presidents in an aircrash said to have  been caused by unknown attackers, Leotard said that France and  its military chiefs of staff were preparing for the evacuation  of French nationals.    It was to be expected that such procedures would be required  increasingly often in the future, notably in black Africa and  North Africa, he told reporters here.    The evacuations could be carried out with the cooperation of  local authorities, who would facilitate access to ports and  airports and provide radio liaison, or, in cases of war, without  their cooperation.    France last year called on its nationals resident in Algeria  to pull out of the North African country following a wave of  attacks on foreigners by Islamic fundamentalists.</p>

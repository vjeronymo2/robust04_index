			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities turn higher towards the close THE picture suddenly bright-ened towards the close of dealings on the London stock market yesterday when gilt-edged prices turned firmer, signalling a more optimistic view of today's auction of Pounds 3bn of government securities. Also helping share prices was the official US support for the dollar, which reversed an initial gain in the pound, and also a sizeable buy programme of UK equities from a leading US investment bank. While trading volumes remained unexciting, the FT-SE 100 Index bounced successfully at 2,812 to replace its early loss of 10 points with a gain of similar proportions. The final reading put the index at 2,832.7, a net rise of 10.4. Stock index futures helped to fuel the recovery in equities. The London market was surprised by the appearance of the buying programme from the US because much of its recent weakness appeared to originate from across the Atlantic. An estimated value of around Pounds 125m was put on the programme, in which the battered pharmaceutical sector rated highly; some looked for favourable developments on the Clinton administration's healthcare plans. Earlier in the day, one of the leading London-based securities houses also operated a large programme. Since many of the trades in both programmes were protected trades, the details did not appear on the trading screens until the end of the session, when they spurred the general recovery. The programmes helped to boost equity turnover, as reported by the Seaq system, to 596.6m shares yesterday from the 491.9m recorded on Monday, when retail business only just scraped above the Pounds 1bn mark now established as a daily minimum. Dealers are hopeful that equities will regain the centre of the stage when today's gilt-edged auction is out of the way. With the recent outbreak of bid speculation less active yesterday - United Biscuits came off the boil - the market returned its attention to the basic prospects of the economy and of corporate earnings. Once again, the stock market paid little heed to signs of economic optimism, making scant response to the latest industrial trends survey by the Confederation of British Industry, which said that business confidence had shown its highest monthly rise for a decade. Corporate trading figures from the retail and building sectors brought no surprises for equities. Caution regarding the market outlook was expressed at an investment conference hosted in London by Kleinwort Benson Securities. The consensus of fund managers was that the FT-SE 100 would be 7 per cent higher at 3,040 at the year-end, and 13 per cent up at 3,190 in 12 months' time. Potential problems of liquidity were raised by managers' inclinations to increase holdings of Japanese equities, with London perhaps vulnerable in view of impending cash demands for the government's funding programme, as well as for planned fund-raising in equities by Zeneca and BT. Against this backcloth, strategists pointed out that this week has seen the Footsie drift down towards the low end of its trading range and a recovery was to be expected; the question remains whether the market can successfully challenge the existing year's high points in the 2,957 area.</p>

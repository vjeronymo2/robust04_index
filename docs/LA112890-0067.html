			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLENTY OF GRACE HEADS MATRIARCH  </P> <P> Plenty of Grace, who was 56-1 when she won the Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita on  Nov. 4, will be a considerably shorter price and may even go off as the  favorite on Sunday in the $200,000 Matriarch at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Trainer John Veitch hopes that a victory in the 1 1/8-mile Matriarch might be  enough to convince voters that his 3-year-old filly deserves the Eclipse Award  for best female on grass this year.  </P> <P> The other stake at Hollywood Park this weekend is Saturday's $100,000 Native  Diver Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on dirt.

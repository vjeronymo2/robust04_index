			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONE DISCOVERY MAY SHOW THAT NEANDERTHAL MAN COULD TALK  </P> <P> The discovery of a 60,000-year-old, two-inch neck bone in a cave in Israel,  reported in today's issue of the British journal Nature, suggests that modern  man's brutish predecessor, the Neanderthal, may have had the physical capacity  to speak.  </P> <P> The conclusion -- drawn by a group of Israeli, French and American  archeologists -- has provoked sharp reactions from other scientists and has  rekindled a long-simmering controversy over the origin and evolution of human  language.  </P> <P> But Baruch Arensburg and his colleagues in Israel contend that the tiny  U-shaped fossil, which was discovered in the Kebara Cave at Mt. Carmel, closely  resembles its counterpart, known as the hyoid bone, in modern humans. What that  means, they say, is that voice-production machinery has changed little over the  past 60,000 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Speech Capability  </P> <P> "We conclude," they wrote in the Nature article, "that the morphological basis  for human speech capability appears to have been fully developed during the  Middle Paleolithic" -- the period known as the Stone Age, from about 2.5  million to 9,000 years ago.  </P> <P> The ability to talk -- to make commands, to articulate arguments, to give voice  to emotions -- is surely one of the most complex and remarkable of human  achievements. Speech has long been thought to be the characteristic that  separates modern humans from their ape-like ancestors.  </P> <P> For some years now, many anatomists, anthropologists, linguists and others  working in Europe and the United States have concluded that the physical  elements necessary for complex spoken language -- the voice box, the tongue and  associated muscles -- must have evolved to today's level of sophistication  about 300,000 to 400,000 years ago. Researchers have based their conclusions on  massive reconstructions of the head and neck bones of early human and pre-human  fossils and computerized models of the soft tissues that probably surrounded  these bones.  </P> <P> Critics have wasted no time in voicing their skepticism about the new study.  </P> <P> "This guy is way off base," said Dr. Edmund S. Crelin, a distinguished  professor of anatomy at Yale University School of Medicine. "What he's done is  basically attach a whole theory of evolution to a little bone."  </P> <P> "The problem," said Dr. Jeffrey T. Laitman, associate professor of anatomy at  the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York, "is that this is the first and  only bone of its kind that we have found" in the fossilized remains of  prehistoric man. "For all we know, all hyoid bones may look alike all the way  back to the beginning of time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mammals Have Bone  </P> <P> According to Philip Lieberman, professor of cognitive and linguistic sciences  at Brown University, most mammals have a hyoid bone that looks much like the  human equivalent and yet it is clear that most mammals cannot speak as humans  do.  </P> <P> "If we were to accept the reasoning of these archeologists, we could prove that  pigs talk. Which may explain the Old Testament injunction against eating pig.  In a happier, earlier time in Israel perhaps pigs did talk," Lieberman quipped.  </P> <P> The debate, the scientists agree, is not over whether Neanderthals or other  predecessors of modern man could make sounds or even whether they could  communicate by means of their voices -- indeed most animals can and do. The  issue is whether they were able to articulate the vast range of modern human  sounds that make complex human speech possible.  </P> <P> "The first human vocal tracts appear in fossils 300,000 years ago," Crelin  said. "The evidence is very clear . . . in the shape of the skulls, the length  of the mandibles (or lower jaws). Before that, they (the vocal tracts) look  like those of an ape or a baby."  </P> <P> One of the interesting aspects of the human vocal tract is that it changes over  time. At birth, a human baby's vocal tract is shaped and positioned much like  that of a dog or a cat, which means it can make only a limited number of sounds  and has the ability to breath and swallow at the same time. At about one year  of age, the larynx descends and human speech as we know it begins to form.  </P> <P> But adult humans pay a big price for the ability to speak. Because they cannot  breath and swallow at the same time, they can choke to death fairly easily and  quickly.  </P> <P> The elaborate reconstructions and computer models of human head and neck and  mouth structures provide "persuasive evidence" of a rather dramatic evolution  in the structure of the vocal tract, Laitman said.  </P> <P> "Baruch and his colleagues haven't proven anything; they've only made  assertions," Laitman added. "In science, you can't just say it; you have to  show it. This isn't the 19th Century, which is the kind of science they are  practicing."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview from his office at Yale, Crelin was even less  complimentary of Baruch. "This guy's an idiot," said Crelin, who acknowledged  being particularly irritated by a less than flattering review that Baruch had  written earlier of a book Crelin wrote in 1987 explaining the evolution of the  human vocal tract. In the review in the "American Scientist," Baruch called  Crelin's theories "unexplained," his conclusions "bizarre" and described the  book as having "anatomical errors."  </P> <P> "He says he found anatomical mistakes in my book!" Crelin exclaimed. "My God,  for 35 years I've been the expert on anatomy here."  </P> <P> The ferocity with which these scientists were attacking each other this week is  not uncommon in the field of vocal evolution, according to those who are in the  middle of the dispute. One of the reasons seems to be that the controversy over  human speech is part of a larger debate on whether Neanderthals were direct  ancestors of modern humans, rather than an evolutionary dead-end.  </P> <P> Behind that controversy is an even larger debate over exactly where and how  prehistoric ape-like mammals made their fateful transition to modern human  beings.  </P> <P> On one side, there are those -- and the numbers are growing -- who hold that  modern humans evolved in one place -- probably Africa -- and then migrated  throughout the world. In this camp, racial differences are attributed to human  evolutionary responses to regional conditions.  </P> <P> On the other side are those -- among them Baruch and a number of prominent  scientists -- who believe that modern humans arose virtually simultaneously and  independently in different places in Africa, Europe and Asia.  </P></p>

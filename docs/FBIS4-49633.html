			<p>BFN     [Text]Hong Kong, may 6 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese official  reiterated here today that no matter what happens the principle  of "one country, two systems" will not change for at least 50  years. "I foresee that the principle of 'one country, two  systems' will not change not only within 50 years, but much  longer," said Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office of the State Council, at a luncheon given in his honor.  "The obvious reason is that we are still in the primary stage  of socialism. We need hundreds of years to build China into a  strong socialist state. In this whole course of building  socialism, Hong Kong will continue to play its important role as  a bridge between China and the Western world," Lu said. "It is  a correct policy, it is good for Hong Kong, good for the country  and good for the rest of the world. It is also acceptable to  all. Why would China want to change it?" he asked. The  director said, "it is the responsibility of the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office to see that the principle of 'one country,  two systems' as well as all the basic policies laid down in the  joint declaration and the Basic Law are being fully carried  out." The principle of "one country, two systems" is embodied  in all the articles of the Basic Law, which was adopted by the  National People's Congress and has become a national law, he  said, adding that it has to be observed not only by Hong Kong  but also by the rest of China for matters relating to Hong Kong.  Noting that it took four years and eight months to work out  the Basic Law, he said "if we are not serious in carrying out  the principle of 'one country, two systems', why on earth should  we spend such a lot of time, money and energy to put it into  law?" "I wish to repeat that the principle of 'one country,  two systems' is guaranteed by law," the director said.</p>

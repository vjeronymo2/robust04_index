Vice Economics Minister Sheu Ke-sheng [Hsu K'e-sheng] made  the statement on the second day of US-Taiwan trade negotiations  called to discuss Taiwan's bid for full membership in the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    On the first day of talks Thursday, the US expressed its  dissatisfaction with Taiwan's proposed tariff reductions, saying  they were far short of US expectations.    The US said Taiwan did not make a "complete" response to its  Nov. 24, 1993 request that Taiwan lower tariffs on more than  8,000 farm and industrial products.    Taipei Thursday submitted a list of 253 farm and 2,097  industrial products pegged for tariff cuts.    During the talks, the US also asked how Taiwan would handle  its existing restrictions on the import of agricultural products  after its admission to GATT.    Taiwan delegates said Taiwan hoped to follow the example set  by South Korea and gradually open its market to foreign  agricultural products.    On the US concerns over Taiwan's export subsidies,  inspection  systems and quarantine, the Taipei delegates said Taiwan has  never subsidized its farm exports and its inspection and  quarantine practices are all in line with GATT standards.    Meanwhile, a Finance Ministry official noted that the US had  not set any specific agenda for Friday's negotiations on  financial and service industry issues.    He said this was because Taiwan had opened its financial  market wider than any other Southeast Asian country.</p>

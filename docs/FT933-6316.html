			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Brierley Investments disposes of half its Guinness Peat holding BRIERLEY Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment company once headed by Sir Ron Brierley, has sold half its shares in Guinness Peat Group, Sir Ron's UK investment vehicle, the Australian Stock Exchange reported. BIL sold 65m shares, or 19.2 per cent of GPG's issued capital, at 62.5 Australian cents a share. It retains 63.7m shares - 18 per cent of the capital. GPG said on Tuesday, when announcing a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.15m to Pounds 6.75m, that it would be listed in Australia from Wednesday. BIL said yesterday that now GPG had a listing in Australia it was appropriate to place half BIL's shareholding there. This would provide for wider participation and liquidity in the shares in that market. BIL, from which Sir Ron was ousted as chairman several years ago, owned more than 60 per cent of GPG at the beginning of the decade. After restructuring and recapitalising, BIL reduced its shareholding to 40 per cent in 1991. The company said this had completed its direct role in GPG, and facilitated its new direction as an entrepreneurial investment company under the chairmanship of Sir Ron.</p>

In a statement to REUTER, 'Abd-Rabbuh said that the PLO will  receive an Israeli delegation within the next few days to  discuss measures that will provide security for Palestinians in  the occupied territory. 'Abd-Rabbuh added that PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat has no plans to meet with Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres in Cairo tomorrow, as was reported earlier.    'Abd-Rabbuh said that what is important for Palestinians is  to implement the UN Security Council resolution on the Hebron  massacre and for the Israeli Government to adopt full and  tangible measures in this regard. 'Abd-Rabbuh said that the  U.S. coordinator, Dennis Ross, proposed such a meeting in a  telephone call to 'Arafat last Thursday.</p>

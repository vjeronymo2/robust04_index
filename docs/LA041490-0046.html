			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 45-DAY MORATORIUM ON CONSTRUCTION SET  </P> <P> Concerned by oversized homes and recent resident complaints about the  proliferation of condominiums, the Alhambra City Council has enacted a 45-day  moratorium on construction.  </P> <P> The emergency moratorium will give city officials "breathing room" while they  review development standards for areas zoned for medium to high density, Mayor  Barbara Messina said.  </P> <P> The moratorium exempts property owners who have already submitted plans to the  city's Department of Community Development. About 120 applicants fall into that  category, City Manager Kevin Murphy said.  </P> <P> In 1988, the city imposed a moratorium for about six months while it rezoned  and reduced densities in 23 neighborhoods. The council, which may extend the  latest moratorium, scheduled a May 14 public hearing on the matter.  </P></p>

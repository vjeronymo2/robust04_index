			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 16 SAPA -- An SA National Defence  Force patrol on Monday found the body of a 20-year-old man  believed to have been "necklaced" in Tokoza on the East Rand,  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news  reports. The charred body was found at about 2PM on the corner  of Lekwane and Masibuko Streets -- about two blocks away from  the Tokoza hostels.    Inkatha Freedom Party whip in the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] legislature Gertrude Mzizi told  reporters at the scene the victim was believed to have been an  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] member allegedly caught by a mob in  a known African National Congress stronghold.    Mrs Mzizi expressed the belief that violence had flared up  in  the East Rand townships after a quiet spell during the elections  because of the new troop deployment there. She said acts of  criminal and political violence had increased because the new  troops were unfamiliar with the area, especially the hot-spots.  However, the situation could improve as they got to know the  area better.    The police said the motive for the killing was unknown but a  murder docket had been opened.</p>

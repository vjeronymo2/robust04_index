			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Western and Russian  mediators have failed to narrow differences between Muslims and  Bosnian Serbs on a cease-fire to revive peace talks.    A meeting between the newly formed "Contact Group" and  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in the Bosnian Serb  stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo on Friday [29 April] appeared  to make little progress, reports reaching here said.    During the two-hour meeting, Serb leaders insisted on an  overall permanent cease-fire in Bosnia, reports quoted the  mediators as saying.    On Thursday, Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic proposed a  temporary truce of two to three months to allow time for a  settlement of territorial disputes.    Bosnian Muslims fear that a permanent cease-fire would allow  the serbs to hold on to captured land, stalling a final peace  settlement.    The "Contact Group", consisting of representatives from  Russia, the United States, the European Union (EU) and the  United Nations, headed to Sarajevo for another meeting with  Izetbegovic.    Before leaving Pale, Charles Redman, the U.S. representative  of the group, stressed that differences between Serbs and  Muslims over the length of a proposed cease-fire must be  overcome before peace talks could resume.    Also on Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  reportedly proposed an interim one-year cease-fire to seek a  final settlement in Bosnia. If a settlement is not then  reached, a high-level conference can be convened for arbitration.    The mediation team, faced with the task of securing a  cease-fire of at least three months and a division of Bosnia, is  preparing a report for discussion at a ministerial meeting on  Bosnia.    A member of the team was quoted by local media as saying  that  the difficulty will not be how much land the warring parties  get, but rather which land.    After meeting with the "Contact Group", Izetbegovic raised  new conditions for the resumption of peace talks, demanding that  the world community formally recognize the territorial integrity  of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He also asked that Serb forces "withdraw from the occupied  Muslim and croat territories" as a precondition for new peace  talks.    On Thursday, both Britain and the U.S. urged the three  warring parties-- Serbs, Muslims and Croats--to come to the  negotiating table and make "constructive efforts" in a new round  of peace talks.</p>

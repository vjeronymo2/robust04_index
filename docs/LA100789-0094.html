			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO SWISS RED CROSS WORKERS ABDUCTED IN S. LEBANON  </P> <P> Masked gunmen kidnaped two Swiss Red Cross workers at a medical center outside  the Lebanese port city of Sidon on Friday, the latest in a series of abductions  of foreign relief personnel in Lebanon's lawless south.  </P> <P> The two men, identified as Emmanuel Christen, 25, and Elio Erriquez, 23, were  bundled into the trunk of the kidnapers' car and driven off in the direction of  Ein el Hilwa, a large Palestinian refugee camp, according to press reports from  Sidon.  </P> <P> The Palestinian camp lies less than 100 yards from the Red Cross center, where  Christen and Erriquez were assigned as technicians fitting artificial limbs to  Lebanese war victims. One report quoted a policeman as saying the gunmen's car  and a backup vehicle entered the camp.  </P> <P> There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the abduction, the third  similar case in less than a year in the area.  </P> <P> Last November, the International Committee of the Red Cross withdrew its staff  members from Lebanon after the kidnaping of Peter Winkler, a Sidon-based  official of the organization. He was released a month later and Swiss  authorities sent their representatives back in January after reportedly  receiving assurances from armed groups that there would be no further  kidnapings.  </P> <P> Then, in May, gunmen abducted two West German men working for the Humanitas  relief organization in Sidon. The Germans, Heinrich Struebig and Thomas  Kempner, are still missing and believed to be among 16 foreign hostages still  held in Lebanon, including eight Americans. Most of the foreign hostages were  kidnaped in West Beirut, 25 miles north of Sidon, by pro-Iranian elements. On  July 31, one of the radical Islamic cells, the Organization of Oppressed on  Earth, reported that it had killed Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, one of  the American hostages, and released a videotape of his body, hanging from a  gallows.  </P> <P> Winkler's kidnapers reportedly had threatened to abduct other Swiss workers  after his release, alleging that the Red Cross and Swiss authorities had  reneged on a promised ransom payment.  </P> <P> Press reports from Sidon said that Friday's kidnapers were waiting in two cars  outside the medical center when Christen and Erriquez drove up to begin work.  "Christen parked the car at the center's parking lot and climbed out, holding  an artificial limb," a Lebanese policeman was quoted as saying. When two gunmen  jumped from one of the cars and trained their weapons on the medical aides, he  said, "Christen and Erriquez immediately threw their arms up, offering no  resistance. They were bundled at gunpoint into the trunk of the (car), which  sped off followed by the other car, loaded with armed guards."  </P> <P> Mustafa Saad, head of the Popular Liberation Army, a Lebanese militia that  effectively controls Sidon, denied any responsibility in the kidnaping in a  meeting with reporters. "This is an Ein el Hilwa affair, not mine," he was  quoted as saying, implicating radical Palestinian groups active in the refugee  camp.  </P> <P> Outside the camp is the Palestinian shantytown of Miye ou Miye, where forces of  the terrorist kingpin Abu Nidal reportedly have a base. His breakaway  Palestinian group, Fatah-Revolutionary Council, was implicated in the Winkler  kidnaping but has denied it played a role.  </P> <P> "I think those who carry out such actions do it as a blackmail (for ransom)  rather than for any political or national stand," Saad, the Nasserite leader,  told reporters Friday.  </P> <P> Carlos Bauverd, a spokesman for the Geneva-based International Committee of the  Red Cross, said the kidnaping of Christen and Erriquez would deter the  humanitarian work of his agencies that work in Lebanon.  </P></p>

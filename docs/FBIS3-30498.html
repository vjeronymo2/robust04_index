			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the Information Service of the 4th Corps of the </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Army]    [Text] The aggressor's formations of the Croatian Defense  Council [HVO] and the Croatian Army have virtually not stopped  artillery attacks in the zone covered by the 4th Corps in the  last 24 hours. Ustasha fighters were attacking virtually all  defense regions and the enemy fired dozens of projectiles from  (?different) artillery pieces. Unlike their [word indistinct]  practice so far, the ustashas especially intensified their  artillery activities during [word indistinct] morning. In the  region of Potocari in the north of the Mostar commune, over 50  mortar bombs of various calibers have been fired. Other regions  in the north of the Mostar Commune, such as (Plice) and (Racici)  were exposed to increased shelling, and the ustashas shot at the  lines of separation with [word indistinct]. There was also no  peace in the central parts of Mostar, so that about 30  projectiles, mostly mortar bombs of the largest caliber, have  been launched on the district of (Dalic) alone in the last 24  hours. However, other Mostar districts have not been spared,  because it has been registered that, late last night, the  Ustashas fired several rockets at the village of (Jelice) from a  multiple rocket launcher, and shells and mortar bombs were fired  at all districts in the region of Pracevac. At the separation  line, on the right bank of the Neretva River, along with  increased fire from infantry weapons, 25 mortar bombs were also  fired. Despite all the assaults by the enemy (?Ustasha)  formations, all lines of separation in the zone covered by the  4th Corps have remained unchanged and stable.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Australian jobless rate falls to 10.7% Signs that improvements in the Australian economy are finally having an effect on the nation's labour market were evident yesterday when it was announced that the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate fell from 11.1 per cent to 10.7 per cent last month. This is the largest monthly decrease since July 1992, and the improvement was far more marked than most analysts had predicted. The consensus estimate for the December unemployment rate had stood at about 11 per cent. The sharp decline last month will come as a considerable relief to the Keating government. There has been strong pressure from the country's powerful trade union lobby and Labor party caucus for action to be taken to address the jobless problem. Even the coalition opposition said it 'welcomed the recent improvement in the employment situation,' although Mr Alexander Downer, shadow treasurer, added that 'a substantial improvement in unemployment will require increasing levels of investment and consumer expenditure in the economy. 'It is crucial the government keep in perspective the severity of the unemployment problem that still exists in Australia, and tailor economic policy to reflect this,' he added, pointing to the 6.4 per cent unemployment rate in the US. The December figures, which represent the fourth straight month of jobs growth, showed that 23,200 new jobs were created last month, while the 'participation rate', the percentage of working-age population either in a job or actively looking for one, eased slightly from 63.2 per cent to 63 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] This year the fear felt by the  masters who have been harmed by the disavowal of polytheists'  cries by the Muslims of Iran and elsewhere made the unfit  servants of the city of God create an atmosphere of terror,  resort to threats, and arm their police force and obstruct the  disavowal of polytheists. It is under these conditions that the  skillful physician of the world of Islam--the esteemed guardian  of the Muslims' cause--approved canceling the disavowal of  polytheists' ceremony.    Until the direct confrontations between the enemies of the  Muslims and the pagan-breaking ceremonies for the disavowal of  polytheists, some people had not understood the philosophy  behind the Islamic Republic's insistence on holding the  disavowal marches and ceremonies and asked themselves and  others: What need is there for marches and struggles during the  Hajj pilgrimage and in the hot weather? And if the cry of  disavowal is raised, what harm will be done to arrogance? The  simple-minded thought that the so-called civilized world of the  world-devourers would tolerate such political problems and allow  opponents the right to live, to demonstrate, and to hold  marches. This allegation was based on permission being given  for marches in the so-called free Western countries. But it  should be clarified that those marches do not harm the  superpowers and other powers; it is the Mecca and Medina marches  that spark Muslim unity. It is the march in the city of God  that makes the polytheists tremble with fear.    The brave and alert Iranian nation and Muslim nations of the  world should know that their declaration of solidarity and their  marches in support of the Muslim nations, especially of the  Palestinian and Bosnian nations, are not only effective, but  will make the polytheists tremble.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Games Which Are Easy To See Through"] </F>   [Text] In election times political parties are less  inclined than ever to heap compliments on each other. Wooing  the electorate notoriously leaves no holds barred, and political  opponents come in for their share of the mud which is slung.    So, when politicians of differing hues lay into each other  without pulling any punches, their behavior should not be  examined too closely. Not all their expressions, descriptions,  and modes of addressing each other should be taken too  literally. Provided their comments are relevant, fair, and  remain within the bounds of decency, there is no cause for  complaint.    Unfortunately, though, the man is often played, rather than  the ball. Personalities are dragged into the gutter. Untruths,  half-truths, and sweeping statements are the currency. Utter  cock-and-bull stories and deceit are used to portray the  opposite camp in a bad light, while putting a halo round one's  own head.    Anyone descending to these depths and hitting below the belt  to gain attention not only abuses the rules of the game; he also  shows himself lacking the very qualities required to engage in  politics on behalf of the people. This is the opposite of  politics understood primarily as serving mankind. The first  stage of serving mankind is having respect for people, and  consideration. Anyone indifferent to the personal dignity of  others should not enter politics.    The 1994 election campaign now approaching its end cannot,  thank God, be said to have degenerated into mudslinging. There  have in the past been primaries when attempts were made to  overcome political opponents not through factual arguments, but  rather through insult, character assassination, and the like.  In this respect, there seems to have been an improvement in  this country's political life, which is to be definitely  welcomed.    For the past five years, the Christian Social Party and the  Socialists have governed the country together, as they  previously did between 1984 and 1989. This was a coalition  which at first glance was certainly not forged by love. The  governmental alliance between the CSV [Christian Social People's  Party] and the LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg] was  more of a marriage of convenience, based on the voters' verdict.  The arithmetical balance of power between the coalition  partners was decided by the voters. The two major parties  committed themselves to a joint governmental program, which  guaranteed our country's economic, social, and financial  progress, while placing a new emphasis on social policy.    The CSV and LSAP have now been sharing power for ten years.  They have achieved much, and managed to implement a great deal.  Luxembourg's prosperity has perceptibly increased. We  Luxembourgers are now better off than ever, as is confirmed by  all available international statistics. Other countries envy us  for this.    There is therefore a whiff of pettiness and meanness of  spirit when a party such as the LSAP now seeks to take all the  credit for the social achievements, the prosperity created, the  protection of jobs, and the continued economic diversification  during this period. But this is what it is doing when its  leading candidate brazenly claims the CSV is planning a "massive  authoritarian policy," and has ordered a "total halt on  welfare." The conservatives, he claims, would not shrink from  "interfering with the minimum wage, protection against wrongful  dismissal, and working hours."    This move by the Socialists to distance themselves is  schizophrenic. Are they so naive as to assume the voters are  unaware which party is responsible for the major welfare  legislation over the past 10 years? The reform of protection  against wrongful dismissal, early retirement legislation,  increase in minimum wages, tax reductions for low and medium  wage earners, the substantial increase in housing assistance,  improvements in family benefits, and the raising of students'  grants, are without exception the work of CSV ministers. Why  should these ministers do the exact opposite, after the election  on 12 June 1994, of what they did after the 1984 and 1989  elections?    The Socialists, taking stock of the 1984-1994 period,  proudly  offer such figures as the 83 percent increase in the welfare  budget between 1988 and 1994, to 54.7 billion Luxembourg francs  [LF], or the average 63.4 percent rise in pensions between  December 1985 and December 1992, only 17.7 percent of which  resulted from indexing. But all this is not just to the credit  of the Socialists, as they would have the voters believe. Are  these improvements not largely down to the budgetary policies of  the finance and budget minister [Jean-Claude Juncker], who as is  well-known belongs to the CSV?    The socialists also look back to 1990, claiming that the  then  average income of a Luxembourg family, after taking account of  inflation, was 34 percent higher than in 1985, and that since  1990 a great deal more has been done, including tax reform which  for example raised tax thresholds from 29,400 francs per month  (for a married couple with one child) to 59,700 francs in 1994.  When the Socialists say this, they are again trying to persuade  the voters that they should take the credit for it. But the  voters know very well that the tax reform so trumpeted by the  Socialists was the work of CSV Minister Jean-Claude Juncker.    We could go on listing further examples where the LSAP  claims  "There are no comparable achievements anywhere in the European  Union." They are mainly the work of CSV ministers in the  coalition government. Despite this, however, the LSAP's leading  candidate proclaims to the country that the CSV's antagonism to  social welfare must be resisted, and the LSAP must be the  barrier against the CSV's attacks on the welfare state. It's  enough to make you laugh!</p>

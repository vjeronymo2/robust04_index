			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bibby seeks Pounds 36m to help relieve Caterpillar debt J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the industrial and agricultural group, yesterday launched a Pounds 35.6m rights issue to relieve debt taken on with the acquisition of Spain's sole Caterpillar distributor. Bibby is 78.9 per cent-owned by the South African Barlow Rand group, which is taking up its full entitlement in the 1-for-4 issue. The 115p issue price compares with yesterday's opening of 136p. At the close 16p had been shed. Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, Bibby's chairman, said the rights issue was envisaged earlier this summer, when it raised its bid for Finanzauto to Pta15.9bn (Pounds 88m) to clinch success. Including more than Pounds 120m of Finanzauto's borrowings and contingent liabilities, the combined group's gearing had risen to about 150 per cent on net debt of more than Pounds 240m. By the end of the financial year in September, with the help of the issue proceeds, gearing would be down to about 90 per cent, he said. Further reductions would be achieved by cutting stock and selling non-core assets. The directors planned to maintain the final dividend at 6.9p to make an unchanged 9.75p total. In the six months to June 30, Finanzauto made pre-tax profits of Pta106m, down from Pta792m. That reflected a 50 per cent fall in the market for earth moving equipment in Spain. The balance of the rights issue has been underwritten by Cazenove.</p>

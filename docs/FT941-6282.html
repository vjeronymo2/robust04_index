			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ASW recovery under way with modest Pounds 0.1m ASW Holdings, the steel and construction products group, announced pre-tax profits of just Pounds 100,000 for 1993, but said it would return to satisfactory profits when margins better reflected the industry's costs. The outcome compared with a Pounds 10.8m loss in 1992, but is lower than the Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m forecast by analysts in November, when the company issued a profits warning because of rising scrap prices - its main raw material - and reduced selling prices on the Continent. Turnover rose from Pounds 367.8m to Pounds 428.5m, and operating profit on continuing operations bounced from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 8.1m. But operating losses and provisions on discontinued operations - reinforcement engineering in steel and fabrication on the construction side - were Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 7.8m) and net interest payable rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.9m. Losses per share were 0.7p, down from 16.2p. The final dividend is maintained at 3p, making an unchanged total of 6p. Operating profit in steel activities jumped to Pounds 9.4m from a loss of Pounds 600,000 in 1992. This reflected Pounds 10.4m of margin improvements - mainly in the second quarter but not maintained subsequently - and Pounds 2.1m from volume increases, offset by Pounds 2.5m of electricity price increases. Mr Alan Cox, chief executive, said the company had survived three years of 'awful' prices in the steel industry. But Allied Steel &amp; Wire had made further improvements in productivity last year, with sales per employee rising from Pounds 135,600 to Pounds 155,500. He predicted further improvements in productivity and said there had been some improvement in margins since the year-end. The issue of subsidies for lossmaking competitors in Europe was coming under attack, he said, but added: 'We object to people being subsidised to sell steel at below the cash costs of the lowest-cost producer'. The operating loss in construction systems deepened from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 4.2m, but Mr Edward Townsend, the new finance director, said continuing operations were making significant progress - especially the new stressing, tie and anchor systems - and a return to profitability is expected this year. COMMENT At 190p, ASW's share price has recovered from the jolt caused by November's profit warning, and the market is clearly betting that profits will rise quickly when margins improve. There are some signs of margin improvement in Europe, but demand for scrap is increasing as continuous production shifts to electric arc furnaces, underpinning the price. Fortunately the company remains on a roll when it comes to cost reduction, which in the short-term might provide greater benefits than margin improvement. Based on pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 5m this year, the prospective p/e is a heady 50. That may look over-optimistic, but the yield is not out of line with the sector and looks secure.</p>

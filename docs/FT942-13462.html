			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Observer in South Africa: Spin doctor magic Sir Tim Bell, Baroness Thatcher's favourite public relations man, clearly relishes challenges. Last week he was dodging the flak from his over-enthusiastic promotion of the D-day celebrations. In South Africa Sir Tim's outfit is now trying to sell the National party  - which brought you apartheid  - to black voters. Sir Tim is buoyant: 'We've doubled our share of the vote since November and the momentum is still coming our way,' he says, unprepared to accept that the Nats might lose. Maybe he's paid too much attention to his own briefing papers, the latest of which has fallen into Observer's hands. It reports that the Nats will 'trounce' Nelson Mandela's African National Congress in Northern Cape province; 'is ahead of the ANC by 13 per cent in Western Cape'; 'in the north-east, Orange Free State, Eastern Cape and Eastern Transvaal NP support has doubled'; and ANC support has 'shrunken from 71 to 54 per cent since last December'. The memo adds that, in the economy's heartland, the Pretoria-Witwatersrand region, Nat support has risen from 14 per cent to 29 per cent. 'The NP is poised to spring a real surprise on April 27-28,' it concludes. Don't hold your breath.</p>

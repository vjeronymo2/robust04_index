			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Only the Government of the People"] </F>   [Text] It is being said about UP [Uttar Pradesh] Chief  Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav that he supports strict discipline.  But the strictness he refers to should be soft from within. If  the officials do not understand the chief minister's definition  of strictness, then they might be making a serious mistake by  following his directives. Recently, he told senior police  officials in the state that they must be sensitive to the needs  of the poor, because this government is of the poor. At the same  time, the chief minister also told them that police officials  must pay special attention to the minorities (Muslims), backward  classes, and the Dalits. Here, the police officials must avoid  misunderstanding him. What we mean is that in their zeal, they  should not think that the chief minister has told them not to  care for whoever is left after Muslims, backward classes, and  the Harijans are taken care of, and that if they come with a  complaint, they should be totally ignored. Nor does this mean  that the police should be so lenient toward the minorities that  if they are committing atrocities against the majority group,  then the police should not listen to the grievances of the  suffering group in the name of Mulayam Singh. The poor,  backward, and the Dalits are the ones being given political  color in a hurry. The reason is that there are a large number of  people in India who are either poor, backward, or Dalits, or  members of a minority group. In this situation, the officials  should be fully alert to the fact that governments change  periodically; however, the constitution they must follow remains  the same. It is the duty of the police and the administrators to  implement law and carry on government work within a  constitutional framework. Senior police officials are only  required to be loyal to the law and the Constitution. That is  their duty. Be it a chief minister or a prime minister, they are  all under the constitution. When a political party that has the  support of the minorities and the Harijans comes to power in a  state, it is clear that its chief minister will talk about  helping them just to strengthen his popular support. However,  the police officials should not forget that their real boss is  the Constitution, and that they are small cogs in this big  machinery, just like the chief minister and other Cabinet  members. These officials run the government, which the people  elect. An elected government belongs neither to the poor, nor to  the rich, nor to the high-caste people; to the Harijans, the  Hindus, or the Muslims. An elected government belongs to  everyone.    Whenever a chief minister gives a directive to the state's  senior police officials, and administrators, then one must be  very careful about his words. How can Mulayam Singh Yadav say  his government belongs to the poor? He cannot say this, because  who knows how many rich people have voted for his party. How can  the chief minister order the high officials to give special  attention to the minorities? Did not the Hindus help his party  win the government? If he thinks so, then he should say that  this is the government of the Muslims. What we mean to say here  is that when a party establishes government, it has its own same  place. However, the ministers and their leader, the chief  minister, get out of the narrow circle of their party. There  would be tens of millions of UP voters who are BJP Bharatiya  Janata Party] supporters. Does it mean Mulayam Singh Yadav will  hang them all or tell the UP police to make their lives  unbearable? Under the Constitution, every citizen of the state  has the same privileges and rights. It is the government's duty  to make sure that they get these rights and privileges equally,  and without any bias. In other words, Chief Minister Mulayam  Singh should remember when addressing the senior police  officials that the UP government is the government of the  people. Please remember that, and make sure that no person, be  he powerful or weak, is suffering, and that no one has to face  any extreme treatment. That is what the whole message is about.  The government belongs to the people, especially in a democratic  system. We cannot say that a specific government belongs to the  poor, the Dalits, the backward, the Harijans, the minorities,  the rich, the high caste, or the Hindus.    The politicians of our country cashed in the Harijan votes  first. Later, they cashed in the minorities and various  religious groups. Kalyan Singh did not take anyone's side. We  have seen only one scenario under the slogans of "eradicating  poverty" and "the government of the poor." The BJP said that  this is the government of the Hindus, and now it is out of the  government now. There was a time when the Congress (I) used to  lick the feet of the Harijans and the Muslims, and it is out of  the state's government now. Now Mulayam Singh is the chief  minister, and he is saying it is the poor people's government.  It is OK to this extent; however, telling the officials to gird  up their loins to make sure the minority and backward groups get  full justice is undemocratic, biased, and suicidal for the  government itself. A government should never distinguish between  the rich and poor, high and low, Hindus and Muslims, high-caste  and Harijans, and so forth. If the police and the administrative  officials begin to do their duty according to caste and  religion, it would hurt the democratic system. We believe that  it is the duty of the administrators to cooperate with the  government; however, a veteran politician like Chief Minister  Mulayam Singh should not talk like this. He is fortunate in that  the people of this state have recognized him as an effective and  skilled administrator. He should remember that he has become  chief minister because the Congress has supported him, the  Janata Dal is also with him, and so are some other parties. A  war can be fought based on the caste system; however, one cannot  celebrate victory over this system. Mulayam Singh is chief  minister of all groups. If a brahmin is poor, a landlord is  poor, or a Hindu is poor, then will this "government of the  poor" ignore them?</p>

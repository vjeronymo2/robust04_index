			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OHA's proposed rules were published on the same day as OSM proposed related rules defining the AVS, requiring its use in reviewing permit applications to determine whether there are any ownership or control links between applicants and persons in violation, and proposing procedures and standards for an applicant or other person shown in the AVS to challenge ownership and control links shown in the AVS and the status of the violation. 56 FR 45780&hyph;45804 (Sept. 6, 1991). OSM also proposed to amend its existing rules governing suspension and rescission of improvidently issued permits. OSM's proposed rules provided a right to review of its decisions to suspend or rescind a permit under the procedures set forth in OHA's proposed rulemaking of sections 4.1370 through 4.1377. See proposed &sect;773.20(c)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). OSM's proposed rules also provided a right to review of its written decisions on challenges to ownership and control links and the status of violations shown in the AVS under the procedures set forth in OHA's proposed rulemaking of sections 4.1380 through 4.1387. See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(d)(2)(ii), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OHA received comments on its proposed rules from Texas Utilities Services, Inc. (TU Services), the Joint National Coal Association/American Mining Congress Committee on Surface Mining Regulations (NCA/AMC), and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF). The NCA/AMC comments dealt with both OHA's and OSM's proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) Withdrawn <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of its September 6, 1991, proposed rulemaking, OHA proposed an amendment to 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) at 56 FR 45808 which set forth an element of OSM's prima facie case in proceedings to review the assessment of individual civil penalties. Proposed 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) complemented proposed rules by OSM at 56 FR 48924, 48929&hyph;30 (Sept. 26, 1991) addressing individual civil penalties. Both TU Services' and NCA/AMC's comments expressed reservations about the proposed amendment of 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3). By a notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on October 16, 1992, OSM withdrew its September 26, 1991, proposed rulemaking. 57 FR 47431 (Oct. 16, 1992). Therefore, OHA hereby withdraws the corresponding proposed amendment to 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3). Because this proposed rule concerning an element of OSM's prima facie case in individual civil penalty proceedings is withdrawn, no response to the comments concerning it is necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the NCA/AMC comments address both the proposed OSM rules and the proposed OHA rules ``[b]ecause [their] comments on the proposal by [OHA] are interrelated with [their] concerns about the OSM proposal.'' NCA/AMC's comments that relate to the procedures for administrative review are addressed here. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedural Due Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NCA/AMC state that although the proposed rules ``purport to establish a comprehensive scheme for administrative review of ownership and control determinations emanating from the AVS, they fall far short of providing the meaningful guarantees that the due process clause requires.'' They fall short, NCA/AMC state, because the procedures do not allow one to challenge the existence of the violation that forms the basis for a permit block under section 510(c). Further, the proposed rules do not provide ``any opportunity for challenging either the status of the violation or the validity of the AVS link  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> prior  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to the deprivation of the operator's property interest through permit denial, suspension, or revocation, unless the applicant is able to meet the stringent requirements for seeking temporary relief'' contained in proposed 43 CFR 4.1386 (emphasis in original). NCA/AMC state that the ``right to notice and a hearing prior to a governmental deprivation of private property is a cornerstone of American jurisprudence, and is a well-established principle in cases involving the constitutionality of SMCRA provisions'' that the proposed rules fail to recognize. NCA/AMC state that an appeal or challenge to AVS information ``must, of necessity, include the right to a full and fair determination on the merits of the violation in advance of any decision to prohibit mining through the sanctions contained within section 510(c).'' Under the balancing test announced in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mathews  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eldridge <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 424 U.S. 319 (1976), the proposed rules do not afford due process, NCA/AMC argue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A fundamental requirement of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States that ``[n]o person shall *&blank;*&blank;* be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law'' is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Armstrong  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Manzo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965). In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mathews  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eldridge <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the U.S. Supreme Court discussed ``the extent to which due process requires an evidentiary hearing prior to the deprivation of some type of property interest even if such a hearing is provided thereafter.'' 424 U.S. at 333. The Court quoted  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Morrissey  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brewer <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972), that ``due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands,'' and then stated: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> [O]ur prior decisions indicate that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> Goldberg  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> Kelly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> .

A complete record and a comprehensive opinion are not necessary; an opportunity for the welfare recipient to confront and cross-examine witnesses relied on by the government, and to retain an attorney, however, are necessary.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> . at 267&hyph;270.

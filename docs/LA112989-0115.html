			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW DROPS 13.23; TRADERS GROW WARY OVER INTEREST  </P> <P> The stock market fell in generally lackluster trading today amid continued  uncertainty about interest rates.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.23 points to 2,688.78.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 897 issues up, 577 down and 479 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 147.27 million shares, against 153.77 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index lost 1.08 to 190.26.  </P> <P> At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 1.46 to 373.64.  </P> <P> Analysts said computerized trading strategies helped push stock prices lower in  the final hour of trading.  </P> <P> Stocks came under pressure from the opening as investors took profits after the  market's recent gains. The Dow had gained nearly 70 points in the last five  trading sessions.  </P> <P> Analysts said the stock and bond markets largely ignored reports on  third-quarter gross national product and corporate profits.  </P> <P> Larry Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said investors  were focusing on the current quarter.  </P> <P> "As far as the market is concerned, that is dated material," Wachtel said. "We  now know the economy is floundering and corporate profits are floundering."  </P> <P> Bank stocks came under pressure today after Southwest Bank of St. Louis  announced that it was raising its prime rate back to 10.5% from 10% after  cutting it three weeks ago.  </P> <P> Some analysts said, however, that the market's sluggishness is merely a pause  after the recent run-up in stock prices and before the start of a pre-Christmas  rally.  </P> <P> "It's two days overdue," said Ralph Bloch, chief market analyst with Raymond,  James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.  </P> <P> Bond prices posted minor losses early today amid disappointment about the  chances for an imminent cut in interest rates; analysts believe that the GNP  report will not cause the Federal Reserve Board to alter its cautious approach  to credit policy.  </P> <P> The central bank is expected to wait for clear signs of substantial economic  weakness before loosening its hold on credit, which would lead to lower  interest rates.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond dropped 5/32 point, or less than $1.50  for every $1,000 face amount. It yield, which rises when the price falls,  increased to 7.92% from 7.90% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Market analyst Jack Barbanel of First Global Asset Management Inc. said the  Commerce Department's revised estimate of economic growth in the third quarter  was close to expectations.  </P> <P> "I think they're going to take an extremely cautious approach to lowering  interest rates," Barbanel said.  </P> <P> He said he does not attach much significance to an increase in the federal  funds rate today, attributing its movement to technical factors. The rate was  quoted at 9 1/8% this morning, up from 9% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Analysts watch the fed funds rate for clues about the central bank's policy  intentions. Last week the markets apparently misinterpreted a drop in the rate  to mean that the Fed was moving aggressively to encourage interest rate  declines.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each other for  short-term loans, and the Fed can drive the borrowing charge higher or lower by  arranging short-term securities sales or purchases that affect the amount of  money available in the banking system.  </P> <P> Today is the last day of a two-week reserve maintenance period and banks were  trying to acquire funds to meet reserve requirements. This could account for  the rise in the closely watched rate.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term  governments were unchanged to 1/32 point lower, intermediate maturities fell  1/32 point to 3/32 point and long-term issues were down by 1/8 point to 5/32  point, according to the Telerate Inc., financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer,  declined 0.58 to 1,193.22.  </P></p>

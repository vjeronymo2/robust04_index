			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Vauxhall fights franchise moves PRICES of new cars in the UK are now lower than in several other European countries, a report published yesterday by Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, says. Vauxhall has issued the study, prepared by management consultants AT Kearney, in an effort to avoid action by the government to force carmakers to change some of the controversial terms of their franchise agreements with dealers. The motor industry's selective distribution system, which allows carmakers to sell vehicles through exclusive networks, has been blamed by consumer groups for making UK car prices higher than in many other parts of Europe. The investigation of car makers' pricing policies across Europe is set to intensify in the next two years, as the present 10-year 'block exemption', which allows car makers to use a selective dealer distribution system in contravention of European Community competition rules, is due to expire in mid-1995. It is understood that carmakers in the UK have rebuffed a request made last year by the Office of Fair Trading to change some of the more restrictive terms of their dealer franchise agreements. The changes were recommended in a report published early last year by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after an investigation into UK car prices. It is understood that the OFT has recommended that the DTI will have to take action to force implementation of the MMC report's findings. The MMC report recommended the removal of any restrictions on franchised dealers which: Limit the dealers' freedom to advertise outside their territory. Limit dealers' freedom to hold or acquire dealerships from other car makers outside their territory. Prevent dealers holding or acquiring competing dealerships in their territory (although the supplier may require that any other dealership acquired be on a distinct and separate site and a reasonable distance away). Restrict the extent to which dealers can sell car-related goods or services, such as hire, second-hand car sales, fast-fit or multi-brand servicing outside their territory. Limit the number of the manufacturer's cars that any dealer or dealer group may sell in any given period, or the proportion of the total sales of its cars that may be made by any dealer or dealer group. Vauxhall, which ranks second in the UK new-car market, yesterday urged other carmakers to prepare a new action plan to establish 'common ground' with the OFT, which could allow changes in franchise agreements that would be 'compatible' with present EC regulations.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Battle to control blazing supertanker TUG boats and fire-fighting vessels were last night battling to prevent an environmental disaster and control a fire on board the Maersk Navigator, a fully-laden supertanker drifting 100 miles off the northern tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The supertanker, carrying nearly 2m barrels of crude oil, collided with a smaller unladen tanker at the northern entrance to the Malacca Strait early on Thursday. The 24-man crew, including the British captain, abandoned ship and were rescued by a passing vessel. The Maersk Navigator's Danish owners say the supertanker is leaking oil and a slick two miles long and 200 yards wide was reported yesterday. The owners say the oil is seeping from one of 12 cargo holds. The ship is reported to be drifting slowly away from land and the owners say it is likely that any oil spilled so far will evaporate. A salvage crew has managed to board the vessel and tug boats have attached lines. But there is still no independent assessment of the scale of the problem. The coastal authorities in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have been put on alert to tackle an oil spillage. A Singapore salvage expert said the salvage teams will try to contain the fire on board the Maersk Navigator and assess how serious is the leak from its cargo tanks. 'It could take several days to cool the vessel down and transfer such a large amount of oil onto another supertanker,' he said.</p>

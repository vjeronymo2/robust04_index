			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Further gains in South Africa Equities in Johannesburg continued to make ground as the recent positive mood continued. Analysts suggested that local buying in the gold market and light foreign interest were the main factors for yesterday's rises, and they expected further gains if gold bullion prices and the world's equity markets remained firm. The overall index added 65 at 5,823, industrials advanced 80 to 6,656 and the golds index rose 54 to 2,157. Among the day's active stocks, Joel, the gold miner, gained 20 cents at R7.25 following recent positive quarterly results. Sasol, the chemicals group, extended its recent gains, adding R1.25 at R33.25, a new high for the year. Analysts forecast that the stock could reach R35 in the short term. De Beers moved ahead R1.50 to R119.25, Anglos R2 to R254 and Richemont R1.50 to R39.</p>

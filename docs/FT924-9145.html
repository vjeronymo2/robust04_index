			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Letter: Heritage in need of support Sir, Your conclusions regarding English Heritage's planned disposals ('Selling the Silver', October 31 and 'English Heritage cuts anger MPs', October 27) are quite right. I am one of the 300,000 members of English Heritage who will most certainly cancel my subscription if these plans go ahead. I subscribe to English Heritage not to support those famous tourist attractions such as Stonehenge, but to support the maintenance of the smaller and lesser-known sites, such as the Roman Village and Harry's Walls in the Isles of Scilly. Sites such as these are often in remote rural areas, whose councils would be unable to afford the cost of their maintenance. They are sites, integral to the heritage of our islands, to which, by the very nature of their location, one could not charge admission. It is these smaller sites that we expect the government to fund, and not the large tourist money spinners that could be turned into profitable concerns. I suggest English Heritage has its priorities wrong. Prior consultation with interested parties might have saved some of the furore that is now gathering pace.

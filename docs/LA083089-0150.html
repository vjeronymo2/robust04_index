			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SOVIET TEAMS EXPECTED IN SLED RACE  </P> <P> Two teams from the Soviet Union are expected to enter the 1990 Iditarod Trail  Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Nome, race officials say.  </P> <P> "We have issued an invitation; they have responded, accepting our invitation,"  said Rosemary Phillips, the race's executive director. "That is a definite."  </P> <P> One of the Soviet mushers will be training with three-time Iditarod champion  Susan Butcher near Manley, north of Fairbanks, Phillips said. "That was a  specific request from the Soviets: that one of the two stay at Susan's camp in  Manley," Phillips said.  </P> <P> Phillips is expected to leave for Provideniya in the Soviet Union next month.  She is to be joined by Butcher and Wasilla veterinarian Phil Meyer. They are to  inspect the Soviet dog teams to see how suited they are for running the  punishing 1,100-mile race.  </P></p>

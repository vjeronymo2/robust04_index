			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / GEC agrees to buy Ferranti defence units from receivers GEC has reached final agreement to buy Ferranti's main UK defence businesses from the receivers, Arthur Andersen. An announcement on the sale is expected today. The price, which has not been disclosed, was apparently agreed in advance and is thought to be around Pounds 50m. The package of businesses to be sold to GEC remains essentially unaltered from the start of negotiations in March. It includes the military systems integration business, based in Bracknell, Berkshire, which employs 570 people, and the simulation and training operations with headquarters at Cwmbran, Wales, with 540 employees. There have been redundancies in both operations since Ferranti went into receivership last December after GEC withdrew its 1p a share offer for the whole company. However, most of the 630 redundancies were at Ferranti's Manchester and Oldham sites. Negotiations had been expected to be completed in April, but had to be extended to allow further time for due diligence work. A management buy-out team had been ready to bid for the business had GEC withdrawn. Several other potential bidders were also thought to be interested, including British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF of France. GEC is also in separate negotiations to buy Ferranti's 50 per cent share in its sonar joint venture with Thomson. That business is not in receivership and Thomson is expected to exercise its pre-emption rights to buy the Ferranti shareholding. It will then be passed on to GEC in a simultaneous transaction. The Ministry of Defence was thought to be unhappy about a crucial technology for Britain's nuclear submarines passing completely into foreign hands. GEC was thus considered by analysts to be the preferred buyer. Ferranti's components manufacturing plant at Cairo Mill in Oldham remains with the receivers. It produces complex printed circuit boards, avionics equipment for military aircraft, and designs military equipment from helicopter sites to sophisticated anti-tank and anti-helicopter mines. The receivers have decided not to sell this business at present, as it is undergoing changes to improve profitability.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Virtual reality arrives home Virtual reality in the home has come a step closer with the launch of the VFX1 headset by Forte Technologies, writes Richard Rosen from the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The unit incorporates a pair of colour LCD displays, one for each eye, each measuring 0.7 inches. This gives an effective viewing area equivalent to watching a 35-foot screen from 35 feet. Each screen has an individual lens, which can be focused - a useful feature for people who have taken their glasses off. When in use, it measures the amount of head movement from the wearer in all three planes and calculates where you are looking. The headset, which weighs less than 2lbs including stereo speakers, uses its own 8-bit PC ISA card for output and works independently of the standard PC display. It will be launched worldwide in October at a price of about Dollars 900. Contact Forte Technologies: US, 716-427-8595.</p>

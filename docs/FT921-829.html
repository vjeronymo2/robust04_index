			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Technology: Exchanging recipes - How two food industry suppliers have blended their skills As the dust settles on one of last year's biggest takeover controversies, managers and technologists at two very different suppliers to the food industry are gingerly beginning to make an omelette without breaking eggs. More than a year after Tetra Pak, the packaging equipment and materials group best known for its Tetra Brik brick-shaped carton, announced the SKr16.25bn (Pounds 1.6bn) takeover of Alfa-Laval, the manufacturer of food, agricultural and industrial process equipment, the two Swedish companies are investigating how to make the merger work. 'It is taking off, and it's going to be very interesting for both companies,' says Jorgen Haglind, Tetra Pak's communications director. It is also an unprecedented, and at first glance rather curious situation. Instead of combining fully, the two companies are remaining separate. Their relationship is assuming a T-shape, with vertically integrated Tetra Pak providing the downstroke, and horizontally-integrated Alfa-Laval the cross-stroke. In technology terms, the link stands where the two strokes meet, with liquid food - its processing, packaging and distribution - providing the connection. Synergies in that product area are now being examined - Alfa-Laval, for example, has developed a new process for heat treatment of liquid egg that could link with Tetra Pak's continued efforts to find new applications for its cartons. But the two companies are also looking at possible long-term benefits from closer links between Alfa-Laval's non-food activities, such as its process control subsidiary SattControl, and Tetra Pak. Either way, what is emerging is a technology-led business combination in which knowledge and skills, rather than corporate entities, are being merged. Synergies are being discovered at divisional and product development level rather than imposed from above. Contacts, inevitably, have been established at board level, and Alfa-Laval's financial department has been closed down, but the two companies have avoided the trouble that could easily have plagued a full integration of a marketing and a manufacturing culture. The structure, Haglind suggests, might be applicable in other situations where companies have products that stand in-line in a client's manufacturing process - Alfa-Laval's process equipment produces liquid food that is then packaged in Tetra Pak's machines and cartons. That may prove to be true, but meanwhile there is little doubt that the unusual structure helped the two companies sidestep an assault from Brussels that focused on such links. Soon after the takeover was announced in January last year, the European Commission launched one of the first in-depth inquiries under its recently introduced rules for large takeovers. The EC's concern was that competitors either in the food processing or packaging equipment sector would be disadvantaged if the merged company offered a package deal including, for example, Alfa-Laval equipment at below the commercial price. Similarly, competitors could have lost out if Tetra Pak and Alfa designed equipment that could only be linked to each other's products. However, by May last year, the Commission had apparently decided that it had no authority to make a ruling on the merger because it was neither a horizontal nor a vertical combination. The two companies had, in any case, promised not to act anti-competitively. Even so, Tetra Pak and Alfa-Laval have to develop technology and process synergies while mindful of the fact that 'we are being watched from Brussels,' as Bo Wirsen, head of Alfa-Laval's food business, puts it. Both companies are convinced that they can achieve this in the long-term, even if the initial steps are tentative. This month Alfa-Laval begins a series of informal discussions with its senior managers and sales managers to acquaint them fully with how to interpret the EC's concerns. 'I don't think it's going to pose a problem, but equally it's very important that we all understand the implications,' says Wirsen. At the same time, two parallel series of discussions have begun between the two companies. The first links Tetra Pak with different parts of Alfa-Laval's food business via separate project groups in liquid foods, convenience foods, ice cream and other areas. The intention says Wirsen, is that in the medium-term the discussions could produce 'new technological solutions that give customers a distinct competitive advantage'. The second initiative involves project groups aiming to find synergies between Tetra Pak and Alfa-Laval's non-food activities such as control equipment and heat exchangers, many of which number food equipment among their applications. Wirsen suggests that Alfa-Laval's strengths outside its food division may have come as a surprise to Tetra Pak following the takeover. The aim of these links is to build on connections between the two companies that have ebbed and flowed over the past 30 years. Both companies have built global organisations from one idea - Gustaf de Laval's continuously working separator invented in 1877 and Ruben Rausing's device to form, fill and seal packages under the liquid level from a roll of packaging material. Both companies are also strong in the dairy sector and in aseptic packaging, and their paths have inevitably crossed on big projects. For the future, though, the priority for the two companies is to exploit opportunities arising from sharing knowledge and offer 'integrated solutions' for a food industry that increasingly wants large processing plants built for them on a turnkey basis. Achieving that would seem difficult in two separate companies with their own marketing departments. But Wirsen maintains it should be easier, now that the companies have merged, to develop new liquid food technologies or new approaches to total automation of food processing. 'At the end of the day the engineers and technical people on Alfa-Laval's food side and Tetra Pak can really make a difference . . . we have a chance to create something that was not achievable before.' And, if they are careful, to keep Brussels happy.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Comprehensive assessment of current communications and telecommunications environment throughout all components of the public health structure within the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Creation of a Network Design and Technology and Implementation Plan that emphasizes a WAN using modern, personal computer-based client server architecture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Creation of a Hardware and Software Implementation Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> ii. Implementation Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Strategy for the integration of the State communications network and the immunization information system, allowing access to all providers of immunization and other public health services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Implement local area network connectivity (including cabling, hardware and software installation, and user training) between local and State health departments and CDC, including an Internet interface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;User applications, including support and training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> iii. Evaluation Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Demonstrate that there has been an adequate inclusion of all agencies and organizations that will be critical to successful implementation of elements B and C below (i.e., Information Access and Data Exchange).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Thorough specification of existing public health related systems infrastructure and current plans for and funding sources for expanding this infrastructure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Information Access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> i. Planning Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Grantee should specify the types of immunization information needed to assist public health personnel to more effectively improve and protect the health of the public. For example, directories of training resources, guidelines for disease prevention, operational guidelines for prevention programs, State information databases, etc., to which online access would be desirable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Grantee should specify the process through which these information resources will be determined and developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> ii. Implementation Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Grantee must present an implementation strategy and timeline for placing these information resources into electronic access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> iii. Evaluation Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Grantee should present an evaluation plan that provides a basis for determining the impact that access to the immunization information databases (item B.i.) above has on changing the practice of public health and potentially the outcomes as measured by health status indicators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Data Exchange  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Future public health information systems should provide for efficient capture, transmission and exchange of the universe of data relevant to the practice of public health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> i. Planning Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Grantee must describe the State's approach to state-wide public health data system integration, the goal of which is to provide efficient capture, transmission and exchange of public health data (e.g., patient specific data, immunization events, vital records, disease surveillance and reporting data, population based assessments, etc.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The plan should specify how the State is proceeding or will proceed to develop an integrated data system to meet the future needs of public health. Where appropriate, the plan should discuss plans for electronic interaction with non-government health care organizations, such as managed care organizations, private practitioners, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> ii. Implementation Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The grantee should present a data system implementation plan and system design with timeliness and development schedules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> iii. Evaluation Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The grantee's evaluation plan should correspond to the goals (as identified in the PURPOSE section of this announcement) of the integrated State system and include an inventory of existing health-related information systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Hardware and software requirements and estimated costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Personnel requirements and estimated costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

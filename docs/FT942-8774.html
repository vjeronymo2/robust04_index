			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Israeli spending irregularities alleged Israel's state comptroller yesterday detailed serious allegations of irregularities in government expenditure and appointments, and advised that legal action be considered against some government officials. In her annual report, Ms Miriam Ben-Porat singled out the Housing Ministry for criticism of inefficiency, political allocation of resources, political appointments and the continuation of building projects in the occupied territories despite a government decision in November 1992 to freeze construction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The report for the year 1993 also criticised the way money was transferred to religious institutions by the Religious Affairs Ministry; the excessive protection of agricultural products by the Ministry of Trade and Industry; waste and inefficiency in Israel's Moscow embassy; the government's attempted sale last year of Bank Mizrahi; and the lack of competition in water supply. 'In view of the suspicions of criminal offences in my report, I will pass my findings on to the attorney general,' Ms Ben-Porat said. On agriculture, she said excessive government protection by import quotas and taxes prevents competition, entrenches monopolies, stimulates inefficiency and increases prices. In the section on housing, the state comptroller said 'grave findings' included the ministry's failure to prevent the continuation of five construction projects in the occupied territories; serious under-performance in meeting a target to build 23,000 apartments; and allocation of resources in favour of Labour councils and discrimination against local government headed by the right-wing Likud opposition. The Housing Ministry is also under attack in Israel for failing to take measures to reduce housing prices - the main component of rising inflation which is undermining the government's economic policies. Mr Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, minister of housing, said yesterday the report was distorted. 'I won't resign,' he said. 'I am proud of my achievements. The government is not corrupt.' Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the Likud party, said the government should resign 'in view of its failure to keep up its promises to the voters to abolish corruption'.</p>

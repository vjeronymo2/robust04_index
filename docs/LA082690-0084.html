			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BRAZIL;  </P> <P> DEEP RECESSION TIED TO FIGHT ON INFLATION  </P> <P> President Fernando Collor de Mello's draconian anti-inflation plan, implemented  last March, has set off Brazil's worst recession in 10 years, according to data  from the IBGE, the government statistics institute. Since Collor froze a third  of the nation's wealth, ended indexation of wages to prices and slashed  government spending, Brazil's gross domestic product fell 8.8%, compared to the  same period a year ago, the IBGE said in data released in Rio de Janeiro. The  freeze on liquidity, the data showed, meant a sharp fall in orders which sent  production crashing 16.87% between April and June, compared with the same  period last year.  </P></p>

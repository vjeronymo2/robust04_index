			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Italian Dollars 500m FRN fails to spur activity The Eurobond market came back to life with a handful of dollar issues and two Dutch guilder deals. However, with continuing volatility in the underlying bond markets, investor activity remained thin, traders said. The day's largest deal was a Dollars 500m issue of five-year floating rate notes for a unit of Italy's IMI Bank via joint leads Lehman Brothers and Swiss Bank Corporation. The bonds, which pay a coupon of three-month Libor plus 25 basis points, were priced to give a discounted margin of 30 basis points over Libor at the re-offer price. While many dealers deemed the pricing to be fair, they felt the deal's size could make it slow to place. However, according to one of the lead managers, its size will help make the issue a new benchmark for the Italian banking sector. Swedish Export Credit also tapped demand for short-dated debt, issuing Dollars 250m of two-year notes via SBC. While some traders felt the issue was tightly priced - yielding 15 basis points over the US two-year note at re-offer - they said this was compensated by the 6 per cent coupon, which was especially likely to attract Swiss and Benelux investors. CS First Boston launched Dollars 175m in a self-led issue of seven-year floored floating-rate notes. They pay a coupon of six-month Libor less 25 basis points, with a floor at 5 7/8 per cent. According to an official at the lead manager, the paper saw strong demand from Swiss retail investors. General Electric added to the recent flow of medium-dated, retail-targeted deals in the Canadian dollar sector with its CDollars 100m of 8 1/8 per cent five-year bonds via Wood Gundy. Yielding 22 basis points over the corresponding government bond at re-offer, the deal was considered fairly priced and was expected to be placed among continental European retail investors. In the Dutch guilder sector, the Republic of Finland's Fl 400m of 6 1/2 per cent seven-year bonds received a mixed reception, with some dealers complaining about the deal's aggressive pricing. The bonds were priced to yield 25 basis points over the interpolated Dutch government bond yield curve, and some said they felt an extra 5 to 10 basis points would have been more appropriate. However, while conceding that the spread was 'not generous' and that the deal could take time to place, lead manager ING Bank said there was good investor demand for eight-year paper, and was confident the paper would be placed. Aegon, the Dutch insurance company, issued Fl 150m of three-year bonds via ABN Amro Bank.</p>

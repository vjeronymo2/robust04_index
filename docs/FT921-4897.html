			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Defence workers face contract call-up clause DEFENCE industry employees may have call-up clauses written into their contracts if proposals from the Ministry of Defence are implemented. The plan would also affect civilians working for the MoD. The aim of the scheme, part of a set of proposals in a consultative document on the future of Britain's reserve forces, is to enable the government to call automatically on certain categories of reservists to take up non-combat duties in support of the armed forces in the event of war. More than 40 UK defence companies sent employees to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries to support equipment used by UK forces in the campaign against Iraq a year ago. Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, said yesterday: 'This will be a tidier way of people going out in support of our country.' Proposals also include an 'ever-ready' force of specialist reservists who would voluntarily accept a liability for early call-up in time of crisis. Mr King said this would involve several thousand people, such as medical staff and linguists. Changes are also planned in the law covering the call-up of reservists and protection of their civilian jobs while they are serving.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> DOLPHIN DEFENSE HAS IMPROVED  </P> <P> Defensive end Jeff Cross, leader of the Miami Pound Machine with 10 sacks, said  the Dolphin defense has improved since last season because of consistency.  </P> <P> "We're just playing a straight-up defense," Cross said.  </P> <P> "We're just lining up and getting after people."  </P> <P> So how will the Raiders attack the Dolphin defense Monday night in Miami?  </P> <P> "They're a very good football team, and they're playing extremely well," Raider  quarterback Jay Schroeder said of the Dolphins. "But I have confidence that the  guys up front are going to be able to block them."  </P> <P> Injuries: Raider safety Eddie Anderson (knee injury), receiver Jamie Holland  (foot) and defensive tackle Bill Pickel (back) are listed as probable. Dolphin  safety Bobby Harden (hamstring) is doubtful; fullbacks Marc Logan (knee) and  Tony Paige (knee), and defensive end Karl Wilson (ankle) are questionable;  linebacker John Offerdahl (toe) is probable.

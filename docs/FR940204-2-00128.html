The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD is proposing to amend section 4 of its OTCBB rules to require market makers participating in the OTCBB to append a fifth-character, geographic indicator to their MMIDs when the firm's trading desk for a security quoted on the OTCBB is located away from the firm's primary trading office. The NASD believes that the use of fifth-character, geographic indicators is necessary to avoid confusion and delay by market participants in contacting market makers in securities quoted on the OTCBB. Specifically, the NASD believes that the use of geographic indicators will ensure that traders will direct their calls to the appropriate location where the market maker for the stock is located and avoid instances where multiple phone calls are needed to access a market maker's quote. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the NASD believes mandatory use of the fifth-character, geographic indicator is necessary in light of developments associated with the NASD's Nasdaq Workstation II <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> SM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  service. Specifically, with Nasdaq Workstation II, market makers' telephone numbers will not be displayed on the OTCBB screen, but may be recalled separately. Accordingly, once Nasdaq Workstation II is in operation, unless fifth-character, geographic indicators are used, there may be confusion among market participants concerning the trading location of securities quoted on the OTCBB. The NASD also notes that the use of fifth-character, geographic indicators already has been mandated for market makers in securities traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=3 --> &reg; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31933 (February 26, 1993), 58 FR 12608 (March 5, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;92&hyph;55). <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

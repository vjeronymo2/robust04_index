			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN OUTLINED FOR POMONA'S REVITALIZATION;  </P> <P> CITY PLANNING: CONSULTANTS FIND CRIME AND EDUCATION PROBLEMS. BUT THEIR REPORT  SAYS POMONA COULD BECOME 'THE CULTURAL CENTER OF THE EAST SAN GABRIEL VALLEY.'  </P> <P> The city should turn its fading downtown into a lively, Latin-flavored cultural  and shopping hub, establish magnet schools and pare down its management-heavy  city work force, a consultants' report recommended last week.  </P> <P> "Pomona is the only real city in this area," said Trevor A. Campbell, who  coordinated the city-commissioned strategic planning study by the Center for  Leadership Resources in Granada Hills. "Most of the adjoining cities tend to be  largely bedroom communities. Pomona goes beyond a bedroom community . . .  Pomona can be the cultural center of the east San Gabriel Valley."  </P> <P> Campbell conducted the seven-month, $60,000 study along with Eduardo M. Ochoa,  associate professor of economics at Cal State Los Angeles, and Lukman Clarke, a  management expert.  </P> <P> The team surveyed public opinion, interviewed community leaders and examined  the city's social and economic conditions to devise a five-year strategy for  economic growth.  </P> <P> Some of the researchers' findings were expected. They noted, for example, that  Pomona, with a population of about 120,000, lags behind neighboring cities in  education and income levels and leads in violent crime.  </P> <P> But there were some surprises too.  </P> <P> In a telephone survey of 434 households in Pomona, the consultants found that  most residents said they feel safe in their neighborhoods. Only 9% said crime  was out of control. Nearly three-fourths said crime was either a small problem  or no problem at all.  </P> <P> However, Ochoa said the response may reflect the way the question was phrased.  If residents had been asked whether crime was a serious problem in Pomona, he  said, most would probably have said yes, but not in their own neighborhoods.  The city had 44 murders last year, the highest total ever reported in the San  Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> The survey also found that most residents pay little attention to city  government. Half of those surveyed said they never follow the activities of the  often-contentious City Council, and 80% said they have had no occasion to deal  with City Hall in the past year.  </P> <P> The City Council commissioned the study to develop a strategy for promoting  economic development and making government more effective.  </P> <P> Some of the recommendations -- such as magnet high schools, job training for  residents and programs to help small businesses -- would entail substantial  costs. The report does not attempt to calculate costs or explore in depth how  the money might be raised.  </P> <P> Councilman Tomas Ursua, who proposed the study, said many approaches could be  taken. Substantial state and federal grants exist for job training and cultural  programs, he said. But some of the money could come from a shift in priorities.  </P> <P> He said the City Council has thought nothing in the past of giving hundreds of  thousands of dollars in redevelopment funds to subsidize the purchase of  property for developers. He said this report suggests that the city might gain  more by putting that money into job-training and other purposes instead of  giving it to developers.  </P> <P> "What we have here is the beginning of a new way of thinking," Ursua said, "and  it's going to take time for it to become a reality."  </P> <P> Specifically, the consultants suggested that Pomona look to Santa Ana as a  model of self-improvement. Both cities have high Latino populations and  residents with similar education levels. And both have large numbers of old  commercial buildings, the consultants said. But Santa Ana has revitalized its  economy, whereas Pomona has fallen behind.  </P> <P> Ochoa said Santa Ana has adopted a Mexican theme for its downtown area "with  small quaint shops, restaurants and so forth, and they have managed to tap into  a market that is right there. I think that strategy could work here."  </P> <P> Downtown Pomona was the region's retail center years ago, but it now houses a  single department store, Buffums, and an odd mixture of other establishments,  including antique shops, an osteopathic college, storefront churches, furniture  stores and thrift outlets, along with a significant number of empty buildings.  </P> <P> The consultants said the city also should promote the arts in its downtown  area. They suggested sponsorship of outdoor music festivals and art shows,  establishment of a playhouse theater in cooperation with local schools and  colleges, and the development of a multiplex movie theater that would show  art-house films.  </P> <P> The report also recommended that the city promote construction of condominiums  instead of apartments near the downtown area, and encourage the use of downtown  buildings as artists' lofts.  </P> <P> Bob Dahms, president of the Central Business District in Pomona, said downtown  already has a little-noticed but growing artists' colony. He said he has not  read the consultants' entire report but agrees with portions he has seen.  </P> <P> On the education front, the consultants recommended that the city work with the  school district in establishing an arts magnet program at Garey High School  because it is near downtown.  </P> <P> The report also proposed a health sciences magnet at Pomona High School to tie  in with the growth of Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center and other medical  facilities. Finally, it suggested establishment of a business magnet at Ganesha  High School.  </P> <P> Such magnet schools offer intensive training in specialized areas.  </P> <P> Irv Moskowitz, superintendent of the Pomona Unified School District, said he  has not seen the report, but he said district staff members have recently begun  assembling information for a new long-range plan for the district. Moskowitz  said magnet schools are one of many options.  </P> <P> In their analysis of city government, the consultants concluded that the city  is overstaffed with managers and has been hampered by weak executive  leadership.  </P> <P> The consultants found that one-fourth of Pomona's municipal work force is  classified as management, compared to 10% in most cities. The report says that  some workers were probably promoted to management classifications because there  was no other way of rewarding employee performance.  </P> <P> The consultants suggested that the city reorganize its classifications so  workers can advance monetarily without being promoted to a management-level  salary. The city could save $500,000 to $600,000 by reducing the number of  managerial positions, the report said.  </P> <P> City Administrator Julio Fuentes said he has not examined the staffing claim.  "I'm always open-minded and will look at that," he said, "but I don't have  anything to say about it at this point."  </P> <P> The consultants said the city has many strong individual managers and  employees, but "they are frustrated by a system that undercuts innovativeness  and teamwork."  </P> <P> Finally, the consultants' report also suggests raising residents' job skill  levels. They noted that while Pomona has more jobs than neighboring cities,  many of these jobs are held by people who live outside the city. Pomona  residents have trouble competing for jobs in their own city because of low  education and skill levels, the report said.  </P> <P> The consultants recommended that the city, schools and colleges cooperate on  programs to upgrade job skills, and that the city adopt a policy of requiring  any business with city contracts to first interview Pomona residents when  hiring.  </P> <P> LIFE IN POMONA  </P> <P> The Center for Leadership Resources conducted a telephone survey of 434  households in Pomona in September. These were among the results.  </P> <P> Which best describes the crime situation in your neighborhood?  </P> <P> Not a problem: 37%  </P> <P> Small problem: 37%  </P> <P> Serious problem: 17%  </P> <P> Out of control: 9%  </P> <P> Which best describes the effectiveness of police services in your area?  </P> <P> Excellent: 13%  </P> <P> Good: 39%  </P> <P> Fair: 22%  </P> <P> Poor: 10%  </P> <P> No opportunity to judge: 16%  </P> <P> Which best describes the effectiveness of fire services in your area?  </P> <P> Excellent: 22%  </P> <P> Good: 33%  </P> <P> Fair: 12%  </P> <P> Poor: 1%  </P> <P> No opportunity to judge: 32%  </P> <P> Which best describes the quality of the public school your child attends?  </P> <P> Excellent: 17%  </P> <P> Good: 41%  </P> <P> Fair: 27%  </P> <P> Poor: 8%  </P> <P> No opinion: 7%  </P> <P> Do you follow City Council activities?  </P> <P> Regularly: 13%  </P> <P> Sometimes: 38%  </P> <P> Never: 49%  </P> <P> Can you identify two current council members?  </P> <P> Yes: 35%  </P> <P> No: 65%  </P></p>

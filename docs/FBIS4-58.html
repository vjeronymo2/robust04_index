			<p>Beijing      has authoritatively denied Western news reports of large  scale Chinese military deployments along the Sino-Indian border  and portrayed recent talks with Indian officials on border issues  as contributing to continued progress in resolving the sensitive  border issue.  In response to a reporter's question at a 28 April  news conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu  Jianmin rejected as "sheer fabrication" reports that China had  sent "30,000 troops" through Tibet to the Sino-Indian border  (Xinhua, 28 April).  Consistent with Wu's denial, the Western  press agency Agence France Presse quoted an Indian defense  ministry spokesman on 25 April as dismissing reports from  "Tibetan sources" that day of Chinese troop movements into Tibet  and described the Indo-Tibetan border as "absolutely normal"  (AFP, 25 April 1994).     Wu buttressed his denial of troop movements by noting that China  and India had "begun talks on the reduction of troops" along the  border in line with an accord signed last year by the two  countries that established diplomatic and military expert teams  from the two sides to negotiate a solution to the longstanding  border problem (Xinhua 28, April).  Both Chinese and Indian media  commentary on the recently concluded second round of talks  between the teams suggests that both sides view the 21-23 April  meetings as having made progress on some issues.  Reflecting this  apparent progress, a 23 April Xinhua report stated that the two  sides signed regulations guiding the work of the teams.  The  report also implied that progress had been made when, in contrast  to Xinhua's portrayal of the first round of expert talks in  February, it made no mention of military tension on the border  and said that the two sides had discussed ways of "continuing" to  implement the border accord.  In February, Xinhua had said that  the teams had exchanged views on solving, "as early as possible,"  the issue of "close military confrontation at certain sectors" of  the border, and had discussed "future tasks in implementing" the  agreement.     Indian media were even more upbeat in assessing the results of  the talks.  A 25 April report carried by the ISI Diplomatic  Information Service not only repeated Xinhua's evaluation of the  talks but also went on to claim that both sides had expressed  satisfaction at "the confidence building measures already in  place" and that the line of actual control along the Sino-Indian  border was "peaceful."  The atmosphere of the talks, it said, was  "friendly" and the two teams had "adopted a constructive and  forward-looking approach."     (AUTHOR: SIMON.

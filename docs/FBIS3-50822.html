			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Henrique </F> Cardoso by Luiz Noronha and Rodolfo Fernandes at Cardoso's  apartment in Brasilia; date not given]    [Excerpts] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso will  return to Congress, at least during the month of January. He  will practically move over there to personally promote the  approval of the economic stabilization program by senators and  deputies.    In an interview with O GLOBO, Cardoso says: On the day after  the approval of a zero-deficit budget, we are going to create  the URV [real value unit]. I am hoping to be able to do this by  the end of January.    Cardoso is aware that in undertaking such a marathon effort  he will have to have lunch and dinner more than twice a day and  will have to attend dozens of meetings. But he is not concerned  about this. Not even the recurrence of back pains provoked by  an old hernia ailment -- which, by doctor's orders, sometimes  forces him to lie down -- causes him to lose his good humor and  enthusiasm. [passage omitted]    [O GLOBO] Congress will vote on the zero-deficit budget  proposal, which is the pillar of the stabilization plan, at a  time when a historic moralization campaign is being conducted  within the Budget Committee. What effect could this have on the  success of these measures?    [Cardoso] Had it not been for the crisis that erupted within  the Budget Committee and for the CPI [Congressional  Investigating Committee] that was subsequently created to  investigate it, I would not have been able to revise the budget.  Neither I nor the government would be able to make Congress  discontinue its traditional habit of inflating the budget to the  point of rendering the fight against inflation unfeasible. Had  it not been for the crisis, we would have had no cards to play.    [O GLOBO] Who else is obstructing the plan in Congress?    [Cardoso] A group of deputies linked to municipal  governments  who believe the plan will be harmful to their municipalities.  What motivates Congress more than the presidential succession,  for example, is the election of each deputy. There is a group of  municipalities, the poorest ones, that essentially depend on the  Fund of Municipal Participation [in the national budget]. But we  are negotiating it. One of the alternatives, suggested by Deputy  Gonzaga Motta, is of liberating resources according to an idea  inversely proportional to poverty. The poorer it is, the less  resources it will hold in the fund. Another possibility: not  touching the issue of municipalities to continue toward an  alternative mechanism. What would it be? I suggested one: Today  there is an income tax paid by public employees. That tax  collected by the states should remain within the states; what is  collected by the federal government will not be kept by the  federal government but will be sent to the states and  municipalities. It is just a matter of changing it. It  represents approximately $1 billion.    [O GLOBO] And what is unnegotiable?    [Cardoso] Two things. The deficit must be zero. Today  everyone already has adopted this idea. Point two: There is no  way to end the mechanism of having a provisional fund within the  Fund of Municipal Participation because the government would  have no way of facing the essential issue, which is, for  instance, that of paying for health, because it would have no  funds earmarked for that. I must have 15 percent of the budget  free in order to meet those expenditures. That is unremovable.  But only the municipalities have resisted this idea.    [O GLOBO] Then once the budget and the constitutional  amendment creating the Social Emergency Fund are approved, will  the government immediately create the URV?    [Cardoso] Ah, it will be created the next day. But first  there must be a decision by Congress so I will be certain I have  a balanced budget and I will not need to resort to the banking  system to ask for money. I hope to be able to do it by the end  of January. The URV's creation is a simple thing. What is  difficult will be implementing it. I believe society already is  expecting it. Everyone is anxious to see the URV. [passage  omitted]    [O GLOBO] Does your position as a potential candidate for  president of the Republic, which is taken independently from  your will, upset the economic program?    [Cardoso] Here there is a paradox: To implement that plan I  need a certain political leadership; but if you have that  leadership people will automatically say you are a candidate.  Then it does disturb. But at the same time it helps because  people realize that I have a stable relationship with the  president of the Republic, that I am capable of negotiating with  Congress, that I do not run away from debate with anyone.    [O GLOBO] People want to hear a statement from you that you  are not a candidate.    [Cardoso] It is not a matter of making a statement. I am not  taking any personal steps for a candidacy, nor am I organizing  an economic policy based on a candidacy. I have never accepted  the condition of a candidate, not even within my party, the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. It is a rather hasty  decision to believe that in Brazil someone who is finance  minister can be a candidate for president. First, because the  minister experiences great pressure. He must say no all the  time, and this makes him very unpopular. There is also a public  responsibility: Can I give up the ship now? I am not saying I  will not be a candidate because I can be a candidate for  senator. My political rights already have been lifted once; I do  not wish it a second time. There is no sense in someone keeping  me away from the political game. [passage omitted]</p>

Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to North Dakota. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until May 9, 1994. Copies of North Dakota's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the Addresses  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approval of North Dakota's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's comments on the draft application were addressed in the final application. Thus, the North Dakota program is only granted final authorization for those provisions specifically listed in Table 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

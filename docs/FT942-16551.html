			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News - The AGM Season: Power of the shareholder vote These are the meetings that company chairmen love to hate. As the annual meeting season gets under way FT writers take a serious look at shareholders' rights and meeting room technology, and a more light-hearted view of the folklore, the perks and the colour As the season for quoted companies' annual meetings gets under way there have been renewed calls for a widening of shareholders' powers to influence the conduct of the meetings. The shareholders' lobby groups have also found an influential ally in the form of Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, the fund management group. He recently appealed for the resuscitation of the annual meeting to 'restore it to its rightful place as the nexus of shareholder and management contact'. Yet shareholders' powers are already considerable and for many managements that nexus has become distinctly uncomfortable. Already in the current season disgruntled shareholders have given a rough ride to the boards of Lonrho and BP. However, these instances remain the exception and even fewer annual meetings live up to the ideal of informed discussion between owners and managers. That is partly because few of the owners fully understand their rights. These are a complex amalgam of statutory obligations under the Companies Act, the rules of the Stock Exchange's Yellow Book and the companies' own Articles of Association. The latter vary widely though all are based on a model in the Companies Act which sets the minimum requirements. When considering taking action shareholders therefore need to consult the latest Articles of the company, but the accompanying box sets out their basic rights. A growing number of companies are responding to investor pressure by extending shareholder rights. Legal &amp; General and Rank have both agreed to put the question of political donations to the vote at the annual meeting. And companies trying to reverse the process have found it difficult to swim against the tide. Last year Hanson proposed changes to its Articles which would have eliminated the right of shareholders to nominate a director to the board unless backers represented at least 10 per cent of the vote. Shareholders would also have lost the right to propose amendments to resolutions at the meeting unless they represented 5 per cent of the share capital. However, Hanson withdrew the proposed changes following shareholder opposition orchestrated by Pensions Investment Research Consultants, which advises pension funds on corporate governance. Mr Stuart Bell, PIRC's research director, argues that the shortcomings of AGMs are as much the fault of shareholders as of their directors. 'In the past shareholders didn't bother to consider their rights, though meetings have been getting slightly better recently.' Nonetheless, PIRC also believes that shareholders' rights need to be extended to encourage active participation. 'The rights for shareholders to be involved in agenda setting by proposing resolutions are much too restrictive,' says Mr Bell. 'The problem at the moment is that the agenda is set entirely by directors. If it is not relevant to shareholders the AGM becomes a dull exercise in public relations by the company.' PIRC is calling for the reduction in the number of shares required to propose a resolution to just 100, held for more than a year. It is also proposing that the costs of circulating shareholder resolutions be borne by the company, a suggestion strongly backed by the UK Shareholders' Association. Mr Donald Butcher, chairman, says: 'For a large company the cost is quoted at up to Pounds 10,000. If as many as 100 members wish to circulate a resolution then it is quite reasonable that it should be at the company's expense.' Mr Butcher believes that the importance of shareholders' rights to kick up a fuss at the AGM should not be underestimated, particularly if it is reported in the press. 'Public obloquy does have an effect,' he declares. But he argues that legal reforms are required to 'elevate the status' and he is very encouraged by Mr Myners' recent speech. 'This signalled a change of view of one very important fund manager.' However, it is not a view widely shared by other institutions. Mr Paul Yates, a director of PDFM, says that annual meetings are largely irrelevant to main shareholders, although the fund manager takes voting seriously, if only by proxy. 'We see the companies in which we invest on a regular basis and we don't want anyone else there. It is much more constructive to hold corporate governance discussions in private than in public.' He admits that private investors need 'some sort of forum' to question directors but adds: 'I can't think what you could do to make it a more useful for institutional investors.' He dismisses the idea that annual meetings should be used by companies to announce price sensitive information, which would cause 'a frantic scramble to the mobile phones'. The head of investment at one of the UK's largest institutions agrees that AGMs are, and are likely to remain, little more than 'opportunities for private shareholders to air their grievances'. He argues that management problems are best addressed in private and that general meetings should only be used as a last resort. 'People need to save face when cornered and are more willing to accept change if it is done in a gentlemanly way out of the public gaze. 'Annual meetings are just not the right environment either for careful cross-questioning of a company's strategy or for resolution of corporate governance issues.' Even those institutions which favour change do not expect it to happen quickly. Mr Robert Adamson, who deals with corporate governance questions at the British Rail pension fund, says: 'Change needs to be supported by the big funds and most couldn't care less.'</p>

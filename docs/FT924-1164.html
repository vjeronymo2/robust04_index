			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Tesco goes shopping in France: The purchase of a continental retailer by the UK supermarket chain The experience of British retailers which have acquired abroad in recent years has followed a dismally familiar pattern. All too often, the initial exhilaration which accompanied the deals has been abruptly punctured by a series of nasty surprises, to the prolonged chagrin of the acquirers and their shareholders. So when Tesco, the UK's second-largest supermarket chain, announced yesterday that it was moving into continental Europe by buying Catteau, a family-controlled retailer in northern France, the immediate reaction in the City was restrained enthusiasm. The first question on many lips was: 'Does Tesco know what it's getting into?' By the end of the day, the company appeared to have reassured most observers that the acquisition made reasonable sense. However, unresolved questions remain about what Tesco's continental foray says about its underlying strategy at a time of growing doubts about the health of its UK business. Though Tesco is the first large British food supermarket to establish a bridgehead across the channel, its move is in line with a growing trend elsewhere in Europe. In the past few years many continental chains have begun to expand across borders in search of fresh markets. As a result of acquisition or greenfield investment, leading groups such as Ahold of the Netherlands, Aldi and Tengelmann of Germany and Promodes and Carrefour of France today all have 30 per cent or more of their sales in other European markets. By this measure, Tesco's initiative is exceedingly modest. Catteau's annual sales of Pounds 341m last year were a tiny fraction of Tesco's Pounds 7.1bn turnover, while the Pounds 150m to be paid for 85 per cent of the French group is a sixth of Tesco's investments in UK stores this year. 'It's a toehold in Europe, which offers a test bed and a learning experience. There are no great risks involved,' Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco's chairman, put it yesterday. Catteau operates a mixture of 90 convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets, mostly in the Nord-Pas de Calais region. In a country notorious for fierce price-cutting and wafer-thin retail margins, it appears exceptionally profitable. Its operating margin of more than 5 per cent last year is double that of many larger supermarket groups. The explanation given is a strong regional franchise, combined with keen pricing and tight cost controls. Nonetheless, the growth of national supermarket chains in France, coupled with incursions by foreign newcomers such as Aldi, have raised questions about the future of regional groups, some of which have already gone to the wall. 'The Catteau family decided to sell because they looked ahead and recognised that in the longer term, they would need an ally,' says Mr David Reid, Tesco's finance director. Catteau will continue under its present management but will benefit from access to its new parent's expertise in distribution, marketing and product innovation - areas in which UK supermarkets are acknowledged leaders in Europe. There are also modest plans for the French group to expand its geographic coverage. For Tesco, which will have four directors on Catteau's board, the main advantage of the deal will be the opportunity to gain practical experience in an unfamiliar market. 'Over the next months and years, we will get to know how a French retailer works,' says Sir Ian. The big questions are what Tesco will do with this knowledge - and why the company wants it in the first place. According to Sir Ian, Tesco has been studying opportunities overseas for the past five years. After considering the US, he said, 'we favour the European route'. However, he would not be drawn on the likely timing or direction of Tesco's next step. There are potential advantages to be gained from a moretrans-European approach. Though leading supermarket chains across northern Europe have grown steadily stronger in their home markets in the past 20 years, they face a supplier industry in which the biggest brands are increasingly concentrated in the hands of multinational manufacturers such as Nestle, Philip Morris, Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever. One reason why retailers have expanded across borders in recent years has been to match these companies' scale economies and bargaining power. However, there is one vital distinction between British food retailers and their continental counterparts: profitability. While thin margins at home have been an important factor driving some French and German groups to venture outside their home markets, those earned by the leading UK chains have long been the envy of the rest of Europe. As Mr Richard Hyman of Verdict, a retailing market research firm, puts it: 'In food, it is no coincidence that much of the European interest has consisted of continentals eyeing the UK market. Expansion in the other direction has always looked much less attractive.' Indeed, J Sainsbury has long ruled out expansion on the continent, preferring to focus on the US. How far the skills which have enabled UK supermarkets to achieve high margins at home can be transferred across frontiers is an open question. Certainly, their experience in the US does not offer much encouraging evidence. The least that can be said is that finding the answer is likely to be a lengthy process, which will require substantial investments of resources and management time. So what is Tesco up to? To some observers, the significance of yesterday's announcement lay more in what it implied about conditions on this side of the Channel than about future opportunities in France. 'It focused attention once again on Tesco's UK growth prospects,' said Mr Nick Bubb, retailing analyst with investment bank Morgan Stanley. These have recently been the source of growing debate in the City, where the company's price-earnings ratio stands at a substantial discount to those of Sainsbury and Argyll. Some observers believe that it is under more pressure than its big rivals, and that its huge investments in new superstores may be running into a problem of diminishing returns. Tesco's marketing effort is also compared unfavourably by some critics with that of Sainsbury. Sir Ian stoutly rejects such suggestions, insisting that Tesco has plenty of room left to grow by launching new store formats and capturing market share from weaker competitors. However, the improved results yesterday from Asda, until recently one of the most vulnerable supermarket chains, suggests that market share gains may be becoming harder to achieve. A proper judgment on Tesco's performance may have to wait until after the end of the recession. But until the questions hanging over the company's prospects are resolved, opinions are likely to remain divided. To some, its continental shopping expedition marks the start of a bold expansion phase; to others, it is a defensive response to difficult conditions at home.</p>

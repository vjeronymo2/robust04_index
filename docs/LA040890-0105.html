			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCADIA SPRINTS GO TO MILLER  </P> <P> For two years, Inger Miller of Pasadena Muir battled two-time state sprint  champion Angela Burnham of Oxnard Rio Mesa in the Arcadia Invitational track  and field meet.  </P> <P> As a sophomore in 1988, Miller gained recognition by finishing second to  Burnham in the 100 and 200 meters, and last season she became known nationally  in splitting sprint victories with her Rio Mesa rival.  </P> <P> With Burnham now a UCLA freshman, Miller had to face a new Rio Mesa sprinter in  freshman Marion Jones Saturday in the 23rd Arcadia Invitational.  </P> <P> On a chilly windy night, the 5-foot-5 Miller had to come from behind in both  sprints to defeat the taller but younger Jones.  </P> <P> In the 100 meters, Miller overcame a bad start and a strong midrace burst by  Jones to win in 11.71 seconds to Jones' 11.78.  </P> <P> "I was left behind at the start, and I had to catch up in the last 30 meters,"  Miller said. "It was really close there at the end." Miller also anchored  Muir's winning 400-meter relay team, which established a national-leading mark  of 46.07.  </P> <P> The matchup was even closer in the 200 meters, as Jones attacked in the first  75 meters to take a five-meter lead. But Miller was able to catch Jones at the  finish and win in a meet record of 23.57, the fastest time in the nation this  season.  </P> <P> "In the 100, I thought I had her, but somehow she snuck up on me and won," said  Jones, whose time of 23.80 is a national record for 14 year olds. "(In the  200), I knew she would be there, so I just tried to hold her off, but I think  her experience helped her."  </P> <P> For Miller, the matchups with Jones rekindled memories of her first meetings  with Burnham.  </P> <P> "This is just like when I was in 10th grade and I lost two close races to  Angela," said Miller, who was named the girls' outstanding meet performer.  </P> <P> Donovan Burks of Los Angeles Washington and Andre Green of Long Beach Poly  exchanged victories in the boys' 100 and 200.  </P> <P> Burks, the defending city sprint champion, won the 100 in 10.85, and Green, who  finished second in the 100, won the 200 in 21.43.  </P> <P> Other meet highlights:  </P> <P> Brent Noon of Fallbrook, boys' outstanding performer, won the discus (192-11)  and shotput (71-4 1/4).  </P> <P> Lamont Warren of Dorsey won the 400 meters (47.51) and anchored the Dons'  winning 1,600-meter relay team.  </P> <P> Jerome Price of San Diego University leaped a wind-aided 25-8 1/2 in the long  jump, best in the nation this season.  </P> <P> Coley Candaele of Carpinteria defeated a strong field in the 800 meters in  1:51.19, also a national best.  </P> <P> Andy Maris of White River, Wash., outkicked Brian Dameworth of Agoura to win  the 3,200 meters in 8:53.78, another 1990 best.  </P> <P> Melisa Weis of Bakersfield won the discus in a national-best 169-9.  </P> <P> Juliana Yendork of Walnut, the national indoor triple jump record holder, won  her specialty with wind-aided leap of 40-7, tops in the nation.  </P> <P> Twila Sims of Lompoc, defending state 300-meter hurdles champion, won her event  in national-best 42.56.  </P> <P> Also: Kim Toney of Atascadero in the 800 meters (2:12.06), Karen Hecox of South  Hills in the 1,600 meters (4:52.04.) and Becky Spies of Livermore in the 3,200  meters (10:36.56) all were national bests.  </P></p>

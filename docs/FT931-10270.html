			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / 'Champagne' claim upheld FRANCO-BRITISH relations took a blow yesterday when French champagne producers were defeated in a High Court case. The champagne houses failed in an attempt to stop an English vineyard marketing a sparkling non-alcoholic drink as 'Elderflower champagne'. The court ruled that the drink produced by the Surrey-based company Thorncroft and sold for Pounds 2.45 in champagne-style bottles with wired corks was 'misrepresentation calculated to deceive'. But it concluded that the damage to the reputation of genuine champagne would be nil or minimal. 'This is Waterloo brought up to date,' Sir Gerard Vaughan, Conservative MP for Reading East, said of the ruling. It is the first setback in the European Community to attempts by French champagne producers to restrict the use of the appellation 'champagne' to the sparkling wine produced in the Champagne region of France since the fight with cidermaker Bulmer over calling Babycham 'champagne perry' in 1975. Although the champagne producers lost that case in the Court of Appeal, the matter was settled subsequently by negotiation in their favour before the case was due to go before the law lords. It comes only weeks after Hoover provoked widespread anger in France by announcing it would shift all European vacuum cleaner production to Cambuslang, near Glasgow, causing the loss of 650 jobs at its plant at Longvic, near Dijon. The champagne houses said they would appeal. Mr Malcolm McIntyre, director of the Champagne Bureau, said: 'We are very disappointed and I think this will cause some gnashing of teeth in Europe. It is the thin end of the wedge.' Mr Guy Woodall, Thorncroft's owner, said he was delighted with the decision. 'The spirit of Agincourt lives on,' he said. The Leatherhead vineyard has been marketing its drink as 'Sparkling Elderflower' since last April when the champagne producers obtained a temporary injunction preventing it from calling the drink 'champagne' pending a full court hearing. Yesterday it was awarded costs estimated at Pounds 100,000, against the champagne producers led by Taittinger and will be entitled to damages for expenses caused by the temporary injunction, such as re-labelling. The exclusive right to the champagne name was confirmed in this country in the early 1960s when Spanish producers of sparkling wine were banned from using it. French producers of champagne have taken legal action in many countries in an attempt to protect the name, bringing 64 actions in the English courts alone since the early 1960s. Mr David Sills, solicitor for the champagne producers, said he was 'shocked and dismayed' by the decision. 'The judge decided there had been misrepresentaton calculated to deceive yet declined to give us a remedy. 'He also found there was a specific risk of confusion between the goods of the two parties which is contrary to the 1987 European wine regulation which says there must be no risk of confusion. 'He seems to have grafted the English requirement for there to be a likelihood of damage to the plaintiff on to the European regulation,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> OUSTED MUSCOVITE WINS BALLOT SPOT  </P> <P> Boris N. Yeltsin, the ousted Moscow Communist Party chief and outspoken critic  of party conservatives, won a spot today on the ballot to represent the capital  in the new national legislature, Radio Moscow said.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, who lost the party job in 1987 after complaining about the slow pace  of reform, received 532 votes at an electoral committee meeting that ended  before dawn at the ornate House of Unions in downtown Moscow. Yevgeny Brakov,  director of the giant ZIL automotive plant, received 570 votes and will compete  with Yeltsin for one spot in the March 26 elections. Both were chosen by  committee members from a field of 10 potential candidates to represent Moscow.  </P> <P> Because election law permits candidates to be nominated in more than one  geographical area, Yeltsin also has been nominated in Sverdlovsk, where he  could stand a better chance of election.  </P></p>

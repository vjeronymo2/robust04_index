			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Mobil -- An Op-Ed Page article Thursday about a Torrance ballot measure on the  Mobil refinery misstated the number of injured in a Nov. 24, 1987, explosion at  the plant. The figure should have been 10. The reference to scores of injured  was meant to cover several incidents at the refinery in recent years.  </P></p>

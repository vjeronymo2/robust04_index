			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Talking to the IRA Anyone who seeks peace in Northern Ireland, at an honourable price, should support Mr John Major today. The prime minister has been charged with duplicity, on the ground that his government has sanctioned secret contacts with the Irish Republican Army in spite of its frequent protestations that it would never negotiate with terrorists. This is a setback for those who believe that governments must at all times behave like boy scouts, but the alternative would have been worse. Public deal-making with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, could not be countenanced by a democratically elected British administration unless the bombers of Warrington and the Shankill Road turned convincingly away from violence. Yet a refusal to keep open unofficial lines of communication would have denied the government the chance to make its own position plain, and to take note of any peace proposals coming from the other side. The Israelis spent some time in secret conclave with the Palestine Liberation Organisation before emerging in public with their recent deal. Mr Major has not gone nearly as far as that, nor could he even if he wanted to: unlike Israel, he is not in the business of trading territory for peace. Constitutional future British policy is clear. If the IRA lays down its arms, and an unspecified period of 'quarantine' has passed, Sinn Fein can join talks about the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. Relations with the republic of Ireland will be discussed with Dublin. Any proposals arising from such talks would have to be endorsed by the voters of Northern Ireland. The unionists would therefore retain their veto on any plan to move towards a united Ireland - a point Mr Major again needs to make plain today. Republicans would have to persuade them to change their minds. The IRA is thus invited to abandon its campaign of violence and to rely on Sinn Fein's re-entry to the political process. It can show whether its talk of peace has any substance by picking up that invitation today. Mr Major, who has placed himself at the head of a drive to seek a political settlement of the troubles, has behaved with courage, and a sense of responsibility. Certainly, as an FT report shows today, his peace initiative is in tune with business opinion in Ulster. It also reflects the feelings of most ordinary people. The prime minister aims to take advantage of a tide of popular feeling in favour of peace, while not abandoning the unionists and their right of veto. He is therefore standing by his Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, who has no reason to resign. The latter has said that the documents relating to back-door communications with the IRA will be published today. It must be presumed these will confirm that the long-standing and oft-repeated government promise to the Unionists, that the people of Northern Ireland will be able to determine their own future, will be seen to have been respected. Limit the damage Northern Ireland being what it is, this will not satisfy everyone. The cries of 'betrayal' from the Reverend Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists are routine; the more measured response from Mr Molyneaux's larger unionist party suggests that it may be possible to limit the damage to the prime minister's peace initiative. It is often remarked that the government depends on unionist votes to shore up its uncertain parliamentary majority, but, against that, the unionists depend on the continuance in office of the Conservatives. To Ulster ears, Labour sounds pro-republican. A greater danger lies on the right wing of Mr Major's own party, where pro-unionist speeches have recently been made by Lord Tebbit and the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont. Initial reactions to the weekend's news, notably from Mr Lamont, suggest that the damage may be containable. With luck, and skill in handling the house of commons, Mr Major and Sir Patrick should be able to weather today's political storm. Assuming that they do, there should be no hesitation in pressing on with the peace initiative. The next step for the prime minister will be to confirm the date for his planned summit meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Friday would not be too soon.</p>

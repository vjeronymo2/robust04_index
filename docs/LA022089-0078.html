			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HARD BATTLE MAY FACE GOLDING FOR STATE OFFICE  </P> <P> If serving good food could get you elected to statewide office, San Diego  County Supervisor Susan Golding would be well on her way.  </P> <P> Golding, flanked by quesadillas and tortilla chips with first-rate guacamole  and salsa on the side, entertained dozens of rank-and-file Republican activists  and a few party leaders at the state GOP convention here over the weekend.  While officially attending only as a county supervisor and chairwoman of the  party's group for locally elected officials, Golding made no secret of her  ambition to move beyond San Diego and play in the state's political big  leagues.  </P> <P> Golding said she is "99% sure" she will run for lieutenant governor in 1990,  when U. S. Sen. Pete Wilson seems assured to top the Republican ticket as the  candidate for governor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eager Field of Legislators  </P> <P> But it will take more than tasty Mexican food to propel Golding into the second  spot. With Wilson ready to reenter state politics after six years in  Washington, an eager field of legislators and others who had been hoping to run  for governor are now looking at the other constitutional offices.  </P> <P> Republican state Sens. William Campbell of Hacienda Heights, Marian Bergeson of  Newport Beach and John Seymour of Anaheim all have said they are interested in  the lieutenant governor's job, which until now has been a largely symbolic  post, ineffective even as a stepping stone to higher office. Orange County  Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez and former Rep. Daniel E. Lungren (R-Long Beach) have  also been mentioned as possible candidates.  </P> <P> All of them have as much as or more statewide stature than Golding because of  their legislative activity, connections to Gov. George Deukmejian or previous  attempts at statewide office themselves.  </P> <P> Still, Golding, 43, said she believes she would have as good a chance as any of  those yet named as possible candidates.  </P> <P> "No one who is talking about running already has a statewide constituency," she  said in an interview in her hotel hospitality suite, which she rented with  personal funds and staffed with three employees from her county office, whose  expenses she also paid out of her own pocket. "Everyone who is running is going  to have to start with a local base."  </P> <P> Golding does have some state government experience. After being appointed to  the San Diego City Council in 1981 with the help of then-Mayor Pete Wilson, she  left in 1983 to take the job of deputy secretary of business, transportation  and housing in Deukmejian's administration. Golding quit that post a year later  to run for county supervisor, and she was reelected to a second four-year term  last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'What You Make of It'  </P> <P> Golding first toyed with the idea of running for state office when she went to  work for Deukmejian. Since her return to San Diego, she has been considered a  potential candidate for mayor, but Maureen O'Connor was recently reelected and  will hold that post at least through 1992.  </P> <P> The lieutenant governor's job, Golding said, is "what you make of it."  </P> <P> "You can take any constitutional office and become a spokesperson on important  issues," she said, mentioning as examples the lieutenant governor's role as a  member of the State Lands Commission and the University of California Board of  Regents.  </P> <P> A Golding candidacy could be well served by her relationship with Wilson and  his longtime political advisers, Otto Bos and George Gorton of San Diego. As  chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors this year, Golding has a chance to be in  the limelight on important issues such as growth management, the homeless and  AIDS. And she has proven to be an effective fund-raiser, even though she has  raised money under local laws that limit contributions to $250. State law  allows donations of $1,000 from businesses and individuals and up to $5,000  from political action committees.  </P> <P> But some party insiders were saying privately over the weekend that Golding  might be seen as too liberal, once she is known, to win the GOP nomination. And  she has been questioned repeatedly about the wisdom of putting two San Diegans  at the top of the Republican ticket, a question that assumes Wilson will follow  through with his intention to run for governor and win the nomination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Geography Factor Downplayed  </P> <P> Golding discounts the geographical disadvantage, contending that Wilson, a  statewide officeholder since 1982, is no longer seen as a San Diegan. And even  if he is, she said, voters pay little attention to a candidate's hometown when  they go to the polls.  </P> <P> "I don't ever remember voting for someone because of where they lived," she  said. "I'm more concerned about what they stand for."  </P> <P> At any rate, Golding said, there is still a year before candidates for state  office must declare their intentions. Although she will be forming an  "exploratory committee" soon and probably doing some fund raising, Golding said  she will not make up her mind for many months.  </P> <P> "I'm testing the waters," she said. "I'm trying to decide in my own mind what  I'm going to do."  </P></p>

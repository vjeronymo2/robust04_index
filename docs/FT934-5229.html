			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Greek government tries to rein in public spending Greece's Socialist government yesterday presented a budget that attempts to curtail government spending in order to restrain a fast-growing public sector deficit. Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, economy minister, said preparing next year's budget had been 'a nightmare' because of a revenue shortfall that raised the government's borrowing requirement this year to 13.9 per cent of gross domestic product, against a target of 7.9 per cent. Although the budget projects a primary surplus, the borrowing requirement will drop only to 12.9 per cent of GDP as a result of high repayments due next year on domestic debt. Overall spending is forecast to rise by 9.3 per cent, one percentage point below the anticipated inflation rate, while revenues should increase by 21.4 per cent. Mr Gennimatas said a renewed effort to crack down on tax evasion and collect tax arrears would suffice to improve income. But he also announced increased taxes on tobacco and cigarettes. However, the budget projections will quickly be derailed if the government goes ahead with plans to rehire 25,000 civil servants dismissed by its conservative predecessor.</p>

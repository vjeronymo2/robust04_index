Tsyb, Medical  Radiology Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences,  Obninsk, under the rubric ``Investigation of the Sequelae of the  Chernobyl Disaster'' ; UDC 614.876:621.039.58]    [Abstract]Immunological (modifications of passive  agglutination of particles and enzyme immunoassay, agglutination  of gelatin particles loaded with microsomal antigen, and  radioimmunoassay of thyroid microsomal and antimicrosomal  antibodies) and ultrasound screening (of the thyroid) methods  were compared in a study of 6398 inhabitants of Korosten,  Zhitomir Oblast, at the time of the Chernobyl disaster.  Ultrasound screening revealed changes in the thyroid in 108  cases; serum samples were taken from these and 22 subjects  without changes for demonstration of antibodies to the  microsomal fraction of the thyroid using immunological methods.  There was a high degree of coincidence of diagnoses made by  ultrasound and immunoassays, which indicates that the latter can  be used for the said population to supplement the ultrasound  findings.

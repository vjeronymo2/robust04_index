			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Defence and NHS business help Vega advance to Pounds 1.7m VEGA GROUP, a satellite software specialist, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.39m to Pounds 1.72m in its first full year as a quoted company, boosted by diversification into Health Service and Department of the Environment contracts. Defence business also grew. Satellites are 'areas of the Ministry of Defence which are unaffected by the general military spending cuts,' said Mr John Rigg, chairman, yesterday. Turnover for the 12 months to April 30 expanded 29 per cent from Pounds 6.27m to Pounds 8.1m and earnings per share rose from 6.69p to 7.99p. The final dividend is 1.86p making a total for the year of 2.73p. There was an extraordinary item of Pounds 227,000 to cover the costs of the flotation. Cash flow continued to be positive and net assets rose from Pounds 1.12m to Pounds 2m. The number of employees has grown from 125 in May 1992 to more than 150, with about 80 per cent in fee earning posts. 'Vega is very well positioned to continue its strong growth. The company has contracts to provide support services to most European space projects', said Mr Rigg. 'Many of these contracts extend over a number of years and provide a stable financial base from which we can continue to develop new business.' The company is looking for acquisitions in the software sector, he said. These might include one or both of two other companies chaired by Mr Rigg, a former chartered accountant with Arthur Andersen: Triad Special Systems and Shreeveport. He added that an alternative was the flotation of Triad, which is set to make a pre-tax profit of Pounds 900,000 on sales of Pounds 5.5m this year. Vega Group was floated in June 1992 via a placing at 122p. Yesterday the shares rose 5p to 132p.</p>

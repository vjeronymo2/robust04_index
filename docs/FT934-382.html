			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Russia to accelerate bankruptcy The Russian government has moved to speed up bankruptcies next year as part of its economic reforms. President Boris Yeltsin, who has promised to continue reform despite the nationalist victory at the polls, has authorised the privatisation agency headed by deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais to designate insolvent enterprises and open bankruptcy proceedings. This is not the first time Mr Yeltsin and others have resolved to push ahead with bankruptcies. But since Russia's bankruptcy law came into force in March, only one small kitchen-knife factory has filed successfully. Though the presidential decree outlines some practical procedures for the bankruptcy law, it does not set deadlines or require published lists of insolvent enterprises. The decree must also be reviewed by the new parliament. Mr Chubais said he hoped for success in discussions on co-operation with parliament's other main pro-reform bloc, headed by market economist Grigory Yavlinsky, against nationalists and Communists. Mr Chubais acknowledged yesterday that Russia's privatised companies had changed little in the way they operated. 'It would be very naive to expect that after the first day of privatisation a state enterprise would cut its production costs four times and double its profits,' he said. Communist Party member Anatoly Lukyanov, on trial for his role in the August 1991 failed Soviet coup, was 'almost unanimously' elected chairman of the temporary co-ordination commission of the new parliament.</p>

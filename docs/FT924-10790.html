			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Committee publishes supervision principles THE technical committee of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) yesterday published a set of principles for the supervision of financial conglomerates, designed to focus greater attention on the group as a whole rather than solely on the securities entity. Securities regulators have traditionally concentrated on 'solo' regulation, believing that securities firms can, if necessary, be wound down with minimal risk to market stability and to investors. However, the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the US securities firm, in 1990, triggered by problems within the holding company, focused regulators' minds on the risk of contagion - that problems within one part of a company, perhaps unregulated, can quickly spill over into other areas. The shift towards group regulation is reflected in the EC's capital adequacy directive, and bank regulators, under Basle Committee on banking supervision, have also opted for an approach based on consolidation. However, bank regulators favour a quantitative approach, which involves measuring risk and applying a specific capital requirement accordingly. Securities regulators tend to take a more qualitative approach, exemplified by the US Securities and Exchange Commission's recently-introduced risk assesment rules. However, the Iosco principles allow for the full spectrum of supervision techniques. The Iosco paper proposes greater sharing of information between regulators, and suggests identifying a lead regulator, with primary responsibility for group-based risk assessment. However, the guidelines stop short of proposing any routine exchange of information. While banking and securities regulators are moving in the same direction, convergence with insurance regulators 'still remains some way off', according to the report.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a news conference following a meeting of the  cabinet on 25 February, Manae Kubato, director general of the  Economic Planning Agency [EPA], opposed the idea of setting  targets for reducing Japan's current-accounts surplus. She  said, "The current-accounts surplus is the most difficult  economic factor for the government to control." She also said,  "I understand that Japan has maintained the principles of free  trade in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks." In this  way, Kubota indicated that setting any kind of numerical target  could lead to managed trade.</p>

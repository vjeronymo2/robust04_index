			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Amex and AT&amp;T target small business community AMERICAN EXPRESS and American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), two corporate giants under pressure from nimble rivals, have joined forces in an attempt to woo the US small business community. They announced yesterday that AT&amp;T's corporate calling card and the American Express corporate charge card would be jointly marketed to small businesses as a single entity. The system will allow small businesses which are American Express corporate card members to charge AT&amp;T telecommunications expenses along with other out-of-office expenses and get a single monthly statement. American Express is under pressure from the Visa and Mastercard credit card operations.</p>

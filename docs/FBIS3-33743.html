After receiving the above news, our country's deputy foreign  minister for Asia and Oceanic affairs telephoned Turkish Deputy  Foreign Minister Bilgin Unan to express the deep concern of the  Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for that tragic  incident and called on the Turkish Government to give an  explanation in that regard.    The deputy Turkish foreign minister said: The Turkish  Government under no circumstances allows such operations inside  Iranian territory, and yesterday's military operations were  conducted following very precise calculations; they took place  precisely inside Iraqi territory and were aimed at suppressing  the PKK. The Turkish Government is ready to immediately dispach  a team to the Islamic Republic of Iran to work under the  supervision of the Iranian authorities to investigate the  incident. He added: The Turkish Government will accept the  outcome of the investigations.    When that telephone contact ended, the Iranian deputy  foreign  minsiter for Asia and Oceanic affairs told our correspondent  that the Foreign Ministry is coordinating its efforts  continuously with the Interior Ministry and other concerned  organizations to follow up the case, the result of which will be  announced later.</p>

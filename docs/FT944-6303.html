			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94: Aid for hiring long-term jobless Getting the long-term jobless back to work with a mixture of benefit incentives and new employment schemes was the centrepiece of the Budget. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced a Pounds 680m package of new measures mainly designed to help the 500,000 people unemployed for two years or more return to work - and reduce the cost to employers of hiring them. But the government also announced a 20 per cent cut in its training budget over the next financial year with a 14 per cent reduction until 1996-97. Mr Clarke said the employment measures constituted a very important and carefully thought-out package of support. He told MPs: 'It is no longer credible for some people to campaign for reductions in long-term unemployment without having effective policies to deal with it.' Employers are to be provided with incentives to recruit the long-term unemployed. There is to be a 0.6 per cent cut in employers' National Insurance contributions for the lower-paid. Employers are also to receive a one-year rebate from National Insurance contributions for each worker they hire who has been jobless for more than two years. Workstart schemes, which give grants to employers taking on the long-term unemployed, are to be tried out, providing 5,000 job opportunities. Other proposals involve the provision of financial support from the state in the transition period for the unemployed moving back into work. This is to be achieved by speeding up the provision of family credit as well as housing and council tax benefit for those returning to employment. Jobfinders' grants are to be provided to enable workers to buy clothes and tools for their new employment. Measures are also to be introduced to ensure the unemployed 'keep in touch with the labour market'. Mr Clarke said the aim was to 'lift people from dependency into work and to smooth the transition from out-of-work benefits to modest in-work benefits'. He added that the measures were also designed to tackle structural unemployment, which he described as 'the big problem that faces the western world'. The chancellor said: 'The days of priming the pump to cut unemployment are long since past. The government is building reforms on reforms to remove the distortions and anomalies from the benefit system which discourage so many unemployed people from taking jobs.' Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, claimed the package of proposals to deal with unemployment would 'help bring down unemployment at an even faster rate and create jobs'. But union leaders criticised the package. 'Ken Clarke is tinkering with the trimmings of the unemployment problem,' said Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union. 'He is subsidising low pay out of taxpayers' money.' Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said that while the measures for the low-paid and long-term jobless were welcome as far as they went, the unemployed would be asking why Mr Clarke was waiting until 1996 to implement many of the proposals. Mr Robbie Gilbert, the Confederation of British Industry's social affairs director, said he regretted that the chancellor had not focused on schemes to cover the 1m people out of work for over a year rather than limit many of the proposals for those unemployed for more than two years. For 1995-96, the training budget will be Pounds 578m as opposed to Pounds 693m in the current financial year. The Training and Enterprise National Council had sought a Pounds 724m budget for 1995-96. This will mean a drop in the number of training places from 270,000 this financial year to 230,000 in 1995-96. The Department of Employment's overall budget is to be cut over the next three years in real terms from Pounds 3.29bn to Pounds 3.12bn. Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, said: 'We want to ensure our main training programme for the long-term unemployed is focused much more sharply on getting people into jobs. We will increase the number of unemployed people who get jobs as a result of the programme from a reduced budget.'</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Awful 'vision' but some good ideas A frequent criticism of policy groups is that their principles are fine, but they are short on detailed proposals on how to implement them. The report of Labour's so-called Commission on Social Justice - chair Sir Gordon Borrie - is just the opposite. The principles vary between the platitudinous, the meaningless and the wrong-headed. But there are some good individual proposals, which needed to be rescued from the surrounding material with a greater exercise of charity and imagination than the commission members were willing to extend to their own intellectual opponents. It is, however, unnecessarily difficult to carry out the necessary extraction. The Executive Summary is not that at all, but a party political pamphlet. There is no index. The book is both insular and partisan. Every idea is presented as novel and utterly different from the government's. Examples from other countries are brought in for debating purposes. But there is little recognition that the problems it describes affect most western countries, irrespective of the party in power. To take one example, the British government is castigated for the low proportion of the population at work; but no mention is made of the fact that the proportion is lower still in most other European countries, whose degree of labour market regulation the commission so much envies. Above all, there is no costed programme or even a list of costed options of the kind that is standard, for instance, in the work of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. This is a great wasted opportunity. For the potential value of a group like the Borrie commission is that it can put forward proposals which do not commit its political sponsors. Tackling the poverty and unemployment traps is an expensive operation, if benefits are not to be cut or more harshly administered. But there are more and less cost-effective ways of doing so. It would be better to give some honest estimates than an open-ended list of proposals and possibilities, with the half-hearted hint that they might be paid for by economic growth - as Ronald Reagan's tax cuts were supposed to have been. Hardly a model to appeal to a modernised Labour party. I suspect that the first few chapters will be passed over as 'guff' by numbers merchants of all persuasions. But bad guff gives political economy a bad name. We are given these alternative prescriptions: (a) an 'Investors' Britain', (b) a 'Deregulators' Britain' and (c) a 'Levellers' Britain'. As if these titles were not contentious enough, the first is identified with a 'fair and prosperous Britain', the second with a 'harsher Britain' and the third with a 'kindly, poorer Britain'. Why did not the philosopher member, Professor Bernard Williams, apply the standard critique of 'Persuasive Definitions' to this section? The labels, however, will not be persuasive to those with enough economic logic to know that investment is itself a cost, not a benefit, best seen as by-product of entrepreneurial search for new products, processes and customers. There is a highly misleading chart supposedly linking the growth of output per worker to the share of net investment in GDP. We are not told of the period over which the relationship is supposed to apply. The only source we are given is the New York Review of Books, without even an author. The chart fails to include the former communist countries which had the highest investment ratios of all and - as we now know - the worst economic performance. It was inevitable that the commission would support minimum wage legislation in view of former Labour leader John Smith's dug-in attitude. But the commission's own figures show that it is an extremely ineffective way of dealing with poverty, which varies so much with family circumstances. Its main weapon is a number of studies purporting to show that minimum wages in some industries and countries do not destroy jobs, relying on the reader's ignorance of other studies showing the opposite. The market economist is meant to applaud the commission for proposing a minimum wage of Pounds 3.50 per hour rather than the higher sums demanded by union leaders, as if a perverse medicine can be defended by the moderation of the dose. Is the Pounds 3.50 minimum meant to apply to part-time or only full-time workers? If it applies to the latter, it will only increase the shift to part-time jobs. If it is to apply to any work done by anyone, then it means that a householder who cannot afford to pay that rate for a few hours' work by a jobbing carpenter will have to resort to do-it-herself - even though this makes both sides worse off and is in contravention of one human being's right to make a contract with another so long as there are no large adverse spillover effects. The most radical single idea is the Pension Guarantee. This, thankfully, abandons the Labour commitment to wasteful across-the-board increases in state pensions. Instead there are to be more generous and more humane top-up arrangements than at present for pensioners with little or no other income. There is, of course, much casuistry to avoid using words like selectivity and means testing. Less happily, mandatory second pension schemes seem to be advocated - which is too near compulsory saving for a liberal. Many detailed but important low cost improvements are put forward which might make Family Credit more effective in topping up the incomes of families with low earnings from employment. Another good idea, canvassed rather than firmly proposed, is that of merging Family Credit with Income Support for the unemployed. At least that is better than the Conservative Job Seeker's Allowance, which puts an iron curtain between the two. The Borrie commission is also more favourable than the government to low cost proposals to allow the unemployed some modest earnings from casual work without losing benefit. Furthermore, there are reforms in Housing Benefit, which could make it less of a work disincentive than it now is when combined with Family Credit. All through one would like tabulated statements about losers as well as gainers. One can also applaud the suggested phasing out of the Married Couple's Allowance. This was originally meant to happen when individual taxation was introduced, but one rather important married couple vetoed the idea. The allowance is now being partially phased out by Kenneth Clarke. But unlike the chancellor, I would also support the channelling of the savings from ending it into children's benefits. Children are more at risk from poverty than childless couples or older single people; and they did not ask to be born. That does not mean sharing the Borrie enthusiasm for channelling everything saved into across-the-board increases in Child Benefit - still less into nursery education which looks like vying with industrial training as the fad of the hour. I would prefer some of it to be channelled into income-related benefits. Most of all, I was pleased to see the incorporation, if only as a suggestion, of Hermione Parker's idea of a modest Participation Income for all, which would be conditional not on seeking paid employment but on any kind of service for other people. Those of us who believe in individualism with a human face (which means something less grudging and punitive than the government's ideas) should not hesitate to raid Borrie for ideas and dialectical support. But on no account should we allow it monopoly of insight, compassion, imagination or any other aspect of the 'vision thing'.</p>

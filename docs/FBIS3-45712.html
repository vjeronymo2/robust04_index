			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1245 GMT on </F> 21 January transmits a service message canceling the following  item and asking it be replaced with another version; differences  between the two items noted below; feature by reporter Hu Xudong  (5170 2485 2639): "Chairman Qiao Shi at `Benz'; variant version  reads: "Chairman Qiao Shi Visits Benz Company," replacing "at  `Benz'" with "Visits Benz Company"]    [Text] Stuttgart, 20 January -- "5, 4, 3, 2...." Before  "1" was announced in the countdown, a Benz car slammed into an  obstacle with a loud "bang" and, meanwhile, a safety air cushion  was instantly ejected out of the steering wheel inside the car  while the "driver" remained safe and sound [variant version  reads: ...in the countdown, a safety air cushion was instantly  ejected out of the steering wheel, sending up a light smoke.  This was a scene simulating a car collision in the Benz auto  company....].    The Chinese subtitles reading "Welcome Your Visit to the  Benz  Company Safety Research Division" were shown on the wall in the  hall for the collision simulation test. The visit by Qiao Shi,  chairman of the PRC National People's Congress Standing  Committee, and his entourage to the Benz auto company, one of  Germany's most famous enterprises, reached a climax here  [variant version reads: ...National People's Congress, to the  Benz auto company reached a climax here... deleting "and his  entourage" and "one of Germany's most famous enterprises"].    Safety in driving a car has become the crucial point of auto  research and development [variant version reads: ...research and  development now... adding "now"]. It is learned that the Benz  auto company is one of the earliest auto manufacturers to use  safety air bags in their products.    Qiao Shi and his party arrived at Sindelfingen city near  Stuttgart for a visit to the Benz headquarters at 1630 today.  Accompanied by President (Lloyd) of the Benz group, Qiao Shi  visited the Benz company's new car exhibition hall first.  Various new Benz cars were on display in this round hall which  occupies several hundred square meters. Qiao Shi listened with  keen interest to a company briefing on various new models of  Benz cars, and raised questions from time to time.    "Does this car have automatic gear shifting? Is it  electronically controlled?"    "Yes."    "How many cylinders does it have?"    "There are four, six, and eight cylinders."    "What kind of gas does it use?"    "Super unleaded."    "How much gas does it consume per 100 km?"    "Ten to 20 liters per 100 km, depending on the number of  cylinders and capacity."    Pointing at the star-shaped emblem in the front of a car,  (Lloyd) said: "This is an article most liable to theft. We  must produce a large number of emblems as spares every year."  Qiao Shi and other visitors burst out laughing.    Standing in front of a beautiful convertible, Qiao Shi said  humorously: "This is very suitable for youngsters. They like  to go for a drive."    When Qiao Shi and his party came to the place where a heavy  truck was on display, their host said that the Benz company had  signed an agreement with China to produce this kind of truck in  China. Qiao Shi enquired with concern: "What is its loading  capacity?" Their host replied: "Eighteen tonnes. Plus the  weight of the truck itself, it has a total capacity of 40  tonnes. However, the weight of the truck China is to produce is  altered to 36 tonnes." At this point, (Lloyd) pointed at a  colleague standing beside him and said jokingly: "He drives  this kind of truck like a racing car, speeding at 280 km per  hour on the freeway." Another burst of laughter.    Then, Qiao Shi visited an assembling shop. At last, he came  to the safety research division hall for car collision  simulation tests. On display in the hall were cars damaged by  collisions at different angles. The responsible person for the  safety research division demonstrated a simulated car collision  controlled by computer. Qiao Shi was very interested. More  than once, he walked close to a damaged part to take a careful  look while he was listening to a briefing. The responsible  person of the safety research division said: "Indeed, Benz auto  technology and safety are the best, but their prices are a  little too high." Chairman Qiao Shi said: "So long as you pay  further attention to technology, you can gain an upper hand in  the competition all the same."</p>

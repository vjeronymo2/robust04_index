			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (15): Treat them the same as other shares - New issues This year has seen investors deluged with prospectuses from companies floating on the stock market. Not since the mid-1980s has the new-issue market been so active. Yet there is an important difference this time. Ten years ago, new issues were an easy way to make money. Many were hugely underpriced, leading to a flood of applications and big premiums over the offer price when the shares started trading. For the so-called 'stags', who applied for shares only to sell them as soon as possible, there were good profits to be made. By contrast, most investors in new issues in 1994 have suffered paper losses. New issues are priced in relation to the general level of shares, so if the market as a whole falls, as it has done since February, so will shares in recent new issues. Overall, new issues have performed no worse than the market as a whole. Yet the expectation would have been for them to perform slightly better, because new issues are priced to give a reasonable premium over the offer price when they start trading in the market. The problem has been a few disastrous flotations, where the shares have fallen sharply not long afterwards. While these flops have scared many private investors off, new issues do still have some attractions. The first is simply convenience. The Stock Exchange requires that the largest flotations must be conducted through a public offer for sale. Under an offer, anyone can apply for shares, and the process involves no more than filling in a form printed in the newspapers and sending it off with a cheque. (In smaller flotations, shares are sold via placings or intermediaries' offers, and are only available to private investors if they happen to be clients of the particular stockbrokers involved.) Another advantage of buying shares when a company floats is that there is no commission to pay. If the shares are priced at Pounds 1 each, Pounds 1 is what you pay. In theory, a more valuable saving is that the shares are priced so that they go to a premium in the market. But in the volatile conditions seen during most of 1994 this has not always happened. One of the biggest claimed selling points for new issues is that it is the least risky time in a company's life at which to invest. In preparation for flotation, a company's business and finances will have been scrutinised by its merchant bank, stockbroker and accountants. They put their names to the prospectus, and will be severely embarrassed if anything goes wrong shortly after flotation. But recent experience shows that this is very far from a guarantee. There is even an argument that flotation is a positively bad time at which to invest, because the shares are unlikely to be seriously undervalued. Those looking for bargains might be better advised to consider shares of neglected or unfashionable companies already trading on the stock market. The best policy for investors is to treat new issues no differently from other shares, and to judge them on the same basis.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Arts: Regionals to the fore The rise of regional orchestras was one of the outstanding features of the 1980s. At the weekend the London concert-halls played host to a pair of orchestras, each of which comes from a self-proclaimed 'second city' in its respective country - the NDR (North German Radio) Symphony Orchestra of Hamburg and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Both for its past and its present, Hamburg lays claim to be the cultural centre of Germany. The number of publishing houses and record companies which have their headquarters there testify to the city's importance in the arts, but its musical life struggles to rival Munich or Berlin (indeed, Berlin looks ever more dominant). It may well be that the NDR Symphony Orchestra was aiming for a higher public profile when it appointed John Eliot Gardiner as principal conductor in 1991. With Gardiner's arrival there came a recording contract, which has ranged from Brahms and Dvorak to Britten and Janacek. Unfortunately, his tenure in Hamburg looks set to end this year, after a brief stay which is rumoured to have been difficult. It has not, however, been unproductive. At its Royal Festival Hall concert on Saturday the orchestra played with a combination of clarity and intelligence that had Gardiner's stamp on it through and through. The programme consisted of two major romantic pieces: Rachmaninov's Symphonic Dances and Mahler's Fourth Symphony. Both are complex orchestral scores, in which Gardiner set out to make every note count. The razor-sharp clarity that he gets from a symphony orchestra is remarkable to the point where the Mahler became a bubbling cauldron of new and unexpected details. What I missed was sensuality in the Rachmaninov, charm in the Mahler, though Barbara Bonney was a delightfully bright-eyed soprano soloist in the latter. While the Hamburg orchestra had been in Birmingham the night before, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra had been in London, making one of its periodic appearances at the Barbican. Again there was a vocal soloist who gave a good account of herself, this time the mezzo Ann Murray, who sang Berlioz's tragic scena La Mort de Cleopatre with a firm grasp of its potential. A few years ago she would have been overparted in music like this. Now both the voice and the personality have grown in stature. Something similar might be said of the orchestra, which was in good form under Mark Elder, its principal guest conductor. Their performance of Sibelius's First Symphony also had plenty of character, as Elder dug away at the rhythms to create climaxes that became nearly obssessive in their drive. It was very different from Simon Rattle's Sibelius with his orchestra, less atmosphere, more intensity. The programme noted that Rattle's recording was on sale upstairs - rather tactlessly, I thought. Jonathan Lloyd, an English composer in his mid-40s still far too little known in the wider musical world, has fulfilled a commission from the London Philharmonic Orchestra in a way that should aid in righting the balance. Committed Lloyd-followers long ago learned to relish his music above all for its wit - achieved not through farce, hyperbole or heavily jokey contrast, but through fresh and sometimes slyly hilarious use of a highly individual musical language, in which the popular and the recherche are jostled and blended with genial sleight-of-hand. Lloyd's Waiting for Gozo, for the London Sinfonietta, and his recent score for the Hitchcock silent film Blackmail are just two examples of this 'personal' quality at its most quirkily original. Tolerance - the LPO's new big-orchestra piece, given on Thursday its premiere at the Royal Festival Hall under Franz Welser-Most - seems to me a captivating third, on an orchestral scale larger than most of his previous ensemble compositions. The title is intended to suggest the 'co-operative anarchy' that rules its scheme, with different groups of orchestral voices constantly snatching the limelight and then ceding it, and with a continual undercurrent of contrasted comment - sometimes wrily amiable, sometimes acerbic - from others. Snatches of Prokofiev-like bustle are tossed into the mixture, later to be exchanged for Tchaikovskian melodic sumptuousness and cell-like outbursts of Janacekian fractiousness. The circus imagery that Lloyd also invokes in his programme note is particularly to be sensed in the percussion punctuation: ringmaster, as it were, of an unfolding entertainment made up of many interlocked diversions. What is actually achieved beneath the amusing variety of sounds and rhythmic patterns is an unexpectedly substantial 20-minute concerto for orchestra, one which tests each department in enjoyably taxing ways. In their first go at Tolerance, Welser-Most and the LPO got round the notes efficiently enough but only intermittently conveyed the wry good humour in their connection, and in Lloyd's use of quotation and pastiche. There is room here for greater interpretative freedom, sharper responsiveness: future LPO performances, of which I hope there will be a good number, must surely help these players.</p>

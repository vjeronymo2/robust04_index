			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Record result for Italian utility Enel, Italy's state-owned electricity utility, yesterday announced record profits for 1993, in preparation for privatisation, possibly before the end of this year. The group, which is directly owned by the Italian treasury, reported a net profit of L344bn (Dollars 216m), compared with L234bn in 1992, after depreciation of L6,152bn against L6,129bn a year earlier. The gross operating margin in the group's industrial operations increased by 3.7 per cent against the background of a 0.4 per cent increase in sales and unchanged tariffs during 1993. The group said that its costs had been reduced by 4.3 per cent in the year, or 8.6 per cent in real terms. Investment in power stations during the year was 14 per cent lower than the previous year at L8,749bn, but the group said this was due to the difficulty of getting permission for new construction and the poor economic situation. The group said that the results showed Enel was economically healthy, efficient and with good growth prospects, elements which would lead to a successful sell-off.</p>

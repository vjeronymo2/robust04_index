			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Travel: A rare foray into Burma's far north - Victor Mallet visited Kachin State, an area previously closed to foreigners by the military junta We could tell they had not seen many foreigners by the way the babies puckered their faces and howled when they glimpsed our white and somewhat hairy features. Children whimpered and hid behind their mothers. Young women giggled and screamed, and, with an innocence inconceivable elsewhere in south-east Asia, dragged the white men off to be photographed alongside them and their friends. They made us bend our legs so as not to appear absurdly tall in the pictures. Kachin State, in the mountainous far north of Burma, has been closed to foreigners for 32 years by the military junta because of the war between the central government and the guerrillas of the Kachin Independence Army. Now the fighting has stopped and the two sides have signed a ceasefire. The junta decided to allow a group of journalists to fly to Myitkyina, the state capital, and visit the remote surrounding area sandwiched between China and India on the upper reaches of the Irrawaddy river. It seems we were lucky. Myitkyina - pronounced Mee-Chee-Na - is now said to be off limits again. We were lucky, too, to catch the end of the manau festival, an animist harvest ceremony of dancing which brings together thousands of merrymakers from the six branches of the Kachin race. It was banned until last year as a dangerous opportunity for the expression of Kachin nationalism. Under a structure much like a large maypole, to the sound of amplified chanting and the boom of a great drum hanging from a bamboo frame, the Kachin danced the conga-style sut-manau to ensure prosperity. Leading the dance were men wearing swords, Chinese silk robes of red and gold, and hats made of hornbill heads. The festival included a beauty contest, a Burmese pop concert, a fun-fair for children and much drinking of rice wine. It was mainly at the sports-ground, where the fair was held, that we were seized by young women as props for Kachin snapshots. The elders, on the other hand, know all about foreigners, having fought for the British and Americans against the Japanese during the second world war. Christian missionaries from the west also loom large in the history of the Kachin. 'We were semi-Neanderthal, we were mountain people, not civilised,' said Zau Nan, an enthusiastic minister at the Kachin Baptist Church in Myitkyina. 'We worshipped mountains and rivers and spirits. But by the grace of God, messengers from God came from Sweden and Germany.' Asked about the festival, he described with gusto the various kinds of manaus. But, steadfast Christian that he was, he refused to accept they were animist rituals designed to appease the spirits. Christianity is not the only purveyor of foreign influence in Kachin state. Madonna - the pop star, not the mother of Jesus - is portrayed naked but for a few jewels on her nipples in a colour poster adorning the Popa Hotel's restaurant above the railway station. Sitting at a tea shop in Myitkyina's main street, looking at passers-by on their bicycles, horse-drawn carts and army trucks, we heard Pink Floyd's The Wall from the teashop sound system. The local cinema, an upper room of somebody's house boasting a video machine and filled with clouds of cheroot smoke, was playing Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and A Bridge Too Far. Burma's generals, citing the danger of 'neo-colonialist plots', still try to keep foreign influences under control. We met a local official in Myitkyina who, we thought, might help us arrange interviews, but he was given the cold shoulder by the all-powerful military intelligence apparatus. 'The MI man is very discouraging,' the official told us. 'He said: 'You must not help them talk to anyone', and slammed the 'phone down.' This was odd: it was the government which had arranged the trip in the first place. The generals do have some friends, even foreign friends. As we waited in Rangoon for our flight to Kachin State, we were accosted by a wild-eyed American in the departure lounge. He looked like the kind of person one tries to avoid in Californian fast-food outlets for fear they will suddenly produce a lethal weapon. He was wearing a longyi, the traditional Burmese sarong, and he rounded on us - as representatives of the western media - for the supposedly unfair treatment meted out to Burma's military rulers in the international press. I could almost have sympathised, but at that moment a resident of Myitkyina to whom we had been chatting idly about life in Kachin State was hauled away for 30 minutes of interrogation for having 'spoken to tourists'. In the countryside north of Myitkyina, such unpleasantness was all but forgotten. This is a land famed for its jade mines, where much of the forest is still uncut, and where villagers still talk of catching the few remaining tigers and carrying them over the hills to sell to Chinese medicine-makers. The confluence of two rivers - one called the 'Useful', because it is navigable, the other the 'Useless' - which join to form the Irrawaddy, is a popular site for gold panners and a picnic spot for Burmese tourists. The ceasefire has made it accessible. Foreigners, however, are rarely seen. We heard giggles and screams; it was time to pose for more photographs.</p>

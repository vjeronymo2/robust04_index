			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Chang-sop] </F>   [Text] In a warm-up process for Korea's full-fledged  opening of the 140 billion dollar bond market, the Ministry of  Finance announced yesterday that from July 1, foreigners will be  able to buy non-guaranteed convertible bonds [CBs] issued by  small- and medium-sized companies listed on the Korea Stock  Exchange as well as long-term state and public bonds of which  yields are similar to international rates. The ministry said  that the combined foreign purchase of these CBs will be set at  30 percent and individual foreigners can buy up to 5 percent of  a single company CBs.    Like stock investment, foreigners seeking to buy Korean  bonds  must open an account at foreign exchange banks and securities  companies and get an investment registration card from the  regulators.    Even if foreigners have been issued an investment  registration card from Korean regulators for their stock  investment in Seoul stocks, they must separately get a card from  them for bond investment, the ministry said.    Foreigners can theoretically invest in both stocks and bonds  simultaneously from July 1. Foreigners must trade these stocks  only through the Korea Stock Exchange. But 98 percent of all  Korean bonds are traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) market.  They must sell their Korean bonds only to Koreans. Trading  among foreigners outside the exchange is prohibited, the MOF  said.    CBs issued only by small-and medium-sized firms listed on  the  Korea Stock Exchange without payment guarantee from financial  institutions will be available to foreigners. These CBs are  regarded as the most risky, unattractive and illiquid of all  bonds available here.    Non-Koreans can also buy state and public bonds that are  designated by the Securities Supervisory Board. The maturity of  these bonds is more than five years. They can not buy state and  public bonds unless the issuers make formal request to the  regulators.    All bonds foreigners buy must be kept at the Korea  Securities  Depositories, a semi-state agency which is in charge of  safekeeping all kinds of marketable securities, until they sell  them to Koreans.    Foreigners can freely remit investment money and income  accruing from their bond investments in Korea. But the  government retains the right to restrict the cash remittance  exceptionally in emergency cases, which may not take place,  ministry officials said.    Foreigners who buy CBs issued by small businesses will be  fully guaranteed to convert them into underlying equities at the  conversion date, the MOF said. But they will be told to sell  part of their holdings if the aggregate foreign stock ownership  exceeds 15 percent. Foreigners holding more than 3 percent of  any listed company will be told immediately to sell their  beyond-ceiling portion, it said.    Under the limited market-opening steps, foreigners can buy  6.9 billion won worth of CBs issued by small-and medium-sized  firms and they can initially buy 10 billion won worth of public  bonds in September, which are issued by the Chollanam-to  province to finance its container yard construction.    The amount is quite a peanut of Korea's 140 billion dollar  bond market, a Western broker here said. He and other foreign  brokers said Korea initially put on sale "rotten vegetables"  unattractive to Koreans. Fresh vegetables (guaranteed bonds  with higher return) will be off-limit to foreigners for the time  being.    Korea opened 10 percent of the stock market and announced  the  initial opening of less than 0.02 percent of the bond market.  The stock market (120 trillion won in market capitalization) is  larger than the bond market (111 trillion won).    But they added that it is meaningful that Korea finally  starts to open its bond market although they do not know when  additional bond- market openings will be made.    The government has a justifiable reason to be cautious in  the  opening of the bond market because of wide differences in  interest rates between home and abroad, government officials and  even many foreign bankers here said.    A full-scale opening will result in an influx of huge  amounts  of foreign capital, which will jeopardize the nation's monetary,  foreign exchange and macroeconomic management, a Ministry of  Finance official said.    The government has not specified when and to what extent the  bond market-opening will be made additionally. But many  analysts here view that the bond market-opening will be made  only after the domestic interest rates fall to the significant  level and the nation's foreign exchange and capital flow  restrictions are set free, possibly after 1997.</p>

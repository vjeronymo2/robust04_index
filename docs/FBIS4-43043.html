			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl, CDU  [Christian Democratic Union] chairman, has described the showing  of the CDU and CSU [Christian Social Union] in the European  election as a "very good starting position" for the forthcoming  state parliament elections and for the Bundestag election in  October. Following meetings of the CDU presidium and executive,  Kohl said in Bonn this afternoon that the CDU and CSU have  "reached an important stage." However, there are no grounds for  sounding an all-clear. In the coming weeks and months, the CDU  and CSU will have to fight for every vote, he stated. Kohl is  also confident that the Free Democratic Party will again enter  the new Bundestag.</p>

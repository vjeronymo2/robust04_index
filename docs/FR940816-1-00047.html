			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service actively solicits regulatory proposals from other tribal groups that have an interest in working cooperatively for the benefit of waterfowl and other migratory game birds. Also, tribes are encouraged to work with the Service in developing agreements for management of migratory bird resources on tribal lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that this proposed rule includes generalized regulations for both early and late season hunting. There will be a final rule published later in an August 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that will include tribal regulations for the early hunting season. The early season begins on September 1 each year and most commonly includes such species as mourning doves and white-winged doves. There will also be a final rule published in a September 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that will include regulations for late season hunting. The late season begins on or around October 1 and most commonly includes waterfowl species. In this current rulemaking, because of the compressed timeframe for establishing regulations for Indian tribes and because final frameworks dates and other specific information are not available, the regulations for many tribal hunting seasons are described in relation to the season dates, season length and limits that will be permitted when final Federal frameworks are announced for early and late season regulations. For example, the daily bag and possession limits for ducks on some areas are shown as ``Same as permitted Pacific Flyway States under final Federal frameworks,'' and limits for geese will be shown as the same that will be permitted the State(s) in which the tribal hunting area is located. The proposed frameworks for early-season regulations will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in mid-July; early-season final frameworks will be published in mid-August. Proposed late-season frameworks for waterfowl and coots will be published in mid-August, and the final frameworks for the late seasons will be published in mid-September. The Service will notify affected tribes of season dates, bag limits, etc., as soon as final frameworks are established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed earlier in this document, no action is required by tribes that wish to observe the migratory bird hunting regulations established by the State in which a reservation is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations for the fifteen tribes with proposals that meet the established criteria are shown below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, Jicarilla Indian Reservation, Dulce, New Mexico  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Jicarilla Apache Tribe has had special migratory bird hunting regulations for tribal members and nonmembers since the 1986&hyph;87 hunting season. The tribe owns all lands on the reservation and has recognized full wildlife management authority. The proposed seasons and bag limits would be more conservative than allowed by the Federal frameworks of last season and more conservative than States in the Pacific Flyway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a May 2, 1994, proposal, the tribe proposed the earliest opening date permitted Pacific Flyway States for ducks for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season and a closing date of November 30, 1994. Daily bag and possession limits also would be the same as permitted Pacific Flyway States. However, it is proposed again that no canvasbacks be allowed in the bag. Also, the goose season would continue to be closed. Other regulations specific to the Pacific Flyway guidelines for New Mexico would be in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Jicarilla Game and Fish Department gives an annual estimate of harvest, which continues to be relatively small_comparatively speaking. In the 1993&hyph;94 season, estimated duck harvest was 1323, the largest since recordkeeping began in 1986, with the greatest percentage of this made up of mallards (31 percent), gadwall (27 percent) and teal (16 percent). Because water conditions on the reservation are again excellent, another good duck production and harvest year is expected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requested regulations are essentially the same as were established last year, and the Service proposes to approve the tribe's request for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. White Mountain Apache Tribe, Fort Apache Indian Reservation, Whiteriver, Arizona  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The White Mountain Apache Tribe owns all reservation lands, and the tribe has recognized full wildlife management authority. The White Mountain Apache Tribe has requested regulations that are essentially unchanged from those agreed to for the 1993&hyph;94 hunting year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hunting zone for waterfowl continues to be restricted and is described as: the entire length of the Black and Salt Rivers forming the southern boundary of the reservation; the White River, extending from the Canyon Day Stockman Station to the Salt River; and all stock ponds located within Wildlife Management Units 4, 6 and 7. All other waters of the reservation would be closed to waterfowl hunting for the 1994&hyph;95 season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tribe is proposing a continuous duck, coot, merganser, gallinule and moorhen hunting season, with an opening date of November 12, 1994, and a closing date of January 8, 1995. The tribe proposes a daily duck bag limit of 3, which can have no more than: 1 redhead; 2 canvasbacks; 1 pintail; and 1 hen mallard. The daily bag limit for mergansers is 3. The daily bag limit for coots, gallinules and moorhens would be 25 singly, or in the aggregate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For geese, the season is proposed to extend from November 12, 1994, through January 8, 1995. Hunting would be limited to Canada geese, and the daily bag limit is 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Season dates for band-tailed pigeons and mourning doves would run concurrently from September 2 through September 11, 1994, in Wildlife Management Units 7 and 10, only. Proposed daily bag limits for band-tailed pigeons and mourning doves would be 3 and 8, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

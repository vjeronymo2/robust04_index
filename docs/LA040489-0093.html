			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE FIRM IN $10-MILLION STOCK SWAP;  </P> <P> DENSE-PAC TO ACQUIRE COMPETITOR  </P> <P> In a move to expand its European sales, Dense-Pac Microsystems, a Garden Grove  computer microchip maker, has agreed to acquire a European competitor in a  stock swap valued at roughly $10 million.  </P> <P> Under the merger agreement, Dense-Pac will acquire all the stock of  Scotland-based Hybrid Memory Products in exchange for issuing 8 million new  Dense-Pac shares to the Scottish firm's stockholders.  </P> <P> The two companies are expected to have combined sales of more than $25 million  for the year ended February, 1990, Dense-Pac Chairman James G. Turner said.  </P> <P> Dense-Pac has been trying to establish a presence in Europe. Earlier this year,  the firm announced the acquisition of its European affiliate, EMM Dense-Pac  Ltd.  </P> <P> William M. Stowell, Dense-Pac's chief financial officer, said Hybrid's  experience in Europe will help in improving the profitability of the EMM  operation.  </P> <P> Likewise, Dense-Pac will play a role in boosting sales in the United States of  commercial products made by Hybrid's U.S. subsidiary, San Diego-based Mosaic  Semiconductor, he said.  </P> <P> Less than 10% of Dense-Pac's present sales are in Europe. After the  acquisition, which is subject to the signing of a definitive agreement, more  than 40% of the sales of the combined firm will come from Europe, Stowell said.  </P> <P> Dense-Pac and Hybrid have complementary product lines and are strong in  different markets, he said. Dense-Pac produces custom memory chips, mostly for  U.S. defense customers. Hybrid does most of its business in Europe and is  stronger in the commercial, industrial and aerospace markets.  </P> <P> Since emerging from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1987, Dense-Pac  has been on the financial mend. The company earned $821,000 on revenue of $6  million in fiscal 1988.  </P> <P> It expects to earn about $900,000 on revenue of $7 million for its fiscal 1989  year that ended Feb. 28, Stowell said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE COMPANIES AT A GLANCE  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:3.54IN:3.54IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Dense-Pac Microsystems  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Hybrid Memory Products  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Headquarters:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Garden Grove  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Scotland  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Employees:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 55  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> not available  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revenue:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> $7 million *  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> $11 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> year ended 2/28/89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> year ended 3/31/89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net income:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> $900,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> $1.5 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Chief executive:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> James G.

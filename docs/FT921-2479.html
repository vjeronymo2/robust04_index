			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: South Korea eases rules to lure foreigners THE South Korean Securities Supervisory Board (SSB) has relaxed stock market registration requirements which had barred investments by overseas unit trusts, investment trusts, pension funds and non-limited companies, Reuter reports from Seoul. 'This is to actively solicit foreign investment and promote the opening of the stock market,' the SSB said. South Korean rules initially excluded all but individual foreign investors and foreign corporations from investing in the market, which was opened to limited direct foreign investment on January 3. However, South Korea has gradually relaxed the rules, permitting foreign governments and certain pension funds to invest. A Finance Ministry official said 828 foreign investors had registered as of March 17. In an effort to generate liquidity, the Finance Ministry also announced that country funds would now be permitted to increase their capital and local investment trusts would be permitted to offer new investment products. The Korea Fund, the Korea Europe Fund and the Korea Asia Fund, capitalised at a total of Dollars 360m, will be permitted to increase their capital by Dollars 50m each.</p>

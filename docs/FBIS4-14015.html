			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>   [Text] The Palestinians have started preparing for  elections to the Palestinian self-government council. A  committee on general and municipal elections has recently  started operating at Orient House, the Palestinian headquarters  in East Jerusalem.    The committee, headed by Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, deputy head of  the Palestinian delegation to the Washington negotiations, is  working on the structure and powers of the council and on the  manner in which the elections will be held. The committee  members, some of whom are lawyers, represent the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip.    The Palestinian Center for Statistics, set up several months  ago in Jerusalem, has started drafting lists of Palestinian  residents in the territories which will help in the preparation  of voters lists.    The elections committee is about to send 30 Palestinian  academics to Germany to study the issues of general and  municipal elections. The studies, sponsored by the Germans, will  include the management and conduct of elections, methods of  defining constituencies, and so on. The course will start at  the beginning of June and will last three weeks. At the end of  the course, the academics will return and serve as instructors  in local classes.    According to the Declaration of Principles [DOP] of 13  September 1993, general elections for the Palestinian  self-government council are to be held in the Gaza Strip and the  West Bank nine months after the DOP goes into effect and after  the negotiations on the council and the elections are completed.  According to the DOP timetable, the elections were supposed to  be held in July but, due to the delay in the completion of the  negotiations on the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho,  the elections will probably be postponed.    Palestinian sources have reported that municipal elections  may be held in the territories before the elections to the  autonomy council take place.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Swallowfield rises 24% to Pounds 522,000 SWALLOWFIELD, the aerosol and cosmetics manufacturer, reported pre-tax profits ahead 24 per cent at Pounds 522,000, against Pounds 421,000, in the 24 weeks to June 19. Turnover rose 40 per cent from Pounds 8.6m to Pounds 12m. Mr Tony Wardell, managing director, said that within the encouraging performance the results of individual companies were mixed. Aerosols continued to provide most of the turnover and profits and reported a 30 per cent rise in volume but only 12 per cent in value. In cosmetics, the UK side increased profits but the Belgian-based manufacturer had yet to be turned round. The pre-tax figure was after increased interest charges of Pounds 344,000 (Pounds 256,000). Earnings per share were 2.6p (2.2p). The interim dividend is held at 2.2p.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed notes will be linked to either the J.P. Morgan Commodity Index or the J.P. Morgan Commodity Excess Return Index. Both indexes measure the return from an investment in the same 11 liquid industrial futures contracts. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange states that the JPMCI and JPMCIX are identical in all respects except for the incorporation of ``collateral return,'' as more fully described below, into the JPMCI. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Both Indexes are constructed as an arithmetic average of commodity returns, and will be rebalanced monthly to maintain constant dollar weights. Because the Exchange and the underwriter believe the Indexes are identical in all respects (with the exception of incorporating collateral return), they desire the flexibility to determine at the time of offering, based upon investor demand and market conditions, which of the Indexes it will utilize for valuing the notes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The commodities underlying the Index and their approximate weightings are: aluminum (9%), copper (8%), nickel (2%), zinc (3%), heating oil (10%), natural gas (7%), unleaded gas (5%), WTI Light Sweet Crude (33%), gold (15%), silver (5%) and platinum (3%). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The JPMCIX and JPMCI are designed to capture both ``price'' return and ``roll'' return from an investment in commodities. Price return, or ``spot'' return, is the component of return that arises from changes in constant maturity nearby prices. Roll return is the component of return that arises from rolling a long position through time in a sloping forward price curve environment. When nearby futures contracts are more expensive than longer dated contracts, roll return is positive. When the reverse applies, roll return is negative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to price fluctuations, the relative weights of the Index components will be rebalanced monthly to maintain the appropriate dollar weighting. In addition, due to the periodic expiration of the futures contracts used to compute the Index value, it also is necessary to ``roll'' out of expiring contracts and into the new nearby contracts. To minimize possible pricing volatility arising from conducting the ``roll'' on a single business day, the substitution of the new contract for the old is accomplished with 20% of the roll volume transacted on each of the five subsequent business days after the rebalance date. The futures contract to be used for monthly rebalancing and rolling of each commodity will be the nearest designated futures contract to be used in the appropriate Index, with a termination of trading date not earlier than ten business days into the following month. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For energy and base metals, the new and old contracts will be different. For precious metals, the new and old contracts may be the same contract because of the absence of a designated contract for every month. In this instance, rebalancing and rolling will only involve an adjustment of the amount held of the old contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The JPMCI is a ``total return'' index based upon the same eleven commodities as the JPMCIX which, in addition to measuring price return and roll return, is also comprised of collateral return. The Amex states that collateral return is the risk free component of commodity returns afforded by full collateralization of the notional value of futures positions with Treasury bills. It measures the return that an investor would receive if the investor were to fully margin a futures position ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  post 100% margin) with Treasury bills. According to the underwriter, some investors may choose not to fully collateralize commodity investments, but because stocks and bonds are collateralized investments, it is useful to treat commodities on the same basis to compare risk-return performance. Therefore, the underwriter believes that collateralization permits meaningful comparison with traditional assets in a portfolio allocation framework. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The return based upon the Treasury bill rate is calculated using a 13 week T-bill yield, compounded daily at the decompounded discount rate of the most recent weekly U.S. Treasury bill auction as found in the H.15 (519) report published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, on the full (100%) value of the index. Interest accrues on an actual day basis over weekends and holidays at the previous day's rate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Amendment No. 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

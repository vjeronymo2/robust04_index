			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEATH OF A DRIVE-IN;  </P> <P> PICKWICK THEATER SHUTS DOWN, ENDING AN ERA FOR BURBANK MOVIEGOERS AND FILM  MAKERS  </P> <P> The closing of the Pickwick Drive-In Theatre not only marks the end of an era  for Burbank moviegoers, but for movie makers who had used the outdoor theater  for premieres and as a backdrop for films.  </P> <P> The Pickwick, in the 1100 block of West Alameda Avenue, was a prime location  for filming because of its proximity to Burbank Studios, which houses Walt  Disney Co., Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros.  </P> <P> "It was convenient, just a few blocks away," Ron Chan, field publicist for  Warner Bros., said. "It was easier to go there than other places."  </P> <P> Over the years, the Pickwick has been used to film scenes for such movies as  "Blue Thunder," starring Roy Scheider; "Christine," featuring Keith Gordon; and  "St. Ives," with Charles Bronson and Jacqueline Bisset. More recently, the  theater was used to film a segment for the television series "The Outsiders."  </P> <P> "I had to hold up demolition for a week so they could come in here and do their  filming," said A. Terrance Dickens, director of real estate for Pacific  Theatres Corp., which owns the Pickwick.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Closed Sept. 10  </P> <P> Dickens said the theater, which closed Sept. 10, will be torn down within the  next few weeks to make way for, among other things, a 55,000-square-foot Vons  Pavilion shopping center.  </P> <P> The 800-car Pickwick, at one time Burbank's only theater, is the second  drive-in in the Valley to be shut down in the last two months. With the closing  of the Pickwick and the Sepulveda Drive-In on Aug. 13, only two outdoor  theaters are left in the Valley and seven in all of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> "It's sad," Dickens said. But, he added, "things change."  </P> <P> Indeed, times have changed. A May 12, 1949, flyer advertised the grand opening  of the Pickwick: "Clean, healthful entertainment under the stars for the entire  family," the ad boasted, all for a mere 65 cents. The pictures featured on the  theater's opening night were the action adventure "Red Stallion in the Rockies"  and the Dorothy Lamour comedy "The Lucky Stiff."  </P> <P> The theater was charging $4.50 for adults and $2.50 for teen-agers when it  closed and still was losing money, officials said.  </P> <P> "We had banners, free drinks and popcorn . . . I remember Natalie Wood was on  hand for the opening," said Frank Diaz, a veteran Pacific employee. Wood was  only 12 at the time but already a movie star.  </P> <P> Diaz said the most memorable event at the theater was Warner Bros.' 1974  premiere of Mel Brooks' western comedy "Blazing Saddles."  </P> <P> At the invitation of the theater, about 250 guests -- including the stars of  the film, Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder -- came on horseback. Drive-in  speakers were attached to saddle pommels and a "horsepitality bar" was set up  in front of the huge outdoor screen.  </P> <P> "It was quite a promotion," Diaz said. "People got up on their horses and  watched the movie. It was a lot of fun."  </P> <P> The unusual premiere was the brainchild of the late Warner Bros. publicist  Marty Weiser.  </P> <P> "It's legend around here," Chan said. "Mel Brooks was so pleased with the  promotion that he wrote a letter praising Marty" for coming up with the idea.  </P> <P> Chan, like others, said he is disappointed with the decision to close the  Pickwick.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Really Sad'  </P> <P> "It's really sad that Pacific is going to tear it down," Chan said. "I hate to  see it go because it is a landmark. It's too bad we have to sacrifice  historical things for the sake of progress."  </P> <P> The main reason for the Pickwick's closing, Diaz said, is that single-screen  theaters are no longer profitable. Successful drive-ins, as well as  conventional theaters, are multiscreen, he said.  </P> <P> "The Pickwick sits on about 9 acres . . . Any single-screen drive-in is pretty  much limited as an entertainment venue because there is no way to expand," Diaz  said.  </P> <P> For years, the Pickwick was the only place in Burbank for big-screen  entertainment. That changed in 1988 when an AMC 10 Theatre opened near the  downtown intersection of First Street and Palm Avenue.  </P> <P> But the Pickwick, Pacific officials said, already had experienced a significant  decline in business the year before with the opening of the 18-screen Universal  Cineplex in Universal City, a short drive from Burbank.  </P> <P> "It was very successful over the years," Diaz said. "But business dropped off  in recent years."  </P> <P> The Pickwick hosted its last premiere in 1987. The screening of Alex Cox's  "Straight to Hell" drew such stars as Dennis Hopper and Emilio Estevez, both of  whom camped out with friends in a 1960s Ford Falcon. Actors Buck Henry, Shelley  Duvall and Ed Harris also attended the screening.  </P> <P> Diaz said the two remaining Valley drive-ins, the Winnetka Drive-In and the Van  Nuys Drive-In, owned by Pacific, have survived because they are multiscreen  theaters.  </P> <P> "Between the two theaters, there are nine screens," he said. "They are doing  very well. They are very successful."  </P> <P> Still, some moviegoers insist, there was something special about the Pickwick.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Saw Rolling Hills  </P> <P> "At the Pickwick, you not only saw the screen but the rolling hills all around  it. Nowhere else in the Valley can you get that kind of view," said Leslie  Brogan, a former Burbank resident who attended one of the theater's last  showings.  </P> <P> Brogan, 28, said she had gone to the Pickwick for "as long as I can remember. I  would go there with my high school friends. Sunday was the popular day to go.  But we wouldn't watch the movies too much."  </P> <P> Brogan admitted that the old drive-in was not as popular in recent years as it  once had been. She said "only about 25 cars showed up" at the theater's last  screening, a double feature of "Turner and Hooch" and "Indiana Jones and the  Last Crusade."  </P> <P> "It's a shame," Brogan said. "Who knows, maybe 10 years from now, there won't  be any drive-ins."  </P> <P> Burbank resident Rachel Smith, 18, said she will miss the Pickwick.  </P> <P> "They're knocking down a piece of history," Smith said. "I didn't go there very  often, but the times I went it was very groovy."  </P></p>

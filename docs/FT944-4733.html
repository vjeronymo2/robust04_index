			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Slow but sure progress on electricity liberalisation Sir, Your editorial on 'Electricity gridlock' (December 5) raises a number of interesting points, but fails to recognise that progress is being made after several years of stalemate. The two energy councils in 1994 have led to a positive and formal accord among member states on two of the three main parts of the electricity liberalisation directive. On the third key area - competition in national markets - the Commission has already tried to resist the French concept of the single buyer, as you suggest, since it was put forward earlier this year as an alternative to third party access. However, negotiations in the council on an internal electricity market have been so difficult, for all the reasons you mention, that the member states are anxious to find solutions, even if they are far from perfect. At last week's energy council, they asked the Commission to look more carefully at the anticipated consequences of the side-by-side application of third party access and the single buyer system. The Commission is therefore bound to make an objective study and report back to the council. Your article also touches on the need for regulation and the possibility of an energy chapter. There is a crucial point here about the UK government's position. The UK has argued forcibly for an internal energy market, yet has refused to countenance any new Union competences in energy. As the only member state more or less self-sufficient in energy resources, this stance may be all too clear. But, how can the UK expect the Union to sign up to an open and liberal market in energy and not recognise the legitimate concerns of other member states to have some joint EU safeguards for security and stability of supply to customers?

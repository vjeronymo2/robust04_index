			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Matsushita profits fall 65.6% due to lower domestic sales MATSUSHITA, Japan's biggest producer of consumer electronics, revealed the full extent of the fall in Japanese consumer demand when it yesterday announced a 65.6 per cent drop in profits. Pre-tax profits for the half-year fell to Y67.9bn (Pounds 361m) from Y197.48bn a year earlier. Sales fell 4.3 per cent to Y3,510.7bn, the group's first sales decline in six years. from Y3,670bn. An increase in depreciation charges affected net-profits, which fell 78.9 per cent to Y16.4bn. Operating profits fell 57 per cent to Y87.5bn on foreign exchange losses. The announcement follows last month's parent company results, where pre-tax profits fell 51 per cent, and the company announced a 10 per cent cut in directors' salaries. Matsushita was burdened with heavy losses at Matsushita Refrigeration, the fridge component maker, and JVC, the audio equipment affiliate. The group booked servicing costs of Y8.1bn due to defects found in Matsushita Refrigeration's fridge compressors. Other costs totalling Y15.5bn included losses stemming from Matsushita's acquisition of MCA of the US. Depreciation costs totalled Y173.5bn, a 9 per cent increase. The company said while domestic sales fell 7 per cent, overseas sales fell only 1 per cent. Sales of video equipment fell 12 per cent to Y735.8bn, while audio equipment sales dropped 5 per cent to Y287.5bn. Sales of communication and industrial equipment was one of the few bright spots, rising 1 per cent to Y841.6bn, while electronic components remained flat at Y426.5bn. The group's entertainment revenues fell 1 per cent to Y281.2bn, where MCA posted sales of Y212.2bn, a 3 per cent drop. However, Matsushita said in dollar terms, MCA's sales rose 2 per cent. The company spent Y171.5bn on first-half capital investments, a 45 per cent fall, while research and development spending fell 2 per cent to Y205bn. For the full year to March, the Matsushita group has been forced to revise its previous projections down sharply due to severe domestic conditions. The company forecasts a 53 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y170bn, down from a previous projection of Y385bn, on a 5 per cent drop in sales to Y7,070bn, previously forecast at Y7,500bn.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Gevorok Bagdasaryan, chairman of the </F> Permanent Commission on Questions of Defense and Internal  Affairs of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Armenia, by  Manvel Mkrtchyan; place and date not given: "If the Prestige of  the Military Were High...."]    [Text] As we have learned, Mr. Bagdasaryan recently  returned from the United States where some physicians who are  our compatriots conducted a complicated heart operation on him.  The operation was successful and now his condition is quite  satisfactory.    [Mkrtchyan] Let us get one thing clear first: Was this form  of recruitment agreed upon by the Ministry of Defense and your  commission? Are you not afraid that recruitment using mass raids  will compromise the very idea and increase the alarm in the  society while simultaneously creating occasion for various legal  infractions?    [Bagdasaryan] On 27 March of this year the government of the  Republic of Armenia made a decision approving the list of  officials not subject to being drafted for three-month active  duty training. Everyone else, actually, by a decision of the  government and the Ministry of Defense, is subject to the draft.  But there is one "but" here.... The government is not  coordinating all issues with the Supreme Council, particularly  with our commission or the Commission on Legal Questions. And  this is the reason mistakes have been made. I cannot say right  now whether there are instructions granting military  commissariats and the military police the right to arrange raids  and other such actions. So far we have received no written  protests from citizens to study them and set them in motion. We,  like many others, learned about this from conversations with  friends and acquaintances. According to these conversations  there have been trading sessions on the spot, and in dollars or  Russian rubles. Incidentally, there was a discussion of the  aforementioned negative phenomena in the Presidium of the  Supreme Council as well, but, I repeat, so far we have received  no written complaints about the commission's orders.    By one of the resolutions adopted last year the Supreme  Council made significant changes in the Law on Military Duty.  They stipulate that if an individual with a military obligation  does not show up at the military commissariat within three days  after receipt of his notice, he may be held criminally liable.  In other words, there is no need for additional notices or  warnings. But, as we can see, the organizers of the raids have  decided to take the shortest path. They decided not to wait  until the draftees start evading the draft before they resorted  to repressive measures in keeping with the law, but wanted to  solve the problem at once, with the help of raids. I think that  such forms of mobilization are unacceptable.    [Mkrtchyan] Mr. Bagdasaryan, let us take a look at the  problem from the other side. As we know, the state minister for  questions of defense, when summing up the results of the  preceding recruitment, noted with satisfaction that when  conducting it they managed to achieve extremely high indicators.  The legitimate question arises: If it is possible to achieve  such results using the structure of military commissariats, what  brought about the use of such "unacceptable," as you put it,  methods during the last conscription?    [Bagdasaryan] I find it difficult to answer this question  and  I can only give my personal opinion. We have lived through a  difficult winter and some of our citizens are outside the  republic. This probably explains why the Ministry of Defense  resorted to extreme measures to provide for mobilization of the  necessary number of reservists.    [Mkrtchyan] The present military-political situation shows  that our state will be forced to conduct large-scale  mobilizations in the future as well. What is the legal basis for  conducting them and how good is it?    [Bagdasaryan] The law on military duty regulates all of  these  questions. It has a special chapter devoted to the reserve and  it talks about both the time periods and rights of the draftee  and about the social protection for his family and everything  else. So far we have received no proposals to make an amendment  to the law and so far we see not need to make it either stricter  or more lenient. I repeat that we too are dissatisfied with the  form in which it is conducted...so far that is all.    [Mkrtchyan] We assume that the reasons for the panic that  arose during the time of the mobilization and the evasion of the  service go much deeper than people sometimes try to indicate. In  this case the most important task is to provide for a favorable  social and political atmosphere, level of psychological  preparation, etc. Frequently one gets the impression that state  propaganda, especially on television, does not see this as its  task. And one wonders whether this is intentional or the result  of inability. How do you assess the activity of state propaganda?    [Bagdasaryan] The gap that formed after the fall of  communist  ideology is now being filled with whatever is at hand. There is  no clear-cut state ideology that could fill the vacuum. Possibly  this is the reason why many of our citizens, including in  administrative positions, are lacking ideological approaches. In  my opinion, this explains the panic that arose. If this gap were  filled, say, with the national ideology of Gagerin Nzhde, I do  not think that we would be seeing such phenomena. If the people  had an awareness that every Armenian family must have one  military serviceman, such a panic would not have existed. If the  prestige of the military had been high, there would not have  been this kind of panic at all. But to tell the truth, I find it  difficult to accuse anybody of the situation that developed. It  seems to me that we are all to blame. And I watch almost no  television because of a lack of electricity.</p>

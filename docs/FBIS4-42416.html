			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 2 (AFP) -- The International Committee  of the Red Cross [ICRC] called Thursday [2 June] for a ban on  the some types of "inhuman" weapons currently being developed, a  statement said.    In particular the ICRC is concerned about laser weapons  which  can blind, arms using microwave and infrared technology, and  allegedly nonlethal chemical weapons.    The call for the ban came after an ICRC-organized meeting of  experts Tuesday and Wednesday to consider the dangers of certain  types of weapons, some of which have already been produced.    The experts expressed concern at the possibility of such  weaponry coming into the hands of terrorists or criminals, in  particular in the case of laser arms.    The experts will draw up a report detailing their  conclusions, to be presented to a conference of government  experts to debate amending the 1980 UN convention on arms. The  conference will be held at the end of the year.</p>

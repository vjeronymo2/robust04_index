			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Records: Fireside music The most delightful moment at this year's Gramophone record awards came when Sir Georg Solti, presenting one of the prizes, admitted that he had never heard the piece of music in question, although he added smartly that as it had won, it must be good. The category was highest-selling classical disc of the year. The winner was Gorecki's Third Symphony. Only a couple of years ago Gorecki was a name that almost nobody in the West knew. How far the vast popularity of his symphony is due to the simultaneous arrival on the scene of Classic FM is no doubt a topic for discussion in the marketing departments of every music organisation in the country. It seems unlikely that it was wholly coincidence (excerpts from the symphony were playing the very first time I tuned in to Classic FM). At any rate, there are now large numbers of listeners out there who have decided that they like this form of transcendentalism in music and Radio 3 is evidently keen to get its hands on them. The BBC Symphony Orchestra has already given us some Kancheli; next January it turns its attention to Tavener, the other composer to have scored a hit in this area. For its two concerts in Radio 3's Celebration of Polish Arts and Culture it turned inevitably to - yes, Gorecki. The second of the pair, on Thursday, invited Alexander Lazarev, the orchestra's Principal Guest Conductor, to perform the Third Symphony. (A tame conductor is a necessity, as no other would surely be prepared to spend time on the piece.) How disappointed the programme-planners must have been. Half a million people have bought the CD, but only about 1,000 could be lured to a half-empty Royal Festival Hall to hear it live. It seems to me that Gorecki has produced a new phenomenon: a symphony for the home consumer. Heard after a hard day at the office, the music is no doubt ideal for relaxing, gently transporting the listener off to a higher plane. Sound-bites work well, too; the couple of minutes I caught on Classic FM were enough to make anybody want to hear more. But trying to keep concentration going in the concert-hall for nearly an hour on nothing but endlessly repeated common chords is another matter. No wonder Gorecki's supporters stayed away. To provide the Polish coupling, Gorecki's Third Symphony was preceded by Szymanowski's Fourth, as much a piano concerto as a symphony really (Janina Fialkowska was the bright soloist). The programme-note helpfully pointed to the composers' shared interest in Polish folk melodies, but it is unlikely the audience will have perceived much in common between them. Szymanowski is as restless as Gorecki is static and the Fourth Symphony darts about unconvincingly. The orchestra sounded unhappy with it.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / UK Gilts: Negative factors set to hold back upturn ALONG with the green shoots often come some creepy crawlies. These thoughts bucked up the gilt market last week, as indications strengthened that any UK upturn will be held back by negative factors, such as high household debt and economic weakness across the rest of Europe. Nervousness that the UK economy is still sickly was due partly to the belief that the US recovery might be slackening, a factor that would further depress export markets. Also, the latest money supply data indicated consumer spending might not be growing by as much as some economists believe. These factors arrested the sharp decline in gilt prices that had been evident the week before. Yields at the short end fell up to 10 basis points on the week, with a corresponding increase in prices, while yields for longer-dated securities were little changed. An important factor holding up prices at the short end were the shock defeats by the Conservative party in the Newbury and county council elections. The inference that the government might be forced into a further cut in base rates to lift its sagging popularity led to some buying support for gilts of less than 10 years maturity. Base rates have been held at 6 per cent since late January, even though many industrialists and consumers are still calling for easier borrowing conditions. At the longer end of the yield curve, there was a firm ceiling over price rises. Investors were worried by theories that the large volume of gilts likely to be on offer over the next year to fund the big government deficit will push down prices. In particular, the Bank of England is thought likely to announce in the next few days another Pounds 3bn gilt auction for later this month, possibly for stock of about 10 years in maturity. The thought of another auction so soon after the one last month - which attracted relatively little interest from important groups of gilt investors - acted to damp investor spirits. M0, the narrow measure of the money supply which mainly comprises notes and coins in circulation, grew in the year to last month by a seasonally adjusted 4.8 per cent, after year-on-year growth of 4.9 per cent in March. This was the first fall in the year-on-year increase in M0 since December, and indicated that any upturn may be weak. 'There are few doubts that the recovery has started but there is a question mark over its robustness,' said Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. Assuming such sentiments continue to be in evidence in the next few weeks, then gilt prices could yet see a new spurt. Investors will find out today from the Central Statistical Office how much extra credit consumers took on in March, an indicator that will provide clues as to the strength of any upturn. The consensus among City economists is that this figure will be about Pounds 90m. Also, the gilt market will be watching for today's release of the figures for producer price inflation for last month. Output price inflation remained stable at a year-on-year rate of around 3.4 per cent in the second half of last year. After registering 3.7 per cent in both February and March, it may show a rise to 3.9 per cent in the year to April, according to the City consensus. Such a rise would be worrying for many in the gilt market on the basis that this would indicate an upsurge in demand pressures. However, at a retail price level Mr Julian Callow, a bonds specialist at Kleinwort Benson, remains optimistic that rising prices are some way from becoming a problem. He calculates that in the year to last month the increase in the retail prices index will turn out to be just 1.5 per cent, after 1.9 per cent in March, while the figure for the RPI less mortgage costs will fall to 3.1 per cent from 3.5 per cent. While weak underlying demand pressures are one factor behind Mr Callow's bullishness over inflation, another is the change in the RPI caused by the introduction of the council tax in place of the more expensive poll tax. If Mr Callow's arithmetic is proved correct when the RPI announcement for April is made a week on Friday , this will probably give a strong boost to gilts.</p>

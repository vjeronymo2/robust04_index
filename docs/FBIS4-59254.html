			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>   [Text] The Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] Central  Command has held a meeting in the presence of the  representatives of this alliance in Lebanon. The discussion  dealt with the serious repercussions the Cairo agreement will  have on the Palestinians in the diaspora.    A statement issued by the conferees emphasized that this  agreement endangers the status of the diaspora Palestinians,  particularly in the camps in Lebanon. In this respect, the  secretaries general of the 10 Palestinian factions called on the  Lebanese Government and the Lebanese nationalist and Islamic  forces to enhance the cohesion and the unity of blood enshrined  by the Lebanese and Palestinian people, and to defend the  Palestinian people's right to repatriation. In their message to  the Lebanese Government, the factions reiterated their rejection  of resettlement in Lebanon. The 10 factions said they hope the  Lebanese Government will help the Palestinian people in Lebanon  solve the problems they face, treat Palestinians as equals with  the Lebanese concerning job opportunities, and reconstruct the  camps after the United Nations Relief and Works Agency [UNRWA]  reduced its aid to these camps. The factions called on UNRWA to  continue its task of providing various services to the  Palestinian people.    Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]  sources said other meetings will be held in Lebanon between the  10 factions, the Lebanese Government, and UNRWA representatives  to tackle these issues.</p>

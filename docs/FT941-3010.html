			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Moscow fights for Kazakh oil share Russia has increased the pressure on Kazakhstan and its western partners to give Moscow a stake in two of the largest energy projects in the former Soviet Union. The Russian targets are the Tengiz oil field being developed by Chevron of the US and the Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) Karachaganak gas development being negotiated by British Gas and Agip of Italy. 'The Russians want an equity share (of the Chevron project) and they're going to squeeze till they get it,' said a western diplomat in Alma Ata, the Kazakh capital. Moscow argues it has 'an inherent proprietary interest' in natural resources discovered during the Soviet period, says Mr Ben Miller, director of the consultancy firm Ernst &amp; Young in Alma Ata. This applies to Tengiz, where Chevron plans gradually to expand production from 67,000 barrels a day to 700,000 b/d by 2010. But Russia has restricted exports to just over 20,000 b/d, claiming the presence of the corrosive contaminant mercoptan makes larger shipments unacceptable. The two sides have also failed to agree over the route of a new pipeline to carry the increased volume of exports. Western diplomats say Mr Yuri Shafrannik, the Russian energy minister, has made it clear that Russia also wants a share of Karachaganak, located in northern Kazakhstan near the Russian border. They say British Gas and Agip would probably have to reduce their prospective shareholdings to accommodate a Russian stake. This would be a departure from a precedent set in neighbouring Azerbaijan, where Russian political pressure recently caused the Baku government to accept a dilution of its stake in a consortium being led by British Petroleum to accommodate the Russian integrated oil company, Lukoil. A Kazakh official said it might offer a 3-4 per cent equity stake to Transneft, a Russian state-owned pipeline operator. But several western oil executives in Alma Ata said the final stake was likely to be closer to 10 per cent. The prospect is making some western executives nervous. 'We've already got so many problems that if Russia does get these shares it's going to scare a lot of people,' said one.</p>

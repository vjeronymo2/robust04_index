			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Norwich Union suspends pensions direct sales force Norwich Union, one of the UK's leading insurers, yesterday suspended 800 agents - including its entire life and pensions direct sales force - for a month after the industry's regulator identified breakdowns in management control. The move means that from midnight last night no one in the company's direct sales force will be able to give financial advice to a customer until he or she has successfully completed a re-training programme. Lautro, the life industry's self-regulatory organisation, prompted the suspensions after it uncovered shortcomings in the way Norwich Union was implementing higher training and competency standards which took effect in April 1993. This is the first time a financial regulator has taken such a drastic step against a large company. Possible disciplinary action, including fines, against the company is a separate matter for consideration by Lautro. Mr Philip Scott, Norwich Union life and pensions general manager, said he did not believe any customers had been placed at a disadvantage, since the company operated a quality control programme separate from the process of selling, to ensure that appropriate products were sold. Some 600 of the agents suspended are in Norwich Union's direct sales force, and the remaining 200 work for companies which are the life insurer's appointed representatives. Norwich Union's sales force is paid entirely on commission but Mr Scott insisted that the system of payment was 'largely irrelevant' to selling practices. The direct sales force accounts for about 10 per cent of Norwich Union's new life and pensions business. Mr Scott said that the company's loss from the month when they would not be selling would be 'relatively small'. Mr Allan Bridgewater, group chief executive, emphasised that the suspension did not affect Norwich Union's business through independent financial advisers and Leeds Permanent Building Society. Lautro's action comes after it warned it would take a tough line with companies which failed to meet its standards. Mr Scott said the weaknesses found by Lautro in October had already been picked up in an internal review. Some 320 sales agents had already left since the review began last summer, he said. Seventeen managers, including the national sales manager for direct business, have also left. Lex, Page 22 Results, Page 25</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Armco to take Dollars 205m charge ARMCO, the US steel group, said yesterday it would take a Dollars 205m pre-tax charge against third-quarter earnings to cover the sale of several businesses. The company has completed the sale of part of its Worldwide Grinding Systems unit to Leggett &amp; Platt, its partner in the joint venture, and announced an agreement to sell the remainder. The move is part of Armco's strategy of concentrating on specialty steels. The group has been steadily selling non-strategic businesses after years of being one of the most diversified US steel companies. Armco now focuses on manufacturing specialty flat rolled steel, grinding systems, carbon steel and fabricated products. It has completed the sale of Worldwide Grinding Systems' 50 per cent stake in several wire-drawing operations, for Dollars 33m in cash. The rest of the business is expected to be sold to Bain Capital, a Boston-based investment firm, in partnership with members of the unit's management, for Dollars 80m, excluding post-closing adjustments. The sale agreement is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Worldwide Grinding Systems produces grinding balls, rods, castings and process control systems for the mining industry. It also produces high-carbon wire rods. The business had sales of Dollars 400.4m last year and underlying operating income of Dollars 10.1m, stripping out special charges of Dollars 19.1m and income from joint ventures of Dollars 13.8m. Armco expects gross cash proceeds of nearly Dollars 170m from the Worldwide Grinding divestment, and from the previously-announced sale of its Brazilian strip operations. About Dollars 24m will be used to retire debt and other obligations associated with Worldwide Grinding. The company posted a loss of Dollars 25.2m, including extraordinary items, in the 1992 third quarter. It said Dollars 150m of its 1993 third-quarter special charge would cover the disposal of a number of other businesses in its steel and fabricated products interests.</p>

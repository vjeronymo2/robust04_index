			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / French power group pledges cuts in tariffs and debt THE FRENCH power utility, Electricite de France, will today promise to cut tariffs by 1.25 per cent a year up to 1996 and to reduce its indebtedness by nearly a quarter over the next four years. These commitments are contained in the latest EdF long-term contract with its owner, the French state, which will be signed today. EdF officials say they are the fruit of considerable productivity gains in recent years which leave the French utility well-poised to make further inroads into the electricity markets of its neighbours. EdF already exports about 12 per cent (54bn kilowatt hours in 1991) of its electrical output generated in France, chiefly to the UK, Italy and Switzerland. It has contracts that will push these exports up to 70bn kilowatt hours by 1997. EdF said yesterday it had no plans to increase direct exports further, but rather to expand into foreign joint ventures in Spain and the eastern states of Germany. This is partly because of sensitivity over its exports, particularly in Britain, with which EdF has a cross-Channel link. The company stressed that its progressive 1993-96 price reductions would be in its domestic market, and that it did not disclose what it charged for its power exports. But the latter could be very competitively priced, given the productivity gains EdF claims. Edf will be taking advantage of a relative lull in its investment programme to reduce its overall debt from FFr195bn (Pounds 23.69bn) last year to FFr155bn by 1996. Such a reduction would make EdF a more attractive privatisation prospect, though the utility is hardly on the priority list of public companies for sale by the centre-right government that is expected to take office after the March parliamentary election. Early in the next century, EdF faces the task of renewing the nuclear power plants which provide 75 per cent of its electricity. French basic monthly salaries excluding bonuses and overtime rose by 0.7 per cent in the third quarter of 1992, giving a year-on-year increase of 3.6 per cent, the Labour Ministry said, Reuter reports from Paris.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Observer: Asian law You won't find the name of 44-year-old Sarosh Zaiwalla in Who's Who or Debrett's People of Today, but when it comes to Britain's growing network of Asian millionaires, Zaiwalla is better connected than most. His latest venture, putting together Europe's first Hindi-language satellite TV station, is a reminder of how easily he flits between the worlds of international big business, showbiz and politics. Zaiwalla, senior partner in his own London law firm, has been hovering around the fringes of the Conservative party for several years but first came to national attention when he organised a pre-election 'power dinner' for Asian businessmen at Number 10. Now he is giving the same sort of attention to TV Asia, a Pounds 7m project which brings together Faisal Sherjan, Pakistan's TV king, a wealthy politician close to Benazir Bhutto, and Ajitabh Bachchan (brother of Indian movie star Amitabh). Like many lawyers, he finds no difficulty juggling a sometimes controversial client list, which includes Bachchan (for whom he acted in the Bofors arms controversy), Greek shipowners, and some of the more wealthy BCCI depositors. The Indian government is an ex-client; relations soured with New Delhi after a tiff over unpaid fees of Pounds 350,000. M'learned friends have been instructed. And could there be a starring role for him on TV-Asia? Hosting a show on legal problems would seem a fitting choice.</p>

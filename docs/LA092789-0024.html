			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DISCLOSING HOMEOWNER MEMBERSHIPS  </P> <P> An article about light rail on Sept. 10 quoted Richard Close, president of the  Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., and Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of  Encino. Many articles regarding growth issues quote representatives of  homeowners groups. My difficulty is in understanding whom these various  representatives represent.  </P> <P> For example, as a member of the Citizens Advisory Committee for the  Ventura/Cahuenga Specific Plan, I served with Mr. Silver. While one must  respect his strongly held convictions and his ability to obtain substantial  press coverage in their furtherance, one must question whether his convictions  are more his own than those of a community.  </P> <P> This is especially true in Encino, where more than one organization claims to  represent homeowners.  </P> <P> Requiring homeowner associations to make public their paid memberships would  allow the comments of an individual such as Mr. Silver to be given their proper  weight. Logically, the only homeowner groups that should object to making this  information public would be those that have limited membership. Imagine the  difference in importance if Mr. Silver represented 25 households as opposed to  500 or 5,000.  </P> <P> I also believe that representatives of homeowner groups who actively lobby  within the city of Los Angeles should be required to register as lobbyists. As  chairman of the Business Property Council, our executive director, Tim Riley,  is required to register as a lobbyist prior to speaking on behalf of our  organization and its membership. This filing is a public disclosure as to our  organization and its membership. Representatives of homeowner groups should be  no less regulated when they are performing the same functions.  </P> <P> MICHAEL A. ZUGSMITH  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

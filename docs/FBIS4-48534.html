			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Constitutional Court Selection -- Johannesburg THE STAR in  English in an editorial on page 12 on 20 May calls for  "openness" in the selection of a Constitutional Court. After  noting that the Judicial Service Commission will nominate ten  people for membership on the Constitutional Court, the editorial  warns that "there is no guarantee" that the commission's  hearings "will be open to the media. On the contrary, arguments  are even being offered in defence of closed hearings. The new  democratic order owes it to itself...to ensure that the  questioning of candidates by the Judicial Service Commission is  audible and visible -- through the media -- to ordinary  citizens."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 17 May says in a  page-10 editorial: "The new constitution came into effect last  month. The first full session of Parliament will take place  next week. But one of the cornerstones of the new  constitutional dispensation, namely the Constitutional Court, is  still lacking. This court is the most important mechanism built  into the constitution to guard the constitution....Already there  are indications that several important matters will land on this  court's table within months, relating especially to such  sensitive issues as lanOuage and land rights. It is therefore  of the utmost importance that the president sets the wheels in  motion as soon as possible to establish the Judicial Services  Commission -- which must recommend suitable members for  appointment to the court -- and the Constitutional Court  itself....In order to ensure broad credibility in the  institution as a watchdog over the constitution, it will be  necessary that the appointment process is as transparent as  possible. There must be no secret deals between political  parties wishing to get their candidates appointed; that could  discredit this cornerstone. Every possible care must be taken  to ensure that the most qualified people are considered for this  exceptional task."    Educational Issues A Priority -- A second editorial on page  10 says: "The insistence in black educational circles that all  empty and underused schools be put to full use as quickly as  possible has merit. However, this is a relatively small part of  a solution to the educational problems in South Africa. Put  another way, overfull schools in black areas are certainly a  problem, but an even greater problem is that most of those  schools stand empty for much of the school year. That is due to  the culture of absence, strikes, and boycotts which has  developed among black students and teachers over the past two  decades as a result of various factors. Many of the reasons for  these actions still remain, but the major political grievance  was removed last week with the inauguration of President Nelson  Mandela, and the remaining problems can now be tackled in all  seriousness....The greatest educational priority for South  Africa now, though, is getting all school children back in their  desks and all teachers in front of the blackboard."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Regional Economic Leadership Urged -- Johannesburg BUSINESS  DAY in English in a page-10 editorial on 20 May argues that the  election in Malawi is an opportunity for South Africa to begin  "to lead our part of the continent out of the morass." The  editorial continues: "We must not only ditch the controls that  restrain our own economy, we must be prepared to accept the  consequences of assuming regional leadership -- a free flow of  skills, goods and capital from and to our neighbors." The paper  calls on President Mandela to use next week's  state-of-the-nation speech to encourage emigres to return to  South Africa and to "enunciate a credible economic strategy that  cannot be derailed by expedient politicians."  <H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>   Understaffed Ministries -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp;  GUARDIAN in English, in an editorial on page 30 of its 20-26 May  issue, voices concern over the small number civil servants in  key government ministries. It cites the Housing Ministry as one  example of an understaffed ministry, and expresses particular  concern that the Defense Ministry and the Safety and Security  Ministry do not have enough muscle to effectively take charge of  the army and the police. The editorial concludes: "Although  under pressure to cut civil service costs, the cabinet must face  the fact that some critical departments may have to grow if they  are to assert civil and political control over the state  bureaucracy."    Labor Unrest -- Johannesburg NEW NATION in English publishes  on page 14 of its 20 May edition an editorial expressing concern  that labor unrest among civil servants in some former homelands  represents a threat to the country's democratic process. "We  believe," the paper notes, "that workers...would be prepared to  delay mass action to allow all channels of communication to be  exhausted....It surely cannot serve the best interests of the  same workers to undermine or sabotage the new government without  giving it a chance to prove itself." If workers strike before  exhausting all other avenues of communication, the editorial  argues, they risk "falling into the hands" of the "enemies of  our new democracy." The editorial concludes: "We urge Public  Service and Administration minister Zola Skweyiya to immediately  put together a team of Directors-General to travel with him  throughout the country to assure civil servants that their  grievances are being addressed."</p>

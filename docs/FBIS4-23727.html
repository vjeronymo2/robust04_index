			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rafael Omar in Nampula] </F>   [Text] The voter registration process in Nampula Province  is experiencing problems. The Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] Party has been complaining about an alleged presence of  Tanzanian citizens in Matibane and Cabeceira posts in Mossuril  District, as well as at Mozambique Isle.    A communique issued by the Renamo provincial branch in  Nampula accuses the Mossuril district government of interfering  with the voter registration process by illegally establishing  mobile voter registration centers in the district when,  according to it, there should only be fixed centers.    The Renamo political leadership in Nampula says the acting  Mossuril district administrator has been diverting the attention  of people by announcing the distribution of food in voter  registration centers, allegedly to prevent them from registering  as voters.    The Renamo communique sent to our news desk says government  officials have been exacting taxes from civilians in voter  registration centers. It cited as examples the areas of Gelo,  Larde, and Gaone, in the districts of Angoche, Moma, and Rapale,  respectively. In Rapale, these alleged tax collectors were  deployed by the Rapale town council mayor. Renamo also says in  its communique that two men belonging to the State Information  and Security Service [SISE], carrying pistols and bayonets, were  recently beaten up by civilians when they tried to kill two  Renamo election monitors. Renamo also says that voter  registration teams at Mapipine Ward, on the outskirts of Rapale  city, have not been registering Renamo members.    The Renamo communique also says that at voter registration  centers in Anchilo, also in the city of Nampula, voter  registration photographers have been repeatedly and without  controls photographing some people, particularly the head of the  administrative post and the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo] Party representative. Renamo cited photographer Jose  Lopes Sumbana as having said that the pictures were just a  remembrance. With regard to the uncontrolled taking of  pictures, Renamo has warned that there should be no uncontrolled  distribution of voter registration cards, since photographers  say the uncontrolled taking of pictures has no particular  purpose.    In the communique, Renamo says the presence of Frelimo Party  secretaries and other government elements in voter registration  posts are a clear violation of the electoral law.    In conclusion, Renamo calls on the Nampula Provincial  Elections Commission to take necessary measures with regard to  these issues.    Our reporting team contacted Aurelio Monteiro das Neves,  chairman of the Nampula Provincial Elections Commission, who  said there is no evidence of the presence of Tanzanians in voter  registration centers, despite the presence of large number of  foreigners in the province. Monteiro das Neves said Renamo  should come up with at least one case where a Tanzanian citizen  has been registered.    On other complaints in Mossuril, Moma, and Angoche, our  source said it has sent a team to Mossuril District to  investigate Renamo's complaints.    On the alleged presence of SISE men beaten up by civilians  in  Rapale, the chairman of the Nampula Provincial Elections  Commission, said he received information that the two were just  drunks and were not even armed.    On the alleged presence of ruling party members in voter  registration posts, Aurelino Monteiro das Neves cited Article 50  of the electoral law which says that any legal political party  can cooperate with voter registration teams, although it is up  to the latter to define, without discrimination, the need for  and the sphere of that cooperation. The provincial elections  commission chairman said he was not informed about the issue of  photographs in Anchilo, but promised to bring up the case with  election officials in that administrative post.    This is the second time here in Nampula that Renamo has been  complaining about an alleged presence of Tanzanian citizens in  the province, connected with the electoral process in Mozambique.</p>

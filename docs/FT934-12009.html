			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Moody's reviews local rating of Hong Kong's Mass Transit group HONG KONG'S Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) is having its local credit rating reviewed by Moody's Investors Service as a result of concerns over Hong Kong's rapid economic and political integration with China. The announcement comes at a sensitive time for MTRC, which plans to raise substantial external funding for the HKDollars 33bn (USDollars 4.2bn) rail link between Hong Kong island and Chek Lap Kok airport, assuming it can secure approval from China. Moody's comments on the potential down-grading of MTRC's Aa2 rating for Hong Kong dollar-denominated debt made no reference to the financial position of the company. They referred only to the impact of 'Hong Kong's accelerated pace of integration into China' on financial and monetary trends in the colony. Mr Roger Moss, finance director of MTRC, said he believed the announcement would have little impact on the corporation's ability to raise capital. MTRC - which is owned by the Hong Kong Government - has just returned from a US roadshow. Mr Moss said it was apparent that the group could get ready access to low-cost financing outside, regardless of the rating for its local debt. Of greater concern is the implication of the current political talks between Britain and China on Hong Kong's political future; worsening relations between the two sides have been primarily responsible for the lengthy postponement of approval for the MTRC's newest rail project. However, an adverse decision by Moody's would be expected to have an impact on the ability of other Hong Kong companies to access cheap funding in the overseas capital markets.</p>

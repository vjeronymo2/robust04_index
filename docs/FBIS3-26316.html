The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomed the move after the  news was learned in Taipei.

The amendment  bill concerning our country submitted by Murkowski also included  the following issues: President Clinton should send  cabinet-level officials to visit China [Taiwan]; discussion of  the annual report on Sino-U.S. economic cooperation submitted by  the State Department; and that Americans of Chinese origin  should be allowed to stamp Taiwan as their place of birth in  their American passports.    The official said: After the Senate adopted the  authorization Act by an overwhelming majority, the Senate and  House will hold separate meetings in the near future to  deliberate the articles of the Authorization Act and the  amendment bill. After a consensus is reached, the package will  be sent to the White House to be signed by President Clinton.  Once it is signed by the President, it must be carried out by  administrative departments. [words indistinct]</p>

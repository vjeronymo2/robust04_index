			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / People: Forestry Commission The government has announced the appointment of a new chairman of the Forestry Commission to succeed Sir Raymond Johnstone, who has retired. Sir Peter Hutchison, chairman of Hutchison and Craft insurance brokers, takes on the top post at the Forestry Commission at a crucial time for the industry. He will preside over the transformation of Forest Enterprise, the commercial arm of the Commission, into a Next Steps agency to be run in a more business-like fashion. This follows the government review of forestry which decided against privatisation in August. The Forestry Commission is still a government department, and Forest Enterprise will be run in a more commercial way, but will still be answerable to the commission. The government's plans for Forest Enterprise have been criticised by environmental groups as a way of privatising by the back door. As part of a government working party Sir Peter recently advised the government on the development potential of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs areas of Scotland.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Krzysztof Gacek: "A Return of PRL?; Pawlak's </F> Government Proposes Centralism"]    [Text]The slowing down of the work on administrative  reforms and the government's centralist tendencies are the  reasons behind the resignation of Minister Michal Kulesza.  According to the opposition, the government not only has no  ideas for changes, but it outright reaffirms the ways of the old  Polish People's Republic [PRL]. A majority of the parties is  against abandoning the reforms.    On Friday [20 May], Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak accepted  the resignation of Minister Michal Kulesza from the post of the  government's plenipotentiary for reforms of public  administration. Kulesza announced his resignation from the post  a week earlier in Poznan, during a Second All-Poland Conference  of Territorial Self- Governments.    "The reason for my resignation is the current government's  decision to slow down the work on reforming the country's  administration" -- Kulesza said this past Saturday. "The  governing coalition has no plans for any kind of system-wide  transformations of the state, it ignores self-governments, it is  against powiats [small administrative units], and it strives to  achieve centralized management."    According to the former minister, the government not only  has  no vision or plans for changes, but it outright proposes a  return to solutions deriving from the PRL period. This is  demonstrated by draft laws being prepared by Michal Strak, chief  of the Council of Ministers' Office [URM], on URM, on  governmental and territorial administration, on employees of  state offices (an amendment to the 1982 law), and a superficial  law on state civil service.    "I cannot reconcile a loyalty towards the government with a  faithfulness toward a program of decentralization and reforms of  public administration" -- Kulesza says. "I do not want to be  responsible for disassembling the program of reforms."    In a statement issued to journalists, the former minister  said that decentralization is required in Poland because an  overly centralized state is managed inefficiently, with taxpayer  money being spent irrationally, and at times it is even outright  wasted.    The current governing team is returning not just to the old  personnel, but also to the old way of thinking, as exemplified  by the practice of "booty sharing" which was introduced in the  clerical sector of the territorial administration.    "There are many marvelous mayors and chief officers of  groups  of villages [wojtowie] in the Polish Peasant Party, whose  managerial skills are as good as those of wojtowie coming form  other parties" -- Kulesza told journalists. "The misfortune is  about the fact that is not they that are the intellectual basis  for the party's leadership, and that it is an apparatus which  strives only at strengthening its own position that has the  upper hand in the party."    In Kulesza's view, the other participant in the coalition --  the Democratic Left Alliance -- does not transform its  reform-oriented program into specific measures.    The former plenipotentiary expressed his concern over the  subsequent fate of some draft laws which were prepared by his  office -- these concern public orders [zamowienia publiczne],  economic activities by gminas [small administrative units], and  self-governmental appeal collegia.</p>

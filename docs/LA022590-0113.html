			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDPAPERS: 'FIFTY-SEVEN VARIETIES LOWER THAN A TURKEY BUZZARD'  </P> <P> The recent publication of H. L. Mencken's diary caused the kind of furor that  the curmudgeon of American letters would have loved. A good deal of this  post-mortem controversy has to do with Henry Louis Mencken's status as the  patron saint of journalists.  </P> <P> It has been generally pointed out in the saint's defense that he was  uncomplimentary not only about Jews and blacks, but practically everybody under  the sun, including fellow journalists. The point that gets lost is that the  offensiveness of some passages in the long-withheld diary looks tame when  compared with the avalanche of vituperative invective hurled at this  independent thinker during most of his career.  </P> <P> In 1928, two years before Mencken began writing his diary, Alfred A. Knopf, his  regular publisher, brought out a small volume of "Menckeniana -- A  Schimplexicon," meaning (in German) "a lexicon of abuse." It contained  selections from editorials, reviews and general hate mail printed about Mencken  when he was in his mid-40s.  </P> <P> The title is misleading, since the reader might have expected the quotes to  have been authored by Mencken himself, while attributing them to newspapers and  individuals who had attracted his scorn. He was certainly capable of  perpetrating such a hoax: The celebrated fabrication about the introduction of  the first American bathtub -- how it had been banned in Boston, except on  medical prescription, and how Virginia imposed a $30 tax on each tub, etc. --  still is remembered as a practical joke on the order of Orson Welles' radio  version of "War of the Worlds." Mencken had written the piece to amuse his  readers during World War I, but these "historical facts" came to be reprinted  in reference books and countless articles for decades despite the author's  repeated attempts to expose his own fraud.  </P> <P> "During the single year of 1926," the publisher points out in a prefatory note  to Menckeniana, "more than 500 separate editorials upon the sayings and doings  of Mencken were printed in the United States, and at least four-fifths were  unfavorable. Himself given to somewhat acidulous utterance, he has probably  been denounced more vigorously and at greater length than any other American of  his time, not even excepting Henry Ford, Robert M. LaFollette, Clarence Darrow,  and Sacco and Vanzetti."  </P> <P> From the vast amount of material, contained in 30 volumes of scrapbooks,  Mencken and the future Mrs. Mencken, Sara Powell Haardt, made an "expurgated  edition." According to the publisher, some were "chosen for their wit -- for  there are palpable hits among them! -- and some for their blistering ferocity,  and some for their charming idiocy." A few of these deserve to be remembered,  to provide a context for readers of "The Diary of H. L. Mencken" and also for  themselves, as examples of lively invective rarely found in our tamer days.  </P> <P> Mencken was "a literary stink-pot," according to the Raleigh Times; "a tavern  brawler, drunk on adjectives," (the Nashville Tennessean), and as "a scribbler  plethoric and thinker vacuous," the Memphis Commercial Appeal concluded, "what  he writes is bilge."  </P> <P> These are just three of the appreciative comments about the man who is now  chiefly remembered for his monumental work about the American language. He had  few defenders even among intellectuals and literary types. The New Republic  called him a "Cinderella with flat feet"; the Chicago Literary Times dubbed him  a "Dionysus sitting on a piece of flypaper," and a magazine of the University  of Mississippi writes about "the cynical, putrid-souled H. L. Mencken . . .  wallowing in a self-created atmosphere of filthy literary stench. . . ."  </P> <P> Mencken himself rarely lowered himself to such direct ad hominem smears,  content to attack whole classes of people, such as the unrelenting war he waged  on the "booboisie" -- a term he applied not just to the bourgeoisie but to all  humanity. During the famous "Monkey Trial" of 1925, he kept up a barrage of  derision against the backwardness of the South. His gloating obituary of  William Jennings Bryan, the fundamentalist demagogue who was chiefly  responsible for bullying the state of Tennessee into prosecuting John Thomas  Scopes for teaching evolution, certainly did not win Mencken any friends.  </P> <P> "In the not very remote past," wrote Nannie H. Chestnutt in the Nashville  Tennessean, "a wiggle in the mud got alive, and in the course of time, became  maggot, gadfly, cockroach, wasp, tobacco worm, scorpion, bat, English sparrow,  cow-bird, buzzard, polecat, hyena, jackal, monkey, jackass and eventually  evolved Mencken."  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Inquirer called him a "stormy petrel of unbalanced mental  potentialities," and Howard Hammond, writing to the St. Michaels Comet in  Maryland, showed as little respect for Mencken as for the English language:  "Disappointed, dishonest, distruthful, disgraceful, degraded, degenerate  evolute of a species fifty-seven varieties lower than a turkey buzzard."  </P> <P> The circus metaphor also was popular, and even big-city newspapers happily  joined in the chorus. "When Mr. Mencken tries to be humorous," opined Percy A.  Hutchison in the New York Times, "he has all the subtlety and grace of a trick  elephant dancing on an inverted tub."  </P> <P> From evolution, it was a short step down into the gutter of indiscriminate  racist attacks. Mencken hailed from a prosperous Baltimore family of German  descent. The Danville Register in Virginia associated his "patronymic with a  sinister Hunnish sound," while the Los Angeles Times ventured that "Mr. Mencken  is a typical Hun in his criticism." One paper accused him of being a "former  subject of the Kaiser"; another called him "a British toady," and the Vancouver  Sun told its readers that in his "veins runs unsullied the pure blood of  Hungary."  </P> <P> The St. Louis Mirror thundered that "as the pure blood will tell, the erstwhile  Bright Boy of Baltimore has in time evolved into the super-Boche of our  American culture . . . " Harold N. Coriell, in the New York Herald Tribune,  thought Mencken "an offense in the nostrils of all Americans who love the  ideals and best traditions of their country." Ditto the New Haven Union:  "Mencken, obviously of foreign name, is a treacherous alien sapping at the  vitals of America's proudest and most essential institutions, an indecent  buffoon wallowing in obscenity as he howls with glee."  </P> <P> Out of the empty West came this: The Montana American in Butte pictured  Mencken, a continent away, as "a Jewish expert screwing the microscope into his  jaundiced eye," and "shaking his head over all the jewels proffered in America  by Americans." In the light of the few racist comments found in the diary, the  following 1920s quotes are noteworthy:  </P> <P> "We are not fully informed as to Mencken's color and race," editorialized the  Tampa Tribune, "but his remarks about Negro superiority in the South lead us to  believe that he must be a Negro by inclination if not by birth. He is, as a  matter of fact, far inferior to the average Southern Negro." Arabella Jameson,  in the Raleigh News and Observer, takes a different tack: "Away with the  inhibition of inferiority this clever Hebrew would wish upon us!"  </P> <P> No less a literary figure than Gilbert Keith Chesterton joined the lynch mob  from England, managing to damn him and Americans in the same breath: "Mr.  Mencken is a clever and bitter Jew, in whom a very real love of letters is  everlastingly exasperated by the American love of cheap pathos and platitude."  Even if Mencken had been Jewish, he would have found that community less than  welcoming. "He appears to be a Jew of the 'dirty bird which fouls its own nest'  variety," The American Israelite tried to analyze him, "probably acting in this  manner to show that he is different and of finer clay than his fellows."  </P> <P> Mencken hardly ever responded to this endless stream of abuse. He seemed to  delight in it. His revenge was to make money from publishing Menckeniana.  Almost 30 years after that, he finally did have something to say -- in private.  His last seven years laid waste by a stroke, and welcome death approaching,  Mencken's parting words to a visiting friend were: "Remember, write what you  damn well please. But be sure to tell 'em I've always been a Christian. And a  patriot."  </P> <P> He died on Jan. 29, 1956. May he never rest in peace -- because he never wanted  to.  </P></p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Letter: Training and obligation do not mix Sir, Your Leader on unemployment (August 14) is right in urging the government to 'think long-term'. But you are wrong in suggesting that entitlement to benefit should be conditional on unemployed adults participating in training schemes open to them. Our experience has led us to conclude that involvement in skills training should not be obligatory. If the employment service forces people to train, the result is that those who do want to train find their training ruined by those who do not want to be there. Making skills training obligatory will make it low-quality. While training and obligation do not mix, obligation is right and proper in relation to temporary work. Here our experience suggests that the unemployed would respect an obligatory temporary work programme, since they know how appalling it can be to have no constructive activities outside their homes. They should be offered some choice about the work they do, but work they should. The government should retain Employment Training as a voluntary programme, and make Employment Action an obligatory temporary work programme for those out of work for more than 12 months.

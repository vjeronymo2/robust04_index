			<p>BFN     [Text] Italy has offered to supply troops to a UN standing  army. More than 15 countries have already placed troops at the  UN's disposal, and 54,000 soldiers could be rapidly deployed in  peacekeeping operations.    The UN plans to have 100,000 blue helmets by the end of the  year. They will be used where both sides in a conflict ask for  their intervention. The contingent being offered by Italy would  largely be made up of medical personnel. Seventy thousand  troops are currently deployed by the United Nations.</p>

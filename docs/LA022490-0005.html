			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIETNAM SOUTH  </P> <P> On Feb. 15, Calendar published a Jack Mathews news analysis under the heading:  "Will the academy voters consider the year's angriest movie, 'Born on the  Fourth of July,' to be the best? Don't bet on it." Would someone please tell  Mathews that the Vietnam War was not fought against "the Red Menace."  </P> <P> And when you do, please note that during the initial screenings of "Born on the  Fourth of July," our great and noble country invaded Panama, another tiny,  distant, foreign land.  </P> <P> I think film editor Mathews really missed the point on this absolutely current  motion picture masterpiece. Thus, he can be added to the immense list of those  who can't see anything but what the government wants them to see.  </P> <P> KRISTEN K.A. NORRIS, Cal Poly Pomona  </P></p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Mixed fortunes for Old Masters: Saleroom OLD MASTER drawings continued to have mixed fortunes yesterday. A spirited chalk, ink and wash drawing of a cloud-borne winged deity and other figures by GB Tiepolo, which sold at Pounds 30,800, was one of a number of Italian works at Christie's to sell at the lower end of the estimate. It came from the collection of Duke Roberto Ferretti, as did a delicate black chalk angel by Fra Bartolommeo which exceeded expectations by selling for Pounds 24,200. The careful panoramic view, not of Venice but of Borgo di Valsugana in the valley of the Trenta, by Francesco Guardi was bought in at Pounds 100,000 but sold after the auction for the same price. The morning session totalled Pounds 339,955. Some 65 per cent by lot was sold, 59 per cent by value. Christie's offered another diverse group of drawings from the collection of the late Ian Woodner. The top price of Pounds 26,400 was for a fragment of a cartoon for a ceiling fresco of a concert by Niccolo dell'Abbate. The group realised Pounds 531,157, with 82.64 per cent sold by value and 87.5 per cent by lot. At Phillips' paintings sale, a somewhat worn half-length canvas of Lucretia, given to the studio of Guido Reni and estimated at Pounds 10,000-Pounds 15,000, was thought by some to be the work of the Bolognese master himself. It went to an overseas telephone bidder for Pounds 110,000.</p>

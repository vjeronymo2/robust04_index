			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw limits fall as new car sales decline IN A declining market for new cars last year, Evans Halshaw, the motor dealer, limited its pre-tax profit fall to 6 per cent, from Pounds 4.11m to Pounds 3.86m. The share price rose 9p to close at 285p, its highest level since 1989. The profit decline for the year to December 31 was much less steep than in 1990, when the group was hit by losses in parts distribution, which it has sold, and the cost of reorganising contract hire. The group also announced plans to open two multi-franchise outlets in the Midlands. This decision was made against a background of relaxation in manufacturers' restrictions related to a recently published Monopolies and Mergers Commission report. Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman, said the first outlet, in Birmingham, would combine the sale of new Honda, Nissan and Mazda cars with used cars and service. It would cost just over Pounds 3m and open by August. The second, in Solihull, would include Vauxhall, Rover, which relaxed its exclusivity requirements in January, and Toyota. It would cost a similar amount and open next year. The concept involves a cluster of independent showrooms rather the new makes being mixed in together. Mr Dale said that when the developments were complete the company would have 45 dealerships covering 18 different franchises. Operating profit fell by 18 per cent to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 8.62m) on turnover of Pounds 340m (Pounds 383m). Part of the fall followed a business disposal. Ongoing activities were down 7 per cent. Mr Dale blamed the downturn in the UK new car market - last year total sales fell by 21 per cent to 1.59m units. The share of Evans Halshaw's operating profit attributable to car sales fell from 32 per cent to 19 per cent. Three quarters of profit came from servicing and parts, compared with 62 per cent in 1990. At the pre-tax level, there was an Pounds 800,000 turnround in contract hire and the growing fleet management business, which gives computerised analysis of fleet costs. This helped the interest line, where charges fell from Pounds 4.52m to Pounds 3.24m. The business disposal and cost control also played a part. Net debt went up slightly to Pounds 14m (Pounds 13m), all but Pounds 2m related to contract hire, giving gearing of about 37 per cent. Earnings per share slipped from 12.3p to 11.7p. A maintained final dividend of 7.65p makes an unchanged 11.25p total.</p>

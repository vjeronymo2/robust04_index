			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cameroon president was received by his French  counterpart in Paris this afternoon. Cameroon has found it  difficult to launch reforms demanded by international monetary  institutions. President Biya has therefore come to ask Francois  Mitterrand for economic support. The Cameroon president was  optimistic when he left the Elysee Palace. Ghislaine Dupont  asked him what lessons his country has drawn from the CFA  [African Financial Community] franc devaluation:    [Begin Biya recording] It is still too soon to draw  conclusions. There are some very negative aspects, such as  unemployment and the decline in purchasing power. But at the  same time, we note positive aspects, like, for instance, the  increase in capital of some companies and the increase in  exports. There is the prospect of an increase of agricultural  products in rural areas. We also note that the gross national  product, which was decreasing, has stabilized. All this,  however, is still very fragile. We cannot draw conclusions  after just three months. But we need more capital, through  bilateral or multilateral agreements, to consolidate the  positive aspects. It was this aspect that I raised with the  president. I was happy to see that I was heard and I saw him  [Mitterrand] giving instructions, so funds can be released as  soon as possible.    There is hope. I will see other political figures. I will  meet the prime minister tomorrow and I will see the finance  minister in a short while. The Elysee has led me to believe  that something will be done. [end recording]</p>

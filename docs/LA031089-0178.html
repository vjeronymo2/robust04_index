			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MCFARLANE RECALLS DEBATE ON LEGALITY OF CONTRA PLAN  </P> <P> Former National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane told a jury today that top  Reagan Administration officials discussed whether arranging third-country aid  to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels was an illegal act for which the President  could be impeached.  </P> <P> Testifying at Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial, McFarlane said then-White House  chief of staff James A. Baker III took the position at the June 25, 1984,  meeting of the National Security Planning Group that it is illegal to solicit  third-country aid.  </P> <P> "I took it to mean . . . that if the President were to authorize . . . money  from third countries that would be a violation of law and he could therefore be  so charged and impeached . . . removed from office," McFarlane said. Members of  the planning group included then-President Reagan, Vice President Bush and  secretaries of state and defense.  </P> <P> McFarlane recalled that Baker's view was "strongly countered" and that the  consensus from the meeting was that Baker's opinion was "not true."  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia that year began giving the Contras $1 million a month.  </P> <P> Prosecutor John Keker asked McFarlane whether top Reagan Administration  officials were being asked to lie to Congress about the secret third-country  aid. McFarlane said the intent was "just not to have" the matter "become  public."  </P> <P> McFarlane said the Administration decided to seek help for the rebels from  other countries because it did not wish to become involved in a messy political  fight with Congress by seeking additional Contra aid in an election year.  </P> <P> "The American people don't like violence," McFarlane said in regard to the war  the Contras were waging against the leftist Nicaraguan government.  </P> <P> Earlier today, a public relations consultant who moved money to the Contras  testified at the U.S. District Court trial that North approved taking a 10% cut  from private donations to the rebel cause.  </P> <P> Richard Miller said North told him at the end of 1985 that "most of the people  involved" in the fund-raising network were "getting 20% to 30%."  </P> <P> Miller also told how he asked the former White House aide for lists of  "big-ticket items" the Contras needed that would be "comprehensible" to  potential contributors.  </P></p>

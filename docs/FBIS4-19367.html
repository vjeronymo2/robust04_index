			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Punctuation as published] </F>   [Text] TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President  Rauf Denktas has said that Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos  Kliridhis' main objective is to have the Greek Cypriots enter  Maras [Varosha] and that the UN officials wish to have the  Turkish Cypriots transfer the area to the Greek Cypriots without  taking anything tangible in return.    Denktas has assessed the latest situation in the indirect  talks between the two sides in Cyprus for the TURKISH CYPRIOT  NEWS AGENCY. Accusing the Greek Cypriot side of rupturing the  package of confidence-building measures [CBM's], he said they  must repair it. Denktas stressed that significant pressure has  been directed on the Turkish Cypriot side to force it to agree  to the package and noted that the changes effected in the  package concern the issue of sovereignty and as such cannot be  accepted.    Denktas recalled that Glavkos Kliridhis strongly reacted to  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's latest intermediary  report:    ``Kliridhis revealed that he had seen the initial draft of  that report. He also complained that particular changes were  made to its final form in favor of the Turkish Cypriots.  Consequently, the Greek Cypriots have regarded it as a moderate  document against the Turkish Cypriots.    Why have the Greek Cypriots described the report as a  moderate document? Obviously, somebody must have made other  promises to them. That person also showed them the initial  draft of the report. That person, whoever he may be, has  definitely not facilitated the talks by playing such a game.  The Greek Cypriot community has described the CBM's package as  a `catastrophic' document. Kliridhis can talk on behalf of that  community, including the other Greek Cypriot leaders, the Greek  Cypriot Church, and EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot  Fighters]. What has he said to them? Let me outline things:  `Do not worry. In essence, I have agreed to nothing. I have  purportedly agreed to the CBM's package for tactical purposes  because the Turkish Cypriot side is confronted with several  problems. The Turkish Cypriots cannot agree to that package as  it stands.' That is why Kliridhis has said he `is ready to  accept the CBM's package, providing the Turkish Cypriot leader  does likewise.' What does that mean? The UN officials have  been unable to assess that. They expect us to transfer Maras to  the Greek Cypriots without receiving anything tangible in  return.''    Denktas said that Kliridhis' main objective is to have the  Greek Cypriots enter Maras. Stressing that the Greek Cypriot  leader cares for nothing else, Denktas asserted that the Turkish  Cypriot side calls for the establishment of a functional UN  Administration and for a tangible form to the rights and powers  it will gain. He stressed:    ``Kliridhis has not even informed the other political party  leaders of the second `nondocument paper,' which he purported to  accept for tactical reasons... How can that be? The Turkish  Cypriot side is expected to make concessions for an agreement  that the Greek Cypriot side does not wish to accept... Why is  that so? What will happen to the concessions we may make if the  Greek Cypriot side rejects the agreement? We will have made  concessions for nothing. But the Greek Cypriot side's position  in the next round of talks will be a step ahead of us...    Can the Turkish Cypriots be expected to make concessions in  accordance with the promises that are made by this or that  person? Why have U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher and the other  officials not documented in a tangible way what they have  verbally guaranteed? They are working on the text of an  agreement, which will say that we `will place Maras under UN  jurisdiction and the Greek Cypriots will return to that area.'  That will be put on record... What will the Turkish Cypriots  receive in return?''  <H5>  I Have Been Subjected to Pressure </H5>   Recalling that significant pressure has been directed on the  Turkish Cypriot side to force it to agree to the initial CBM's  package, Denktas stressed that the Turkish Cypriots have  remained within the parameters promised to them. So, he said,  the ball is in the Greek Cypriot court. Reiterating the Turkish  Cypriot side's views on the status of Dhimokratias Avenue in  Maras, Denktas asserted:    ``We insisted that we retain the north of Dhimokratias  Avenue  so that the security of the Port of Famagusta and its environs  can be guaranteed. But the UN secretary general clearly  informed us as follows: `You will retain the access road to  Maras in the south of that area. Travel to and from Maras will  be under your control. The UN officials will be responsible for  law and order in Maras... The issue of security cannot be an  excuse...' Considering that, we agreed to give up Dhimokratias  Avenue. But afterward, the UN General Secretariat moved  immediately to say: `The exercise on Maras will be meaningless  if the access road is not placed under UN jurisdiction. A  massive hole was drilled in the package in favor of the Greek  Cypriots. I have repeatedly said that `I cannot have the TRNC  Republican Assembly and the Turkish Cypriot people agree to that  package with such a hole in it.' But no one seems to  understand.''    Stressing that the package must be repaired by the Greek  Cypriots because they are responsible for rupturing it, Denktas  asserted that nothing can be achieved by blaming the Turkish  Cypriot side and that maintaining the talks is the only way to  solve the problem.  <H5>  Clark's Disclosures </H5>   Recalling that the UN General Secretariat submitted the  initial CBM's package to the two sides on the condition that "it  cannot be changed and that the Turkish and Greek Cypriots must  remain within its framework," Denktas stressed that the UN  General Secretariat drilled a hole in the CBM's package in favor  of the Greek Cypriots without the consent of the Turkish Cypriot  side.    Denktas also assessed remarks by Joe Clark, the UN secretary  general's special representative to Cyprus, to journalists in  New York. Stressing that the benefits and rights the Turkish  Cypriots stand to gain from the first package have been given no  tangible form, Denktas recalled the promises made to the Turkish  Cypriot side in return for Maras and noted that he was informed  that several of those promises would be fulfilled if he agreed  to place the area under UN jurisdiction. He described that as  "an unreliable situation."    Asserting that a tangible form must be given to the promises  made to the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas said that the changes  effected in the package against the Turkish Cypriots cannot be  described as being of "secondary importance," because they have  harmed the essence of the package and indicated that the  promises made have been rescinded.    Denktas stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side must retain  its control of the access road to Maras in the south of that  area and noted that the issue is vitally important for the  Turkish Cypriots. Recalling the UN secretary general's promise  on the issue, Denktas said that no one seems to remember it  apart from the Turkish Cypriot side.    Denktas asserted that the promises made to the Turkish  Cypriot side on the Nicosia International Airport have not been  fulfilled either. He stressed that the failure of the UN  officials to fulfill their promises has disrupted the balance.  But no one seems to care about that, he said.    Denktas reiterated that the Turkish Cypriot side is prepared  to maintain the indirect talks and blamed Glavkos Kliridhis for  creating a deadlock in the negotiating process. He said: "We  maintain our contacts with the UN officials... We will see what  will happen in four weeks."    Arguing that Joe Clark, in a bid to satisfy the Greek  Cypriot  side, wants to force the Turkish Cypriots to agree to various  issues, Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side only wants  the promises that were made fulfilled.</p>

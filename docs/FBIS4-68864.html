			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Ryaboshapka: "Reconciling Wages With </F> Profits"]    [Text] As of today, the main tax for production  enterprises is the income tax, which enterprise directors do not  like. Usually countries with a market economy have a tax on  profits. In ratifying the Law on Taxation of Income, the Supreme  Council took into consideration the fact that over the period  the Law on Taxation of Profits was effective in Ukraine, our  businessmen understated profits, converting them to wages.    Would it not be more advisable to introduce in Ukraine,  instead of a tax on income, a tax on profits? Such a step would  be more advantageous both for foreign investors and for many of  our country's enterprises--primarily state enterprises, which  specialize in the production of traditionally labor-intensive  output. Today they are forced to pay higher taxes on income than  enterprises whose production output does not relate to  labor-intensive sectors. Enterprises of the coal and metallurgy  industries therefore find themselves in an unfavorable  situation, while those of light industry (where wages comprise a  significantly lower proportion of the producer cost structure  than in the above-mentioned sectors) are in a more favorable  situation. If we shift to a system of taxation of profits, all  enterprises will then be operating under the same conditions.  Bearing in mind Ukraine's experience with the effects of this  method of taxation in 1992, however, it is necessary to  introduce a new method and mechanism for collecting this tax.    Thanks to studies conducted over the course of 25 years  (from  1965 through 1990) on the problem of the machine-building  complex of Ukraine, the following rule was discovered: There  exists a stable, approximately 1:1 ratio between wages and  profits in this sector. The ratio is a bit different in other  sectors, but it is also stable, the wages being less and the  profits more. Under our present-day conditions, it would be  advisable for all sectors to have the ratio between wages and  profits on the level of 1:1. Such a ratio has existed over the  course of decades in countries of the market economy of Europe  and the United States. It is based on the fact that  simultaneously characteristic of human labor are the output of a  necessary product (wages) and a supplemental product (profits).  Based on the constancy of this ratio, therefore, we may  introduce the following method of establishing a tax on the  profits of enterprises of all forms of ownership and the  mechanism for withholding it. When an enterprise receives from  the bank, let us say, 1 billion karbovantsy in cash for the  payment of wages, the bank must immediately remove 350 million  karbovantsy as tax on profits from the settlement account of  this enterprise and deposit it into the budget, to the  appropriate account of the Ministry of Finance--this under the  condition that the norm for tax on profits is 35 percent.    The proposed method of establishing the tax on profits and  mechanism for withholding it has the following advantages:    it will be impossible to artificially understate profits,  for  if an enterprise attempts to do this, it will also have to lower  its wage fund, which would be economically disadvantageous;    not a single production enterprise will be able to evade  timely payment of the tax on profits, and the budget will  receive tax revenues in timely fashion (this is the main  advantage of the new method);    the method is strongly anti-inflationary; an enterprise will  not be able to overstate its wage fund, for if it does so it  will also have to increase the withholdings from its profits in  the form of tax going to the budget;    enterprises will be interested in augmenting their noncash  accounts and in taking cash out of the banks only for wages, for  if they take out cash for other purposes, 35 percent of the  amount will have to be paid as tax all the same;    the tax inspectorate will be able to focus its attention on  the withholding of taxes from those enterprises that are  involved mainly in cash transactions, i.e., with trade  enterprises, while taxes will be collected from production  enterprises at the banks.</p>

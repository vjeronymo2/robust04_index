			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Turkey's first woman PM must reforge party image: Ciller offers change from grey-suited political mainstream MRS Tansu Ciller, a former economy minister, is to be predominantly Moslem Turkey's first woman prime minister after being elected leader of the largest party in parliament yesterday. Mrs Ciller, a 47-year-old academic economist better known for the fact that her husband took her maiden name, won 574 votes in the True Path party's leadership race - just 11 short of an absolute majority of those eligible to vote - on the first ballot. Interior minister Ismet Sezgin, with 320 votes, and education minister Koksal Toptan, with 212, then withdrew their candidacy. She will be sworn in today. A welcome foil to the drab, grey-suited male politicians of Turkey's mainstream, Mrs Ciller will have to reforge the party's image in the wake of Mr Suleyman Demirel's move to the presidency, which led to yesterday's leadership contest. Party strengths in parliament are finely balanced. Her first task will be to choose a cabinet in coalition with the junior partners Social Democratic Populists (SHP) after the announcement that Mr Erdal Inonu, SHP leader, would stand down in September. Written off by many commentators when she was first elected to cabinet in 1991, Mrs Ciller emerged a surprising winner, apparently convincing delegates that she offered the better chance for re-election, rather than the respected but uninspiring Mr Sezgin, her main challenger. Mrs Ciller faces the difficult task of rebuilding the party ahead of vital municipal elections next year. A staunch European who speaks good English and German, Mrs Ciller is likely to accelerate Turkey's economic convergence with the European Community. She is expected to speed up the privatisation of state enterprises, which lose an estimated Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) a year. Her anti-inflation policy has proven more controversial and brought her near to open conflict with Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, the central bank governor. Mr Saracoglu's future must now be in doubt. Mrs Ciller has cut a curious figure in her Chanel suits assiduously courting the party's predominantly Moslem constituents with claims that the call to prayer makes her 'feel good'. Addressing the congress of 1,169 DYP delegates, Mrs Ciller promised yesterday she would visit Germany in the wake of right-wing attacks on Turkish families in a number of German cities - another gesture to rural supporters. She faces an urgent policy agenda - from annual inflation, which is running at more than 60 per cent, and the bloody Kurdish rebellion on the domestic front to an arc of foreign policy concerns from the Caucasus, north Iraq and the Balkans. During 20 months as chief economics minister she has overseen a radical trade reform, moving the country back on track for full customs union with the European Community in 1995. Following legislative changes the stock exchange has enjoyed a renewed lease of life. Before the vote this weekend, the index had reached a record. She has had mixed fortunes in her anti-inflation policy centred on restructuring the government's domestic debt, which has put downward pressure on interest rates. Debt service, at about 40 per cent of recurrent budget expenditures, fuelled the public sector's borrowing requirement, running at close to 12 per cent of gross national product. Mrs Ciller first came to attention when commissioned by the Istanbul Businessmen's Association to produce a report on Turkey's debt during the former Motherland party administration. Her findings were so critical it brought the association into direct conflict with then prime minister, Mr Turgut Ozal. She will want to keep her distance from Mr Demirel, whose accession to the presidency created this leadership race. Mr Demirel for his part will want to counter the impression that he opposed Mrs Ciller's candidacy.</p>

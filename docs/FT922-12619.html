			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool There are no auctions during the Easter recess and overseas wool prices were firm or slightly dearer before the holiday took effect. The tendency was not pronounced enough to bring in any urgent buying, however, and dull and featureless trading is considered probable for the rest of this month. Beyond that there is cautious confidence in firm wool values, but it is recognised that 4 million bales of Australian stockpile wool still overhang the market and that buying by the former Soviet Union areas will not put pressure on supplies. Wool production forecasts meanwhile indicate a continuing decline.</p>

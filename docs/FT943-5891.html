			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Four-way merger sets up entertainment giant The billionaire US investor Mr John Kluge yesterday unveiled a four-company merger between his privately-owned international telecommunications group Metromedia, the Hollywood studio Orion Pictures, the film and television production group MCEG Sterling, and Actava, a cash-rich conglomerate. The new company will be called Metromedia International. Mr Kluge, who rescued Orion from bankruptcy last year, said yesterday: 'Our vision is to create a new global media, entertainment and communications company.' Actava, which after recent divestments has Dollars 215m in cash and liquid securities on hand, will provide the capital for the new entity. Orion and MCEG Sterling will produce new entertainment programming and provide a film library of more than 1,000 titles (including Oscar-winning movies such as Silence of the Lambs and Dances with Wolves). Metromedia will contribute the delivery mechanism via its international telecommunications systems. Initially, the new company will focus on delivering entertainment programming to overseas markets. Mr Kluge will be chairman of the new company, and Mr Jack Phillips, a telecommunications industry executive who was chief executive of Actava, will be president. The creation of the new company is the latest evidence of how telecommunications and entertainment are converging. Companies in both industries are eager to exploit technological developments and regulatory reform that will allow films and other entertainment and educational programming to be delivered to customers via phone lines.</p>

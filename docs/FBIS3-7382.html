However, if North Korea does not show any change in its attitude  to the last and sanctions are inevitable, the government will  work out all possible measures based on the international  cooperation system.    Deputy Prime Minister Yi stressed this while appearing in  the  program, "Diagnosis of Policies" carried by KBS-1 television  network. He said that although North Korea did not show any  indication of military provocation, it intensified slander,  propaganda, and instigation activities against South Korea.  Thus, North Korea more clearly showed its line for communization  of the South. He revealed that the ROK established a firm  security posture in close cooperation with the United States,  including 24-hour operation of the AWACS system.    Concerning the issue of the North Korean residents' escape  to  China, which was recently intensively reported by KBS, Deputy  Prime Minister Yi said that this issue was related not only to  the ROK and North Korea but also to China, and as a result of  this, the exercise of the rights for diplomatic protection is  very difficult. However, he said, the government will make  diplomatic efforts to solve the issue at an early date.</p>

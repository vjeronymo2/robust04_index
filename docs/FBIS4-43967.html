			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels (DPA) -- The heads of government and party  chairmen of the christian democratic parties in the European  Union [EU] are meeting in Brussels on 22 June to coordinate  policy for the forthcoming EU summit.    Their talks will be focused on a successor to European  Commission Chairman Jacques Delors. The two most promising  candidates for the top office, which will be vacant in January  1995 -- Belgian Premier Jean-Luc Dehaene and Netherlands head of  government Ruud Lubbers, both of them Christian democrats --will  take part in the meeting, as will Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    Observers are hoping for a preliminary decision by the  Christian democrats, which form the European People's Party  group in the European Parliament. The socialist Jacques Delors  will have a Christian democratic successor, who will be selected  by the EU heads of state and government at their summit meeting  on the Greek island of Corfu on 24 and 25 June.    Kohl's preferred candidate is Dehaene, who is apparently  backed by the majority of the "Twelve." If the leadership of  the European People's Party opts for one of the candidates, this  vote will be decisive for the EU summit. The possibility has  not been ruled out, however, that no vote will be taken, in  order to avoid a conflict. Both candidates are considered  "highly qualified" for the top position at EU headquarters.    The European People's Party leaders will also discuss the  outcome of the EU parliamentary elections.</p>

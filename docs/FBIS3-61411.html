			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. P. Shilov; UDC 546.799.6] </F>   [Abstract] Comparison of thermodynamic and optical  properties and stability in aqueous alkaline solutions of  heptavalent neptunium, plutonium, and americium, makes it  possible to predict certain properties of curium (VII). The  oxidation potential of a metal pair M(VII)/M(VI) in 1 mole per  liter NaOH increases almost linearly in the series Np-Pu-Am.  Extrapolation shows that the Cm(VII)/Cm(VI) potential is 1.3  volts. This value indicates that curium (VII) could at some time  exist in an alkaline solution. In the present work it is  postulated that on the basis of published data, preparation of  curium (VII) in cold alkaline solutions is possible by reaction  of strong oxidizers with curium (VI). Possible oxidizers include  ozone, the O[.sup]-[/] ion-radical, and any compound having  an oxidation potential of 1.3 volts in this medium.</p>

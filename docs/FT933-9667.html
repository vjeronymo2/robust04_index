			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Recovery for Russia 'in 1996' THE crisis of the Russian economy will continue well into next year, but economic recovery can be expected in 1996, according to the government's latest blueprint for market reform. This medium-term programme, approved on Friday, also claims to have digested last year's lessons, including the need for more social cushioning, more action against inflation, and selective rather than across-the-board support for industry. It lists unchanged strategic aims, such as land reform, and sets out essential institutional changes, such as the creation of an effective secondary share market. The programme expects the economy to begin stabilising in the second half of 1994, saying that the completion of mass privatisation by then will have improved company performance. It hopes for inflation to fall to 5-7 per cent a month next year, compared to 19 per cent last month. By the end of 1995, it expects the equivalent of 35 per cent of gross domestic product to be in state hands.</p>

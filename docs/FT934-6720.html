			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Lada producer borrows Dollars 150m from Swiss Avtovaz, the Russian producer of Lada cars, has obtained a Dollars 150m loan from a Swiss finance company in an unusual solution to Russian companies' difficulties in raising finance on western capital markets. The Swiss-based Forus Services said it had arranged the seven-year loan from its own funds and western banks including Banque Nationale de Paris, for on-lending to Avtovaz for the modernisation of its plant at Togliatti in Russia. Mr Rene Kuppers, Forus' general-manager, said guarantees presented to banks included receivables from exports of Lada cars to Latin America, the Middle East and Europe. But western banks themselves, which have been negotiating a rescheduling of debts owed by the former Soviet Union, have been reluctant to lend directly to Russian companies without guarantees from their own governments. Forus also has a 15 per cent stake in a new Russian consortium which plans to produce a new passenger car in co-operation with a western manufacturer which has yet to be selected.</p>

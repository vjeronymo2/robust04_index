			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Mario Segni, leader of the Pact for </F> Italy, by Bruno Vespa on 21 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Vespa] Mr. Segni, it seems that everyone is  sticking to their position. Some of you, a small number, want  to abstain from voting against the government, while the  majority want to be in opposition.    [Segni] Yes, that is the situation. A Berlusconi government  is being viewed in different ways. Of course, that does not  prevent us from working together in parliament or looking to the  forthcoming European elections.    [Vespa] But if the four MP's who want to abstain from voting  against Berlusconi do abstain, will they be allowed to stay in  the Pact for Italy or will they be thrown out?    [Segni] We will deal with this if it occurs; I do not know  what would happen. However, the important thing is to explain  the reasons for our positions concerning Berlusconi. It is not  a preconceived position. There are some matters which must be  settled before a favorable judgment can be made.</p>

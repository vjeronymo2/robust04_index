			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad </F> Bin-Jasim Al Thani, in Damascus, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, on  the "Dialogue From Afar" program; date not given--recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Al-Jundi] Reports from  Damascus say the foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration  states will discuss Arab reconciliation.    [Al Thani] The agenda is open for discussion. We hope this  subject will be discussed. Qatar's view on it is known.    [Al-Jundi] What is Qatar's position?    [Al Thani] Qatar unreservedly favors any Arab reconciliation  and closing Arab ranks.    [Al-Jundi] Does this meeting of the Damascus Declaration  foreign ministers have particular significance in light of the  recent Middle East developments?    [Al Thani] Perhaps the discussion of peace developments is  one of the most important topics at the meeting. But there are  other important issues to be discussed. We hope we can achieve  positive results.    [Al-Jundi] Speaking of the situation in the Middle East, is  the Gulf Cooperation Council now inclined to lift the Arab  boycott against Israel?    [Al Thani] The Arab boycott was introduced by an Arab League  decision. I believe the Arab League is the right venue at which  a decision on removing the boycott should be made. I am  discussing the primary boycott, the first-degree boycott. As  regards other degrees of boycott, Qatar will do what is  necessary when the other negotiating tracks, notably the Syrian  and Lebanese, are advanced.    [Al-Jundi] But Qatar was the first Gulf state to begin  telephone contacts with Israel. Is this an action distinct from  any by the Gulf Cooperation Council states?    [Al Thani] I cannot discuss distinction. We assumed this  position and others can judge it. But we made the decision for  humanitarian reasons. We opened telephone links with the West  Bank and Gaza for humanitarian reasons. There are many  Palestinians in Qatar who want to contact their families  directly. It is a humanitarian issue.    [Al-Jundi] What can the Gulf Cooperation Council offer to  support the Palestinian-Israeli agreement?    [Al Thani] As you know, the Gulf Cooperation Council has  helped the Palestinian cause a great deal. I believe that if  the Council helped in the days of war and estrangement, it will  spare no effort to help during the peace process.    [Al-Jundi] Have you in the Gulf agreed to provide specific  amounts of money to support the Gaza-Jericho agreement?    [Al Thani] No, we have agreed on no such thing.    [Al-Jundi] Thank you.    [Al Thani] Thank you.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacek Pawlicki: "Eastern Barrier? Trade With </F> Former USSR"]    [Text]Over the next years, Russia will keep reducing  its imports more and more because of the burden of paying back  interest rates on foreign credits. So a program of expansion  based on an exchange of oil and natural gas (which are  strategically important to us) in return for food surpluses,  should be put aside and instead, one must seriously think over  strategies for regaining Eastern markets.    Hopes expressed by left-wing politicians for rebuilding  trade  with Russia may come to nothing. All the signs are that Russia  -- which is entangled in its own political and economic problems  -- has practically no interest in expanding its trade with  Poland.    It is not known whether the "breakthrough" visit by Prime  Minister Aleksandr Chernomyrdin [as published] to Warsaw --  which was announced for May -- will take place in June. There is  more and more talk of July, but that will also depend on  Russia's internal situation which keeps changing radically daily.    Zbigniew Okonski, deputy foreign economic cooperation  minister, who was subjected to a "confession" before the Sejm  Foreign Economic Relations Commission on 25 May, admitted that  Chernomyrdin's visit would not be a step further in resolving  the most important issues for both sides, that is, mutual debt  levels, and a modern system for payments in trade.  <H5>  Mounting Discrepancies </H5>   For now, all documents which are strategically important to  us, are still subject to negotiation. The treaty on economic  cooperation, which was signed in August 1993, and supposed to  reverse the trend in mutual relations, has not even been  ratified by Moscow. There is still no trade protocol for 1994.  The Russians refuse to agree to use the method of barter  applied in the past: Their natural gas in return for our food  products.    There is still no agreement -- which was announced by the  two  prime ministers in Moscow in April -- concerning mutual supply  of strategic merchandise in the 1994-2000 period.    The Russian concept of reexports does not allow for signing  an agreement on military and technical cooperation. It is the  same case with a protocol on mutual supplies of special  equipment: We submitted orders for $25 million worth of  merchandise, while the Russians are offering merchandise for  just $4 million.    There is no news concerning a speedy settlement of mutual  debts. The Polish and Russian commissions are said to be working  on this very hard, but the issue will definitely not be resolved  soon.    The Polish Finance Ministry is not eager to be hasty,  anyway.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which was  willing to financially coparticipate in reconstructing the  system of Polish-Russian mutual payments, finally gave up since  it was not able to find reliable partners among Russian banks.    Negotiations are still going on concerning the presence of  our fishing boats in the Sea of Okhotsk. It has been agreed  that part of them will leave, but the Russians do not feel fully  satisfied yet.  <H5>  Bad Memories </H5>   Many companies seem to think that Russia will gladly  exchange  its natural resources for our canned meat or pickled cucumbers.  But past experience contradicts that. The famous "natural gas  for food" transaction, implemented in 1992, may be a warning in  that regard.    In return for food and agricultural products from Poland, we  were supposed to receive 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas,  with a possibility of increasing supply to 2 billion.    Due to misunderstandings on both sides, just 0.5 billion  cubic meters of gas (worth $44.5 million) was supplied. On our  part, the following was shipped East: 65,500 tonnes of apples,  93,500 tonnes of potatoes, 500 tonnes of garlic, 2,500 tonnes of  pickled cucumbers, and 1,000 tonnes of canned food products. By  the way, the last item mentioned did not come directly from  Poland.    "There could be have been much more of the food" -- Deputy  Minister Okonski argued. According to the Foreign Economic  Cooperation Ministry [MWGzZ], the "natural gas for food"  contract backfired because the Russians wanted to receive  foreign-made merchandise in addition to Polish products, but  "they were not treated with understanding."  <H5>  Hope About Credits </H5>   Both MWGzZ and exporters have high hopes about a draft law  which was just approved by the government, concerning insurance  on export contracts. This year, the government intends to spend  25 trillion zlotys (about $1 billion) on the guarantees, but it  is not known whether -- due to quite a high risk factor --  Russia will be on the list of countries to which exports will be  insured by the Corporation for Export Credit Insurance [KUKE].    Fortunately, there is still Belarus, the Baltic countries,  and the Asian post-Soviet republics. For example, an agreement  has already been initialled in the Finance Ministry concerning a  $30 million credit for exports of our merchandise to Kazakhstan.    Poland will definitely not be able to tie up substantial  means in credits and insuring trade with the East. Germany  could afford to "sink" 18 billion German Marks in Russia (this  is how much unpaid bills are worth -- GAZETA WYBORCZA's note).  Our KUKE will never be the German Hermes whose Russian  liabilities reach 5 billion German Marks.</p>

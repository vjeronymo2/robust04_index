			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: FTC drops inquiry into Intel The US Federal Trade Commission yesterday formally dropped its three-year investigation into unfair trading practices at Intel, the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors. The news came after the market had closed and was too late to reverse a Dollars 1 1/8 fall in the company's share price, to Dollars 53 3/8 , in the wake of second-quarter figures announced on Monday. In a letter to Intel president Mr Andrew Grove, Ms Mary Lou Steptoe, acting director of the FTC's bureau of competition, said of its investigation: 'On further review of this matter, it now appears that no further action is warranted by the Commission. Accordingly . . . the investigation is closed.' The FTC, which has never previously confirmed the existence of the investigation, said that it had looked into possible 'unlawful tying or exclusive dealing practices or other unfair methods of competition' involving the marketing, distribution and sale of the company's microprocessors and other computer parts. The company, which has a large share of the market for microprocessors for personal computers, continues to face private anti-trust actions brought by two of its competitors. Mr Tom Dunlap, general counsel to Intel, welcomed the FTC decision, adding that the company intended to continue with its 'very aggressive, but very fair intellectual property programme'. The investigation had cost the company 'many millions of dollars,' he said, but had not resulted in any changes in business policy. The decision to end the investigation had been generally expected in the market. Mr Dunlap expressed confidence that the decision would lead to the ending of private actions brought against the company, since these had been based on the same documents that the company had disclosed to the FTC.</p>

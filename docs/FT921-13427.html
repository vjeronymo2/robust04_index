			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Recovery hopes hit by drop in sales AN UNEXPECTEDLY sharp drop in retail sales volumes last month has made the chances of a consumer-led recovery ahead of the general election less likely. Figures released yesterday by the Central Statistical Office showed that retail sales volumes in December fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 per cent, compared with the previous month, giving a 0.4 per cent year-on-year decline. The drop followed a rise in November of 1.3 per cent. Heavy price discounting by shops failed to revive consumer spending before Christmas, increasing pressure on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to provide a stimulus to consumer confidence in the March Budget. Over the fourth quarter of 1991, sales were 0.25 per cent up on the same period of 1990. Sales in the second half of 1991 were 0.2 per cent up on the first half of the year, but unchanged on the second half of 1990. The CSO said the December figure was 'particularly uncertain' and may have been artificially depressed because of a statistical quirk which inflated the November figure by up to half a percentage point. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist for Midland Montagu, said the figures were awful and 'a clear sign that the recession is continuing.' The Treasury said it was disappointed that sales had not recovered as it had hoped, but said the broader picture was one of flat retail sales. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the figures exposed the government's incompetence. 'Despite the repeated promises of recovery and the constant claims of resurgent economic confidence by the prime minister and his chancellor, it is quite clear the government is still in the grip of a paralysis which prevents it taking the action necessary to bring us out of recession,' he said. The figures from the CSO confirmed the findings of a Confederation of British Industry distributive trades survey, published yesterday, which showed that while high street stores thought this Christmas was more active than in 1990, the increase was still below expectations.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Opening speech by Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben </F> Ali in Tunis on 2 April -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of the God, the compassionate, the  merciful. Your Excellencies: It give me great pleasure to  welcome you to your country Tunisia, which is happy to welcome  you as its respected brothers. Today, Tunisia is once again  proud to host the sixth session of the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU]  Presidential Council. On your behalf, please permit me to  welcome brother Liamine Zeroual, the head of the Algerian state,  on the occasion of his joining our council. We would like to  renew our congratulations to him on his assumption of this noble  responsibility. We wish him every success and all progress in  the interest of the brotherly Algerian people. We are sure that  his competence, virtues, and belief in Maghreban unity will  strongly contribute toward giving more impetus to the march of  our union.    I am also pleased to welcome brother militant Yasir 'Arafat,  the president of the state of Palestine. Through him, we send  humble greetings to the brotherly Palestinian people, and renew  our support and backing for their heroic struggle for the  recovery of their legitimate rights. [passage omitted]    Your Excellencies: The AMU is committed to working for the  sake of rapprochement and harmony amongst nations; it stresses  dialogue and negotiations as a method for solving conflicts; and  it is loyal to the ties of brotherhood and solidarity within the  Maghreban family. As a result, the endeavors of the AMU have  continued uninterrupted on the path for finding a peaceful,  just, and honorable solution to the conflict existing between  the sisterly Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah and  certain Western states. Maghreban efforts have concentrated on  a persistent search for a political solution to this crisis  within the framework of respecting international legality and  the protection of the dignity and sovereignty of the Libyan  people; we also warned against the repercussions of the its  suffering as a result of the continuous sanctions, in addition  to the negative outcome of this ongoing crisis.    The Maghreban efforts have been joined to those of the Arab  family regarding this issue within the seven-man committee; the  moves were coordinated on all international levels, mainly at  the African and Islamic levels, the Nonaligned Movement, and the  United Nations. It is only natural that the AMU should continue  its contribution to all endeavors, on all international  platforms, to help find a solution to this crisis and reach a  just and honorable political solution.

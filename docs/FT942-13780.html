			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Nedlloyd sees return to profit this year Nedlloyd, the Dutch-based shipping and road haulage group, said it expected to post a profit this year for the first time since 1991, helped by a further recovery at its ocean-shipping line. Ocean-shipping recovered strongly last year, enabling the group to compensate for losses in its European road haulage business. Net losses in 1993 nearly doubled to Fl 12m (Dollars 59m) from Fl 58m in 1992. However, if non-recurring items such as restructuring costs and extraordinary gains are excluded, the underlying trend shows a narrowing of group losses to Fl 50m from Fl 73m the year before. 'The turnround is well under way,' Mr Leo Berndsen, chairman, said. He said the company, which has not paid a dividend since 1989, would resume payments to shareholders as soon as it was 'responsible' to do so. In shipping, Nedlloyd benefited from higher cargo volumes, particularly on its services between Europe and Asia-Pacific. Operating results in shipping swung into a profit of Fl 39m from a loss of Fl 2m in 1992. In road haulage, the company was hit by the creation of the European single market in early 1993, which reduced demand for its customs services at European borders, and by the recession in Germany. The road sector suffered an operating loss of Fl 4m last year, compared with a Fl 19m profit in 1992. Nedlloyd managed to reduce interest-bearing debt by nearly Fl 300m in 1993, putting it on target to reach its goal of a total Fl 500m reduction by late 1995. This, in turn, has led the company to end its attempts to sell off Neddrill, its profitable offshore drilling subsidiary, Mr Berndsen said. He announced that Nedlloyd would launch quarterly corporate reporting starting in May. Until now the company has published half-year and full-year figures.</p>

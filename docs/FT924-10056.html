			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Fabius tries to limit damage of Aids scandal LEADERS of France's ruling Socialist party are seeking constitutional changes to make ministers more answerable to the law, in an attempt to prevent the scandal over Aids-contaminated blood from tainting their party in the run-up to next spring's elections. Mr Laurent Fabius, secretary general of the Socialist party, has said he wants to clear himself before 'an honorary jury' of allegations that responsibility for the infection of some 1,200 haemophiliacs with Aids-infected blood went to the very top of the government he headed in 1984-86. The sentencing last month of three senior doctors to four-year prison terms provoked an outcry, particularly among the blood transfusion victims and French doctors, that ministers had escaped their responsibility. Mr Fabius, and health ministers in his government, gave evidence in the trial, but under the constitution the only sanction ministers face is impeachment by parliament. Mr Fabius said he would table a constitutional reform scrapping the rarely-used impeachment procedure, except in cases of treason, and applying 'ordinary justice to everyone'. In the meantime, he was ready to submit himself to the judgment of 'an honorary jury of independent personalities'. Opposition politicians, who would prefer to impeach Mr Fabius if only they could rally the support, described the 'honorary jury' idea as a smokescreen. Greece yesterday began an investigation to determine if Aids-tainted French blood products were given to Greek haemophiliacs in late 1985, AP reports from Athens. The investigation comes as several doctors said that nearly 40 per cent of Greece's 1,000 haemophiliacs were probably infected with the Aids virus in 1985.</p>

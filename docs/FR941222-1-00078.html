			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4. Economic Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The following economic impacts potentially are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> overestimated <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a result of inconsistencies in the reporting in the RCRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3007 Questionnaire responses. Some facilities were found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have reported production quantities on a pure product basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while reporting the average selling price per pound on a dilute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product basis. This results in an underestimation of revenues,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a result of reduced production volumes, and an overestimation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of economic impacts. In addition, some of the volume of several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the wastestreams is for co-managed wastes. The values of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production for the co-generated products were not available and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus, further underestimated revenues which resulted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overestimated economic impacts. Economic impacts were evaluated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on incremental, annualized compliance costs discounted at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an after-tax rate of 7 percent over a 20-year period. Of the 49  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities 9 facilities may incur potential ``significant economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , bear compliance costs that would require product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost increases of at least 5 percent) with one of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities facing product-line discontinuation. Sixteen of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 facilities are estimated to incur potential significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts assuming possible future costs for the high-cost LDR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative. Economic ratios indicate potential closure or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product-line discontinuation for 4 of the 16 significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected facilities. Under the low-cost LDR alternative, 15 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 49 facilities are estimated to incur potential significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impacts. Two of the 15 significantly affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities are estimated to incur closure or product-line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discontinuation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Benefits of Listings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One objective of a population analysis is to estimate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of cancer cases that could be avoided as a result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the proposed rule. People drinking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated water from residential wells located near the source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of contamination, people eating home-grown vegetables  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated by blowing dust or vapors, and people breathing air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated by a disposal unit are the potentially exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population for this rule. The Agency did not estimate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population risks from current practices or the incremental risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction from future actions as a result of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation; however, preliminary analysis suggests that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incremental risk in terms of cancer cases avoided is expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be near zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One benefit associated with this rulemaking is to place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestreams the Agency has determined could pose a risk to human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and the environment into the hazardous waste management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. When wastestreams are placed in this system, the risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with their disposal is minimized by the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency, however, has historical information that shows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage to ground water and other sensitive environments has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred during the management of wastes from the dye and pigment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing operations. At ten dye and pigment facilities, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of ground water has been adversely affected by waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management activities, typically unlined waste trenches, aeration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basins, and impoundments. One dye company had to purchase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deeds to three nearby residences and a gas station because VOC-contaminated ground water originating from the plant had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated surrounding drinking water wells. At another dye  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility, a contaminated ground-water plume migrated under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residential houses bordering the site. The residential wells,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for swimming pools and irrigation systems in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighborhood, were condemned because of chemical contamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ground water was contaminated from land treatment of dye  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater being sprayed onto a field, and passing through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> layer of clay. Soil contamination near drum storage pads or drum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wash areas has been documented at 7 dye facilities. As a result,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the leachate from these soils possibly contributed to the ground-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water contamination associated with many of the sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concentrations of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been found in soils surrounding an on-site landfill at a dye  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. Finally, dye and pigment facilities are found on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Superfund National Priority List; further evidence that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mismanagement of dye and pigment wastes have the potential to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yield threats of concern to human health. In summary, although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to quantify precisely, a benefit of today's proposal is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prevention of additional or similar incidents occurring from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar management practices of dye and pigment wastes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially could degrade the quality of ground water or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitive natural resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the reduction of human health risk associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the mismanagement of dye and pigment wastes proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing in this rulemaking, there are a number of other benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are even more difficult to quantify.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Subtitle C management framework for generators and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted treatment storage and disposal facilities establishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for hazardous waste handling, management, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remediation that: Reduce ecological risks, reduce natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resource damage, reduce the likelihood and severity of accidents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improve worker safety, promote facility-wide remedial programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insure that adequate financial assurance is established to handle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective closure of waste management units, increase public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation, improve information availability on waste quantity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and movement, ensure minimum uniform national standards, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> create incentives for pollution prevention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Ecological and Natural Resource Damage Reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The risk assessment for this listing has focused on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human health risks associated with plausible management of dye  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pigment wastes. An additional concern, given the proximity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of several facilities to surface waters and their associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wetland systems, is the potential for ecological damages to biota  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhabiting surface waters and wetlands. In some cases migration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the surface water may be occurring via groundwater. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments regarding the potential for ecological damages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the wastes proposed for listing in today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to direct ecological and human health damage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is evidence from EPA's contaminant fate and transport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modelling and case studies of ground water, surface water, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soil degradation. While use of and human exposure to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural resources may not be occurring now, their use in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future could be limited if they are contaminated. The Subtitle C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste management program will limit future releases and prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural resource damages. These benefits have not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantified. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2ND INMATE IN WEEK ESCAPES FROM COUNTY JAIL IN CASTAIC  </P> <P> For the second time in a week, an inmate at Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho  broke through wire-mesh screening over a maximum-security jail recreation area  and escaped from the Castaic compound, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department reported.  </P> <P> Kirk Anderson, 27, of Van Nuys remained at large Monday after escaping from the  1,780-inmate East Facility between 8:30 and 9 p.m. Sunday, Sheriff's Lt. James  Valdez said. Anderson had served about three weeks of a one-year sentence for  carrying a concealed weapon and an unrelated conviction for filing a false  financial statement, said Deputy Roger Hom, a department spokesman.  </P> <P> Anderson was scheduled to appear Aug. 14 in Van Nuys Municipal Court on a  burglary charge, Hom said.  </P> <P> Valdez said Anderson broke through the wire mesh while standing on an exercise  bench that he had placed atop a weightlifting device in the courtyard  recreation area. He pulled back the screen where it meets the courtyard wall,  climbed through the opening, walked along the roof of the structure and jumped  at least 12 feet to the ground, Valdez said.  </P> <P> He then scaled a 12-foot-high chain-link fence topped with razor wire that  encloses the East Facility and climbed over a second, smaller fence that  surrounds the entire three-jail Pitchess compound, Valdez said.  </P> <P> Valdez said other inmates were playing volleyball nearby and may have helped  Anderson escape from the lighted area. After Sunday's escape, officials planned  to seal the edge of the wire mesh to the wall firmly so that it can't be pried  back, he said.  </P> <P> The escape was similar to one that occurred July 30 at the 1,600-inmate North  Facility, considered the compound's most secure structure. Rodolfo Corona, 22,  remains at large after he cut a hole in wire mesh over an enclosed recreation  area, jumped off the building's roof and scaled a 20-foot-high fence topped  with razor wire, authorities said.  </P> <P> Corona was awaiting a preliminary hearing on robbery and kidnaping charges. He  faced up to 30 years in prison, authorities said.  </P> <P> Valdez said he did not know whether Anderson copied Corona's escape. Inmates  have access to newspapers and television. "If it was on the news, certainly  they would have seen it. There's no way for us to tell," Valdez said.  </P> <P> Valdez said the last escape from the East Facility was in March, 1985, when  seven prisoners, including a murderer, used a pipe to force open a steel screen  on a window and lowered themselves to the ground with bedsheets that had been  tied together.  </P> <P> All seven were captured soon afterward.  </P></p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (1): New word in the language - Privatisation has quickly gained a place in the financial lexicon with state-owned banks among the first destined for disposal. Will big foreign banks be allowed to bid? Not even the timing has been set yet SUDDENLY, an unfamiliar, and until recently, slightly suspect, word has entered Italian banking vocabulary. Privatisation, a pillar of the new Amato government's strategy to tackle the huge budget deficit, has quickly gained a place in the financial lexicon. State-owned banks are among the first assets for disposal. Selling the three banking stakes controlled by IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, will go a substantial way to plugging the gaping hole in the overborrowed group's accounts, which now show consolidated debts of over L60,000bn. Disposals of other companies such as Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the big Rome-based financial services and insurance group, or subsidiaries of capital-hungry Banca Nazionale del Lavoro could change the banking scene even further. Privatisation could also usher in a new era in Italian banking by freeing banks from decades of political interference. That would liberate management to make key decisions on expansion or takeovers on the basis of market forces, rather than traditional political horse trading and the need to share patronage among the main parties. Already, liberalised rules on branching mean that consumers have gained far greater choice in their banking relationships by subjecting the banks to increasing competition. The past year has already seen limited steps in the direction of the market, with the flotation of minority stakes in two public sector banks. Banco di Napoli, the first, quoted around 20 per cent of its ordinary shares in November 1991. Last January, the process took a hefty step forward with the L1,250bn initial public offering of 20 per cent of the shares in Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, now Italy's biggest bank in terms of assets. The prospect of selling Credito Italiano, the first of the IRI banks due to be privatised, Banca Commerciale Italiana and IRI's remaining 35 per cent stake in Banca di Roma has already created a new wave of uncertainty in banking circles. So far, there are far more questions than answers. Who will buy the shares? Will the government opt for broad public flotations, possibly buttressed by a 'hard core' of domestic institutional investors, or look to single buyers? If the latter, will the Bank of Italy tolerate purchases by big foreign banks keen to expand in Italy, which are the most obvious, but least acceptable, bidders? Or will the central bank pull out all the stops to encourage further concentration of the domestic banking system before letting outsiders pick up some of Italy's financial flagships? Not even the simplest question, timing, has been answered yet, although many bankers expect IRI to sell its 67 per cent of Credito Italiano in the early months of 1993. Privatisations, due to raise L27,000bn for the government over the next three years, also imply other changes. None more so than in stimulating the stock market. In spite of a series of new laws reforming share trading, banning insider dealing and setting out new rules on takeover bids, the Milan bourse has remained a sorry place this year. Turnover, although stimulated in the past two months by speculation over possible privatisation stocks, remains relatively low, if above the depressed levels of July and August. Not even a concession by the government  -to suspend the highly unpopular capital gains tax until next September for most private investors - has been enough to revive sentiment. If the creation of a broad share-owning public is the government's aim, then stronger action will be necessary to boost equity trading. Attempts to introduce tax breaks for long-term private investors have so far proved confused, while legislation to create pension funds, which would pump new institutional money into the market, is moving forward, but not fast enough. However, ministers still baulk at the biggest single reform to redress the imbalance between government bonds, which retain strong tax advantages for investors, and shares. Removing some of the tax breaks on treasury bills - the most popular form of short-term savings instrument - could greatly bolster the equity market. But tampering with the flow of private savings into funding the government deficit is a reform that few ministers would risk taking. Meanwhile, the prospect of privatisation has added to the already considerable uncertainty surrounding many of Italy's leading banks by throwing new, and unexpected, cards into the air. The process of concentration to create fewer, bigger banks with nationwide coverage and the fullest range of services has been edging ahead under two champions. While San Paolo has consolidated its position in wholesale banking through the takeover of Crediop, the treasury-owned medium to long-term lending institution, the new Banca di Roma has already become Italy's biggest bank in terms of branches. Formed from the three-way merger of the Rome savings bank - very much in the driver's seat - Banco di Santo Spirito and Banco di Roma, the new group is expanding aggressively. Yet even its horizons are clouded by the question of who will buy IRI's 35 per cent stake. Similar uncertainty surrounds many other big public sector banks, irrespective of whether they are on the privatisation list or not. Plans to sell IMI to Italy's savings banks, led by Cariplo of Milan, may reach fruition by the end of 1992 after almost two years of volatile talks. Yet even in the closing weeks before the government's year-end deadline for the deal, which is a major element in this year's scheduled income from asset sales, new doubts have complicated the transaction. Almost as much uncertainty troubles BNL, the big treasury-owned bank whose reputation is still reeling from the disclosure three years ago of huge, unauthorised loans to Iraq from its Atlanta branch. Although BNL's need for a recapitalisation has grown no less urgent with the passage of time, the source of its essential new funds remains as fuzzy as ever. The problems at BNL, which has gone some way to improving earnings and removing the stigma of Atlanta under its new management, has been exacerbated by the well-publicised decision by Ina, the state-owned insurance group which is another prime privatisation candidate, to divest its 20 per cent stake in the bank. Disposing of the BNL shares is a virtual precondition to floating Ina, which also has a substantial holding in IMI. Rather than throwing in its lot with BNL, as was widely expected, Ina decided earlier this year to seal a cross-marketing pact for banking and insurance products with Banca di Roma. The alliance, one of a string of recent agreements in 'bancassurance' which have already linked Generali and RAS with BCI and San Paolo with the Fondiaria group, is likely to be followed by other bank-insurance ties. Such alliances highlight the degree to which many of the pieces in Italy's new jigsaw of financial services are closely interlinked. And at some stage, the authorities will also need to turn their attention to the south, where Banco di Napoli, Banco di Sicilia and Banco di Sardegna all probably need to find new partners. Matters are no clearer in the private sector. Recent weeks have been decisive for Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), now Italy's biggest private sector bank, following the decision by two of the five institutions controlling its shares to pull out. Meanwhile, Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura, previously the country's largest private sector financial institution, continues to be beset by poor profitability which has raised growing doubts about the ability of its controlling shareholder to maintain the bank's independence. Against this background, Italy's banks face the problem of declining loan quality as a result of the growing recession. The fall in corporate profits and the rising payments difficulties of business customers mean that banks will have to make much higher lending provisions when they report their 1992 results. Add to that the prospect of hefty write-downs on government bond portfolios caused by the collapse in prices ahead of September's currency turmoil and the likelihood of sharp losses on the value of banks' equity holdings, and the overall picture emerges of Italian banking at the crossroads, facing great opportunities one way and unprecedented difficulties and uncertainty in the other.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Luyan (0491 7627 3601): "What Does </F> Tax Reform Mean to Foreign Enterprises?"]    [Text] According to a decision adopted by the National  People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, the provisional  regulations on the value-added tax, consumption tax, and  business tax will apply to foreign-invested enterprises and  foreign enterprises in China as of 1 January this year;  meanwhile, the combined industrial and commercial tax is to be  rescinded. The introduction of the new tax system applying to  foreign enterprises has caused various repercussions at home and  abroad. What does this tax reform actually mean to foreign  enterprises? This we need to analyze, meticulously and  thoroughly.    Since 1979, China has applied different tax systems to  foreign enterprises and Chinese enterprises. The reason for  this practice was that preferential treatment was offered to  foreign business firms purely to stabilize their tax system,  given the higher tax rate in China after the reform and opening  up and the fact that a tax reform was in progress. In this  connection, the combined industrial and commercial tax which was  first introduced in 1958 on a trial basis has been applied to  foreign enterprises. As for Chinese enterprises, the  value-added tax, product tax, and business tax have been applied  to them since 1984. As a result, Chinese enterprises and  foreign-funded enterprises in China have been bearing different  tax burdens for many years past and increasing amounts of tax  have been duplicated through different channels. This was  unfavorable to export trade for foreign enterprises and had an  adverse effect on economic development, therefore, a tax reform  became a must.    The new tax system, molded in accordance with international  common practice, is to introduce a regulated circulating tax  system with value-added tax as the core and the consumption tax  and business tax as auxiliaries. This new system has embodied  the principle of fairness in terms of the tax burden, and that  of competition on an equal footing, and has maintained the  continuity, rationality, and stability with regard to the tax  system concerning foreign interests.    Specifically speaking, after the tax reform, taxes  concerning  foreign interests will be divided into 12 categories, namely:  Value-added tax, consumption tax, business tax, resource tax,  tax on value added to land, stamp duty, slaughter tax, urban  landed properties tax, levy on vehicle and ship licenses,  enterprise income tax, personal income tax, and contract tax.  Of these taxes, only the tax on value added to land is new.  The circulating taxes, consisting of the value-added tax,  consumption tax, and business tax which can be traced to the  field of production and commodity circulation, are a major tax  category accounting for a large proportion of tax revenue. A  special feature of the value-added tax under the new tax system  is to prevent duplicated tax and to make sure that the sum total  of tax income from all channels equals the total amount of all  taxes levied on commodities. The basic rate of the value-added  tax is 17 percent and a unified 13-percent low rate has been set  for all the taxes on daily necessities, products for  agricultural use, and cultural goods, in contrast to the 14.5  percent rate for the former combined industrial and commercial  tax. The main purpose of the consumption tax is to adjust the  consumption structure and to guide the public's consumption  pattern, with high tax rates applying only to tobacco, alcohol,  cosmetics, and jewelry. The business tax rate generally ranges  from 3 to 5 percent, except for certain show business items, let  alone the fact that the former combined industrial and  commercial tax actually contained a part which represented  business tax. Findings from a survey conducted among thousands  of foreign enterprises in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai,  Tianjin, Guangzhou, Dalian, and Wuhan indicate that, after the  new tax system was introduced, the tax burden decreased or  remained the same in most foreign enterprises, with a small  number of foreign enterprises' tax burden increasing slightly  and the general level of tax contribution by foreign enterprises  throughout the country remained unchanged. Thus, the state's  financial revenue is ensured without increasing the burden on  enterprises.    Some people have queried whether the tax reform will give  rise to a new imbalance since the new regulations only apply to  foreign enterprises founded after 1 January 1994, while the old  regulations will continue to apply to those which had already  been founded on or before 31 December 1993. To be honest, we  must say that this is an objective fact. However, we should  approach this issue from a comprehensive viewpoint. Any tax  reform must have a definite effective date and must not be made  indefinitely retroactive. Otherwise such a reform can hardly be  carried out. Also, we apply the old regulations to old  enterprises just because they were established in light of the  results of past feasibility studies and investment return  estimations based on the old tax system. If the new tax system  was applied indiscriminately to both old and new enterprises, it  would unfavorably affect old enterprises. Therefore it is  necessary to give some preferential treatment to the latter  within a certain grace period.    In order to retain continuity of tax related to foreign  interests, the spirit of a unified tax system but no less  preferential treatment has been pursued in the tax reform. The  regulations governing exports remain unchanged in principle. No  circulating tax will be levied on exports by foreign enterprises  except for a few products where state regulations provide for  it. Goods imported by foreign enterprises within the quota  corresponding to the scale of their investment projects will be  subject to tax exemption, including machinery, equipment, and  component parts which enterprises need for daily operation, as  well as raw and processed materials which are needed for  manufacturing products to be exported. Goods which are imported  with special permission are subject to tax reduction or  exemption. No circulating tax is to be levied on goods imported  by foreign-funded enterprises operating in special economic  zones [SEZ] and on products manufactured and marketed in SEZ's,  except for such items as mineral oils, tobacco, and alcohol, on  which the circulating tax is levied at a 50-percent discount.  The preferential policy regarding the circulating tax remains  unchanged for bonded zones. Financial institutions operated  with foreign capital, or jointly run with Chinese and foreign  capital, set up in SEZ's and the Pudong new zone with approval,  will be exempt from circulating tax for five years from their  day of inauguration. As for those foreign enterprises which  have yet to be established for which approval was already  obtained before 31 December 1993, since they will have to pay  all the value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax under  the new tax system--which implies that they will have to pay  more--the extra tax amount thereby incurred by them will be  returned, within a period of not more than 5 years, with the  approval of the tax authorities. Therefore, the new tax system  will not affect foreign enterprises significantly.    By and large, the current tax reform is an integrated  structural reform of overall significance. Domestically  speaking, the reform is for the purpose of unifying the tax  system, making the tax distribution fairer, improving the  investment environment in the country, and suiting the needs of  the establishment and development of the socialist market  economy. Internationally speaking, it will enable China to meet  the requirements of international common practice. Nowadays,  almost none of the countries in the world are simultaneously  applying two different tax systems to domestic tax payers and to  foreign ones respectively. Article 3 of Chapter 2 of the GATT  has specially provided for domestic taxes and equal treatment to  citizens and aliens alike under domestic regulations. This  article not only demands that the tax burden on foreign-funded  enterprises be equal to that on domestic enterprises but also  that restrictions on the operation of foreign-funded enterprises  be relaxed so that they enjoy rights equal to domestic  enterprises. Thus, whether viewed from internal or external  concerns, unification of the tax system is necessary for the  development of foreign-funded enterprises.</p>

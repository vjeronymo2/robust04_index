			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Redundancies push Amexco into largest quarterly loss since 1990 AMERICAN Express revealed a Dollars 205m third-quarter net loss after a heavy Dollars 342m after-tax restructuring charge related to 4,800 planned redundancies and other measures in its core travel-related services (TRS) division. The group's deficit was the biggest in a quarterly period since the disastrous losses suffered by its Shearson Lehman investment banking and securities subsidiary in early 1990. It underscored what Standard and Poor's, the rating agency, termed a negative outlook for the company. Although the agency affirmed debt ratings, S&amp;P noted American Express's problems with credit quality and competition in the card market. The American Express loss, which compares with a Dollars 31m net profit a year ago, was caused by red ink in three of its most important divisions. The TRS division loss was Dollars 187.5m, although operating earnings were Dollars 155m before the restructuring charge. The American Express Bank loss was Dollars 29.8m, caused by staff reductions and by a jump in bad debt provisions for property loans in the UK - from Dollars 8m a year ago to Dollars 67m. American Express's share of Shearson Lehman's loss was Dollars 37.4m. The investment bank and brokerage house said its quarterly loss was Dollars 25m, compared with net profits of Dollars 63m a year ago. The reduction of the TRS workforce by 4,800 represents 9 per cent of the division's 53,000 employees. Other costs were attributed to reorganised product groupings and the need to cut expenses. Loss per share in the third quarter was 45 cents, against net earnings of 5 cents a year ago. The losses slashed American Express's net earnings for the first nine months to Dollars 380m, compared with Dollars 551m in the same period of last year.</p>

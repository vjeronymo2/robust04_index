			<p>BFN     [Text] The upper chamber of the Canadian parliament, the  Senate, has given its approval to a bill that will allow  Canadian Coast Guard and other agencies to arrest pirate  fishermen on the high seas.    The bill was introduced in the lower chamber, the House of  Commons, just two days ago. It has already been given royal  assent, which means it has now passed into law.    With passage of the new law Canada claims the right to stop  and arrest vessels and crew suspected of fishing illegally  outside Canada's 200-mile limit. The move by Ottawa is directed  at vessels with no nationality or those that sail under flags of  convenience.    Canada is trying to protect dwindling fish stocks off its  east coast, which have cost thousands of Canadian jobs.</p>

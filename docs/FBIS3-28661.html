Prasong was  speaking after discussions with his Laotian counterpart Somsavat  Lengsavat, who is making an official visit at the invitation of  the Foreign Ministry. [passage omitted]    Prasong said he told Somsavat that Thailand preferred the  first Laotian consulate to be in Nong Khai.    An informed source said Prasong's proposal was appropriate  as  the bridge would become the pre-eminent entry point for both  countries.    The source said Vientiane had initially considered either  Nong Khai or Khon Kaen for the consulate.    Somsavat will pass on the Thai proposal to his government  for  approval. He told guests at yesterday's ceremony that his visit  will help to strengthen bilateral relations and that Laotians  are excited about the opening of the bridge and HM the King  visiting the country. Somsavat, accompanied by Prasong,  yesterday evening was granted an audience with the King at  Chitlada Palace. According to the source, Somsavat was to have  informed the King of his schedule for inaugurating the bridge.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (AFP) -- The Chinese ministry of  security said Monday that police would continue "investigations"  of leading dissidents Xu Wenli and Wei Jingsheng.    "The police investigations of Xu Wenli and Wei Jingsheng  continue," a ministry spokesman told AFP. An investigation of  Tong Yi, Wei's secretary, is also underway, he added.    The spokesman did not indicate why the three dissidents were  being held or where they were. But the Chinese Foreign Affairs  Ministry said Monday that Xu had been detained by police for  having "violated the terms of his parole."    Xu, 49, leader of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement in  Beijing, was released on parole in May 1993 after 12 years in  prison.    The dissident was initially picked up on Thursday, on the  arrival of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in Beijing.  He was released, but was again arrested Friday, his wife, Kang  Tong, said.    His arrest comes a week after his friend and another leading  dissident, Wei Jingsheng, was detained on accusations of having  "committed new crimes." Wei received a 14-year sentence for his  role in the Democracy Wall movement.    Tong Yi, Wei's secretary, was detained Monday in Beijing.    "China public security organs summoned Xu Wenli according to  law for he has violated relevant regulations on parole," a  spokesman from the ministry told AFP. "This entirely falls  within China's sovereignty and has nothing to do with China's  relations with other countries," the spokesman said.    The arrest attracted considerable international attention,  coming as it did during Balladur's visit to China, which ended  in Shanghai on Sunday.</p>

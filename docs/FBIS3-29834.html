Their accessories including the traction motors, elastic  wheels, electric control devices were domestically eeveloped.    The operation of the streetcar is automated and the shock  from the rails is minimized with the car body supported by many  elastic devices.    Its operation is very safe with three brake systems  available  at high and low speed and in emergency.    The traction motor being large in capacity, it can draw a  trailing car.    The metro car is automatically operated and its body is  supported by pneumatic springs to reduce the shock from the  rails.    And the newly developed compressor leaves nothing to be  desired in the brake system.</p>

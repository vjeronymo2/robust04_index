			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Resignation over shipbuilding row East Germany's shipbuilding crisis has claimed its first political victim, Mr Alfred Gomolka, prime minister of the economically troubled state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern - adding to the woes of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU). Mr Gomolka is to resign today after losing a vote of confidence at the weekend within the CDU. He fell from favour after dismissing his justice minister, Mr Ulrich Born, who had criticised his support for the sale to western shipbuilders of three large shipyards. The dispute centred on Mr Gomolka's unpopular move to privatise the shipyards.</p>

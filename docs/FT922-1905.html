			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Aerial power A Russian Sukhoi Su 27 fighter, which Nato has codenamed Flanker, was put through its paces above London's Thames Barrier yesterday, Daniel Green writes. It is one of the most advanced fighters built in the former Soviet Union. The aircraft is equipped to carry up to 10 air-to-air guided missiles and is also designed as an escort for long-range bombers. The potency of the Flanker prompted European countries to embark on the troubled European Fighter Aircraft project. Sponsored by a Russian insurance company, this particular Flanker is visiting Britain for the Biggin Hill air show, where it is part of a newly established Russian aerobatics team called The Test Pilots.</p>

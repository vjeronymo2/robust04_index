			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to THE STAR" by Ben Wedeman] </F>   [Text] Palestinian and Israeli negotiators took six months  to negotiate the economic agreement signed in Paris last Friday  [29 April], but it took only a few minutes for observers in  Amman to shoot holes in the accord. The official text of the  agreement has been closely guarded, but what has been made  public is arousing profound concerns about the agreement's  impact on the Jordanian and Palestinian economies.    Jordan has reacted cautiously to the agreement. Jordanian  officials insist there is no contradiction between the  PLO-Israel economic agreement and the economic accord between  Jordan and the PLO signed in January. Nonetheless, Jordan has  requested "clarifications" on certain points in the PLO-Israeli  agreement and a senior PLO negotiator is expected to meet  Jordanian officials in Amman to discuss the agreement.    Opinion of independent observers and analysts, however, is  generally against the PLO-Israel economic accord, "This  agreement is very bad as far as Jordan is concerned," a  political analyst told THE STAR. The analyst, who requested  anonymity, noted that the "number one issue" for Jordan is the  future of the Jordanian dinar in the West Bank and Gaza. He  warned that the PLO-Israel economic agreement will undermine the  use of the dinar, leading to a fall in the dinar's value and a  sharp depletion of Jordan's hard currency reserves. He also  warned that this will further exacerbate Jordan's debt burden.  At the same time, he warned, new investment opportunities in  the West Bank and Gaza will attract Palestinian capital at  Jordan's expense. The short term prospects for the Jordanian  economy, he concluded, are not encouraging.    As'ad 'Abd al-Rahman, director of the Shuman Foundation and  a  self-described "PLO man," expressed hope that the dinar would  continue to be the currency of choice in the Occupied  Territories, "I hope that the [Palestinian] entity's orientation  will be westward, not eastward," he said.    Commenting on the agreement, economist Fahd al-Fanik said  the  agreement "proves once again that the current negotiations are  not between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but rather  between the Israelis and themselves. It was Israel which wrote  the text [of the agreement], and the Palestinian delegation  succeeded at introducing a few simple reservations and limited  exceptions."    The agreement, according to al-Fanik, "serves Israel's  interests and sacrifices the joint interests of the Jordanians  and the Palestinians." It places economic barriers between  Palestinians and Jordan, and "prevents them from exchanging  goods and services except via Israeli customs" on the bridges  linking the West Bank and Jordan.    Critics of the PLO-Israel economic agreement worry the  accord  has done nothing but win PLO approval for Israeli economic  control of the Occupied Territories, at the expense of future  Palestinian economic relations with the Arab world in general  and Jordan in particular.    "The economic agreement in its entirety puts Israel's  economic interests in the forefront," Taysir Khalid of the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) told THE  STAR. Khalid, who resigned from the PLO Executive committee in  protest over the Gaza-Jericho accords, said the economic  agreement "subordinates everything to Israeli interests and to  the protection of the Israeli market.    Khalid believes the agreement legalizes Israeli exploitation  of the Occupied Territories, and thus represents no significant  change in itself. "What is new is that the Israeli policy of  annexation and integration has been legalized with Palestinian  approval," said Khalid. The Palestinian negotiators in Paris,  "rather than defending the need to break the two economies apart  and to enable the Palestinian economy to develop independently,  have accepted Israel's conditions and dictates."    Not all reaction has been negative. While acknowledging the  negative impact the agreement will have on Jordan, one analyst  told THE STAR Palestinians in the West Bank will benefit from  integration into the Israeli economy. "The investment climate  in the West Bank, which was near zero, will improve  dramatically," he said. He predicted a surge of investment from  Palestinians living abroad, and didn't discount the possibility  of Israeli investment in the area taking advantage of lower  production costs. The more than one billion dollars earmarked  by the World Bank for the Palestinian autonomous authority will  also help create a positive investment climate.    According to banking expert Yusuf 'Abd al-Haq, the agreement  represents the first step in the implementation of the report  published by Harvard University earlier this year, entitled  "Security Peace in the Middle East; Project on Economic  Transition". "This is a clear implementation of the Harvard  Unviersity report, which calls for the establishment of open  Palestinian-Israeli economic relations, followed by the  establishment of relations between the Palestine-Israel market  and Jordan, and finally by their integration into Arab markets."</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (27): Out of defeat, a new purpose - Christopher Bobinski on Solidarity's position after the election shock The defeat last autumn of Poland's Solidarity-rooted coalition government by parties with a communist past has given the 2m-strong Solidarity Trade Union a new lease of life. At last the movement, which proudly carries the mantle of its legendary anti-communist struggles, has regained a sense of purpose. The Solidarity Union failed to get any MPs into the powerful lower chamber of parliament and this defeat shocked it into refocusing its future as a trade union rather than as a stand-alone political movement. Mr Marian Krzaklewski, a 43-year-old computer designer from the Academy of Sciences in the industrial district of Silesia has led Solidarity since Lech Walesa left his former power base to become the President of Poland in 1992 has learned the lesson well. Talking in Solidarity's Gdansk headquarters, only 500 metres from the shipyard where an 18-day strike won trade union rights for workers in 1980, he stubbornly avoids being drawn on the political implications of Solidarity's present militant stance. Instead, supported by matter-of-fact officials, Mr Krzaklewski prefers to stick to Solidarity's demands. Above all the union wants the government to honour the pledge made by its Solidarity-based predecessor that real incomes will grow in line with GDP and that more money be spent on fighting unemployment. Clad in Solidarity's traditional dress of jeans and jumper, long discarded for suits and ties by those of the movement's leaders and supporters who over the past five years have gone into government or business, Mr Krzaklewski is obviously a man under a great deal of pressure. Talking fast he reaches repeatedly for pencil and paper to illustrate his points as he emphatically rebuts critics in the government and the media who see the union's stance as dangerously populist and risks opening the floodgates of inflation. At the same time he knows he is leading a movement whose increasingly impatient membership has experienced annual falls in real wages since 1990 and wants the trend reversed. 'The last government led by Ms Hanna Suchocka promised us that real incomes would grow by half the rate of increase of GDP,' he says reaching into his files to show an agreement signed after a three-week strike in the Silesian coal mines in January 1993. 'But real wages fell by 3 per cent last year while GDP grew by 4 per cent.' That alone would have been enough 'in Germany, Spain or Italy for a general strike', he adds. This year people will settle for zero growth in real incomes but not a further fall, he concedes as he prepares to follow up the demonstration by 30,000 Solidarity supporters in Warsaw last month with a campaign of selective strikes designed to force changes in government policies. But, bitterly, Mr Krzaklewski admits that it was the previous government which failed to stick to its promises on incomes which last summer prompted Solidarity, then represented in parliament, to put the motion of no confidence which led to Ms Suchocka's downfall. But the present administration has also been in no hurry to inaugurate a standing trilateral committee of government employers and unions which was agreed with Ms Suchocka last spring to seek consensus on economic policy. The committee, which is central to Mr Krzaklewski's hopes of establishing a stable 'system' of consultation, was set set up only last month after work on the stringent 1994 budget was virtually complete. Solidarity's main tactical aim now is to press for an easing of this year's planned 28 per cent price rise for electricity and 60 per cent for central heating. The union also wants income tax thresholds raised and wage controls removed to enable real wages to rise this year. Mr Krzaklewski insists that he is not asking for this year's 83,000bn zloty budget deficit to be increased. 'There is quite enough money for alleviating social needs in the present budget,' he says. 'The problem is that it's been spent wastefully up till now and hasn't gone to those who really need support.' Solidarity also wants the present government to put through legislation enabling collective wage bargaining to go ahead at both the national and shop floor levels. This is another subject, central to Solidarity's strategy, on which the previous government dragged its heels. At present the only statutory obligation on employers is to pay a minimum wage which was set at a 1.8m zlotys a month last October. Mr Krzaklewski argues that a system of collective wage bargaining would help the government and the union to decentralise conflicts. More crucially, from the union's point of view, it would also provide a way into the private sector where Solidarity is sorely under-represented. Mr Krzaklewski says he is not engaged in a crusade against the government because of its communist roots and can live with it, provided it is able to deliver higher living standards. But he does not like the 'post-communists', as he calls them, and stresses that 'if they were to start infringing human rights then Solidarity would have to react'. The question that Mr Krzaklewski leaves unanswered, is what happens if industrial discontent grows in Poland to such an extent that the government's position is threatened. Who would Solidarity support then? The former Solidarity-linked parties now in opposition, or President Walesa, the historic flag bearer of militant Polish unionism who is gearing up for re-election in 1995? Time will tell.</p>

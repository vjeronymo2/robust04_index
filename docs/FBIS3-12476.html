			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Palestinian leader Ahmad al-Tibi by an </F> unidentified L'UNITA reporter in Jerusalem; date not given:  "`Israel Must Choose: The Colonists or Peace';" first paragraph  is L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] Jerusalem -- "We renounced immediate discussions  over two things of fundamental importance, i.e., the status of  Jerusalem and the dismantling of Jewish settlements, in order to  reach an initial accord with Israel. But after what has  happened in Hebron there can no longer be any postponement.  Yitzhaq Rabin must choose: peace or the settlements." This is  what Ahmad al-Tibi maintains. He is currently the most  authoritative individual among the Palestinians in the  territories: He is in charge of relations with PLO headquarters  in Tunis. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres met with  al-Tibi on 27 February to discuss the measures adopted by the  government to put a stop to the actions of extremist colonists.    [L'UNITA] How do you judge the measures taken by the Israeli  Government against the extreme right-wing Jewish movements?    [Al-Tibi] The measures adopted by Rabin can perhaps reduce  the pain but they do not extirpate the disease. The disease  that can terminate the peace process is represented by the  Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank.    [L'UNITA] But is the disarmament of the more extremist  faction of the colonists not a first step to reopening the issue  of the future of the settlements?    [Al-Tibi] I would not be so confident. I think that the  measures currently adopted represent the maximum "concession"  that Rabin is willing to make, not only to the Palestinians but  also to the left wing of his party and the government. Rabin  talks of disarming the extremist elements among the colonists  but it is precisely on the concept of "extremists" that we  disagree with the Israeli prime minister.    [L'UNITA] Do you think that there are extremists in the  settlements?    [Al-Tibi] Certainly, and not only the "Kakh" activists. In  the meeting held Sunday evening with Peres, I asked a question  and am still waiting for a response: How does the Israeli  Government judge the head of the Kiryat Arba settlement who  refused to condemn the massacre at the Tomb of the Patriarchs:  Is he an extremist or not? There are extremist groups that have  not yet committed crimes like the one in Hebron, but their  militants play an active role in the Arab manhunt, attack  Palestinians in the streets, destroy their cars, and impede any  productive activity. My question to Rabin is: Are these not  extremists who should be disarmed? As far as we are concerned,  the answer is yes. Even these elements, and there are thousands  of them, should be disarmed. Before returning to the  negotiating table, we want to verify the criteria that the  Israeli authorities will use to determine who is extremist and  must be disarmed and who instead has the right to go about the  Occupied Territories with a machine gun and pistols.    [L'UNITA] The "Meretz" leaders, who also have never approved  the colonization of the territories carried out by right-wing  governments, maintain that Israel could not support a sudden  turnabout on the settlements.    [Al-Tibi] I understand their concern, but they must also  realize that the politics of always postponing, and delaying,  the issue of dismantling the settlements to "a later date," has  only produced hate, violence, and death in the territories. On  the other hand, we did not ask that all the settlements  disappear as of tomorrow. Our request is simply to place this  topic first on the negotiations agenda. In view of what  happened in Hebron, quite frankly this does not seem to be an  "extremist" request.    [L'UNITA] In concrete terms, what do you Palestinians  consider as being the best way to solve the problem of the  settlements?    [Al-Tibi] Our principal concern today is that of protecting  the population in the territories from the violence of the  colonists. We feel that the best solution is to reconcile the  schedules for the evacuation of the settlements with the  withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza and Jericho. This  being for a reason that Israel cannot refuse to acknowledge: If  another massacre like the one at Hebron were to take place after  the entry into effect of the independence of the two  territories, the Palestinian population would accuse the PLO of  being jointly responsible for that crime, for having accepted  that the settlements remain standing. And this would mean  playing the game of the Hamas integralists.    [L'UNITA] 'Arafat in Tunis has once again asked the United  Nations to guarantee international protection for the  Palestinians in the territories, but Israel has rejected this  proposal.    [Al-Tibi] I find this rigidity by the Tel Aviv government  entirely unjustifiable, and I am saying this precisely on the  basis of what is sanctioned by the additional protocol of  Article 3 of the Declaration of Principles set out in Oslo. The  appendix reads: "A temporary international presence may be  provided for in the area of Gaza and Jericho to guarantee the  implementation of the accords." This is what we are asking for  today. Nothing more.    [L'UNITA] Among the decisions adopted by the Israeli  Government is the establishment of a commission of inquiry into  the Hebron massacre. What do you expect from this commission?    [Al-Tibi] The verification that the military authorities  were  responsible for not having guaranteed safety in holy places. It  is not sufficient to punish the soldiers who fired at the exit  of the mosque. The Israeli Army is called upon to guarantee  safety to all inhabitants of the West Bank. But up to now it  has interpreted this mandate in a unilateral sense: For the  Israeli military commandos, the Palestinians are the potential  terrorists and not people to be protected from the violence of  the colonists.    [L'UNITA] But the Israeli Government is claiming that  disarming all the colonists would be the same as handing them  over to "Hamas."    [Al-Tibi] It is the opposite: It is the presence of the  colonists, with their charge of violence that is helping Hamas  to justify their armed battle. Because those settlements,  together with the massive presence of the Israeli Army, are the  living symbol of an occupation that is still present, despite  Washington. The only way to save peace is by separating the two  communities.    [L'UNITA] And now, Dr. al-Tibi, what will happen?    [Al-Tibi] The future of the talks is hanging by a thread: It  is up to Israel and the United States not to break it. More  than five months have passed since the signing of the accords on  Gaza and Jericho, but life in the territories has not improved:  People continue to suffer and die. What has been promised must  be implemented, and it must be done as soon as possible. Today  the restart of talks passes necessarily through Kiryat Arba,  Ariel, and the other Jewish settlements in the territories.  Peace is incompatible with this presence. Rabin must take note  of this. But if the colonists are not disarmed, if Israel once  again refuses to discuss the times and the ways for dismantling  the settlements, then we will be obliged to tell our people to  pick up their weapons, because this would be the only way of  protecting ourselves.</p>

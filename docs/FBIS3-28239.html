			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Representatives of the ruling  coalition parties agreed Friday [4 February] to renounce a plan  to introduce a new indirect tax on sales of goods and services,  coalition officials said.    The agreement came at a time when intra-coalition discord  over the new "national welfare tax" plan threatened to bring  down the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The accord was reached at a meeting of the leaders of seven  coalition parties who banded together to mitigate the crisis,  they said.    Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist and co-leader  of  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key coalition party, told a  news conference after the meeting, "coalition parties have  reached the conclusion that they should scrap both plans to  introduce the new tax and implement a tax cut as they could not  reconcile their differences over the plans."    Ozawa is widely regarded as the behind-the-scenes architect  of the plan to replace the current 3 percent consumption tax  with a 7 percent "national welfare tax."    The new accord also calls for scrapping a plan to implement  an income tax cut of 6 trillion yen. The Finance Ministry had  planned to cover the cut with revenue earned from the proposed  new tax, the officials said.    The ministry's original plan called for issuing  deficit-financing bonds to fund the tax cut and then redeeming  the bonds and interest with revenue from the new tax to be  imposed in three years' time.    The crisis emerged when the largest governing party, the  Social Democratic Party, threatened to quit the coalition in  protest at Hosokawa's plan to impose the new 7 percent indirect  tax.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference  that  representatives of the ruling coalition parties had not been  able to reach a conclusion on the tax proposals.    "Although the coalition representatives discussed various  aspects of the matter, we could not reach any agreement," Kubo  said.    "We therefore drew up a tax reduction plan and the new tax  will be taken back to the drawing board so we can spend more  time discussing the matter."    Kubo revealed that he proposed at the meeting the  implementation of an income tax and that an alternative source  of revenue be decided after further discussion.    Asked about a possible meeting of heads of coalition  parties,  including Hosokawa, he said that if such talks are proposed, the  SDP will make its decision based on the opinions of the party  chief, Tomiichi Murayama.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: DOWNEY;  </P> <P> DRILLING BEGINS ON NEW WATER WELL -- THE CITY'S 24TH  </P> <P> Drilling began this week on a new municipal water well, located on Paramount  Boulevard and Gallatin Road. Last month, Downey bought a 2,500-square-foot  parcel for the well, which is to be a safeguard against breakdowns of existing  wells.  </P> <P> The well will be 1,000 feet deep, said W.A. Ralph, director of public works. If  all goes as planned, drilling costs are expected to be $300,000, he said.  Including the cost of the land, the city is expected to spend $500,000 on the  new well. The city already has 23 wells, Ralph said.  </P> <P> The city has hired the Anaheim-based consulting firm of Willdan Associates to  monitor noise levels and environmental impact during the project.  </P> <P> The well is expected to be completed by the end of fall and will pump 3,000  gallons per minute, Ralph said.  </P></p>

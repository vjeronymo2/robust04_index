			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Keiji Kobayashi, editorial staff member: "The </F> Reason Why the PRC Is Not Enthusiastic in Persuading North  Korea"]    [Text] In the PRC, there is an expression "sanko-no-rei"  [visit three times]. In the old days, Liu Bi, the emperor of  the Kingdom of Shu, visited Zhuge Kongming at his house three  times, trying to persuade him to become his military advisor.  The expression has been derived from this story.    In dealing with the DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected  development of nuclear arms, the PRC did not respond to  "sanko-no-rei."    Secretary of State Warren Christopher of the United States,  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan, and President Kim  Yong-sam of the ROK visited Beijing one after another to request  cooperation in applying economic sanctions to North Korea, which  is refusing nuclear inspections. However, the PRC did not say  yes to any of them.    Economic sanctions without the participation of the PRC are  meaningless, as the PRC is the largest trade partner of North  Korea. It has become necessary for the United States, the ROK,  and Japan to rebuild their strategy.  <H5>  A Feeling of Distrust Against the United States Exists Among </H5> the PRC Military Authorities    Why has the PRC's attitude has become so stubborn? A Chinese  source in Tokyo pointed out three reasons:    First, the PRC's judgment is that the DPRK has not yet  succeeded in developing nuclear weapons. According to the ROK's  mass media, PRC leaders reportedly said at a meeting with  President Kim that "North Korea has not yet succeeded in  developing nuclear weapons. If the country is serious in  developing the nuclear weapons, we will be responsible for  curbing their intentions."    While this report was denied quickly after taking North  Korea's position into consideration, the report sounds quite  reliable.    The PRC's judgment may be that it is not a preferable policy  to corner North Korea with suspicions of its nuclear ambitions  -- which is merely a pretentious "card" -- thus forcing the  country to actually develop nuclear weapons, and to increase the  danger of creating military confrontation. Also, the PRC is  afraid that economic sanctions may further aggravate the already  weakened North Korean economy and might cause its government to  collapse.    Second, there exists in the PRC a feeling of distrust toward  the United States. Reportedly, because of the human rights  diplomacy of the United States, and because of the intervention  with the Tibetan issue, anti-U.S. nationalism is being created  within the PRC, with hawks gaining influence with the military  authorities.    At the UN, the PRC was ahead of the United States -- which  was to propose a "resolution to recommend reinspection" -- in  proposing a "chairman's statement" of a flexible nature. This  may be an expression of its aversion toward the United States  taking the initiative in UN operations.    Third, the PRC intends to keep "the DPRK card." While the  PRC currently does not have enough strength of its own to  influence North Korean actions, it expects Pyongyang to take the  PRC's ideas into acount if Beijing refuses the requests of the  United States, the ROK, and Japan. It is the PRC's deliberate  calculation that its international influence will be  strengthened if it can make timely use of this card and succeed  in persuading North Korea.    Besides, though not openly expressed, the PRC doubts the  justice of resorting to forced measures such as economic  sanctions.    The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) is an unequal  treaty, under which possession of nuclear arms is permitted for  those countries which already possess nuclear arms and  prohibited for those countries which are trying to develop  nuclear arms.    After all, it is to be decided by individual countries  whether or not to join the NPT, and such a decision is not to be  forced by international law. If a country withdraws from the  NPT, it becomes free from the obligation to undergo nuclear  inspections.    For example, India and Pakistan, while possessing nuclear  devices, are not members of the NPT and thus are not subject to  nuclear inspections. Also, North Korea is different from other  nations such as Iraq because it has not invaded foreign  countries. Even if North Korea happens to be a dangerous country  which is unfriendly to the international community, the  justification for members of a town attacking a certain family  in the town on grounds that the family is disturbing the town's  harmony is questionable.    Noteworthy Comment by North Korea's Ambassador    It seems that, perceiving a certain atmosphere in the  international community toward North Korea, the United States  has changed its strategy to include both forcible and flexible  approaches.    Also, for the time being, the ROK -- which has the right to  announce the reopening of "Team Spirit," a U.S.-ROK joint  military maneuver -- is supposed to try to find a way to reopen  talks with North Korea, emphasizing its ability to cope with  negotiations over the nuclear issue.    Unfortunately, hard-line elements opposing North Korea's  inflexible attitude are gaining strength within the ROK, making  it difficult for the Kim Yong-sam government to follow a  flexible line.    On the other hand, contrary to its radical words, North  Korea  also seems to be trying to find a way to open the talks.    The statement of North Korea's ambassador to Austria that  "we  are ready to agree to the nuclear inspection to be newly  effected if the United States agrees to hold talks with us  again" is considered to be a trial balloon expecting reopening  of the talks.    The DPRK leaders also seem to be aware that it is difficult  to reconstruct the economy and to remain in power if their  country is isolated from the international community.</p>

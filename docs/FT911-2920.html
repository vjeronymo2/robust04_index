			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium contract move attacked A MOVE to introduce a new open-market pricing contract into scrap aluminium trading has met opposition from scrap processors, particularly in Japan. Japanese companies are criticising plans by the London Metal Exchange to launch a contract for trading secondary aluminium, a low-purity metal which is usually produced by recycling scrap. The new contract would be traded alongside the LME's existing high-grade aluminium contract. LME officials, who were visiting Tokyo this week, have yet to make a decision on the plan. They are concerned about criticism from scrap processing companies in Japan and elsewhere. Mr David King, LME chief executive, said at a press conference yesterday that the Japan Aluminium Refiners Association, a trade body, had expressed opposition at a meeting on Wednesday. The LME has often in the past run into heavy criticism from producers when it has introduced new contracts. Producers complain that open markets, such as the LME, create unnecessary price volatility. By contrast, metal-users like the transparency which open markets bring. Producers have been strongest in those metal markets where they are few  - notably in aluminium and nickel. Companies in these areas consistently opposed the use of LME aluminium and nickel contracts after they were launched in the late 1970s, although they have since accepted their popularity among consumers. LME officials say the biggest support for a secondary aluminium contract is in Europe - where there is a plethora of users in different countries - followed by North America. Opposition is strongest in Japan, not least because the buying side is dominated by the large auto companies which are able to get good terms from the processors without the need for an open-market contract. The Japan Aluminium Refiners' Association told the LME that they feared the contract would encourage speculation and breed volatility. But Mr John Wolff, the LME chairman, said yesterday that the opportunity to hedge would protect companies against price swings. The Japanese side was not convinced. The often cosy relations between producers and consumers in the Japanese market mean that scrap prices in Japan do not swing as wildly as in Europe and North America. Japanese processors, for the most part, would like preserve that situation. The LME does not want to impose a new contract unilaterally on Japanese industry, not least because the Pacific region, including Japan, accounts for about one third of members' business. But Japanese opposition alone is unlikely to block the launch. 'We believe the contract would succeed without Japan but we would prefer Japan to be involved,' Mr King said.</p>

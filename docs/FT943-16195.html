			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Cabinet short on experience and lacking electoral tests The Palestinian national authority sworn in before Mr Yassir Arafat in Jericho yesterday is short on experience and made up largely of loyalists who depend on the PLO chairman for their political position. The authority, a de facto cabinet, contains a cautious balance of people from the West Bank, Gaza and the 'leadership in exile', prominent families and both the Islamic and Christian Palestinian communities. Few of the 'ministers' have any proven administrative ability or have passed an electoral test. None is expected to pose any real threat to Mr Arafat's way of centralising power and ruling by fiat. The position of all the ministers, who will rule as a caretaker or interim government until national elections expected in mid-October, is likely to be fragile in the face of a Palestinian population anxious for democracy after 27 years of Israeli occupation. During those three months they will have enormous problems in producing any tangible results in solving day-to-day problems of unemployment, poverty and inadequate services facing the 900,000 Palestinians now under self-rule. But some of the ministers do have a technocratic record in the portfolios to which they have been appointed, among them Mr Yassir Amr, education minister, and Mr Riyad al-Zanoun, health minister. But it is unclear if they will be allowed to exercise real power. 'The fundamental question about the authority is going to be whether Mr Arafat will give them the authority to implement decisions,' one PLO official said. 'In the past, he has never delegated. If he carries on this way, we are going to have tremendous problems with decisions delayed, changed arbitrarily and overruled on the personal whim of President Arafat.' Concern about the authority's real power, democracy and credibility have been reflected in Mr Arafat's difficulty in recruiting members. Mr Mahmoud Abbas and Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, two of the most senior PLO leaders, have refused positions on the authority and chosen to stay at PLO headquarters in Tunis. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, former PLO spokeswoman, also turned down a job. Mr Faisal al-Husseini, the man with perhaps the greatest independent political base in the West Bank, refused to be sworn in yesterday as minister without portfolio on the excuse that his responsibility to the 150,000 Palestinians in Arab East Jerusalem was beyond the geographical limits of self-rule in Gaza-Jericho. At least five places on the 24-member authority have yet to be filled as Mr Arafat continues to cajole opposition figures into taking some seats. Nobody symbolises the nature of the authority more than Mr Nabil Shaath, minister for planning and economic co-operation. Aged 55 and a businessman with one of the biggest publishing and management consultancy companies in the Arab world, he led the PLO negotiating team with Israel and Mr Arafat has, so far, made him front man for self-rule. Mr Shaath, respected for his intellectual, organisational and communications skills, has no political base in the West Bank or Gaza. Many Palestinians see him as more Egyptian than Palestinian. Mr Mohamed Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, finance minister, is closely associated with Mr Arafat. He comes from a prominent Jerusalem family, is head of the PLO economic department, and is a member of the PLO executive committee. His power was substantially increased yesterday when the 'cabinet', among its first decisions, transferred responsibility for the annual budget from the development council to the finance ministry. Two members of the authority represent the Palestinian Democratic Union, or Fida, a small breakaway political party set up in 1993 with marginal popular support. Fida has, with reservations, supported the peace process and backed Mr Arafat. Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, 49, a leader of Fida and a PLO executive committee member, becomes minister for arts, culture and information. Mr Azmi Shuaibi is made minister of youth and sports. Mr Elias Freij, Christian mayor of Bethlehem since 1972, becomes minister for tourism and monuments.</p>

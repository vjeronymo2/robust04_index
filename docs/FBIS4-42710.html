			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] An unattributed article in the 27 April  Paris daily LIBERATION comments on an extensive list of  potential presidential candidates. The following are described  as "probable" candidates:    --Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard, 63, who had to  set aside his ambitions in 1981 and 1988 for Francois  Mitterrand's sake. The article notes that he will surely not  renounce the race this time. His "mediocre" popularity scores  are a disadvantage. Despite his success in "marginalizing" his  most serious PS opponent, Laurent Fabius, Rocard is not "immune  to a Delors operation."    --Valery Giscard d'Estaing, 68, who will only announce his  candidacy if he is "almost" sure of success. His low popularity  scores "do not overly worry him," for he is convinced he could  recoup in a few months. While no French Democratic Union (UDF)  official would counter his plans, part of the party's younger  wing would hesitate to support him.    --Edouard Balladur, 65, whose popularity soared after the  GATT negotiations were concluded but who has "piled up errors  and missteps since." To oppose Rally for the Republic (RPR)  leader Jacques Chirac and appear as a "unifier" and not a  "divider," Balladur should delay his presidential race as much  as possible, the article notes.    --Jacques Chirac, 61, the RPR's "natural" candidate, is "not  quite sure" of how to distance himself from Balladur, but is  "breathing easier" now that the prime minister has dropped in  the polls. Announcing his candidacy too early may be risky, and  doing so too late may make it impossible to overtake Balladur.    --National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, 65, who will  present himself as an "outsider." While he obtained 14.39  percent of the vote when he first ran in 1988, his position is  not as favorable today, and even the Left deprives him of  publicity by not disrupting his meetings.    The following are listed by the article as "possible"  candidates:    --Raymond Barre, 70, considered a "statesman" by UDF leader  Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Insisting he is a "free man," Barre  will decide alone whether to run for the 1995 presidential  elections. Having "obstinately" avoided the parties, it is  probable he will not actively support a candidate.    --Minister of Defense Francois Leotard, 52, has long thought  that the 1995 presidential elections will afford him the  opportunity to "test the waters." After some initial  hesitation, Leotard and his Republican Party (PR) have decided  to support Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's "unifying"  candidacy if he runs. Should Balladur stay out of the race,  Leotard will become a candidate if he can obtain the support of  UDF "heavyweights" such as Giscard and Senate President Rene  Monory.    --Rene Monory, who "suggests nothing, excludes nothing,  denies nothing." He would be Giscard's candidate if the UDF  leader decided not to run.    --Generation Ecologie's Brice Lalonde, 48, expected to run  in the first round to "better negotiate" a ministerial post in  the second. Some of his old friends contend he is waiting for  the results of initial public opinion polls to decide whether he  should run.    --The Greens' Dominique Voynet, 35, who does not hide her  desire to run since she wrested power from Antoine Waechter.  She would perhaps support the Left's candidate in the second  round to facilitate alliances for the municipal elections.    --PS luminary Bernard Tapie, 51. Tapie hopes that good  results in the forthcoming European Parliament elections will  support his ambitions and make him the Socialists' "inevitable"  candidate.    --European Union (EU) Commission President Jacques Delors,  68, has consistently said that he will not run against PS leader  Michel Rocard. This would not prevent his supporters from  relaunching the idea of his candidacy if Rocard, down in the  polls, loses in the Euroelections.    --PS dissident and Citizens' Movement leader Jean-Pierre  Chevenement, 53, whose candidacy hangs on his Euroelections  score.    --Communist Party (PCF) leader Robert Hue, 47, whose primary  aim is to come out of isolation to facilitate leftist alliances  for the municipal elections.  <H5>  Balladur' s Losses Explained </H5>   According to Denis Jeambar writing in the 23 April Paris  weekly LE POINT, Balladur's initial "state of grace" may well  have been an "illusion" whose impact was overestimated. "In  mourning" after the crumbling of Socialism and the suicide of  the late Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy and "in shock" over the  recession and unemployment, the country at the time of the  elections only wished for "calm and the kind of political  silence that Balladur ideally embodied," Jeambar explains.  Balladur changed this situation with his "very political" law  on secular education and the attempt by Social Affairs Minister  Simone Veil and Minister of Defense Francois Leotard to  "presidentialize" him. These developments "broke the implicit  code linking [Balladur] to the French people." Balladur's  decline has boosted the chances of Chirac, now seen as equally  "competitive" with the prime minister for a second round  presidential victory, even if Balladur still seems more favored  in the first round. However, the "ambivalence" of Balladur's  past popularity makes the presidential race "much more uncertain  than figures can tell," Jeambar concludes.  <H5>  Possible Challenger </H5>   The results of a SOFRES poll conducted according to the  quota  method from 1 to 6 April among 1,000 individuals over 18 are  reported in the 21-27 April Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR.  Respondents were asked their opinion of prominent political  leaders as candidates for president of the Republic. On the  Right, Balladur led with 47 percent of favorable opinions--a  drop of 11 points since February--versus 42 percent negative. He  was followed by RPR leader Chirac (33 percent positive, 61  percent negative), Raymond Barre (30 percent positive, 64  percent negative), Interior Minister Charles Pasqua (26 percent  positive, 68 percent negative), Minister of Social Affairs  Simone Veil (25 percent positive, 68 percent negative), Defense  Minister Francois Leotard (23 percent positive, 68 percent  negative), UDF leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing (22 percent  positive, 74 percent negative), and a number of other  personalities with lesser scores. On the Left, Jacques Delors  led with 47 percent positive versus 42 percent negative, an  improvement of 4 percent since January. Socialist Party (PS)  leader Michel Rocard followed with 30 percent positive versus 64  percent negative (an improvement of 3 percent). The greatest  improvement (11 percent) was registered by PS luminary Bernard  Tapie, despite his score of 23 percent positive versus 71  percent negative. Poll results, according to Bazin, underscore  "the end of the exceptional case represented by Balladur and the  rise of the Tapie phenomenon." An analysis of the distribution  of the two men's popularity reveals that Balladur is rejected by  the least affluent classes--the young and the workers--among  whom Tapie registers the most gains. This indicates a new  cleavage between "the people above and the people below,"  superimposed on the old cleavage between the Right and the Left,  Bazin comments.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpts] The pressure on General Abacha's military  government in Nigeria from opposition pro-democrat groups is  beginning to rise. It follows the arrest of self-declared  president, Chief Moshood Abiola, yesterday. Chief Abiola is  widely believed to have won last June's annulled presidential  election. [passage omitted] Now the protests are beginning, as  Sola Odunfa reports from Lagos.    [Begin Odunfa recording] Leading the protests is the  National  Democratic Coalition, Nadeco, which has appealed to the  international community to show and intensify its support for  the restoration of democracy in Nigeria under a government  headed by Chief Abiola. [passage omitted]    However, the government is not without support. The most  prominent of its supporters so far is former military head of  state, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, who was toppled in 1976. He defended  Chief Abiola's arrest on the grounds that the government had a  duty to maintain law and order. He appealed to Nigerians to  support the national constitutional conference opening in Abuja  on Monday [27 June] as the only way to terminate military rule  permanently.    Meanwhile, the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has  ordered that all six former senators charged with treason be  remanded in police custody. The court revoked the bail it  granted earlier to three of them, including former Senate  President Ameh Ebute. Their trial has been adjourned to 6 July.  The three others, a former civilian state governor, Segun  Osoba, and two retired air force officers, charged with forming  an illegal political association were released on bail. Their  own trial will begin on 12 July. [end recording]</p>

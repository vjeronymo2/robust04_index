			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Dragan Milosavljevic] </F>   [Text] Geneva, June 5 (TANJUG) -- An atmosphere of  uncertainity prevails at Geneva's Palais de Nations where the  fourth day in a row is passing in the expectation of the  decision by the Moslem delegation to finally take part in the  talks on a ceasefire in the two-year war in the ex-Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    At 10:00 a.m. local time, when the several-times delayed  talks were scheduled to begin on Sunday, the Bosnian Serb  Republic (RS) delegation arrived headed by President Radovan  Karadzic and military comander General Ratko Mladic. Karadzic  told TANJUG that the Serb side is willing to sign a ceasefire.    The spokesman of the special U.N. envoy for the former  Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on Sunday morning announced at a press  conference that Akashi would meet for consultations with  Moslem-Croat Federation Vice-President Ejup Ganic. Shortly  afterward Ganic told journalists that the Serb forces had  allegedly failed to withdraw from the 3-km exclusion zone in  Gorazde and that the conditions for the start of the talks have  still not been fulfilled. He thus tried to deny reports to the  contrary by U.N. monitors from this Moslem enclave in eastern  Bosnia. Akashi's spokesman Michael Williams could not say what  the chances are for the talks starting on Sunday.    At the U.N. Geneva headquarters there are many skeptics who  doubt that the Bosnian Moslems are ready for serious peace  talks. Some believe that the entire affair aims to undermine  the authority of Japanese diplomat Akashi whom the Moslems  persistently and unfoundedly accuse of siding with the Serbs.    Williams also said that, according to his information, the  first round of talks, sponsored by the "Contact Group," on a  comprehensive political solution and territorial division in  Bosnia, has been completed at the French U.N. mission.    Sources in the Bosnian Serb delegation said that the Serbs  are dissatisfied by the maps proposed by the "Contact Group" in  Washington because they are a basis for a unitary Bosnia, as  adovcated by Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic.</p>

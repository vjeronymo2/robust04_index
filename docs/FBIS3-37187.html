			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vytautas Landsbergis, chairman of the </F> Fatherland Union Party and leader of the Lithuanian Seimas  opposition, by an unidentified correspondent in Vilnius on 14  February--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Last week, Russian news agencies  quoted the annual report on the situation in the country made by  President Algirdas Brazauskas saying, incidentally, that  President Brazauskas emphasized the improvement in relations  between Russia and Lithuania in 1993.    Esteemed Professor, you have expressed concern about the  relations between the big neighbor and Lithuania at today's news  conference.    [Landsbergis] It is evident, and what is evident is not open  to question--that Russia's official policy toward its neighbors,  including the Baltic states, is hostile. This is expressed by  threats, pressure, by constant demands and reproaches, and even  by accusations. The Baltic states cannot feel secure at a time  when such official military and foreign policy doctrines as  those recently proclaimed by Russia claim that Russia allegedly  has the right to interfere into our affairs using force. In  general, the whole policy concerning the encirclement of Russia  has been fabricated, which is labelled "the near abroad".    This would mean the surrounding world (?according to) the  Russian politicians is divided into two categories. Some  foreign countries appear to be just normal, regular, foreign  sovereign countries, and others are especially subject to  influence and even domination by Russia.    This fact makes not only the Baltic states, but also the  states of Central Europe, to look for support in the structures  of European stability and security that have proved their worth.    In response to this, Russia once again accuses these  countries, including the Baltic states, of anti-Russian or  anti-Russia policies. This is a specific aggravation of the  political and psychological atmosphere that is coming from  Moscow. Therefore, it is rather difficult to give an assessment  of this entire unfolding process, including the growing  pro-imperialist and aggressive forces in Russia. It is  difficult to regard all this as an improvement of the situation  in general.    Of course, the former and current governments of Lithuania  have been trying to maintain good relations with Russia;  however, this cannot be said about the Russian side. Perhaps  what Russia regards as good relations is not partnership based  on equal rights but something else altogether.    [Correspondent] As is known, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev has been stressing of late that a program has been  prepared in Russia that will defend the interests of the ethnic  Russians living outside the territory of Russia, i.e. in the  near abroad. He also stressed the problem of anti-Semitism  especially in the Baltic states. [passage omitted]    Brazauskas said that the pressing problems raised at the  Vienna summit were also topical to Lithuania. These problems  were: Aggressive nationalism, a problem of racism, and Zionism.    [Landsbergis] This is propaganda and diplomatic murk that is  sometimes used in the campaign for international public opinion,  and which has been known to us for several years already. We  encountered it when attempts were made to harm Lithuania, and  this was coming from Moscow. Quite often, Lithuania and other  Baltic states were represented as anti-Semitic, nationalistic,  anti- Russian, and what not.    Of course, one of their objectives was to make influential  financial circles in the West become hostile, which would then  refuse to help or would refrain from cooperation with the Baltic  states--in particular, with Lithuania. [passage omitted]    It seems that this card is being used again, since Mr.  Kozyrev is accusing anyone and whoever he likes of  anti-Semitism. No doubt, at the same time, he fails to mention  Russia, where very strong anti-Semitic organizations and groups  are active that create an atmosphere of threat or even terror  against Jews. [passage omitted]    The fact that the mention of Zionism as a topical problem in  Lithuania occurred in the annual report of President Brazauskas  is completely incomprehensible to me. This is such an old card  of the Brezhnev era, which was used to pacify perhaps the Arab  partners. However, to claim that this is a topical issue in  Lithuania today is simply nonsense.

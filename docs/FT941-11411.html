			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Virtual reality hits the surf A breakthrough in electro-mechanical technology could soon enable people to simulate surfing, skiing or even hang gliding in the privacy of an arcade booth. The 'virtual motion' system, developed in Dorset by Denne Developments, replaces traditional mechanical hydraulics with computer-controlled pistons. Sensors in the 'ski' or 'surf' board measure when the would-be athlete puts pressure on the board. The computer then sends instructions to a host of copper coils, which line a series of copper cylinders. Inside the cylinders are pistons that have powerful magnets along their length. When the electrical pulses activate the copper coils, the magnets react, shifting the pistons and so the board. The whole ensemble is finished off with a virtual reality headset.

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAYS MEAN INCREASED THEFT AT LOCAL STORES  </P> <P> The holiday season isn't just for giving.  </P> <P> The period between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day is also a time of greed for  shoplifters and larcenous employees who traditionally increase their activities  in Ventura County's retail stores, authorities and store personnel say.  </P> <P> "Any time there's a Christmas season, you're going to have people who will  shoplift because they want things and can't afford them," Ventura County  Sheriff's Department Deputy Chris Lathrop said.  </P> <P> But business owners and managers say they are fighting crime with increased  security forces, new alarm systems and programs encouraging employees to report  larcenous peers.  </P> <P> Authorities estimated that shoplifting increases by about 35% during the  holiday season. And while it is difficult to track exact losses, they said they  believe that employee theft also increases.  </P> <P> Indeed, employees are believed to be responsible for 70% of the merchandise  losses, or "shrinkage," suffered each year in the nation's stores, Lathrop  said.  </P> <P> In 1989, U.S. stores lost an estimated $40 billion due to shoplifting and  employee theft, according to the Small Business Advancement Institute in  Medford, Ore.  </P> <P> Lathrop, who heads the crime prevention bureau in Thousand Oaks, said the urge  to steal may be fueled if employees believe their store is not treating them  well.  </P> <P> A frequent scam is to hide a product in the trash, then volunteer to take the  garbage out. When the goods are outside the store, the employee hides them in  his car and then returns to work, Lathrop said.  </P> <P> Employees assigned to unpack shipments may under-report the number of items  that arrive in a package and keep the extras.  </P> <P> They may develop kickback schemes with delivery people or suppliers. And if a  customer forgets to ask for a receipt, they may pocket cash and never ring up  the purchase, Lathrop said.  </P> <P> Sometimes, employees have deals with friends whom they allow to purchase goods  with bad credit cards or stolen checks, said Sgt. Bob Anderson of the Ventura  Police Department.  </P> <P> Anderson said he recently cited a top-level manager at JC Penney in the  Buenaventura Mall on suspicion of stealing hundreds of dollars of clothing over  many months. The employee allegedly concealed the merchandise inside her purse,  Anderson said.  </P> <P> "The incidence of theft I think would shock people," Anderson said.  </P> <P> However, some retailers deny the problem, Lathrop said.  </P> <P> Last year, 20 employees from the Sheriff's Department managed to shoplift  $8,000 worth of merchandise in about three hours from The Oaks Mall in Thousand  Oaks.  </P> <P> The department conducted the exercise to impress upon store owners the ease of  shoplifting.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Lathrop said, he sent out 500 flyers advertising Sheriff's  Department seminars telling merchants and employees how to cut down on  merchandise losses.  </P> <P> But only five merchants showed up for the five seminars, he said.  </P> <P> "I believe it is apathy combined with a feeling that the theft isn't happening  at their store," Lathrop said.  </P> <P> However, shrinkage is critical to a store's viability, especially if the store  is smaller, he said.  </P> <P> Larger stores often have teams of security personnel who go undercover,  pretending to browse while actually watching for illicit activity. Many also  have sophisticated camera systems hidden throughout the store, he said.  </P> <P> JC Penney Co. in the Buenaventura Mall has increased its security force to  watch for shoplifters during the holiday season, Manager Jim Word said.  </P> <P> He said employee theft probably increases during this time as the store  supplements its 160 permanent employees with about 40 part-time workers for the  holiday shopping crunch.  </P> <P> Word said full-time employees, who have profit-sharing plans or get stock as  part of their retirement packages, watch the newer employees for signs of theft  because they feel that any losses come out of their earnings.  </P> <P> In October, the Target store on Vineyard Avenue in Oxnard installed a new alarm  system to combat merchandise loss, store manager Norm Grow said. The alarm goes  off when merchandise that has not been scanned during checkout is taken through  a door.  </P> <P> "In a normal holiday season, we would probably see more shrinkage," Grow said.  "This year, you're seeing less because of the new alarm system."  </P> <P> Four months ago, the Mervyn's department store on Saviers Road in Oxnard  assigned employees to stand by two entrances to greet every customer in an  effort to deter thieves who run into a store, grab merchandise and jump into a  getaway car, said Jason Contreras, a Mervyn's investigator. The only entrance  to the store not patrolled is the one into the Centerpoint Mall, where security  guards might easily catch a shoplifter.  </P></p>

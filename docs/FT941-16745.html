			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Job gains indicate solid US growth Official data showing a fall in the US jobless rate to 6.4 per cent last month from a revised 6.5 per cent in November indicated solid economic growth at the end of last year. Many Wall Street analysts, however, interpreted accom-panying figures for payroll employment as signalling a modest deceleration in the pace of economic recovery. Slower - but still healthy - growth would reduce the pressure for an early increase in short-term interest rates. Non-farm employment rose 183,000 last month against analysts' projections of an increase of about 225,000. The increase in November was revised down slightly to 202,000. Roughly 2m new jobs were created during last year as a whole. The mix of employment gains was less encouraging than in previous months. Private-sector employment rose 147,000 against 200,000 in November. Manufacturing employment rose 2,000 against 26,000. Construction employment fell slightly after a gain of 34,000 in November. On Thursday Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, predicted December data would show 'employment rising, probably in the area of another 160,000 to 200,000'. As this was below the consensus forecast in financial markets, bond prices rose as analysts' scaled back estimates of economic growth. The fact Mr Reich's prediction was spot-on has revived charges he improperly leaked the highly sensitive data. Officials, however, say Mr Reich made an intelligent guess based on previously released figures.</p>

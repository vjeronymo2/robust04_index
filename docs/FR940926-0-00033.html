			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Previous Agency Rulemakings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 12, 1990, NHTSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to explore whether the agency should issue Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs) applicable to CNG fuel containers and the fuel systems of motor vehicles using CNG or liquified petroleum gas (LPG) as a motor fuel. (55 FR 41561). The ANPRM sought comment about the crash integrity of vehicle fuel systems, the integrity of fuel storage containers, and pressure relief for such containers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 21, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in which the agency proposed to establish a new FMVSS specifying performance requirements for vehicles fueled by CNG. (58 FR 5323). The proposal was based on comments received in response to the ANPRM and other available information. The NPRM was divided into two segments: (1) vehicle requirements that focus on the integrity of the entire fuel system, and (2) equipment requirements that focus on the fuel containers alone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA decided to model the proposed requirements applicable to CNG fueled motor vehicles on Standard No. 301,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fuel System Integrity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Standard No. 301 specifies performance requirements for vehicles that use fuel with a boiling point above 32&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0253 grid5678 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fahrenheit (i.e., fuels that are liquid under standard temperature and pressure). Vehicles manufactured to use only CNG are not subject to Standard No. 301 since CNG has a boiling point below 32  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0253 grid5678 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F. Standard No. 301 limits the amount of fuel spillage from ``light vehicles'' <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  during and after frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests and a static rollover test. The Standard also limits fuel spillage from school buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds after being impacted by a moving contoured barrier at any point and any angle. By basing the CNG rulemaking on Standard No. 301, the agency believed that passengers of CNG vehicles would be afforded a level of safety comparable to that provided passengers of vehicles fueled by gasoline or diesel fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Light vehicles include passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles (MPV's), trucks, and buses with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 10,000 pounds or less. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the ``vehicle'' requirements for CNG vehicles, NHTSA proposed that the fuel system integrity requirements would include frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests for light vehicles, and a moving contoured barrier crash test for large school buses. The agency proposed that fuel system integrity would be determined by measuring the fuel system's pressure drop after the crash test rather than fuel spillage, since CNG is a vapor and not a liquid. The allowable pressure drop for CNG fueled vehicles would be equivalent, as measured by the energy content of the lost fuel, to the allowable spillage of gasoline during Standard No. 301 compliance testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the ``equipment'' requirements for CNG containers, NHTSA proposed a definition for ``CNG fuel tank'' and performance requirements that would apply to all such fuel containers manufactured for use as part of a fuel system on any motor vehicle, including aftermarket containers. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Thus, while vehicles with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds (other than school buses) would not be subject to Standard No. 303, the CNG containers in those vehicles would be subject to the equipment requirements. The agency proposed that each CNG container would be subject to a pressure cycling test to evaluate container durability and a pressure burst test to evaluate the container's initial strength as well as its resistance to degradation over time. In addition, the NPRM proposed requirements to regulate how the container ``vents'' its contents under specified conditions of elevated temperature and pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Among the terms used to describe CNG fuel tanks are tanks, containers, cylinders, and high pressure vessels. The agency will refer to them as ``containers'' throughout this document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Comments on the Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA received a large number of comments to the docket addressing the CNG proposal. The commenters included manufacturers of CNG containers, vehicle manufacturers, trade associations, other CNG-oriented businesses, research organizations, State and local governments, the United States Department of Energy, and energy companies. In addition, NHTSA met with the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) and the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) and had telephone conversations and meetings with some of the commenters. A record of each of these contacts may be reviewed in the public docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters generally believed that a Federal safety standard regulating the integrity of CNG fuel systems and fuel containers is necessary and appropriate. In fact, some commenters, including the CGA, the NGVC, and CNG container manufacturers stated that NHTSA should issue a Federal standard as soon as possible to facilitate the safe and expeditious introduction of CNG fueled vehicles. With respect to the equipment requirements, the commenters generally believed that Federal requirements about CNG fuel container integrity are needed and should be implemented as quickly as possible. The CNG vehicle industry, led by CGA and NGVC, expressed concern that lack of Federal regulations has created a problem for the industry, given the issuance of potentially conflicting industry and State regulations. Therefore, these commenters stated that CNG container manufacturers may not know the appropriate standards to which they should manufacture their containers. In contrast, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA) stated that the vehicle system requirements are sufficient to regulate the overall integrity of CNG fueled vehicles and that separate requirements for CNG fuel containers are not needed. Nevertheless, AAMA provided detailed comments about the container proposal in case the agency decided to issue separate container requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters addressed a variety of issues discussed in the NPRM. These issues include the appropriateness of adopting the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) voluntary industry standard known as NGV2; <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  the pressure cycling requirements and test procedures; the burst requirements and test procedures, including the proposed safety factor, hold time interval, and need for sequential testing; the pressure relief requirements and test procedures, including types of pressure relief devices, shielding, test gas, test pressure, test fuel, and fuel pan depth; labeling requirements; leadtime; costs; and benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NGV2 is a recently issued voluntary industry standard that was adopted by the ANSI and addresses CNG fuel containers. It was developed by an industry working group that included container manufacturers, CNG users, and utilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA issued an SNPRM proposing to pattern the burst requirements more closely on NGV2, based on its consultation with other Federal agencies, its review of comments to the January 1993 proposal, and other available information. (58 FR 68846, December 29, 1993). NHTSA proposed a burst test that would link the use of particular designs and materials to compliance with safety factors tailored to those designs and materials. NHTSA requested comment on the appropriateness of requiring CNG containers to meet design and material requirements, such as those specified in NGV2, and to meet safety factors tailored to those requirements. As an alternative approach, the agency asked whether it should specify a catch-all high end safety factor for any container whose design and materials are not specified in NGV2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Another incident between Caracol and the  presidential campaign of Andres Pastrana occurred yesterday.    Ricardo Alarcon, president of the [Caracol] radio station,  said that Luis Alberto Moreno, Pastrana's campaign director, had  publicly threatened to declare "war" on him and had done so in  the presence of the presidential candidate.    Alarcon sent a letter to Moreno yesterday asking for an  explanation and telling him many people are thinking that with  this kind of behavior he is driving more people away from  Pastrana than he is attracting.    There has been no response from Moreno who, at the close of  this edition, had still not seen the contents of the letter.    The circumstances surrounding the incident have to do with  the alleged censuring, by the station, of the Tunja news  director's interview with the candidate and his wife which was  to be aired on the "Personality of the Week" program.    On 14 March Moreno sent a letter to Alarcon in which he  protested the decision by Caracol--which has not yet been  explained--not to air the interview.    Relations between the campaign and the radio station have  been tense since Andres Pastrana decided not to accept  contributions from the Santo Domingo Group, which owns the  station.    Alarcon's letter to Moreno states the following:    "The fact that I have been abroad for the past few days has  prevented me from responding to your letter of 14 March.    "I deeply regret that, once again, you have misunderstood  Caracol's position with regard to the presidential candidates.    "With respect to news information, our policy has been, and  will always be the same: to defend the right of our listeners to  be well informed. This is a reality which we are able to  substantiate and which you are aware of as a cabinet minister  and now as director of Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango's campaign.    "I cannot refrain from referring to the incident which  transpired on 16 March in the El Campin stadium at the  Colombia-Sao Paulo match. At that time and in the presence of a  group of people, among whom was Dr. Andres Pastrana, you  threatened me with a `war.'    "Of course, I would not hesitate to let the angry incident  pass, or forget your angry and disconcerting reaction,  understandable perhaps in the light of certain political facts  and realities, but there is a lingering doubt. I don't know  whether I should take your defiant threat, `if you want a war,  you will have a war,' as intended for Caracol, or for the entire  Santo Domingo Group.    "If the above is serious, you should let us know beforehand  what this war involves and what the arena will be. If, on the  other hand, it was brought on by a fit of temper or was the  result of a difficult moment, we would like to have an  explanation of the incident.    "Many people think, ourselves among them, that you are  driving more people away from Dr. Pastrana Arango than you might  think you are attracting."</p>

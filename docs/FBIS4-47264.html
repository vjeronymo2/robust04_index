These and other properties drew attention to these  compounds for possible use to prevent corrosion in pipelines.  This requires a more detailed study of these compounds on steel  in the cathodic region of potentials. In the present work  impedenceometry was used to demonstrate that  N-alkyl-N-methyl-N,N-diethanolamine iodides are adsorbed onto  the surface of steel in the cathodic region of potentials,  thereby lowering the volume of electric double layer at the  metal-coating-electrolyte interfaces. This in turn has a  significant effect on the rate of cathodic sloughing off of the  protective polymeric coating and the rate of corrosion of the  metal being protected.

After meeting Sir Leon Brittan, Mr. Kantor held talks with  Mr. Bangemann and Mr. Vanni d'Archirafi. Below is an overview  of the results of the three meetings. Sir Leon Brittan and  Mickey Kantor discussed:     -  The procedures to be implemented  by the two parties for the Geneva agreements to be signed by  mid-April as scheduled. On the Community side, the European  Parliament will be consulted (although it cannot, obviously,  modify the content of the agreements);    -  The efforts to be made to  improve the results achieved, especially with regard to market  access. The European Commission and the U.S. Administration  believe a meeting of the "quadrilateral" (EC/United  States/Japan/Canada) appropriate before 15 February as well as  contacts with certain Asian countries;    -  The situation in some  specific sectors (maritime services, financial services);    -  The  situation concerning public procurement. The GATT agreement  covers the contracts concluded by the central authorities. The  EC attaches great importance to further progress by the United  States in liberalization at the level of the States of the  Union;    -  The subsequent efforts to go beyond the results of the  Uruguay Round. The World Trade Organization (WTO) will not only  have to implement Uruguay Round agreements and manage the new  system to settle differences and the mechanism for examining  trade policies, but it should also develop new working programs  on trade/environment and trade/competition problems. The EC and  the United States are in agreement about the importance and  urgency of these developments. Mr. Kantor also discussed the  aspect of "working conditions and standards" which the EC is  examining. The two interlocutors also brought up the subject of  aluminium. A third multilateral meeting (after those in Moscow  and Washington) between the main producer countries and main  importers will take place next week in Brussels.    Mr. Bangemann and Mr. Kantor  discussed:     -  Telecommunications. Mr. Kantor confirmed that  the central government was pressuring the states of the Union to  free access to their public contracts. As for standardization,  a few problems exist on copyright and European standards; Mr.  Bangemann will go into more depth on these matters with his  American interlocutors when he visits the United States in  spring;    -  Shipbuilding. Mr. Bangemann and Mr. Kantor agreed that  the negotiations had to be concluded urgently in the framework  of the OECD on aid and trade;    -  Aluminium. The multilateral  approach is considered by far preferable to unilateral  restrictions. That is why both the EC and the United States  would like successful talks next week in Brussels between the  main producers (including Russia) and importers. Mr. Vanni  d'Archirafi and Mr. Kantor examined;    -  Financial services. The  significance of the result of the Uruguay Round (involving the  inclusion of financial services in the GATT rules, through the  General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS) has perhaps not  yet been understood by the business world; an effort to clarify  this seems appropriate. The fact remains that the agreement  must be completed and improved;    -  Public procurement. The  Commissioner reaffirmed the importance that the EC attaches to  the application by the United States of the commitments of the  memorandum of understanding of May concerning the extension of  liberalization to levels other than the level of central  administration (federal).</p>

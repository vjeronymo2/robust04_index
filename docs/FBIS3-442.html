			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kinyarwanda </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Habyarimana today made a one-day visit  to Uganda, accompanied by the minister of defense. Landouald  Ndasingwa, the minister of social affairs, was absent although  he was supposed to be present. There must be a good reason for  this.    There are many reasons for the visit. Reports say that  President Habyarimana may have gone to Uganda to ask Ugandan  President Yoweri Museveni, to help him make the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF] accept the decisions of the interparty  meeting that President Habyarimana chaired. It has been said  that, after his visit to Uganda, President Habyarimana will go  to Tanzania with the same message.    The decisions that he wants the RPF to accept are known to  you. The parties rejected them but later accepted them after  being terrorized and after becoming afraid of experiencing what  happened to their friend [Felicien Gatabazi] who had just been  killed. To us, it is clear that Habyarimana and his henchmen  want to maintain the status quo. They are doing everything  possible to torpedo the Arusha agreement. [passage omitted]    Terrorism forced the parties to agree to the plans. Even the  Liberal Party accepted to sacrifice the rights of deputies who  had been elected by the people so that President Habyarimana  could give them peace at last. Now it is said that the purpose  of his visit is to ask the Ugandan president to help him  convince the RPF. This is a hard job for him because the  terrorism he has been using on other parties will have no effect  on the RPF.    It is clear now in our country that there are two opposing  groups of parties. On one side, there is President  Habyarimana's bloc comprising the Republican National Movement  for Democracy and Development [MRND] and others who want to keep  the status quo and want to forcefully obtain laws that give them  advantages while those who have the interests of the country at  heart are thrown aside. On the other side, there is the RPF and  other parties, which want to have democracy in Rwanda and laws  that benefit the entire country. That is why they want the  Arusha agreement be respected fully, so that people's rights are  respected such as the right of being elected. [passage omitted]</p>

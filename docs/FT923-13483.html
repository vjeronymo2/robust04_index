			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Oil industry refines its operations: A look at structural change in the US energy sector THE US oil and gas industry will this week begin reporting mainly lower second-quarter earnings against a backdrop of dramatic reductions in capital spending and job numbers at many companies. The cuts are more than a cyclical reaction to the weakness of US demand for petroleum products and crude oil prices that are well below levels seen just before the Gulf war in January, 1991. Instead, industry experts say the US sector has begun a structural change that could ultimately shift much exploration and production away from the United States while raising energy prices for retail and corporate consumers. The challenges facing the US energy industry are several: Congressional and local restrictions on drilling in places such as the waters off the coasts of Florida and California and the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska are causing many companies to redirect their exploration efforts away from the US. The sputtering US recovery and increasing price competition are keeping marketing and distribution profit margins under pressure. The industry has also concluded that the medium-term outlook is for only slightly improved crude oil and natural gas prices. The cost of modernising refineries and developing cleaner, reformulated petrol - as dictated by environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act - will be tens of billions of dollars during the next few years. The consensus view is that the industry's operating cash flow will decline by 10 per cent this year, to about Dollars 44bn (Pounds 23bn). Net profits of the energy sector, which fell by an aggregate of more than 50 per cent in the first three months of 1992, are expected to drop by at least 10 per cent in the second quarter and by almost as much for the whole of 1992. The result is that many companies are slashing operating costs. That means sharp reductions in capital spending budgets, selling non-strategic assets and saving money by redundancies that on average will eliminate up to 15 per cent of the workforces of several big US companies. Although the restructuring process has been underway for more than a year, last week saw several announcements that are typical of the trend. Last Monday, after a survey of 247 companies, Salomon Brothers forecast a drop of nearly 20 per cent in 1992 spending on North American exploration and production. Spending by these same companies outside the US was projected to rise by 9.5 per cent. On Tuesday, Mobil, the second biggest US energy group, said its 1992 capital appropriations budget would be Dollars 1bn less than previously predicted. The company's payroll was forecast to decline by 10 per cent by year-end and the disposal of more than Dollars 600m of assets was forecast. Wednesday saw Amoco, the fifth biggest US energy company, unveil plans to take an Dollars 800m restructuring charge in the second quarter and to reduce its workforce by 8,500 employees, or nearly 16 per cent, by the end of next year. On Friday, Mr Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute (API), complained that lower crude prices, the sluggish economy and drilling restrictions had caused the loss of 63,000 US energy jobs over the past year and could lead to another 50,000 redundancies over the next 12 months. In New York, Mr Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, reckoned the US sector was facing 'major structural changes,' including a dramatic shift in exploration budgets from the US to places such as republics of the former Soviet Union, Colombia, Yemen, Algeria, Venezuela and Indonesia. Mr Goldstein said spending cuts had 'decimated' the US exploration and production infrastructure of so many companies that the ability of the industry to respond in a timely manner when the economic recovery eventually strengthened was now in question. In Houston, Mr Roger Frey, an energy sector loan specialist at Chase Manhattan, attributed the structural changes to both mounting environmental costs and the fact that 'the industry can no longer bank on steady price increases'. He said there was a realisation by the industry of the need 'to adjust to only moderate oil and natural gas prices in the foreseeable future'. Mr DiBona of the API argued that while the US energy sector would eventually be leaner and more competitive, the shift away from exploration and production in the US could be permanent and could affect the US balance of payments in the 1990s. Compounding the outlook is the fact that US refinery capacity is forecast by analysts to drop by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent during the next three years, while the nation's proven reserves continue to decline over time. The implications of the US energy sector's restructuring were summed up two weeks ago by Mr Victor Burk, managing director of the oil and gas industry services division of Arthur Andersen, the consultancy. Although Mr Burk said the shift away from US exploration would continue, he noted this did not mean the US would be abandoned. Rather, the industry would enter a new era when exploration would be pursued on the basis of geographical, operational and technological niche opportunities. Mr Paul Ting, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, concluded that while 1991 was a bad year, with net income down by 21 per cent for the top 10 US energy groups, profits in the current year would also decline, although less sharply. With refining and marketing margins under pressure, much of the earnings sweepstakes in the latter half of 1992 will depend upon the price of crude, which is not expected to rise in a significant way. Earnings could improve again next year, thanks partly to the lower operating costs being wrought by restructuring. But neither US job levels nor exploration activities are expected to return to past levels for quite some time.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          CAPITAL SPENDING  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              On oil and gas exploration and production                   by top five US groups (dollarsm)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            In the US          Outside North America                           -----------        -----------------------                     1991     1992      %      1991     1992      %                    actual  estimate  change  actual  estimate  change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Exxon              2,095    1,850     -11.7  3,040    3,325      +9.4 Mobil                920      600     -34.8  1,361    1,500     +10.2 Texaco               905      709     -21.7  1,044    1,112      +6.5 Chevron            1,050      850     -19.1  1,100    1,250     +13.6 Amoco               965       500     -48.2  1,233    1,200      -2.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Salomon Brothers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Information groups warned on multimedia hopes Telecommunications and computer companies which have formed alliances and invested heavily in anticipation of a booming market for multimedia in the home may have been ill-advised, a research organisation has warned. Inteco says that the revenues from domestic multi-media services in Europe will not flow appreciably until the turn of the century. Organisations such as the telephone and cable companies now investing in new services such as video-on-demand and the infrastructure to support them will suffer losses, it says. It concludes that assumptions about European acceptance of multimedia based on US experience are dangerously misguided. Mr Miles Thistlethwaite, who co-ordinated the study for Inteco, said: 'The US model does not work for any of the European countries.' He added: 'There are fundamental differences in the cable and satellite landscape as well as in patterns of behaviour.' He did not believe those patterns could easily be changed. Multimedia implies the integration of telecommunications with computer technology to deliver interactive services. This includes video-on-demand, home shopping and on-line information. The study involved 11,500 interviews with households in France, Germany, Italy and the UK. Its principal conclusions echo the views of many who have questioned the commercial feasibility of the multi-media revolution. It is the first survey on such a scale, however, to cast doubt on the potential profitability of the information superhighway. Mr Thistlethwaite said that the object had been to identify patterns of behaviour which could be used to predict the acceptability and attractiveness of various aspects of multimedia. It found big differences between the US and Europe and equally big differences between the main European countries in their attitude to multimedia. In the US, for example, two-thirds of households with video recorders rented a video tape at least once a month, almost invariably from the 'top 10' movies on offer. In Europe the comparable figure was 22 per cent and the tape was rarely chosen from the top 10. A significant conclusion is that the personal computer rather than the television is likely to be the focus for multimedia services. The study says: 'Those services that people will be most ready to pay hard cash for are likely to be those centred on the PC.' These include interactive compact discs, especially those with educational content, which Inteco sees as important in the better-off homes with children of school age. 'Video-on-demand, on-line information and home shopping interest consumers and could bring in additional revenues but by themselves are unlikely to prompt people into subscribing in the first place,' it says. Inteco says the UK is the best test-bed for multimedia products and services because it is most deregulated. Multimedia In The Home. Inteco, Victoria Gate, Chobham Road, Woking, Surrey GU21 1JD.

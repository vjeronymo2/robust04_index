			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOPES FADE FOR ACCORD IN L.A.'S DESEGREGATION CASE  </P> <P> Hopes for a final, negotiated settlement in a 25-year-old Los Angeles Unified  School District desegregation battle faded Monday when a federal judge put the  case back on course toward a trial, possibly late this year.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima approved dismissal of the school  district from the suit, leaving the National Assn. for the Advancement of  Colored People and state education officials as the remaining combatants. The  three parties had tried for seven months to reach an out-of-court agreement,  but negotiations broke down several weeks ago.  </P> <P> The latest development breathes new life into the bitter, long-running  integration fight that began in Los Angeles Superior Court in 1963 and peaked  with nearly three years of court-ordered cross-town busing from 1979 to 1981.  Busing stopped after a voter-approved initiative -- Proposition 1 -- limited  the ability of state courts to order mandatory busing. The case moved to  federal courts in 1981.  </P> <P> Mandatory busing has remained a legal possibility. But civil rights lawyers  have generally acknowledged that with minority students now making up more than  80% of the student population, forced busing may no longer be an effective way  to deal with segregation in the nation's second-largest school system.  </P> <P> Recent efforts in the case have focused on devising special educational  programs that would improve opportunities for students in low-achieving  inner-city schools.  </P> <P> In what appeared to be a breakthrough last June, Tashima granted a conditional  dismissal of the case against the school district, but ordered the district,  the state and the NAACP to try and work out their differences.  </P> <P> NAACP and school district lawyers said Monday that a settlement, including an  $84-million-a-year enhanced instructional program for dozens of inner-city  schools, appeared possible until representatives of the state declared last  month that they would not pay for any of the program. NAACP General Counsel  Grover Hankins told Tashima that the state "pulled the rug out from under us."  </P> <P> State lawyers, representing Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and the  state Board of Education, said the NAACP and the school district were  misrepresenting the situation. No agreement had been reached on funding or the  adequacy of the proposed instructional improvements at the inner-city schools,  they said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keep Talks Alive  </P> <P> Hankins Monday urged Tashima to keep the school district in the case and to  keep the negotiations alive. But the judge, citing school district and state  arguments, noted that settlement now appears unlikely.  </P> <P> Tashima then finalized his order dismissing the school district as a defendant  in the case, an action that the NAACP had endorsed last year when it appeared a  settlement was at hand.  </P> <P> The action leaves the state as the only remaining defendant. The NAACP,  representing the district's black students, has charged the state contributed  to segregation over the years with a series of actions and inactions, such as  approving the construction of new schools in racially segregated neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Tashima, expressing frustration at delays in the case, criticized the NAACP for  not having its "act together." He said if the civil rights group does not  quickly produce state-requested documents to support its case, he will consider  a motion to dismiss the case against the state also.  </P> <P> Hankins said he is "disappointed" with Tashima's ruling, but he insisted that  the NAACP's case against the state is strong.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State Laws  </P> <P> One course of action previously discussed in the case by the NAACP would be to  try to prove the Los Angeles system was segregated, in part, by state laws  allowing the formation of largely white suburban school districts. For example,  the largely white Palos Verdes Unified School District, in one of the most  affluent areas of the state, was allowed to separate from the Los Angeles  Unified district more than 30 years ago.  </P> <P> But Hankins declined to elaborate on his association's plans, saying the NAACP  would have to assess the impact of Tashima's ruling over the next few weeks.  </P> <P> Peter James, an attorney for the school district, said he was pleased that the  district was dismissed from the case but disappointed that an opportunity  appears to have been missed to reach agreement on a plan to improve education  at inner-city schools.  </P></p>

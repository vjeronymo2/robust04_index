This was stated in a press conference in Moscow on  Thursday by Vladimir Lukin, chief of the State Duma  international affairs committee, and Vladimir Podoprigora,  chairman of a similar Federation Council committee, who both  visited the border area the day before. According to Mr. Lukin,  the Estonian side, as it refers to the borders established by  the 1920 Tartu Peace treaty between the RSFSR and the Estonian  Republic, considers this rayon of Russia to be its own  territory, which is reflected in its constitution.</p>

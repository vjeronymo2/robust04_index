"In my whole coaching career, this is my most rewarding experience. We stuck  together, worked hard and never gave up."  </P> <P> The 49ers had to come from behind after Las Vegas (4-7, 3-4) had taken a 14-9  lead on a 70-yard drive that ended with a five-yard touchdown run by Derek  Black with 1:11 left in the first half.  </P> <P> With nine seconds left in the half, 49er quarterback Todd Studer, with a  defender grabbing his legs, threw a 23-yard scoring pass to tight end Joel  Glick that gave Long Beach the lead for good.  </P> <P> A 30-yard field goal by Sean Cheevers extended the lead to 19-14, then Studer  threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Exum on the first play of the fourth  quarter. Cheevers made it 29-14 when he kicked a 39-yard field goal.  </P> <P> The Long Beach defense, playing one of its best games, held the Rebels  scoreless in the second half until Derek Stott hit Keenan McCardell with a  nine-yard touchdown pass with 2:41 left.  </P> <P> Studer completed 17 of 35 passes for 207 yards, but it was the 49ers' running  that wore down Las Vegas. Of their 231 yards on the ground, Rickey Clark had 87  yards and Herman Nash had 54.  </P> <P> The 49ers, who had lost four games in a row to Las Vegas, finished 6-0 at home  for the first time.  </P></p>

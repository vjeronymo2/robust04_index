The announcement was made  by Christine Stewart, the Canadian minister of state for Latin  America and Africa.    At a news conference the ranking Canadian official said that  her trip to Peru has allowed her to confirm the current  situation in the country. She said she is pleased with the  progress the country has made in the area of economics and  especially in the area of human rights. She pointed out that  the Canadian Government is willing to resume bilateral relations  with Peru, which were interrupted following the self-inflicted  coup on 5 April 1992, and to resume providing social aid for  extremely poor sectors of the population.    [Begin Stewart recording] Our presence in Peru, which has  always remained at the same levels in the past, focuses on  programs to provide aid especially for the poor of this country.  Overall human development and sustained growth are priorities  for my government. [end recording]    Christine Stewart said that Canadian businessmen are quite  interested in investing in Peru which, evidently, would  contribute to the country's development.    [Begin Stewart recording] Private Canadian businessmen can  also invest here for the improvement of Peru and also to  maintain advantages for Canada. [end recording]</p>

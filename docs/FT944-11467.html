			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Food and Drink: Travel broadens the database - Appetisers Eighteen months ago I wrote about Thomas Henkel, an American employee of Conoco, whose business travels had allowed him to produce an extensive personal database of hotels and restaurants around the world. Since then Henkel has added a further 500 entries to his database, which now stands at 3,500, and in response to FT readers' requests for more information, has launched Henkel's Guide, a bimonthly newsletter dedicated to 'discovering exceptional, unique and unusual dining and lodging opportunities worldwide'. For information on obtaining the guide, contact: Henkel's Guide, 16 Foxhill Lane, Greenville, Delaware 19807. Tel: 302-992-9927; fax 302-992-0329. Another guide pioneer is Richard Binns, who since 1980 has been writing and publishing his French Leave series. Binns' latest is Alles France] (Pounds 10.99) which includes 60 favourite hotels and restaurants and a section entitled Franc-wise France - a guide to 350 restaurants and hotels with value for money menus. For Francophiles this guide will provide uncomfortable reading: Binns finds French culinary standards at their lowest for 40 years and that eating out today in provincial Britain can be more enjoyable than the French equivalent. A hundred children will prepare, cook and serve a Sunday lunch banquet for 250 people, to raise money for the Young Cooks Trust and Whizz Kids, a charity which helps provide adapted, powered wheelchairs. The Big Banquet will be held on Sunday November 27 at noon in the Royal College of Music, London SW7. The lunch is masterminded by Philip Britten, Michelin-starred chef of London's Capital Hotel. Tickets are Pounds 65 per person from Queenie Copping, tel: 071-233 6600, fax: 071-233 6611. Restaurant openings never happen exactly on time even with the most experienced management behind them. Six weeks after it should have opened its doors, The Chiswick finally opened for business last week. This in spite of the fact that its directors include Adam and Kate Robinson who have made such a success of The Brackenbury, W6 (081-748 0107) and Tony Mackintosh, the brains behind 192 and the Groucho Club. The Chiswick's chef is Ian Bates, formerly sous-chef at Bibendum, SW3. The Chiswick is at 131-133, Chiswick High Road, London W4 (081-994 6887). Closed Sunday evening and Monday lunch.</p>

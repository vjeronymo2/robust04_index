			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Markets Report: Sterling finishes firmer Sterling had a better day on the foreign exchanges yesterday, bolstered by the CBI quarterly industrial trends survey which suggested that interest rates might have bottomed, writes Philip Gawith. The UK currency finished nearly two pfennigs higher in London at DM2.5226 against the D-Mark from DM2.5049. It also closed one cent higher, at Dollars 1.5015, against the US dollar,the first time in six weeks that it has closed above Dollars 1.50. The sterling index finished six basis points higher at 80.5. Elsewhere, in a quiet day on the markets, the dollar remained weak. It closed at DM1.6801 against the D-Mark, from DM1.6794, but was weaker against the yen, finishing at Y102.925 from Y103.225. The D-Mark was generally stronger in Europe, helped by the market view that there is little scope for a further downward move in interest rates. It closed at L958.4 against the Italian lira, from L957.7, and Pta81.69, from Pta81.52, against the Spanish peseta. The French franc firmed to FFr3.932 from FFr3.435. Despite the stronger performance of sterling, worries about the trade balance and political uncertainty mean that there is little enthusiasm for the UK currency. Yesterday's move appears mostly to have been a response to comments by the CBI that a further cut in UK rates was unnecessary. Although the survey showed manufacturing output had risen at its fastest rate for five years, economists were sceptical about its contents, noting that the balance of optimism had fallen. In its daily money market operations, the Bank of England offered Pounds 770m assistance at the established rate of 5 1/8 per cent, after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 750m. Sterling futures finished the day slightly firmer, with the June contract finishing at 94.58 from 94.57. Traders said the market had been fairly 'whippy', with volumes disappointing. There was some support for the longer contracts. The Bundesbank repo today will be closely watched. Yesterday the German central bank announced both a one and a thirteen day variable repo. The thirteen day period is the result of a public holiday, while the one-day repo appears to represent an effort by the Bundesbank to prevent technical factors impeding the downward path of interest rates. Ms Phyllis Reed, fixed income strategist at BZW, said she believed the Bundesbank had become worried about the bearish tone of German interest rate markets. In the case of the euromark futures, for example, the past two weeks have seen the bottom of the German rate curve come forward from March 1995 to September 1994. The September 1994 contract finished at 94.85, discounting three month money at 5.15 per cent then. This is only 25 basis points below the current rate, which many analysts believe reflects too pessimistic a view on the outlook for German rates. Call money yesterday firmed slightly to 5.35/5.45 per cent from 5.30/5.40 per cent. This is still well below the current repo rate of 5.58 per cent. Predictions about how much the Bundesbank will allow the repo rate to fall vary from 6-12 basis points. Last week the fall of 12 basis points was more than the market expected. Ms Reed said she favoured another similar fall, on the grounds that the German recovery remains fairly fragile and a turnaround in sentiment about rates could damage the recovery, by denting confidence. This was why the Bundesbank had allowed the call rate to stay fairly low, and taken steps to prevent the monthly round of pension payments emerging as an obstacle to lower rates. If this interpretation is correct, it offers the unusual spectacle of the Bundesbank coaxing the market to take rates lower - the reverse of what normally applies. Even a large fall in the German repo rate today is unlikely to help the dollar shake off its woes. Yesterday the US currency was helped by a sharp jump in the April consumer confidence reading to 91.7 from 86.7. Economists were forecasting a slight decline in the reading. The rise was shortlived, however, as the knock-on effect in US debt markets soon curbed the dollar's attempt at a revival. Developments in Japan are not helping the dollar either, with prime minister elect Mr Tsutomu Hata weakened by the SDP quitting the ruling coalition. Mr Robert Thomas, currency strategist at Natwest Markets, said the fiscal stimulus package would probably still be passed, but 'there must be doubt about whether Mr Hata will be more able on the trade side than Mr Hosokawa.' South Africa's two currencies were buoyant as voting began in the country's first democratic elections. The commercial rand rose by nearly three cents to R3.585 against the dollar from R3.6138. The more thinly traded financial rand, the vehicle for foreign investment, rose by 20 cents to R4.695 from R4.895. This represents a 17 per cent appreciation from the low of R5.6435 on April 11.</p>

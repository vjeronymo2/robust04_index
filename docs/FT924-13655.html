			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / BBC audiences 'to fall' THE BBC faces a substantial loss of its share of television audiences by the end of the decade, according to a series of independent forecasts. Paying For Broadcasting, a new book containing studies commissioned by the corporation, says vigorous competition might leave the BBC with 32 per cent of viewing by the year 2000. It currently has about 42 per cent. According to the study, the ITV share in 2000 would be 34 per cent, Channel 4 would have 8 per cent and the combined share of Channel 5 - if it goes ahead - and cable and satellite channels would be 26 per cent. The revenue flowing to the ITV companies in 2000 may not be very different in real terms from the equivalent 1988 figure - about Pounds 1.7bn - which will put increasing pressure on the production of high-cost programmes, according to the book. In one study, Mr Gavyn Davies, chief economist of Goldman Sachs, and Mr Andrew Graham, an Oxford economics tutor, argue that the licence fee should be linked to unit labour costs in the private service sector rather than to the retail prices index. If the licence fee was uprated with the RPI, the BBC's market share would probably decline to less than 30 per cent by the year 2000 and to only 20 per cent by 2010. The study argues that if the BBC were to sell two minutes of advertising every hour, expanding total air time by 13 per cent, it would not lead to an overall increase in advertising revenue. By the year 2000, total revenue would fall to a predicted Pounds 2.382bn, Pounds 37m less than forecasts for a market where the BBC did not take advertising. Mr Tony Hall, BBC director of news and current affairs, last night claimed that the introduction of the planned 24-hour radio news service would give listeners more choice. Both Radio 4 on FM and BBC Radio News on long wave would carry the main news and current-affairs programmes from Today in the morning through to the Midnight News. Mr Hall told the Royal Television Society that there would be an increase in business news with three half-hour programmes a day. Paying For Broadcasting. Routledge. Pounds 18.</p>

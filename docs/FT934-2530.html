			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: GM and Poland reach deal on car assembly General Motors, the US carmaker, reached agreement with the Polish authorities yesterday to begin car assembly in Warsaw, in a joint venture with FSO, the Polish state-owned carmaker. The deal, reached after more than two years of negotiations, marks an important step forward in the modernisation of the eastern European car industry. In the first stage, the venture will assemble up to 10,000 four-door Opel Astra small family cars a year from SKD (semi-knocked-down) kits supplied from GM plants in western Europe. GM will send already-painted car bodies from its assembly plant at Antwerp for final trim and assembly in Warsaw. Major components such as engines and transmissions will be supplied from its plant at Bochum, Germany. Production will begin in the second half of next year. At first, GM will invest DM9.4m (Pounds 3.73m) to take a 50 per cent stake and management control in the venture, which will have a workforce of about 250. It will invest a further DM10m within a few months, which will increase its stake to 65-70 per cent. Under the terms of the deal, GM envisages moving later to a more ambitious second stage in which cars would be assembled from CKD (completely-knocked-down) kits, which would require body welding and painting to be carried out in Poland. Output for the second stage could be increased to up to 33,000 cars a year on three shifts with a workforce of about 1,000. This stage would increase total investment in the project to about Dollars 60m (Pounds 40.2m). At present, GM has 32 Opel dealers in Poland and is aiming to increase this to about 50 next year. As part of the planned co-operation, GM will take part in developing the automotive components supply industry in Poland. Last week, it announced that ACG, the GM group's automotive components subsidiary, with two of its worldwide divisions Packard Electric and Inland Fisher Guide, had signed a memorandum of understanding with FSO and its affiliate ZEM-ELK to set up a feasibility study of the establishment of joint ventures in components areas such as wiring harnesses, lighting, and metal and plastic components. GM said that several other ACG components divisions were also in discussions with potential Polish partners, within the FSO group and outside. As a further part of the deal, GM will advise FSO on measures to modernise production of the Polish carmaker's present out-dated Polonez car range, originally launched in 1978, the design of which dates back to the 1960s. For the longer term, GM will assist in evaluating a replacement for the Polonez, and it is understood to be examining the possibility of producing a new low-cost car in Poland smaller than its present Opel/Vauxhall Corsa supermini. Mr David Herman, chief executive of Opel, said yesterday that 'Poland could certainly be a good place to produce an entry level car.' Fiat, the Italian carmaker, which recently completed the takeover of FSM, the other former state-owned carmaker, already uses Poland as its sole assembly location for its Cinquecento small car for supply to all European markets. GM said yesterday that as part of its assembly deal the Polish authorities had agreed not to impose an excise tax on its local production. A 15 per cent excise duty is charged on imported cars. Mr Marek Pol, the new Polish industry minister, said that GM would be exempt from paying profit tax waivers up to the amount of its investment of DM9.4m. 'There have been no inducements other than those regularly extended to foreign investors,' Mr Pol said yesterday. But the contract gives assurances that the Polish government will compensate GM for any losses resulting from future changes in tariff and tax conditions.</p>

In a televised speech last night, President Salih said unity  was a fact of life and that any thinking of secession is out of  the question. He said it will not happen no matter what the  price will be.    President Salih indirectly accused Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party of heightening military tensions.  He said he warned those who insist on this course that they  will pay the price.    He said a joint Yemeni-Jordanian and Omani military  committee, which also includes the U.S. and French military  attaches in Sanaa, was working to end the military tension and  for the return of forces to their original bases.</p>

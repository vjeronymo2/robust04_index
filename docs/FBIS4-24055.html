			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Text] Fierce clashes are taking place in N'dalatando, the  capital of Cuanza Norte Province, where Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] troops tried to link  N'dalatando to Malanje.    Over the past few days the Armed Forces for the Liberation  of  Angola [FALA] blocked the warmongering adventure of the Futungo  de Belas, which with impressive war equipment tried to break the  FALA defensive lines. FALA's prompt response forced Eduardo dos  Santos' troops to retreat 25 km following hard clashes in Pamba.  At present, everything is secure in the city of N'dalatando.  Our correspondent Felix Miranda reports from Soyo:    [Miranda] The situation in N'dalatando deteriorated  over the past few days when an enormous People's Armed Forces  for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] convoy made up  of about 105 vehicles, carrying troops and war materiel to  assist its regiments [words indistinct] with about 15  armored vehicles. [passage indistinct]    The UNITA armed forces over the past few days destroyed a  war  helicopter, more than 10 armored vehicles, and captured an  assortment of military equipment, including 15 troop transports,  15 radios, and two D-30 guns.    Since the Luanda Communist government began intense air and  ground raids all over the country on 29 May 1994, the residents  of the plateau city of Bie [Kuito] have never experienced peace.  Incessant air raids by Eduardo dos Santos' air force have been  causing numerous victims, particularly in the most vulnerable  group of the society -- old people, women, and children. The  situation has grown worse over the past five days. Our  correspondent Jardo Prata reports:    [Prata] Between 16 and 20 June, more than 300 powerful  bombs were dropped by Sukhoi MiG's [as heard] over Cantifula,  Fatima, (Quiluto), (Candanga), and (Calumpanga) wards. The two  last wards are located more than 15 km from the city of Bie. The  human and material losses are extensive.    Meanwhile, Eduardo dos Santos' war aircraft once again  bombed  civilian wards and settlements today.    [Prata] This morning, Eduardo dos Santos' MiGs once  again bombed (Tecnicombe) and Popular wards twice. In this  murderous rampage, at least three people were killed, a  29-year-old woman carrying her baby and an 18-year-old girl.</p>

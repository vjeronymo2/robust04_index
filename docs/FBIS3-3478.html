			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Hongtao (0491 3163 3447): "Henan Deputies </F> to NPC Suggest Enacting Law on Collecting People's Opinions"]    [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Zhang  Wensheng, a peasant deputy from Henan Province, recently became  a focus of attention for reporters covering the "two sessions."  This is because he took the lead, together with 33 other  people's deputies, in submitting to the congress a motion for  the enactment of a "law on collecting people's opinions."    The peasant entrepreneur, born when the republic was  founded,  gave an exclusive interview to this reporter today. He said:  An important reason for corruption and policy blunders has been  the lack of a mechanism for the people to exercise supervision  and of a normal channel for conveying grass-roots opinions to  the higher authorities. The motion submitted to the NPC  Standing Committee, on the initiative of 34 people's deputies  from Henan, is for the establishment of a "national development  center for the collection and study of the people's opinions"  and for the drafting and promulgation of a "law on collecting  the people's opinions." They are aimed at fundamentally  changing -- through the institution of the law -- the present  condition in which "no one pays attention, or even listens to  the opinions and suggestions of the people; worse still, critics  are retaliated against." Through this motion, the people will  not feel they have no opportunity or right to speak out. If  their proposals and opinions are heeded and adopted, they will  have a stronger sense of responsibility for the country and the  nation, so no one need worry about the country being unable to  become prosperous and flourishing.    According to the jointly signed motion: "Under the  planned-economy structure, various elements in society basically  existed in a system bonded by administrative ties. The market  economy gradually will break parts of the original system. For  instance, some enterprises, institutions, individuals, and  others `without competent administrative departments above them'  now are emerging everywhere. How will the voices of the central  authorities continue to be heard unimpeded in grass-roots units?  How will the voices of grass-roots units be channeled back to  the central authorities? These are matters pending urgent  solution now." Therefore, "it is imperative to institute a `law  on collecting people's opinions.'"    These people's deputies proposed in their motion that during  the term of the current people's congress, an organ specially  responsible for the formulation of a "law on collecting people's  opinions" be set up so as to draft and promulgate such a law as  quickly as possible; that a "national development center for the  collection and study of people's opinions" be established; that  a "national fund to award people for their suggestions" be  founded; and that a new academic discipline called "theory on  the collection of people's opinions" be initiated by the state.</p>

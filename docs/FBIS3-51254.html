The control tower  at Ernesto Cortizos Airport reported that it did not receive  notification of the presence of the aircraft, adding that the  crew did not respond to calls from the control tower asking them  the purpose of their flight and destination.    The airplanes continued their flight, possibly toward Fort  Clayton military base in Panama.</p>

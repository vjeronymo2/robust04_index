			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Patrice Desmedt: "Siemens-Nixdorf Convalescing"] </F>   [Text] SNI [Siemens-Nixdorf] executives predict the  company will not be operating in the red this fiscal year. Also,  the company is finally offering a comprehensive gamut of  products.    Whether wishful thinking or well-founded optimism,  Hans-Dieter Wiedig, head of the Siemens Nixdorf board of  directors, claims to see light at the end of the tunnel. "In  terms of our operating balance, we should reach the break-even  point this year and show actual profits next year." Because of  restructuring costs, new losses will be posted for the current  year. But top-level SNI officials apparently hope to put all the  red ink behind them by next year. Of course, they predicted a  year ago, incorrectly, that the 1992 deficit would be cut in  half in 1993. Today, however, the product line is at last  complete, and SNI has begun acting and thinking like a company  with an identity of its own, rather than just a juxtaposition of  Siemens and Nixdorf.    In the first 5 months of the fiscal year, turnover was down  by 6 percent over last year at the same time, but volume of  outstanding orders is 2 percent greater than at the end of the  last fiscal year, and "profits have improved over the same  period a year ago." Its PCs are increasingly successful, with  orders up 87 percent from first quarter, over and above the  40-percent increase in number of units produced last year. SNI  had already introduced new offerings at Cebit (see LMI No. 576  of 11 February). But some clients, departing from the  mainstream, have shown interest in the RM200, a "RISC" [reduced  instruction set computer] PC built around a 100-MHz R4600  processor (a variant of the R4400) but with original  architecture. The bus is on a slave card, thus allowing for  choice between ISA [Industry Standard Architecture] and EISA  [Enhanced ISA] buses connected to two expansion connectors (one  ISA and one ISA/VESA [Video Electronics Standards Association],  or two EISA/VESA). This machine, designed and manufactured at  Plaisir, in the Paris region, will be available in July. The  price (excluding taxes) is in the same range as a  well-configured Pentium, a high-end Power Mac, or an Alpha PC:  about 40,000 French francs [Fr] for an ISA 16-500 version with  15-inch screen, and somewhere near Fr54,000 for an EISA 32-500  version. The first RM200 will be delivered with Sinix [SNI's  version of Unix]. From a technical standpoint, the machine runs  perfectly under Windows NT (indeed, SNI executives say it runs  NT applications 70 percent faster than a Pentium 66), but SNI  believes there is virtually no demand for NT on RM200-type  machines designed to support client applications.    SNI France has just announced the departure of Kurt  Hollederer from his position as general manager in charge of  operations. He is returning to Germany to oversee implementation  and coordination of international consolidation plans and will  be working directly under Robert Hoogstraten, a member of the  board of directors.</p>

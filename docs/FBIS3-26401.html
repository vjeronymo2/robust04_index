			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nicosia, February 4 (XINHUA) -- The fact that the  rival Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities in Cyprus have  accepted in principle a U.N. package of confidence building  measures (CMBs) has created a unique opportunity, a U.S.  official said here today.    Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special Cyprus  coordinator, told a bicommunal press conference that he hoped  the past week he had spent on the island would be "historic."    He said "we have a unique opportunity. No one sees the CMBs  as an end in themselves. There is obviously more work to do.  The solution is still in front of us," but the package "can lay  the foundation stones."    U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali suggested last  May  a three-point peace plan, or confidence building measures.    The measures, aimed at building trust between the Greek and  Turkish Cypriot communities, envisage the transfer of the  Turkish- held fenced area of Famagusta to the U.N.  Administration and reopening of the now defunct Nicosia  International Airport.    Both sides on the island now accept the U.N. plan but have  strong reservation over it.    Expressing his cautiousness, Lamb said, "The level of trust  between the two sides is low, each side is skeptical about the  other's commitment to the package."    He added that the "party leaders in the Greek Cypriot side  are more negative this time than on the Turkish Cypriot side  which is different from when I was here four months ago."    The message he sent to party leaders across the divided  island was that "There may be things that you see are  shortcomings, but this represents an opportunity." He  described the package as "very positive and balanced."    However, asked about the problems he encountered this week,  he said, "Frankly I came up with fewer difficulties than I  expected," both President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denktash showed willingness to discuss the package.    Lamb said, "There's been agreement on the principles and  what  we have to do now is to go through a process of refining these  principles so that each side understands exactly what the other  side expects from them," Lamb said.    On a timetable for the completion of the talks, the U.S.  official said, "We don't want artificial deadlines ... [ellipses  as received] We're not going to push either community to do  something they are not comfortable with. On the other hand  that's very different from delay," he said.    Local press reports said today U.N. Secretary General Ghali  is about to send a letter to the leaders of the two communities,  asking them to start indirect talks here in Nicosia on the peace  plan.    The U.N.-sponsored peace talks, which have been on and off  for nearly twenty years, have so far failed to yield any  concrete results.    The island country has been divided into two parts since  1974  when Turkish troops intervened in northern Cyprus, with the  Turkish Cypriots in the north and Greek Cypriots in the south.    The U.S. official is expected to leave the island today  after  one week's visit to the island.</p>

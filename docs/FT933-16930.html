			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Letter: Rediscovered in wrong country Sir, With reference to Michael Prowse's review of von Mises' work ('Time to rediscover Ludwig von Mises', June 28), whether his work is or is not an extension of that of David Hume and Adam Smith, I am sure that von Mises would have known that they were Scots and not English.

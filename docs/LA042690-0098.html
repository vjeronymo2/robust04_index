			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY AT AFI FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are The Times' recommendations for today's schedule of the American  Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival (AFIFEST), with  commentary by the film reviewing staff. Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213)  520-2000.  </P> <P> Highly recommended:  </P> <P> "THE BEEKEEPER"(Greece; Director: Theo Angelopoulos; Cineplex Century Plaza).  Like all of Angelopoulos' work, this one -- a contemporary drama and road  movie, starring Marcello Mastroianni -- is hauntingly sad, mysteriously  beautiful. It's a homage of sorts to Michelangelo Antonioni, a definitive  poetic portrait of an aging man facing disillusionment, pain, isolation, the  lusts of youth, possible destruction. (Michael Wilmington).  </P> <P> "SITTING PRETTY ON A BRANCH"(Czechoslovakia; Director: Juraj Jakubisko;  Cineplex Odeon Fairfax). A comic fairy tale on the aftermath of World War II,  with a clown from a concentration camp searching for a stolen bicycle full of  hidden gold, this is a magical film, a return to the great '60s period of  Czechoslovakian cinema. (Sheila Benson).  </P> <P> Recommended:  </P> <P> "THE LONG WAY HOME"(U.S.; Director: Michael Apted; AFI Mark Goodson). This  documentary has a priceless subject, which it reveals with dispassionate skill:  the rocky road traveled by the underground Leningrad rock band, Aquarium, after  signing its first Western recording contract. (M. W.)  </P> <P> "TIE ME UP, TIE ME DOWN"(Spain; Director: Pedro Almodovar; Century Plaza). This  comedy about sexual bondage, while using many of the Almodovar stock company,  has less of the inspired, dead-ahead zaniness of his earlier successes. His  fans may not mind. (S.B.)  </P></p>

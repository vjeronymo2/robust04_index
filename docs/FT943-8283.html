			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Reform of sixth-form curriculum slows The government's most concerted attempt to broaden the sixth-form curriculum appears to be grinding to a halt, according to today's figures. Advanced Supplementary, or AS-levels were introduced six years ago. Each AS-level is worth half an A-level for university entrance purposes. The exams were designed to be as intellectually rigorous as A-levels, but requiring only half as much preparation. However, schools complain that the exams create timetabling difficulties, and that many should be worth more than half an A-level. The numbers taking AS-levels fell slightly this year, with slightly more than 53,000 applications - compared to around 750,000 applications for full A-levels.</p>

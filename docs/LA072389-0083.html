			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE REPORTED ON RISE IN SOVIET JAILS, LABOR CAMPS  </P> <P> Violence in Soviet prisons and labor camps is on the rise, and there have been  three times as many instances of hostage-taking this year as in all of 1988,  the country's top corrections official said in an article published Friday.  </P> <P> Ivan Katorgin, head of the Interior Ministry's Department of Correctional  Facilities, said there was a 28.8% increase in crimes committed at correctional  institutions and detention centers.  </P> <P> "This year, there were 48 cases of hostage-taking, which is three times more  than the whole of 1988," Katorgin wrote in Nedelya, a weekly supplement to the  government newspaper Izvestia. "A total of 114 guards were subjected to  physical violence, with 14 wounded and one killed."  </P> <P> He said that over the first five months of 1989, 263 inmates faced disciplinary  or criminal charges and that there was a growing tendency toward group  disobedience and refusal to work.  </P> <P> The Interior Ministry is taking several steps to reverse the violent trend,  such as allowing inmates to use 10% of their pay to buy food in prison shops  and increasing the number of visits by relatives.  </P> <P> Katorgin also said corrupt prison officials will be fired.  </P></p>

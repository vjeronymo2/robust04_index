			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BUCKEY RETURNS TO COURT FOR TRIAL  </P> <P> Raymond Buckey walked into court today a free man for the first time in nearly  five years, smiling but refusing to discuss the mass molestation charges  against him in the McMartin Pre-School case.  </P> <P> Buckey was released on $1.5-million bail Wednesday night as reporters and  photographers swarmed around him. Today Superior Court Judge William Pounders  likened Buckey's jail exit to the televised slaying of President John F.  Kennedy's killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby in  1963.  </P> <P> "It was certainly a circus," said Pounders.  </P> <P> He asked the jurors, who have been admonished to avoid all news coverage of the  2-year-old trial, if they had seen the release on late-night television news  shows. They assured that him they had not.  </P> <P> Out of the presence of the jury, Pounders deplored the fact that word of  Buckey's release had leaked out and said he had tried to keep it a secret for  Buckey's protection.  </P></p>

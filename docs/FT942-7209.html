			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chamberlin &amp; Hill shows 11% decline to Pounds 1.42m Chamberlin &amp; Hill, the maker of iron castings, electrical conduit fittings and switchgear, reported a near 11 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.59m to Pounds 1.42m for the year to end-March. The outcome was struck on turnover up by 8 per cent, from Pounds 20.3m to Pounds 22m. Interest payable was Pounds 131,000 (Pounds 141,000) and after tax of Pounds 288,000 (Pounds 441,000) earnings per share came out at 15.78p (16.07p). Despite the fall in earnings directors are recommending an unchanged final dividend of 4.5p, making 6.5p (6.25p) for the year. Mr John Eccles, chairman, said the second half of the year had proved more volatile than expected and the forecast improvement in the trading position following high levels of capital expenditure at the Bloxwich foundry did not materialise. In addition, Fitter &amp; Poulton ended the year with second half profits well below its estimates as a result of price competition and sharply reduced margins.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Major fails to revive trade talks - EC farm subsidies remain stumbling block THE high-risk bid by Mr John Major, British prime minister, to revitalise the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks failed yesterday. British officials had insisted the prime minister would take up the issue of the stalled trade talks vigorously in bilateral talks with France's President Francois Mitterrand yesterday afternoon. In the end, however, Mr Major said nothing, after the French president made it clear he would not support any breakthrough during the Munich summit. Even before he met Mr Mitterrand, Mr Major's proposals to break the deadlock had been frustrated. UK officials who had appeared optimistic on Monday evening were visibly downcast 12 hours later. The stumbling block remained the dispute between the EC and the US on cutting Community subsidies to farm trade. Talks early yesterday between US President George Bush and Mr Jacques Delors, EC Commission president, failed to advance the issue significantly. 'No substantial progress was made,' a Commission spokesman reported. 'If anyone was expecting a breakthrough this morning, it did not happen.' The meeting between the two presidents and their senior officials was the culmination of 36 hours of feverish efforts to push the farm trade talks to a successful conclusion. The top-level politicking on trade started on Sunday night at a working dinner attended by Presidents Bush and Mitterrand - well before the formal start of the summit. This was at odds with widespread official advice before the summit that the issue was too complex to unravel while leaders were meeting under such a powerful spotlight. The Uruguay Round was raised again at a bilateral meeting on Monday between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Bush. Hopes rose after the German government spokesman reported that the two leaders had agreed negotiations on trade reform should be continued with vigour and that the two sides were closer than many people thought. Also on Monday, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary and current chairman of the EC council of ministers, met Mr Frans Andriessen, the Community's external affairs commissioner, and Mr James Baker, US secretary of state. The three agreed there was a need to reach a breakthrough to end the current blockage. Mr Hurd's judgment - wrong in the end - was that the US and EC were geared up to take advantage at once of a 'political push' in the talks. Mr Major's move was Britain's attempt to provide that push. Details of Mr Major's proposals remain obscure. It is thought he proposed extending beyond the six years proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt secretary-general, the period over which EC farm subsidies should be substantially reduced. He also suggested less radical cuts in the volume of the EC's subsidised farm exports than the 24 per cent proposed in the Dunkel plan. These ideas - which had been discussed at official level for several weeks without success - would have involved some easing of positions adopted by the big industrialised countries represented at the summit, in particular France and Germany. The ideas were welcomed by the US but barely acknowledged by France, the EC's biggest food exporter, which insisted instead that the US should respond positively to recent reforms of the EC common agricultural policy. While French opposition effectively buried any hope of a breakthrough, the UK made clear it would continue to press for progress on the Uruguay Round and would be seeking strong language in today's final summit communique. Mr Major's initiative was always risky. Officials from most G7 countries had warned that Munich was not the place to expect a breakthrough on farm trade, partly because of the September 20 French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The warning signs were clear when, in the middle of last week, officials abandoned a 10-day push to find a basis for settlement ahead of the summit. Nonetheless, Mr Major insisted that trade reform was his 'number one priority at the summit', driven perhaps by a desire to put an early British stamp on the EC presidency. He won some applause for his efforts. Officials from several delegations suggested that the differences among the G7 countries were not great. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said the protagonists were much closer than at last year's summit in London. One senior EC official said all that was lacking was the political will to reach a settlement. British officials were left putting a brave face on the prime minister's initiative. But they were unable to hide their disappointment that the Munich summit had failed to make progress on an agreement that could stimulate world growth and benefit industrialised, developing and former communist countries alike. Now leaders face the embarrassing task of drafting a summit communique in which commitments to agree the Uruguay Round sound credible. Given their forceful calls both last year and in 1990 for an early settlement of the Round, this will be an unenviable task. RESOLUTION FROM LAST YEAR'S SUMMIT 'No issue has more far-reaching implications for the future prospects of the world economy than the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. . . The aim of all contracting parties should be to complete the Round before the end of 1991. We shall remain personally involved in this process, ready to intervene with one another if differences can only be resolved at the highest level.' London, July 1991</p>

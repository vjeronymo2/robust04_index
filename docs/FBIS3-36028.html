In response to inquiries from the presidential staff, the  government, and public organizations about the number of our  servicemen, three of our highest-ranking generals gave different  figures. Moreover, the gap between the figures amounts to over  20 divisions.    Dmitriy Volkogonov said just before his removal from the  post  of presidential military adviser that 1.8 million men serve in  the Russian Armed Forces. Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov,  chief of General Staff, divulged that the Armed Forces include a  total of 2.1 million servicemen. Defense Ministry Pavel  Grachev, however, said that at present the Armed Forces are  2.341 million men strong.</p>

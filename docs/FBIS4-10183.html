			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 7 Apr (EFE) -- Argentine political  parties will close their political campaign today in the midst  of widespread indifference. On 10 April, citizens will elect  305 members of a Constituent Assembly that will be responsible  for reforming the Constitution.    Numerous radio and television surveys indicate that a good  percentage of Argentine citizens are not aware of what is  involved in the reform except that it will permit President  Carlos Menem to run for reelection. Other surveys indicate that  more than 25 percent of eligible voters will not vote despite  the fact that voting is compulsory, or they will submit blank  votes, as during the 3 October 1993 legislative election.    Yesterday, former President Raul Alfonsin, candidate for the  Radical Civic Union (UCR) in Buenos Aires Province, asked people  to vote for his party "to make sure that the Constitution will  be a guarantee of justice and security for all." Carlos Menem,  in turn, presided over a ceremony in Santiago del Estero during  which he called on citizens to vote for the party of their  liking and not submit blank votes, as blank votes "are of no  use."    The progress made by the center-left coalition Grand Front  (FG) in the Argentine capital, where surveys place it behind the  ruling Justicialist Party (Peronist) and ahead of the UCR, has  been the significant event of the two weeks leading up to the  election.    The FG is headed by Deputy Carlos Alvarez, a dissident  Peronist who has occupied the most important sections in local  newspapers over the last few months because according to  observers, he is the Argentine leader who understands best that  political campaigns must be carried out in the communications  media.    Over the past few days, Menem and Alfonsin have defended the  agreement the two leaders signed at the end of 1993 to have a  project for reforming the Constitution approved by Congress.  Their remarks were aimed at accusations made by other parties'  candidates that "the pact" was signed behind the people's back.    The Peronists and Radicals association opened a deep breach  between them and the other political groups which are also  fighting for votes.    Jesus Rodriguez, who is in first place on the UCR ticket for  the capital, said "people know the UCR alone can control Menem's  growing power," and called on citizens "to concentrate votes for  the opposition."    Fernando "Pino" Solanas, Argentine actor and candidate for  the FG, proposed the election of Neuquen's emeritus bishop,  Monsignor Jaime de Nevares, as Constituent Assembly president.  De Nevares left his provincial diocese when he turned 75, at the  beginning of the year. He will be the main speaker today at the  FG campaign closing act in a Buenos Aires theater. The prelate  was one of the few leaders who maintained a critical position  against the political repression unleashed by the military  regime (1976-83). He has also criticized the market economy  system Menem adopted ever since he came to power in 1989.</p>

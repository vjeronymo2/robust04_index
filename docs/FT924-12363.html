			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / C&amp;G mortgage rate cut to 9.05% CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the seventh-largest building society, undercut the rest of the market yesterday by moving its standard variable mortgage rate down by 0.7 of a percentage point to 9.05 per cent from December 1. Meanwhile, figures released yesterday suggest that societies had one of their worst months for business ever in September - with activity on savings and mortgage lending sharply down. The new Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester rate compares with a standard mortgage interest rate of about 9.25 per cent for other lenders. It will apply immediately for new customers and from December 1 for existing borrowers. Many new borrowers will also be given a discount of 1 percentage point, bringing their mortgage interest rate down to 8.05 per cent. Nationwide, the second-largest building society, and National Westminster Bank have also cut mortgage interest rates. In both cases, the reduced interest rates apply immediately for new customers and from December 1 for existing ones. From today, new borrowers with Nationwide will pay 9.29 per cent interest, a reduction of 0.66 of a percentage point, although there will be slightly larger cuts for customers with large loans. NatWest has cut its mortgage loan rate by 0.74 of a percentage point to 9.25 per cent. The business figures released yesterday by the Building Societies Association show a net savings outflow of Pounds 264m in September, compared with an inflow of Pounds 327m in August. At the same time, mortgage lending dwindled to Pounds 446m, down from Pounds 1.7bn in each of the previous two months. The figure was the lowest monthly total since 1982. One of the reasons for the sharp fall was the end of the stamp-duty holiday in August. New lending, agreed but not disbursed, dropped from Pounds 2.48bn in August to Pounds 1.8bn. During the month, the housing market was extremely subdued, with house prices falling by 3.1 per cent, according to the Halifax house-price index. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the association, said the market was still beset with worries about unemployment and economic uncertainty, but that the latest fall in base rates to 8 per cent might help revive consumer sentiment.</p>

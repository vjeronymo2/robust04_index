			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- The Christian Social Union [CSU]  leadership assessed the election to the European Parliament in  Germany as a "vote for Kohl." Before the beginning of the  executive committee session of his party in Munich on Monday [13  June], CSU Chairman Theo Waigel said that Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] challenger Rudolf Scharping had made the  mistake of underestimating the chancellor. "Scharping does not  look so good, this is an open secret."    Bavarian Minister President Edmund Stoiber said: "It was  certainly a vote for Kohl. The SPD has to decide whether it was  also an anti-Scharping vote."    After the CSU's surprisingly good performance, Waigel called  on his own party immediately to start the work for the Landtag  and Bundestag elections in the fall. "We are not arrogant now."  Bavaria's SPD, with its chairwoman Renate Schmidt, has been  dampened. Schmidt does not have an answer to questions of the  future and she is trying to divert the people's attention from  it with cheap propaganda tricks, it was stated.</p>

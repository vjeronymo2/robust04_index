			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Public funding unavoidable Sir, Whether or not it is desirable to reduce capital expenditure on roads, I think that very few would argue for a reduction in capital expenditure on transport, as suggested in your report, 'Roads budget faces cut of Pounds 400m' (October 3). Any reduction in the roads budget should be complemented by an increase in expenditure on public transport. While the government would like much of that investment to come from the private sector, it is quite clear from the limited progress of the private finance initiative that the use of public funds is unavoidable.

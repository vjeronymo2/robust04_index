			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> GULF WAR ISN'T POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE U.N.;  </P> <P> THE CHARTER PRECLUDES UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION. THE REALITIES ON THE GROUND  BEAR THE SAME MESSAGE.  </P> <P> Almost from the beginning of the Persian Gulf crisis, a chorus of pundits,  often relying on (not-for-attribution) statements by high U.S. officials, has  maintained that only military action will achieve America's objectives. And  last week, for the first time, President Bush and Secretary of State James A.  Baker III expressly broached the possibility of the use of force against Iraq.  </P> <P> An unspoken assumption of this discussion is that the United States, even in  the absence of another attack by Iraq or authorization by the Security Council,  is legally free to take military action unilaterally. The argument is that the  United States was exercising the inherent right of collective self-defense  guaranteed by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter when it deployed forces in Saudi  Arabia and the gulf after the attack on Kuwait. It is for the United States to  decide, therefore, whether the measures taken so far are sufficient and, if  not, what more is needed.  </P> <P> The United States took the same position in August on the use of naval force in  the gulf to enforce U.N. sanctions. U.S. naval vessels fired shots across the  bows of two Iraqi tankers. But in the end the President thought better of it.  He did not order more action, and the ships continued on course. After a day or  two, the Security Council authorized member states with naval forces in the  gulf "to use such measures commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be  necessary . . . to ensure strict implementation" of sanctions. The interception  and boarding of vessels heading to or from Iraq was carried out under the  authority of that resolution.  </P> <P> That seems to be what is required by Article 51 itself. It says that the  inherent right of self-defense persists only "until the Security Council has  taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security."  </P> <P> Of course, if Iraq attacks, the United States would be free to respond. But  without further provocation, the critical question is, who is to judge whether  the actions taken so far by the council are sufficient to maintain  international peace and security? Article 39 says that the council "shall . . .  decide what measures shall be taken . . . to maintain or restore international  peace and security." Even more telling, Article 42, which empowers the Security  Council to order the use of force, begins: "Should the Security Council  consider that measures provided for in Article 41 (that is, diplomatic and  economic sanctions) would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate . . ."  then it may order military action.  </P> <P> In the larger scheme of the charter, it is the Security Council that has  "primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and  security." To carry out that responsibility, the council must have the  authority to make the political judgments and to take the measures necessary to  deal with the situation. This conception of the Security Council's role  reinforces the fundamental aim of the charter to limit unilateral use of force  to the narrowest possible range.  </P> <P> During the Cold War, when the Security Council was immobilized by reciprocal  vetoes, states exercising the right of self-defense could not be expected to  forgo continuing action simply because the council was debating the situation,  with no likelihood of a serious substantive outcome. Today, however, the  President himself has acknowledged that the Security Council is working "as it  was supposed to work." The council addressed the situation promptly, adopted  measures with real impact, including comprehensive and binding economic  sanctions, and strengthened those measures as the need became apparent.  </P> <P> If the United Nations is working as intended, judgments about the ultimate  objectives of its action, the adequacy of measures to be taken, the amount of  time needed to give sanctions a chance to work and the like should be answered  by the council. The United States has a very important voice in the process of  reaching those decisions. To date, the President and U.N. Ambassador Thomas  Pickering have exercised impressive leadership in the council's deliberations.  But if they cannot induce the others to agree that the use of force is  necessary, the clear meaning of the charter is that unilateral action is  precluded.  </P> <P> "Realists" often dismiss this kind of analysis as "legalistic" -- an effort to  impose abstract legal constraints on practical and decisive action. And lawyers  who advise presidents are understandably reluctant to reduce options or  otherwise tell him that he can't do what he wants to do. In the gulf, however,  as is so often the case, the international legal analysis highlights the  practical realities of the situation.  </P> <P> Visions of surgical strikes and costless decapitating attacks may dance in the  heads of armchair strategists and Pentagon planners, but in real life they  almost never come off. A large-scale attack on Iraq, even if "successful,"  would run high risks of significant casualties, including many noncombatants in  Iraq and elsewhere, the destruction of major oil installations, which would  send oil prices skyrocketing; severely negative long-term affects on the U.S.  position with the Arab states and escalation to a general Middle Eastern war.  </P> <P> As a practical matter, it is no longer possible for the United States to use  force in the gulf without the concurrence of the others engaged there. They,  too, will be exposed to the military, political and economic consequences of  any U.S. military action. Indeed, the first consequence of such action would be  to shatter the international consensus that has so far given legitimacy and  strength to the enterprise. Among the first defections could well be the Arab  states that requested the U.S. presence in the first place, and without whose  continuing support the enterprise could not be sustained. Secretary Baker's  current round of consultations in the Middle East and Moscow recognize these  legal and practical realities.  </P> <P> U.S. actions in the gulf will have far-reaching implications for the new world  order President Bush is trying to build. In a sense, we are beneficiaries of a  second chance, something that doesn't often happen in the inexorable world of  international politics. It is almost as if the Security Council had been in  suspended animation since 1945, and is now stirring to life new and untouched.  </P> <P> The most important long-term impact of the crisis may well be on this new and  still fragile growth. If the Security Council is to be preserved and  strengthened for the role it was designed to play, it cannot be used simply as  a forum for consultation, even less so to provide legal cover for unilaterally  mandated ends. As the organ of the international community with primary  responsibility in situations threatening international peace and security, it  must have the powers to decide when force is to be used. That means that the  United States must abide by the council's decisions even when we don't agree  with them.  </P> <P> In a world where power is increasingly diffused and mobilization of power on  the basis of ideology is increasingly unavailable, the requirements of  international law and practical international politics on this issue are one  and the same.  </P></p>

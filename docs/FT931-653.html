			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Managers' pay rises slow but beat inflation MANAGERS' basic pay comfortably outstripped inflation in the 12 months to February but the trend of the settlements fell in the course of the year, a survey of more than 1,000 companies has found. The survey by pay research group Reward found that basic pay rose by 4.4 per cent in the year, compared with a 1.8 per cent rise in the retail prices index, but that six months ago pay was rising at an annual rate of more than 5.5 per cent. Another survey published today also shows that average pay increases are falling but are still more than double the rate of inflation. Increases averaged 4.2 per cent in the quarter to the start of January, the latest Hay Compensation report says. However, the quarterly study of pay awards among 573 large and medium-sized UK organisations covering 188,000 jobs in the management and clerical sectors says deals averaged 6 per cent in the same period of the previous year. The downward trend is further reflected in the annual figures, which averaged 5.6 per cent over the 12 months to the beginning of January compared with 9 per cent in 1991. Mr Steve Flather, Reward managing director, said that pay rises were responding to the drop in inflation. 'But these results also suggest that those organisations which are surviving the tough times of the recession are giving above-inflation increases to ensure that they retain their key staff,' he said. Few managers have swapped their company cars for cash, Reward found. Indeed, with the exception of senior managers, the percentage of managers with cars has risen slightly. Among senior managers, 81.6 per cent now receive cars, compared with 82.3 per cent in March 1992. The figure for middle managers has risen from 37.9 per cent in 1992 to 39.6 per cent. Among junior managers, 20.2 per cent have cars, compared with 19.8 per cent last year. Last year's graduate recruits earn a little more than the current batch of entrants to the jobs market, according to Reward. The average graduate starting salary is Pounds 12,750, with a range of Pounds 11,720 to Pounds 14,000. Last year's graduates have an average salary of Pounds 12,800, with a range of Pounds 11,750 to Pounds 14,000. The Hay study found that average pay increases in the latest quarter were highest for top management at 5.6 per cent (5.9 per cent for the year) and lowest for middle management at 3.6 per cent (5.7 per cent for the year). Clerical staff averaged 4.2 per cent for the quarter but recorded the lowest annual average increase at 5.4 per cent. The Hay study expects average salary increases to remain at about 4 per cent over the next 12 months, although top management is expected to receive average increases of 4.7 per cent.

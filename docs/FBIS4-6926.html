			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. Boeing Company has become a hopeful  candidate for partnership in the joint development project for  the next-generation small civilian airplane (YSX) being  undertaken by the Japanese Government and the private sector.  This was disclosed by an informed source on 21 April. In the  beginning, Boeing showed little interest in the YSX project  because it manufactures large and medium airplanes such as jumbo  jets, not small aircraft. However, due to a worldwide slump in  the aviation industry, Boeing changed its attitude and decided  to participate in the project. Japan, which so far has promoted  negotiations mostly with European companies, also made changes  in its original plan, such as a slight increase in the number of  seats and the utilization of parts used in Boeing's existing  aircraft. Japan is also studying the possibility of taking  advantage of Boeing's global sales capability.    In the YSX project, Japan aims to engage in independent  development of small passenger airplanes (with 50 to 100 seats)  as the aircraft to replace the YS-11. If Japan engages in a  joint project with Boeing, the number of seats will be increased  to approximately 90 from the original 75, and the YSX will be  equipped with the same equipment and parts as those of the  Boeing 737 (with 108 seats) which is currently in service.  Identical cockpit designs will reduce the burden of training  pilots, making it easier for existing Boeing customers to  purchase the YSX.    Japan had also been promoting another development project  for  a medium aircraft with 150 seats (YXX) in cooperation with  Boeing. However, the project has been suspended since last June  after Boeing announced it would give priority to the remodeling  of existing aircraft. The two projects will be virtually  integrated into one by enlarging the size of the aircraft to be  developed under the YSX project.    With regard to the production of the improved Boeing 737,  which will replace the YXX project, those Boeing subcontractors  engaged in parts production strongly opposed the participation  of Japanese aircraft manufacturers.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH FEES CITED AS MURDOCK DROPS PLAN TO SELL LAKE  </P> <P> Billionaire David H. Murdock, developer of the posh new Lake Sherwood Country  Club, has abandoned plans to sell the lake to longtime area homeowners,  apparently ending a dispute that has divided the picturesque community for  months and which prompted a grand jury investigation last spring.  </P> <P> Murdock announced his decision at a meeting with lake-area property owners  Wednesday evening. It was endorsed Friday by an association representing owners  of 121 houses and 47 vacant lots around the lake but outside the boundaries of  the Murdock development.  </P> <P> "Mr. Murdock has brought back a solution that is acceptable to all of us," said  Carl Price, a Lake Sherwood Community Assn. official. "It does end the  controversy."  </P> <P> Murdock had wanted existing homeowners to buy Lake Sherwood from him for $2.6  million or to join a new community-service district into which they would pay  lake maintenance fees. He dropped the plan because the fees were higher than he  anticipated and unreasonable, said a spokeswoman for the developer.  </P> <P> County estimates released last week show that service-district fees would have  been $1,500 to $2,200 a year for current homeowners, Murdock spokeswoman Elaine  Freeman said.  </P> <P> The fees were higher than expected, Freeman said, because only 140 of 600 lots  at the new country club -- far fewer than anticipated by Murdock -- have been  recorded for sale and subject to the fee. That means that there are fewer lots  among which service fees can be divided.  </P> <P> So for now, Murdock will keep the lake and pay to maintain it, Freeman said.  Owners of the 600 luxury homes planned at the 1,900-acre country club will take  over that responsibility once sales begin to close, she said. Twelve of the 20  houses under construction are in escrow, having sold for about $1 million each,  she said.  </P> <P> Murdock also has begun negotiations with the Conejo Recreation and Parks  District about the possibility of giving the lake away and making it public,  Freeman said.  </P> <P> In either case, existing residents would not have to share in the purchase of  the lake or pay new fees for its maintenance, she said. They currently pay  lake-use fees of about $550 a year.  </P> <P> This week's decision by Murdock is the latest twist in his up-and-down  relationship with lake residents. It follows by just a month a push by the  developer to create a special district to buy the lake from him with a $4,000  levy against each property owner.  </P> <P> The county Public Works Agency endorsed Murdock's proposal in September as a  way to force longtime homeowners to assume their fair share of lake-maintenance  costs.  </P> <P> Indeed, the developer agreed to reimburse the $4,000 lake assessments if  existing home and lot owners agreed to join his new community-service district  for the country club.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors delayed action on the proposal after angry  homeowners protested, claiming that Murdock was reneging on promises he made in  1987 to give Lake Sherwood to the public.  </P> <P> The supervisors were cool to the developer's lake-purchase proposal, since the  county was embroiled last spring in its own dispute with Murdock over whether  he had agreed to give the lake to the community as a condition of the  supervisors' 1987 approval of his development.  </P> <P> County lawyers concluded that while Murdock pledged to "dedicate" the lake to  the community, dedication was too vague a term to lock the developer legally  into giving it away.  </P> <P> Murdock's proposal to sell the lake led to a county grand jury investigation  last spring into whether the developer was breaking promises made to the Lake  Sherwood community.  </P> <P> The grand jury, in a June report, faulted county officials for an alleged lack  of communication with the developer over whether he could sell the lake.  </P> <P> The grand jury said that Murdock first mentioned selling the lake in early  1988. But it was not until May, 1990, that county officials sought to clarify  his legal position.  </P> <P> The grand jury also strongly questioned why county officials would support  Murdock's proposal for a special tax district to assess existing residents for  Lake Sherwood. Such a district would benefit only Murdock and could be used to  pressure homeowners outside his development into joining a community-service  district controlled by buyers of his new homes, the grand jury said.  </P></p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Technology: Helping to ease the daily grind - Toyota is using automation to aid its workers, rather than replace them Ever since Henry Ford devised a system to mass produce cars, manufacturers worldwide have struggled with the problem of how to make the grind of the factory-line both efficient and worker-friendly. Toyota, the world's second largest car maker, believes it has found something close to the ideal in a system it has devised which aims to combine the optimum level of human labour and automation. First crystallised at Toyota's factory in Kyushu, which began operating last year, the company's latest thinking on the production process also formed the basis for a recent revamping of the Motomachi factory where it manufactures its popular recreational vehicle, RAV4. The philosophy behind the production process adopted at Kyushu and Motomachi stems from the conviction that human labour is best suited to fulfilling the demanding task of assembly, the last stage of the manufacturing process where the manufacturer has its closest contact point with the customer. 'In manufacturing, there needs to be a kind of communication between the maker of the product and those who use it,' explains Mikio Kitano, a Toyota director in charge of production engineering. This communication is important for car makers to ascertain whether their cars are made to meet the needs of their customers, Kitano believes. Hence the importance of having workers, who can represent customers, in control of the assembly process. Only human employees can really tell if a door fits perfectly or if the steering wheel feels right, Kitano says. At Motomachi, although assembly is the most labour-intensive part of the production process, there are no large, sophisticated robots visible in the assembly area. Instead, workers appear to be doing most of the work with the help of simple machines. 'It is sad to leave everything up to automation and not be fully involved in the work,' notes Kitano. 'People have to be the centre of the work.' At Motomachi, the assembly line where the car's wiring is installed employs about 20 people, each with assigned tasks, involving very little automation. This apparently greater reliance on human labour, however, does not mean that machines are shunned altogether. Automation is used as liberally at Motomachi as at Toyota's most highly automated factory in Tahara, in central Japan. The 30 processes that are automated at Tahara are also mostly automated at Motomachi, Kitano points out. 'Overall, the level of automation is about the same, but the kind of automation that is used is different.' Instead of the vast, supposedly intelligent robots found in highly automated factories, the machines used at Motomachi are designed to perform specific and relatively limited functions to help the workers. 'My belief is that where people find it uncomfortable to do the work, it should be left up to machines,' Kitano says. 'The main purpose of automation is to relieve the burden on the workers.' In a further attempt to make assembly work more satisfying, Toyota has divided the work into groups, with a team in charge of each group of tasks. At Motomachi, assembly does not take place on a long assembly line from start to finish, with each worker doing several, unrelated tasks. Instead, the process has been divided into five lines according to different functions or sections of the car. The intention is to give workers a stronger feeling that they have made an important contribution to the manufacturing of the car. A conveyor belt now carries the workers along the line with the car they are working on, instead of trotting to keep up with the car as it moves down the line. This latest approach to the manufacturing process that Toyota has adopted is in striking contrast to the dominant thinking of a few years ago that propelled many car makers into sophisticated and costly automation. Toyota was not an exception to the trend. In 1991, it, too, built a highly automated factory in Tahara at great cost and installed robots and sophisticated machines. However, it soon discovered that placing too much importance on machines was a mistake. Not only did the need for specialists to run and maintain the high-tech machines mean that automation did not achieve its main goal of cutting labour costs, but those workers who had always worked at the factory felt intimidated by sophisticated machines they could not operate. Automation also led to many mechanical problems as Toyota discovered that 'machines break down easily', Kitano says. By restricting machines to those that make work easier for the workers, Toyota was also able to revamp Motomachi at considerably less cost than at Tahara. Automation at Motomachi cost the company a third of what it cost at Tahara, Kitano notes. Another simple idea has enabled Toyota to realise the same effect as a highly automated line at a fraction of the cost. At Tahara, the lines raise and lower the cars at different stages of the manufacturing process, so that the workers no longer have to bend or stretch. Introducing that system wholesale into Motomachi would have been expensive. But rather than give up the idea, Toyota raised the floors with planks to elevate workers at certain points and trenches were built to lower them at others. 'Personnel costs are not that different at the three plants, so the difference in the costs of the machines is the difference in the overall costs,' Kitano explains. So far, Motomachi has been a great success, Kitano believes. A doubling of production from an initial 2,000 a month to more than 4,000, due to the popularity of the RAV4, has been achieved smoothly. The number of workers overall has increased as a result of the production increase, but the number of workers per car has not. 'Although such an increase usually results in workers demanding more automation, my workers are not complaining,' Kitano says cheerfully.</p>

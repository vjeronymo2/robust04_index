According to the Prosecutor General's Office, the plan  included the hiring of two noncommissioned officers to accuse  Navy Colonel Rodrigo Quinonez and other officers of the murder  of more than 100 leftist leaders and labor union leaders from  the Barrancabermeja area.    The Colombian Navy's intelligence network was established in  August 1991 to fight gunrunning and drug trafficking activities  on the Colombian Pacific coast. Drug traffickers later  determined that Captain Juan Carlos Alvarez was responsible for  establishing the network. Alvarez was then transferred to  Barrancabermeja, where he organized the Navy's intelligence  network along the Magdalena River. His mission was to uncover  possible guerrilla attack plans.    In January 1993 Capt. Alvarez was transferred to Cartagena,  where he was murdered on 6 August of that same year. According  to the Prosecutor General's Office investigation, the captain  was murdered by drug traffickers from Valle del Cauca. Jorge  Hernan Gil has been identified as one of the hired assassins who  murdered Alvarez. The Prosecutor General's Office also  determined that a great deal of information had reached the drug  traffickers in Valle del Cauca Department by way of Saulo  Segura, an NCO who had worked on the Pacific network and who,  along with Juan Carlos Lopez Maquilon, accused Col. Rodrigo  Quinonez and other Navy officers of murdering more than 100  leftist leaders and labor union leaders in Barrancabermeja.    The connection of both NCO's with the Cali Cartel is  mentioned in statements made by several witnesses to the  Prosecutor General's Office. Once the officers' connections  were discovered, the drug traffickers hired four lawyers and  sent the two NCO's to testify against the Navy intelligence  chief and against several Pacific network officers. According  to documents in the hands of the Prosecutor General's Office,  the cartel intended to undermine the work done by the Navy  intelligence network and prevent the arrival of the gringos in  Juanchaco.    The Prosecutor General's Office uncovered this plan after  three months of investigation, but the Cali Cartel was able to  achieve one of its objective: to dismantle the Navy's  intelligence network on the Pacific coast.    This week the Prosecutor General's Office issued arrest  warrants against the two NCO's, but they have disappeared. One  of them was taken out of the country.</p>

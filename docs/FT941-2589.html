			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Dodge that VAT - But move fast to pre-pay your fuel bills If you do not want to pay value added tax on fuel for the next year or two, you need to move quickly. By now, most people know that if they have spare cash, they can use it to pay in advance for gas, electricity, oil or coal supplies, so avoiding VAT of 8 per cent from next month and 17.5 per cent from April 1995. This is because VAT is charged at the rate which applies on the date of invoicing or the date of payment, whichever is the earlier. If you pay before April 1, the rate is zero, so no VAT need be paid. But the utility and fuel companies need time to process cheques, so do not leave it until the afternoon of Thursday, March 31. To be safe, your payment should reach the relevant company within the next week. Some electricity companies have been sending out blank bills to make it easy for customers to pre-pay as much as they like. If yours is not one of them, all you need to do is send a cheque with a covering note giving your name, address and electricity or gas account number. You should make clear that the money is to be treated as a pre-payment for future supplies. If there is a chance you could move house before the pre-payment has run out, check that the power company would be willing to refund the balance. A few eager customers are reported to have paid for more than 10 years' worth of fuel in advance. But have they thought through the implications? The two questions you should ask are: How much money will I save by paying in advance? How much will I lose by not keeping the money in, say, a building society and earning interest on it? The further in advance you pay, the longer the money could have been earning interest and the smaller the savings become. But current interest rates are low. Many building society accounts pay only 3 or 4 per cent. The better ones pay perhaps 6 or 7 per cent on larger amounts. Since this is taxable for most people, the actual interest received is 25 or 40 per cent less. In simple terms, this means that a saving of 8 per cent VAT on a year's worth of fuel is bound to be worth more in cash terms than the interest from keeping the same amount on deposit at present interest rates. When VAT at 17.5 per cent arrives from April 1995, the potential savings will be much greater but, to avoid the tax altogether, pre-payment would have to be made before April 1 1994. Thus, more than a year's interest would be lost. This makes it more complicated to work out the advantages of paying in advance. Accountant Stoy Hayward has taken the example of a family with fuel bills of Pounds 1,300 a year, and calculated what rate of interest it would need to be earning on its savings, tax-free, to outweigh the advantages of paying in advance for the next eight quarters. The firm has taken into account the likely seasonal fluctuations in fuel bills - higher accounts can be expected in February and May than August and November. The results show that the family would need to be earning 19.2 per cent tax-free on its savings for it not to be worth paying the second quarterly bill in advance. But by the eighth quarter, in February 1996, this has dropped to 8.8 per cent and the figure would continue to decline after that. This is only an example, of course, and the equivalent figures in your case will vary, depending on such factors as your fuel consumption and timing of bills. But the general conclusion is that, although 1996 interest rates are an unknown factor, it is unlikely to be worth paying bills much more than two years in advance. If you cannot afford to pay more than one year's bills in advance this month, you will have a second chance to make savings in March 1995, before the higher VAT rate comes into force. The difference between 8 and 17.5 per cent means that it should still be worth making advance payments at the lower rate - unless interest levels have shot up by then. Meanwhile, there is good news for council tenants whose homes are in a district heating scheme where fuel is included as part of the rent and there are no separate meters. The government has decided it cannot apply VAT to such schemes as councils are VAT-exempt and it is not possible to work out the liabilities of individual tenants. So, members of such schemes will be able to avoid the tax without even trying.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          TYPICAL SAVING ON AN ANNUAL POUNDS 1,300 FUEL BILL  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Assumed due date     Fuel bill     VAT    Investment at    Gain from of fuel bill        (estimate)    saved   5.4% compound    prepayment  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- May 15 1994            455        12.13       (4.10)          8.03 August 15 1994         130        10.40       (2.92)          7.48 November 15 1994       260        20.80       (9.36)         11.44 February 15 1995       455        36.40      (22.52)         13.88 May 15 1995            455        50.80      (28.89)         21.91 August 15 1995         130        22.75      (10.10)         12.65 November 15 1995       260        45.50      (23.90)         21.60 February 15 1996       455        79.62      (48.30)         31.32 Total                2,600       278.40     (150.09)        128.31  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Stoy Hayward.

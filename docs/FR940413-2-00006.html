On October 18, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (58 FR 53709). On October 27, 1993, the petitioner, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), requested that we conduct an administrative review for the period October 1, 1992, through September 30, 1993. We published a notice of initiation of the antidumping administrative review on November 17, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has now conducted the administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Imports covered by the review are shipments of PSPT measuring over 13/8 inches in width and not exceeding 4 mils in thickness, classifiable under item numbers 3919.90.20 and 3919.90.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS). HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and for Customs purposes. The written descriptions remain dispositive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Results of Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the single manufacturer/exporter subject to review, NAR, had no shipments of this merchandise to the United States during the period of review, the Department has preliminarily assigned NAR the rate applicable to it from its most recent administrative review as the estimated cash deposit rate. This rate is 1.24 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed firm will be that firm's rate established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, or the original less-than-fair-value investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters not previously reviewed will be 12.66 percent, the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first notice of final results of administrative review published by the Department (48 FR 35686, August 5, 1983). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties may request disclosure within five days of the date of publication of this notice, and may request a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held as early as convenient for the parties but not later than 44 days after the date of publication or the first workday thereafter. Case briefs or other written comments from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttal comments, limited to issues raised in the case briefs, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication. The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including its results of its analysis of issues raised in any such written comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Susan G.

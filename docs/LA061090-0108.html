			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE 12 MOST BEAUTIFUL  </P> <P> I am writing a book based upon the reminiscences and memories of fashion models  who posed from 1937 until 1950.  </P> <P> I would like to hear from Meg Mundy and others from the "Twelve Most Beautiful  Women," shot in 1947 by Irving Penn.  </P> <P> I would like to hear from any models who, like my mother, Elizabeth  Gibbons-Hanson, posed for such artists and photographers as Man Ray, George  Platt Lynnes, Jean Cocteau, Louise Dahl-Wolfe and John Engsteadt.  </P> <P> I would also like to hear from anyone who knew George White, head of the  narcotics agency until his retirement in the '60s.  </P> <P> PAUL JOSEPH HANSON  </P> <P> P.O.

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / More at school after 16 LAST YEAR saw a big rise in the number of 16-year-olds staying on at school in England and Wales, according to a report by the Careers Service published yesterday. The report shows that of the half million pupils who reached school leaving age last summer, 61 per cent - the highest proportion ever - remained in full-time education. In 1990 it was 53 per cent, and in 1989 48 per cent. If Youth Training is included, 76 per cent of those eligible to leave school remained in full-time education or training last year compared with 70 per cent in 1989. For the first time in recent decades, that puts England and Wales within reach of France and Germany where the full-time staying-on rate is between 80 per cent and 90 per cent - although many people doubt the comparability of Youth Training, which accounted for 15 per cent of last year's school leavers, with Continental training schemes. The recession is clearly a factor in the increase. The Careers Service report, published by the Association of County Councils, shows a far higher staying-on rate among girls (68 per cent) than among boys (55 per cent). Among girls leaving school to go into jobs, traditional feminine career patterns persist unchecked. Most girls went into clerical, retail, hairdressing and the 'caring' professions. The five most popular occupations for boys were construction, retail, mechanical and production engineering, processing and the armed forces and police. The survey shows large regional variations. With 68 per cent of 16-year-olds remaining in full-time education, the south-east tops the league. Behind it come outer London, (67 per cent), the south-west (66 per cent) and inner London (63 per cent). The north scores lowest, with only 51 per cent staying on. School Leavers' Destinations.

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Equitable shares fall despite rise in net earnings The share price of The Equitable, the US insurer which is 49 per cent owned by French group Axa, fell yesterday in spite of strong growth in second-quarter profits and continued progress in its life insurance activities. The results also showed a solid performance from the group's investment business, which held up well amid deteriorating market conditions. Investors, however, sold Equitable shares because earnings were below analysts' estimates and because of general concern about what are perceived to be interest rate-sensitive stocks. In New York, the shares fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 20. Equitable earned net income of Dollars 68.5m, or 31 cents a share, up from Dollars 47.5m, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. For the first six months of 1994, the group earned Dollars 150.6m after taxes, compared with Dollars 79.3m in the same period of 1993. Post-tax operating earnings in the life insurance operations jumped 114 per cent to Dollars 62.6m in the quarter, due to a reduction in the losses from disability insurance, higher new sales and improved investment spreads. Investment gains of Dollars 4.7m, however, were partly offset by Dollars 2m of restructuring charges. The investment operations posted after-tax operating income of Dollars 30.4m, down from a record Dollars 55.9m a year earlier as higher earnings from the investment fund and property businesses were offset by a sharp drop in profits at the Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette securities unit.</p>

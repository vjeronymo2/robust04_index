The Second Session of the National Committee of the  Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  [CPPCC] ended in victory on 19 March.    The "two meetings," which were convened in the early spring  of this year, have distinctly reflected the basic policy of the  entire party and of the national work for this year, the overall  situation of the entire party and the national work, and the  will and wishes of the people of all nationalities in the  country. There were meetings on democracy, reality-seeking,  unity, and encouraging all to forge ahead. The meetings will  surely produce a major impact on propelling reform and opening  up, on economic construction and on comprehensive social  progress, and on promoting the great cause of the peaceful  reunification of the motherland. NPC deputies and CPPCC members  highly evaluated Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report."  They said this "Report" takes China's overall situation into  consideration, seeks truth from facts, urges all to forge ahead,  and will encourage the people of all nationalities to seize the  opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development,  maintain stability, and comprehensively fulfill this year's  various tasks.    The outstanding achievements of this year's "two meetings"  lie in the NPC deputies' and CPPCC members' further unifying  understanding of the overall situation of the entire party and  of national work through their examination and discussion of the  "Government Work Report" and through other reports, and in their  unanimous support for the belief that all work must be  subordinate to and serve the overall situation's strategic  requirements. Following the closing of the "two meetings," some  3,000 NPC deputies and 2,000 CPPCC members will return to their  own regions and respective posts to spread and implement the  guidelines set forth at the meetings, which will surely help the  entire nation become united and work with one heart and one mind  to fulfill new tasks.    Correct understanding and handling of the relationship among  reform, development, and stability is the key to victoriously  realizing the tasks set forth at the meetings. Development is  the goal; reform is the impetus: and stability is the guarantee;  the three complement one another; the three are inseparable;  neglect of and inattention to any of them will result in harmful  effects. Only by paying equal attention to them and by  skillfully handling the dialectical relationship among them will  we be on the road to success and victory. This has been an  in-depth summing up of the historical experience since our  country adopted the policy of reform and opening up. This year  marks a crucial year for a planned economic system in transition  toward a socialist market economic system, and a year for  tackling difficult reform measures. A number of major reform  measures have been introduced since the beginning of this year  and they are being implemented in a steady manner. The depth,  breadth, and force of the reform are unprecedented. Seen from  the general trend of this year's reform, development, and  stability, reform occupies a pivotal status. Fresh changes, new  trends, and new characteristics arising from the relationship of  reform, development, and stability will bring forth a series of  new problems; thus arises the need for us to pay extra attention  to handling well the relationship among reform, development, and  stability; to promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy in the course of steadfastly  promoting reform; and to reinforce the foundation of political  and social stability. At the same time, promoting development to  support reform and promoting stability to ensure reform are of  utmost importance in consolidating and developing an excellent  situation.    Adhering to the policy of "carrying out the policy of  promoting the reform and opening drive with one hand, cracking  down on severe crimes with the other, and putting an equal  emphasis on both," and enhancing socialist spiritual  civilization building and democratic legal system building are  the important aspects of triumphantly realizing the tasks set  forth at the meetings. During the "two meetings," Comrade Jiang  Zemin said the more we promote reform and construction, the more  we need to stress ideals, discipline, unity, and the overall  situation and to further develop this kind of spirit within the  party and among the people in the nation. The "four stresses"  are very important and are needed for promoting reform and  construction. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics  and building our country into a socialist nation which is rich,  strong, democratic, modern, and civilized are the common ideals  of the people of all nationalities at the present stage. We  must uphold this ideal and help forge an even closer unity among  the people of all nationalities to realize that grand goal. We  should advocate taking the overall situation into consideration.  Our remarks and actions should be conducive to the overall  situation. Leading cadres in particular should correctly handle  the relationship between the central and local governments and  between overall and partial interests. We should strictly abide  by discipline, implement the principles and policies worked out  by the CPC Central Committee to the letter, and help maintain  the centralism and unity of the CPC Central Committee. In  carrying out a great cause of unprecedented socialist  modernization drive in such a large country as ours, only by  persisting in stressing ideals, discipline, unity, and the  overall situation will we be able to provide a powerful  ideological, political, and organizational guarantee for the  smooth development of various undertakings.    A rapidly developing situation and great and arduous tasks  require leading cadres at various levels of party and government  departments to further raise their understanding, change their  work styles, and work in a down-to-earth manner. It is  necessary to understand both domestic and foreign situations in  a comprehensive and correct manner. We need to understand not  only that we indeed face great and excellent opportunities for  reform and development, but also that difficulties and potential  risks may lie ahead; we should neither be overly optimistic  because of a good situation, nor should we waver in our  confidence because of existing problems and difficulties. All  in all, we should remain sober-minded; guard against arrogance;  be patient; be prepared for danger in times of peace; work hard;  and perform well in our work. We must firmly keep in mind that  wholeheartedly serving the people is our fundamental purpose.  It is necessary to forge close ties with the masses, listen to  the calls of the masses, and help them solve their difficulties.  We need to increase our efforts to build a clean  administration; combat corruption; advocate the honest  performance of official duties; wage a resolute struggle against  corrupt elements and corrupt phenomena. As new situations and  new problems constantly appear in the course of deepening  reform, leading cadres should try to overcome bureaucratism and  formalism; go deep into reality to conduct investigations and  study; call on advanced experience and advanced models; pay  attention to hidden and emerging problems; adopt appropriate and  forceful measures to solve problems in a timely manner; and  gather all positive factors to help realize the goals of reform,  opening up, and modernization construction.    The people's congress system is our country's fundamental  political system. The multiparty cooperation and political  consultative system under the leadership of the Communist Party  is our country's basic political system. Doing an even better  job in NPC and CPPCC work and giving full play to the roles of  the NPC and the CPPCC in the state's political life are  extremely important to maintaining the country's unity and  long-lasting peace and stability and to fulfilling the  historical mission of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Building a socialist democratic legal system  has been progressing steadily and in earnest since the convening  of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.  The CPC Central Committee works out principles and policies and  the State Council formulates implementation plans for major  issues which surface in the course of socialist modernization;  those plans are sent to the NPC and the CPPCC for examination,  discussion, revision, and improvements; following the adoption  of the plans, people in the nation are mobilized to implement  them. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, a  pattern of the NPC, the Government, and the CPPCC working in  close coordination and with efficiency has taken shape. Such a  pattern is conducive to unifying the will of the entire party  and the people in the nation and to concentrating efforts to  handle major affairs; this is the characteristic and advantage  of our country's political system.    The "two meetings" which were held during spring two years  ago implemented the essence of the remarks made by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping during his southern China tour and the guidelines laid  down at the Plenary Session of the Political Bureau of the CPC  Central Committee and made a positive contribution to the entry  of a new stage in our country's reform and opening up. The "two  meetings" held in last spring implemented the guidelines set  forth at the 14th CPC National Congress and made a positive  contribution to the deepening of reform and the acceleration of  development. This spring's "two meetings" comprehensively  implemented the guidelines set forth at the 14th CPC National  Congress and at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee and made the "20-character principle" [seize  the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote  development, and maintain stability] a guide for reform and  construction; this year's "two meetings" will repaint the  ten-thousand-li of the spring landscape of the motherland!    This year marks the 45th founding anniversary of the  People's  Republic of China. People of all nationalities in the nation  will rally even closer around the CPC Central Committee with  Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core; they will unwaveringly make  great strides along the direction shown by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and by the party's basic line; and they will  greet this great festival with even more brilliant achievements  in reform, opening up, and modernization construction!</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: BELL / CUDAHY;  </P> <P> BOARD ACTION EXPECTED ON WALNUT STREET SCHOOL SITE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education is expected to  consider a controversial proposal to tear down 263 homes, apartments and  businesses in Bell and Cudahy to build an elementary school.  </P> <P> The school construction plan, proposed jointly by the district and officials of  both cities, has been criticized by residents who would be displaced by the new  school, tentatively called Walnut Street Elementary School.  </P> <P> The board will decide on Monday whether to order an environmental impact  report, real estate appraisals and relocation costs for the 13-acre site that  is bounded by Florence Avenue on the north, Wilcox Avenue on the west, Live Oak  Street on the south and Crafton Avenue on the east.  </P> <P> The elementary school would be located both in Cudahy and Bell and would be  named for Walnut Street, the cul-de-sac that would cease to exist.  </P> <P> Bonnie R. James, school district building services division administrator,  stressed this week that the Walnut Street site is one of three under  consideration. The other two sites are located in Cudahy and are about half the  size of the Walnut Street site.  </P></p>

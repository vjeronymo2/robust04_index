The situation is calm if  somewhat tense along the line of confrontation, which is marked  by the Inguri River. The Abkhaz side has given permission for  power engineers to cross the so-called border to carry out  repair work at Inguri hydroelectric power station in Gali rayon.  Units of the Georgian armed forces stationed in the region are  guarding the area along the river Inguri.    The situation in Gali rayon in the border area remains  critical as Abkhaz separatists and mercenaries from the northern  Caucasus continue to rob civilians, burn houses, and kill people.    Under an accord between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides,  between 25 and 30 people a day are granted passes and cross the  road bridge over the Inguri from Zugdidi rayon into Gali rayon.  However, according to reliable information, mines laid by  Abkhaz separatists have killed over 60 people attempting to  cross illegally.</p>

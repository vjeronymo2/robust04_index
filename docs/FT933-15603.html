			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Letter: Propaganda for the IRA Sir, Your editorial 'Ring of Anxiety' (July 6) concerning the City of London's anti-terrorist traffic restrictions was pathetically addled. Was it written by committee? Disruption was negligible, you said, yet you conclude that this is a propaganda coup for the IRA. Vital though it is to defeat terrorism, you said, you are critical because the rest of the capital is not thus protected. The ultimate absurdity of your thinking is that 'once made permanent, it would be difficult to dismantle'. Yes, quite. The propaganda coup for the IRA is the bombing and the killing and the disruption and the NatWest tower hanging in shreds. Measures against these acts, providing they do not impinge on traditional civil liberties, are not a propaganda coup for the IRA. Driving to work in the City is not a civil liberty. The sooner the City of London plants trees and flowers in the barriers to make them permanent and pedestrianises the area, the better. Now that would be a propaganda coup. Ronald Willson, 50 rue de Moillebeau, 1207 Geneva, Switzerland</p>

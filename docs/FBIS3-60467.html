The disease has been  observed in the absolute majority of rayons on the largest  island in Russia. Fifty-eight people have been admitted to the  hospital to date. The first fatalities were in the port of  Kholmsk, where two people have died.    In the opinion of doctors, the source of the infection was  from newly arrived conscripts or convicts in prison camps on the  island.    The situation is complicated by the absence of vaccine for  inoculations and medicine for those who are already ill. An  ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by the head of the oblast  public health department Aleksandr Moshenskiy that the last  reserves of vaccine for inoculations are to be used exclusively  on children.</p>

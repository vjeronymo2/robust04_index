			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> FRESH ERA OF WINNING BEGINS AT CRESPI, 21-13  </P> <P> Crespi High's post-Bill Redell, post-Russell White, post-high-powered offense  era posted its first victory Friday night, smothering Hart and talented  quarterback Rob Westervelt, 21-13, in a nonleague game at Pierce College.  </P> <P> The Celts posted no impressive offensive statistics -- such as the ones White  registered in three seasons as an All-American tailback before graduating and  heading to Cal this fall.  </P> <P> Quarterback Bill Canalez completed 12 of 20 passes for 106 yards and one  touchdown. Tailback Lucas Freeman, the game's leading rusher, gained 57 yards  in 14 carries, including a 25-yard touchdown run in the second quarter to give  Crespi a 14-7 halftime lead.  </P> <P> All told, Crespi totaled just 201 yards offense -- 93 on an option pass from  running back Jerry Thompson to wide receiver Zach Rayner early in the third  quarter that gave the Celts a 21-7 lead and broke Hart's back.  </P> <P> "By no means did we do anything impressive on the offensive side of the  football," said first-year Coach Tim Lins, who replaced Redell this season. "We  figured we had to win this one with defense."  </P> <P> And that the Celts emphatically did, smothering Westervelt into  ineffectiveness. The Celts intercepted four of the highly touted quarterback's  passes -- including the final three he attempted -- while sacking him four  times for 40 yards in losses.  </P> <P> Westervelt completed just seven of 23 passes for 93 yards -- 43 on a  third-quarter bomb to Lance Migita to pull Hart to within 21-13.  </P> <P> "They threw some things at us that we weren't prepared for," Hart Coach Mike  Herrington said.  </P> <P> Like blitzing linebackers -- lots of them. The blitzes caused havoc from Hart's  first series on, and the finishing touch came on a blitz by linebacker  Christian Fauria in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> While Hart was playing catch-up, Fauria flattened Westervelt with a full-speed,  blind-side sack.  </P> <P> "All out!" Fauria said of the play. "The coaches said, 'Go after 'em,' so . . .  It was perfect."  </P> <P> Said a somber Westervelt: "A hit's a hit."  </P> <P> For good measure, Fauria caught six passes for 66 yards, including an 11-yard  touchdown reception that gave Crespi (1-1) a 7-0 lead on the game's opening  drive.  </P> <P> "I don't understand why people don't think we're any good this season." Fauria  said. "I think we're the best team in the Valley."  </P> <P> Lins would not go as far but insisted that the post-Redell and post-White Celts  are for real.  </P> <P> "We don't like to focus on the past and what happened when Russell was here,"  he said. "That brought us publicity, but that's in the past. We like to focus  on what's happening now."  </P> <P> Crespi made things happen early when Rayner recovered an onside kickoff to  start the game.  </P> <P> The Celts moved 49 yards in eight plays to take a 7-0 lead.  </P> <P> Canalez completed passes of eight, six and 22 yards before hitting Fauria for  the touchdown.  </P> <P> On Crespi's next series, however, Canalez, who completed seven of 12 for 80  yards in the half, threw an interception on a deep out pattern. The ball was  returned from the 50-yard line to the one by John DePaco.  </P> <P> Two plays later, fullback Scott Renfro pulled Hart even with a one-yard dive.  </P></p>

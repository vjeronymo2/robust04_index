In a joint operation in Transvaal and Natal last night,  they arrested at least 46 members of the syndicate known as the  Boere Mafia. Fraud and theft amounting to more than 250 million  rands are involved. Over 300 members of the police took part in  the operation. Teams were sent as far as Groblersdal to arrest  members of the Boere Mafia at their homes. All their homes were  searched thoroughly for evidence. Seventeen stolen vehicles  were also taken possession of.    The suspects will appear in court in Pretoria and  Pietermaritzburg today on charges of complicity to murder police  officials, armed robbery, housebreaking, credit card and check  fraud, and theft. The police have been on the syndicate's trail  for at least two years.    In August last year 19 people were arrested. Some of those  released on bail at the time were again arrested last night.  The police say the court cases could take up to three years.</p>

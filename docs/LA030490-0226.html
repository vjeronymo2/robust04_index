			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOCTORS SPLIT OVER PROTEST ON SPRAYING;  </P> <P> MALATHION: A PROPOSED RESOLUTION OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSN. CALLING FOR A  HALT TO THE AIRBORNE ATTACK ON THE MEDITERRANEAN FRUIT FLY IS CRITICIZED BY  SOME DOCTORS.  </P> <P> A proposed California Medical Assn. resolution calling for the immediate halt  of malathion spraying was criticized by doctors Saturday, some of whom said the  measure would cause needless public alarm and "paranoia" over a pesticide they  insist has been proven safe.  </P> <P> The comments from nearly a dozen doctors attending the CMA's annual meeting in  Anaheim at the Disneyland Hotel marks the first public opposition by members of  the association to the resolution.  </P> <P> The measure will likely go before CMA delegates for a full vote on Tuesday, the  day after a 26-square-mile section of Orange and Los Angeles counties is to be  sprayed.  </P> <P> The resolution, which alleges that the state has not proven the safety of the  pesticide used in eradication of the Mediterranean fruit fly, was supported by  two doctors at the CMA reference committee hearing.  </P> <P> However, one by one, doctors from Orange County and around the state spoke out  against the resolution, saying the chemical mixture used in the sprayings does  not pose a health risk.  </P> <P> "The malathion is extremely weak," said Kenneth Hayes, an association member  from San Jose. "The CMA should not (get involved) in this mass hysteria."  </P> <P> Several doctors noted that a series of studies found no long-term or short-term  health hazards associated with normal exposure to the malathion mixture, which  amounts to about 2.8 ounces of the pesticide per acre. While the chemical can  be toxic to some insects and fish, state officials say it is not harmful to  humans.  </P> <P> "This issue has been discussed and decided," said CMA member Roger Kennedy.  </P> <P> If the CMA wants to get involved in the issue, one doctor suggested, it should  try to ease the public's fears about malathion by going on record as saying  that the spraying does not pose a health risk.  </P> <P> A similar approach was taken in 1981 in Santa Clara County when a local medical  association cooperated with state officials in attempting to allay residents'  fears about Medfly spraying.  </P> <P> The CMA does not have a formal position on malathion. When Santa Clara County  faced spraying, the association decided the issue was a "matter best addressed"  by local doctors, according to a CMA staff report.  </P> <P> "If the CMA takes action on this . . . it says the doctors of California  believe (malathion) is unsafe," said Alvin Markovitz, a member of the committee  that heard the testimony. " . . . It sends the message that malathion is  dangerous and a poison."  </P> <P> Supporters of the resolution have said the spraying should be stopped until  malathion's effects can be assessed.  </P> <P> "It's not our burden to show that it's not safe," said H. Rex Greene, the  Pasadena doctor who introduced the resolution. "The state must prove that it's  safe."  </P> <P> Greene was joined by Jerome Marmorstein, chairman of the CMA's Committee on  Environmental and Occupational Health.  </P> <P> "I'm not comfortable with it," Marmorstein said. "It's a flagrant violation of  human rights to be (sprayed) when (people) don't want it."  </P> <P> Some doctors agreed that even if the spraying is a social issue, the medical  association should not try to halt the practice if a health risk cannot be  proven.  </P> <P> The committee that heard testimony Saturday will likely recommend acceptance or  rejection of the resolution when it is voted on by the 440-member House of  Delegates. The committee can also make changes in the statement, which calls on  the association's 38,000 members to write letters to state officials and  lawmakers calling for a halt to spraying.  </P> <P> On Friday, a top committee of CMA leaders agreed to let the resolution be  discussed at the annual meeting. Officials believe the resolution is the first  of its kind in the country to deal with malathion spraying.  </P> <P> The controversy comes on the eve of another round of spraying in portions of  Brea, La Habra and Fullerton.  </P> <P> Helicopters are scheduled to fly over the area for the sixth time starting at 9  p.m. Monday, according to Frank Parsons of the Orange County agricultural  commissioner's office.  </P> <P> The area will be sprayed as many as 12 times by the end of summer. A 36-mile  area around Garden Grove and Westminster is scheduled to be sprayed for the  third time on Thursday .  </P> <P> Malathion foes plan a protest at the corner of Harbor and Garden Grove  boulevards Thursday at 6 p.m. Bob Taylor, spokesman for Orange County Residents  Against Malathion Spraying, said the group hopes to attract merchants and  tourism officials who believe the sprayings are hurting business.  </P> <P> MONDAY'S MEDFLY SPRAYINGS  </P> <P> A 26-square-mile region of North Orange County and Los Angeles County will be  sprayed with a pesticide mixture Monday night beginning at 9 as part of the  state's ongoing battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly. The region includes  a 10-square-mile area that was sprayed initially on Nov.30 and four times since  then. The entire region will be sprayed between eight and 12 times, depending  on weather conditions.  </P> <P> The only other spray region in Orange County, covering 36 square miles around  Garden Grove and Westminster, is scheduled for its third application on  Thursday. Residents with questions can call the county's Medfly Hotline at  (714) 447-7118.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT, HE JUST KEEPS ON KICKING;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: USC'S QUIN RODRIGUEZ PRIDES HIMSELF ON CONSISTENCY.  </P> <P> Quin Rodriguez had no intention of playing football in high school. A little on  the smallish side, he preferred soccer, which he had played for several years,  and baseball.  </P> <P> But his best friend, Eric Valliere, didn't want to walk home alone after  practice, so he persuaded Rodriguez to try out. Still, "I didn't care for  football too much," Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> Eight years later, Valliere works in the circulation department at the Arizona  Republic, and Rodriguez is playing the game he almost shunned -- and hoping, in  fact, to play it on a professional level.  </P> <P> USC's senior kicker, Rodriguez has been a regular for the Trojans almost from  the day he arrived on campus 3 1/2 years ago, a skinny freshman from Mesa,  Ariz.  </P> <P> He owns the school record for conversion kicks with 129 and needs two field  goals in USC's last five games, including a probable bowl appearance, to break  Steve Jordan's school record of 51. Known for his consistency, if not an  overpowering leg, Rodriguez is one of the most accurate kickers the Trojans  have produced.  </P> <P> This year Rodriguez has been successful on 12 of 15 attempts, including a  48-yard kick against Arizona, the longest of his career.  </P> <P> His 80% success rate leads the Pacific 10 Conference, but it's nothing  extraordinary for Rodriguez. His career success rate of 74.6% includes one miss  in 29 attempts from 30 yards or less.  </P> <P> "I'm proud of my consistency," Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> It rankles him, though, that when it is suggested some of the nation's best  kickers play in the Pac-10, the first names mentioned are Jason Hanson of  Washington State and Robbie Keen of California, both of whom have earned  All-American recognition.  </P> <P> Rodriguez has never even made the all-conference team.  </P> <P> "I get down sometimes," Rodriguez said of his lack of recognition. "There are a  lot of good kickers, like Jason Hanson, who hit 50-yard field goals and 60-yard  field goals, but I think it's overlooked that he misses the 30-yard field goals  and the 40-yard field goals, just like everybody else."  </P> <P> Rodriguez, who kicked a 55-yard field goal in high school, has tried only one  50-yard kick at USC -- two weeks ago against Arizona. With only 10 Trojans set  and an 11th running onto the field, Rodriguez pulled a hurried kick wide.  </P> <P> Rodriguez, though, said he is capable of making longer kicks. A summer  conditioning program prescribed by Robb Rogers, USC's strength and conditioning  coach, added about 10 yards to his range.  </P> <P> "I think I can hold up with anybody," Rodriguez said. "If I was up at  Washington State, I could hit 65- (and) 68-yard field goals. The air is a lot  different (there). When you come down to sea level and you're kicking against  smog and dirt and the sea breeze, it's a lot different."  </P> <P> He has tried 16 field goals of 40 yards or longer, making nine.  </P> <P> "Coach Smith is more of a field general," Rodriguez said. "He likes to play  field position. That's the USC way to play football. We want to control the  field, and if you try a 50-yard field goal, you give up a lot of field position  if you miss it."  </P> <P> Rodriguez, though, has no complaints."I'd rather be what I am than a booming  kicker who is (inconsistent)," he said. "I would rather be 12 of 15, with a 48  long, and have the consistency."  </P> <P> And why not? It has taken him from Dobson High School in Mesa, Ariz., where 10  of his 26 field goals were game-winners, to three appearances in the Rose Bowl  game.  </P> <P> An all-state choice at Dobson, he didn't want to play in Arizona. He attracted  USC's attention by sending press clippings to the Trojans' coaching staff. A  scholarship offer followed, and Rodriguez has been USC's kicker ever since.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, he has changed his mind about the game.  </P> <P> "I really enjoy football," Rodriguez said. "Just getting a chance to kick (in  the NFL) would be great."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Geir Salvesen report: "Conservative Party's </F> First Lady Says `Thank You and Good-bye'"]    [Text] Bergen -- "I am looking forward to continuing on  the Conservative Party team, but in a much less prominent  position," Kaci Kullmann Five said.    The Conservative Party national conference got off to a slow  start yesterday with a leader who made a personal statement  about why she has had enough: "After the election last fall I  was both tired and sorry for myself," she said. The limit had  been reached for reconciling political work and small children.  That is why she cound not go on.    This introduction did not exactly generate enthusiasm and on  several occasions the Conservative Party leader voiced  bitterness toward the press which she said had tried to create  personal conflicts in the run-up to the national conference by  raising the question of the prime ministerial candidate in the  party which "they write is not alive -- and hardly has any right  to life," as she put it.    Kullmann Five made it clear that it is the Conservative  Party's Storting group and central executive which will appoint  the party's next prime ministerial candidate -- when they think  the time is ripe. "It does not seem to be overripe at present,"  she said, adding that her role will not be that of a trophy on  the wall or a snake in the grass. She said that she fully  supports incoming leader Jan Petersen.    The applause from the national conference audience increased  when she began to talk about the future, and it was a leader in  the mood for a fight who tackled the question of the the shift  in the balance of power through an increase in the share of  state ownership and controls over industry, banking, and the  economy.    "The state's economic power is too great, and is growing all  the time. In addition job after job in this system is being  filled by people with the `right' party membership card," she  said.    "The struggle against the welfare state is not over when the  authorities want to keep a register of stuffed animals in  private homes, introduce a small boat register, or end the  arrangement by which a small extension to a house can be started  with less involvement of bureaucracy," Five said.    Otherwise the EU [European Union] question was the most  central element in the speeches to the national conference. No  one was particularly surprised that Kullmann Five recommended a  Conservative "yes" to the results of the negotiations. The  "yes" arguments were well known, but she had her claws out for  the Center Party and the Socialist Left Party.    "The only thing we now about their alternative is that there  must be at least as much fog as at Fornebu airport today," she  told a national conference for which some people had been  delayed because of fog. "Per Olaf Lundteigen and Paul Chaffey  have also revealed that they would really like to see the EU  dissolved. This means that it is not only an alternative but  also an alternative Europe involving change for the worse which  they want. My 'yes' to the EU is therefore a `no' to something  much worse -- to Lundteigen's alternative and Kristin  Halvorsen's Norway as an experiment in Europe -- outside the EU.  The alternative is that `might is right' and in that sort of  world `might' has never lain with the small countries."    The debate after Kullmann Five's opening speech revealed no  major disagreements either about the past or the Conservatives'  future course. There were no stubborn calls for  self-examination. The vast majority were concerned about the  future. As was Sonja Irene Sjoli from Akershus. But she  thought that the Conservative Party has a problems with its  image.    "The Conservative Party has gained the reputation that we  are  a flock of materialistic, egotistic money people who only think  about ourselves, about competitiveness and tax relief. A party  for the elite and successful, a mother of pearl league. We know  that this is not true, but as long as other people believe it we  also have a problem as a party," she said.    Even if major rally failed to materialize on this opening  day  and is unlikely to appear throughout the rest of this national  conference weekend, this does not mean that pessimism and gloom  rule. National conferences often serve to strengthen a party's  own morale. "There will be other times. We will return the  stronger," parliamentary leader Anders Talleraas said. And the  others think so too. But how? they ask.</p>

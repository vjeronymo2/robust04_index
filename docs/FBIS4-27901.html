			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Core" column by Social News Department reporter </F> Shigeru Handa: "Behind-the-Scene Story of Rimpac `94 --  Japan-U.S.- ROK Team Intended for Emergency on Korean  Peninsula?"]    [Text] On 31 May, nine destroyers of the Maritime  Self-Defense Force [MSDF] left the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka  for Hawaii to join "Rimpac '94," joint Pacific Ocean exercises  sponsored by the U.S. Navy. In addition to Japan and the United  States, the participating countries are Canada, Australia, and  the ROK. In connection with calls for sanctions against the  DPRK (North Korea) over the nuclear inspection issue, Japan, the  United States, and the ROK will be on the same team for the  first time in military exercises. Although the MSDF emphasizes  that "the training assumes no specific situation," the issue of  exercising the right to collective self-defense, banned under  the constitution, appears likely to surface once again.    The highlight of Rimpac '94 is to be an exercise in which  the  participants oppose one another in waters off Hawaii. The  scenario has not been made public. But "Team X," which consists  of two groups -- one organized around a U.S. carrier task force  led by the aircraft carrier Independence and the MSDF destroyer  unit, the other organized by a U.S. unit and ROK frigate vessels  -- will assemble in waters off Hawaii and take back Hawaii from  the enemy.    The opposing force, "Team U," consists of U.S., Canadian,  and  Australian ships. For two weeks in mid-June, the two teams will  conduct exercises comprehensively combining surface warfare,  antisubmarine warfare [ASW], and air defense operations.    In Rimpac '94, the ROK for the first time will join Team X,  consisting until now only of Japan and the United States. The  ROK, participating in its third Rimpac exercise, had been on the  opposing team the previous two times. While it has not been  made clear why the teams have been changed this time, it is  natural to regard it as reflecting the situation on the Korean  peninsula.    When the United Nations decides to impose sanctions against  North Korea over the nuclear inspections issue, ships from the  navies of several nations may jointly conduct naval blockade  actions. In that case, the commander of U.S. Forces Korea would  have command over ROK forces. Therefore, points out a source  related to the Defense Agency, "The aim of this exercise is  probably to strengthen U.S.-ROK ties through Rimpac."    On the other hand, the Maritime Staff Office [MSO] stresses  that Rimpac maneuvers are "not intended for any specific nation  or sea area." Concerning the first Japan-U.S.-ROK combination,  too, the MSO denies that the exercise is a "path" to the  exercise of the right of collective defense, saying: "There are  Japan-U.S. and U.S.-ROK teams, so the three nations will never  carry on maneuvers together."    From the standpoint of Team U, however, Japan, the United  States, and the ROK are a united opposing force, which gives the  strong impression of military ties between Japan, the United  States, and the ROK.    When the MSDF first joined the Rimpac exercise in 1980, it  came under attack for "participation in multinational military  maneuvers constituting an exercise of the right to collective  self-defense." However, not only is there the impression now  that participation has become routine, but the participation of  eight destroyers puts the level of MSDF participation second to  that of the U.S. Navy.    There are deeply cooperative relations in Rimpac between the  U.S. Navy and the MSDF. With MSDF ships participating in at-sea  refueling of U.S. Navy vessels and ASW exercises for detecting  and destroying submarines under the guidance of U.S. destroyers.  The opposite chain-of-command cases also take place as a matter  of course.    Moreover, the Kongo, the MSDF's Aegis-type destroyer with  advanced air defense capability, will join Rimpac '94 for the  first time and come under the U.S. carrier task force. Although  the Japanese and U.S. fleets have separate commands, MSDF Chief  of Staff Chiaki Hayashizaki says that "One has to say, according  to one's point of view, that (the Aegis ship and other  destroyers) will be escorting the U.S. aircraft carrier."    With the ROK's participation in the exercises, the issue of  exercising the right to collective self-defense will inevitably  recur. The MSDF describes Team X as "simply an issue of teams  with no other intent," but there is an outstanding whiff of  smoke in the statements of the Japanese and U.S. sides.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata stated in his policy speech that  Japan would deal with the North Korea issue in concert with the  United States and the ROK even without UN resolutions. When  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry visited Japan in April, he  stressed the need for a settlement of the issue through  dialogue, but noted that "it is important for the international  community to show a firm stance through ties among the United  States, Japan, and the ROK."    Specifically, in the event of an emergency situation on the  Korean Peninsula, Japan is reportedly considering having the  Self- Defense Force carry out such rear-echelon support as  at-sea refueling, transport, and medical care. According to a  senior Defense Agency official, "While participation in military  actions is impossible under the constitution, cooperation is  allowed." However, Japan has never discussed seriously whether  "cooperation" is really possible.    However, from the viewpoint of the U.S. military, there is  no  border in terms of strategy between Japan and the ROK, both  allies of the United States. Even between Japan and the ROK,  their national interests are completely identical when it comes  to an emergency on the Korean peninsula and the defense of the  Tsushima straits.    Under such circumstances, Rimpac `94 is highlighting present  relations among Japan, the United States, and the ROK. However,  Japan should not freely strengthen military ties with foreign  nations. Whether military ties are truly possible and, if so,  to what extent, are issues for which debate based upon the  Constitution are demanded.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Apple returns to the takeover limelight Apple Computer, the personal computer maker, this week again become the subject of takeover speculation, with talk in the US markets that Motorola, the communications and semiconductor group, might be preparing a bid. Although both companies declined comment and several industry observers expressed scepticism, Apple's share price jumped jumped Dollars 4 1/8 , or 12 per cent, on Wednesday, to close at Dollars 37 7/8 . Yesterday, the price receded to Dollars 36 3/4 . This is hardly the first time Apple has been at the centre of takeover speculation. Three years ago Mr John Sculley, former Apple chairman, tried to broker a 'merger' with International Business Machines following the companies' agreement to form a wide-ranging technology alliance, which also involved Motorola. AT&amp;T, the telecommunications group, is also reported to have held talks last year with Apple about a possible takeover. While there is no hard evidence to support the rumours that Apple is 'in play', it is increasingly clear that it needs to form new partnerships - through either alliances or the sale of equity - if it is to maintain its momentum in the PC market. Wall Street analysts expect Apple to post strong results over the next two quarters, with estimates of second-half profits ranging from Dollars 1.10 to Dollars 1.85 per share, up from 65 cents on an operating basis for the first half of the year. But the longer-term outlook for the company is far less promising. Apple's share of the world PC market has declined over the past two years to about 10 per cent from about 14 per cent. Apple's 'installed base' of Macintosh computers is about 16m. This is dwarfed by an installed base of nearly 70m PCs running Microsoft's Windows software, notes Ms Lucianne Painter, a PC industry analyst at Salomon Brothers. 'This makes the Windows platform the obvious choice for software developers to support,' she says. Software programs for Windows PCs outnumber those for the Macintosh by more than 10 to one, according to Ms Painter. Unless Apple can substantially increase the size of the market for Macintosh applications programs, it runs the risk of losing the vital support of software developers, narrowing still further the choice of new programs that users can buy off the shelf. After years of internal debate, Apple recently announced plans to license its Macintosh software to other computer makers, so they could produce 'Mac clones'. The company's goal is to boost market share for computers running Macintosh software to 20 per cent by the end of the decade. However, Apple is taking a cautious approach to licensing its software. The company aims to pick just a handful of licensees which address segments of the PC market where Apple has little presence. With most large PC makers now wedded to Microsoft's Windows, it is not clear that Apple will find many takers for its software. Yet it urgently needs a partner that can boost the Macintosh share of the PC market, industry analysts say. Motorola's introduction this week of a range of computers based on the same PowerPC microprocessor chip used in Apple's latest products has led some industry observers to speculate that the two companies would be a good fit. However, Motorola's computers - which the company aims to sell through third parties - are not designed to run Apple's software. It seems unlikely, therefore, that Motorola's plan is to seed the market for Macintosh clones. Anyone interested in acquiring Apple will need deep pockets. Apple's market capitalisation, at the current share price, is approximately Dollars 4.3bn, and analysts speculate that it would sell at a substantial premium.</p>

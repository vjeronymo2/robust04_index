			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: So you want to love your money - But where? David Barchard examines the options NOW THAT the Big Four high street banks have let it be known they are thinking seriously about ending free current-account banking for those in credit, what options do aggrieved customers have if they want to move their business? When the charges are introduced - something that might well not happen for months, or even years - migrating to another bank might not be as easy as you think. When big banks in the US have introduced new charges, they have usually done so in a way which encourages good customers to stay and bad ones to move on. Knowing this, other banks have not always welcomed a flood of applicants, If you are planning a move, this is probably a good time. But bear in mind that, as with credit card charges, there is little point in moving between the Big Four. The choice is between the high street giants and the smaller players. The big banks have some undeniable advantages: they are very safe, with lots of branches and a wide range of services. Yet, a small bank often provides better service simply because it is smaller and staff know their customers better. There could be a down-side, though. You might live a long way from its nearest branch and have to deal with it by post or telephone. That could be inconvenient when you want to pay money into your account or use the inter-bank giro system to make a payment from a branch. These days, the larger banks normally charge non-customers for using their services. As far as withdrawing cash goes, size should not matter. If your new bank or building society has cash machines of its own, it will belong to one of the main UK cash machine networks such as Link (building societies, Co-op bank and Girobank) or Mint (Midland, National Westminster and TSB). You will also be able to withdraw money through almost any cash machine via the Visa network, although this incurs a 1.5 per cent handling fee). Beyond that, you need to ask yourself if your banking needs make you a 'fat cat' or a 'church mouse.' Do you need to go into overdraft sometimes? If the answer is yes, think very carefully about where you place your account. Overdraft charges are almost the only way that banks and building societies make money from most of their cheque accounts so, effectively, you will be subsidising bank customers who stay in credit. You should be especially careful that you do not go into an unauthorised overdraft, even for a very short time. That means talking to your branch in advance and (although it is much less easy these days) negotiating a favourable rate from your manager. You should look for around 18 per cent. There are considerable differences: the Co-op bank's Ultra account is among the star performers, with good interest rates for customers who stay in credit, but its 31 per cent for agreed overdrafts is punitive. It does, however, have the virtue of allowing you to overdraw by up to Pounds 250 for three days. Do you plan to keep some money in your account and earn interest on it? You are the sort of customer the banks are looking for these days. But you will find that most interest-bearing cheque accounts do not earn you very much. Some of the clearers' accounts pay as little as 1.5 per cent gross on low balances. Even if you plan to keep Pounds 500 or Pounds 1,000 in your account, the picture is not all that encouraging. Coutts and other up-market private banks have long expected customers to maintain large deposits. Some of the banks and building societies are now doing the same. To open a current account at Abbey National, customers must deposit Pounds 300 unless their salary cheque is being deposited regularly. For Halifax's Maxim current account, the figure is Pounds 200. Nationwide's terms are even stiffer: Flexaccount, the UK's first mass-market, interest-bearing current account now requires an opening balance of Pounds 500 or the same amount to be paid in each month. So, migrating from a bank to a building society to avoid charges and earn interest will not suit everyone. But the Woolwich building society's current account does look like one of the best buys on the market. No minimum balance is needed and it pays interest of 3.38 per cent, starting on balances of Pounds 1. Its overdraft rates also compare fairly well. For those with much larger amounts of cash, there are higher-interest accounts available, although many of these limit the number of cheques you can write. The table on this page shows the rates available on a number of accounts with Pounds 1,000 or more. If you are willing to keep Pounds 50,000 in the account, you should be able to earn between 8.5 and 10 per cent, with the Portman and Chelsea building societies offering the best rates (although they pay yearly). The Northern Rock account, which pays monthly at an annual rate of 9.34 per cent on balances of Pounds 25,000 and more, is one of the best buys in this category. Northern Rock, by the way, emerged as the third-strongest society in the UBS Phillips &amp; Drew annual review of the industry, a point which investors might want to bear in mind.</p>

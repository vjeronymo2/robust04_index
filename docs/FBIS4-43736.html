			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F> Carlo Brambilla in Milan; date not given: "But Bossi Swears to  `Bobo's' Loyalty"]    [Text] [Brambilla] Honorable Bossi, are you still  determined to hoist the neo-Laborite flag? Many in the League  no longer seem to understand you....    [Bossi] The definition may create some embarrassment. Let me  reexplain: We invented the Freedom Alliance, which we conceived  as being a liberal-democratic alliance. Well, it won the  election, as did free enterprise which became its system. In  this system there are two irreconcilable spirits. The  conservative one, which already exists and is represented by  Forza Italia and the AN [National Alliance], which is pushing  toward private monopolies, and the popular and federalist one  which embraces small shareholdings and the defense of small  business. This is the neo-Laborite spirit. In order to make  free enterprise win, we worked out how to enter but also how to  get out. Having paid the toll we are now out of [Prime  Minister] Berlusconi's orbit. After tactics we will return to  strategies....    [Brambilla] This is where the difficult part begins. Is it  sufficient to say that you are left-wing to make yourselves  recognized?    [Bossi] With its values the League has lit a strong beacon  toward the world that is disintegrating and that must be  reaggregated under free enterprise. Let us not forget that 70  percent of the votes lies in that stormy night sea. Therefore  it is not a matter of stating that we are left wing. The League  is a popular force that has lit the beacon of federalism and  free enterprise. Those who do not think so do not belong to the  League but to Berlusconi.    [Brambilla] In light of what has been said, what will  relations with the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] be like?    [Bossi] The alliance that is governing and that will have to  govern for at least another two years until a real alternative  has been created, is a system with a well-defined dialectic  between the two spirits and not a single party pushing us toward  Forza Italia as Berlusconi would want. In this way the merger  of the forces in the alliance would lead to the creation of a  single party given the fact that no other politicians outside  the alliance are currently able to object. This would  constitute a danger for democracy. Therefore I insist: We will  set small business against Fininvest, federalism against  centralism and so on....    [Brambilla] [Interior] Minister Maroni does not seem to  think  along the same lines....    [Bossi] It does not appear to me that Maroni has a single  party in mind. This story over differences was invented by the  newspapers. I spent most of the other evening with him in Rome.  We talked about a great many things.... And the only  difference that I noted between him and me was that he had the  flu.    [Brambilla] This may even be so, but Maroni insists on an  organizational agreements between the League-Forza Italia and  the AN....    [Bossi] Let us cut the Gordian knot.... Berlusconi invited  me to be the secretary of that jumble. I said no. I answered  that the League will never be able to do what Berlusconi wants.  The League has never dabbled in the previous regime. The  League means change. We have a different ideology: We are  popular, free traders, and federalists. Our blood is fiery, it  is not blue blood. Therefore no single party in Italian  politics.    [Brambilla] Well then, quarrels with Berlusconi are in  sight....    [Bossi] We are not the ones who are quarreling with  Berlusconi, it is history that is quarreling with someone who is  reasoning with the logic of "I will take everything."    [Brambilla] Is the Knight focusing on early elections for  this reason?    [Bossi] Yes, so much so that the day after the European  elections he went to [President] Scalfaro to ask him to dissolve  parliament. But elections now, without having completed  everything that must be done within the framework of a  well-balanced democratic system, is an adventurist and dangerous  choice.    [Brambilla] Could you provide a picture of the current state  of the League....    [Bossi] We are a car that is running again. We have paid the  toll and we have entered into the highway of strategy again.  Every 100 meters we will try to accelerate at least 20  kilometers an hour. The finish is at the end of the road. The  finishing tape reads: free enterprise and federalism. Change is  starting up again....    [Brambilla] You are confident then. And what will you say at  Pontida [League rally venue]?    [Bossi] Everything that I have illustrated up to this point.  I will explain the strategy, furthermore I will explain that  the League knocked down the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and  that it is now beginning to make the PDS [Democratic Party of  the Left] waiver. And that therefore, for the time being, it is  guaranteeing a governable situation provided that there is no  stop to change. Then I will open the issue of the independentist  faction....    [Brambilla] What does this mean exactly?    [Bossi] The federalists and the independentists are the two  spirits of the League. The first is flourishing within the  country. It is already ahead. The other is still against the  country. Coexisting in this way without any prospects there is a  risk of reciprocal destruction, of unleashing an immunilogical  reaction.... The independentist component must be given a  political conscience, I must lead the way....    [Brambilla] But will they both be part of the League....    [Bossi] An internal dialectic will be created. I will be its  guarantor. A dialectic that will make federalism become the  common good for the whole country. I can say that the  independentist faction was not created up to now because many  militants stalled in order not to displease me. Now they must  all be conscious of their own role. Every difference must  emerge.</p>

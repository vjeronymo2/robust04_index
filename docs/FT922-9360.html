			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Global climate compromise in view DELEGATES to the final round of negotiations in New York on a global climate treaty are working to produce a late compromise that could avert a breakdown in the talks before the Earth Summit next month in Rio de Janeiro, reports George Graham in Washington. After protracted negotiations broke off at 4am yesterday, no agreement had yet been reached on a draft treaty, but a text could be produced today before the talks are due to end. Some delegates were still hopeful that Mr Jean Ripert, French chairman of the talks, would be able to produce a text to resolve the glaring disputes on whether to set firm targets for reducing emissions of gases that cause the greenhouse global warming effect, and on financial arrangements to help the developing world make environmental improvements. Mr Ripert proposed last week a draft text that seemed to win US acceptance. The US has has been a big obstacle to agreement by refusing to accept a specific target for pegging emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, at 1990 levels by 2000. However, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, described the text as a 'sell-out'. German delegates expressed unhappiness at the absence of any goal for a reduction in emissions. Delegates to the talks said they believed a 'reasonable compromise' on goals was still possible. Progress towards an agreement without targets has increased the likelihood that US President George Bush, the only major leader who has not yet agreed to go to the summit, would attend.</p>

Official statistics obtained yesterday showed end-December  local debt was P148.312 billion over the P508.278 billion  borrowed from local sources in 1992.    If the $34 billion foreign debt stock, roughly equivalent to  P9.18 trillion, were added to the domestic liability, the total  country indebtedness would reached a staggering P9.836 trillion.    Data indicated that bulk of the local liabilities, P624.181  billion or 95.06 percent, was incurred by the national  government. The balance was borrowed by government corporations  amounting to P4.038 billion and P28.371 billion by the monetary  institutions. On a month-on-month basis, though, borrowings of  the government corporations as well as that of the monetary  institutions dropped slightly by P14 million and P14.456  billion, respectively. On the other hand, the national  government's liabilities widened by a hefty P196.949 billion  from the previous month's level of P427.232 billion. .    According to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) [Central  Bank of the Philippines], expansion in the NG [national  government] domestic debt stock was caused by its decision to  absorb a substantial amount of liabilities of the old Central  Bank through the issuance of the P220 billion worth of bonds to  the BSP. The BSP said that an aggregate of P226.95 billion has  already been inputted in the end-December liabilities. Of this  amount P176.952 billion was in Treasury bills and P50 billion  were Treasury notes. While the increment was substantially lower  by P30 billion from the amount inputted to the national  government liabilities in December, this amount was however,  paid to the BSP for the advances it made for the national  government in the past.</p>

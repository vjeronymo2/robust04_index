			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Stolberg Ingenierberatung THE GERMAN company Stolberg Ingenierberatung, in association with the British-based Commodities Research Unit, has won the international tender for the delicate task of valuing Mineroperu, the Peruvian state-owned minerals and metals company, writes Sally Bowen in Lima. The valuation process is expected to take four months after a late May start, according to Mineroperu officials. Only the company's four sites which have fixed assets are included in the valuation - the copper refinery at Ilo, the Cerro Verde copper mines and plant near Arequipa, the Cajamarquilla electrolytic zinc refinery in the province of Lima and the vast gold deposits of San Antonio de Poto, Peru's largest. Mineroperu's many deposits with development projects attached are at present not included in any valuation. But Mineroperu will be promoting international interest in all of them, with special emphasis on a scaled-down development project for the Antamina copper deposits, at next week's mining fair, Expomin, in Santiago. The Bayovar phosphates deposits with a 1m-tonne capacity plant are also a Mineroperu promotion priority. 'Although theoretically the deposits have passed to the region, Mineroperu has the know-how to contact interested foreign investors,' said Mr Luis Cohello, Mineroperu's projects manager. Joint ventures with Mineroperu are a distinct possibility in some cases  - with San Antonio de Poto, there has been 'much interest and several preliminary conversations', according to Mr Cohello. There are also Peruvian mining sector rumours that US-owned Southern Peru Copper Corporation is interested in acquiring the Ilo refinery, which processes much of its copper blister.</p>

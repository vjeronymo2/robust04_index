			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Arts: A generous dose of dramatic adaptations - Television in 1992 FOR television the year which ends tomorrow has been much like any other, in one respect at least: a large part of the middle class intelligentsia, the chattering classes, call them what you will, continued to complain throughout the year that 'There's nothing on television these days, is there? It's all rubbish, isn't it?' From the first week of 1992 when Channel 4 brought us the superb autobiographical mini-series An Angel At My Table, charting the extraordinary life of New Zealander Janet Frame, to the end of the year when BBC2 was giving us Jennifer Saunders' wickedly accurate comedy about the world of fashion PR, Absolutely Fabulous, the chorus remained at full volume: 'Just nothing on these days, is there . . .' Television is a huge grab-bag, a monstrosity of a medium, even more multifarious than print. Of course much of it is appalling. The flops of 1992 included a drama on BBC1 called Moon And Son in which Millicent Martin played the psychic owner of a market stall whose son was also in the business. Other duds included the Nicholas Craig Masterclass on BBC2, a joke about taking yourself too seriously which might have sustained a five-minute skit but was, unbelievably, stretched out to fill an entire series. It took itself far too seriously. It was BBC2 again which messed about with The Young Musician Of The Year, turning what had been a great pleasure into a great trial. Many former enthusiasts switched off. Astonishingly it was also BBC2 which brought us Ps And Qs, an 'etiquette quiz' which made anybody who knew anything at all about the subject writhe with embarrassment, while failing utterly to inform those who did not. The Velvet Claw on BBC1 was that rare phenomenon, a bad wildlife series. ITV's new Maigret, despite having Michael Gambon in the title role, was frequently compared, detrimentally, with the BBC's famous black and white series starring Rupert Davies. But the biggest boo-boo of the year was BBC1's new twice-weekly soap opera Eldorado which was set in Spain among expatriates and a few foreigners and was supposed to win big ratings with its formula of sun, sangria and sex. Instead it entered the BBC1 Top 30 in July with an audience of 10 million, slid to seven million by October, fell off the bottom of the list, and has not reappeared since. Yet it is surely no great surprise if there are some disasters in a medium which now offers all of us four terrestrial channels, operating day and night, and attempts to cater for the entire population, young and old, rich and poor, clever and not so clever. The surprise - and it is strikingly obvious to anybody who travels the world even a little and has a look at what television manages elsewhere - is that British television sustains such a high success rate. Take drama. In January ITV brought us a two-part dramatisation of Fay Weldon's novel The Cloning Of Joanna May with memorable performances from Patricia Hodge and Brian Cox. It would have been a peculiar viewer who could watch Part 1 and then forego Part 2. February offered Channel 4's adaptation of The Camomile Lawn, Peter Hall's first effort at directing a television series. The cast list alone would have caused queues round the block for any West End theatre: Felicity Kendal, Paul Eddington, Claire Bloom, Rosemary Harris, Richard Johnson (who turned out to be flavour of the year) and Virginia McKenna. There was lots of rumpy pumpy, not only on the eponymous grass, but upstairs and downstairs and in my lady's chamber. Generally speaking it did seem in 1992 as though the British were becoming a little more relaxed about sex and a little less happy about perpetual violence on screen, which is a move in the right direction. In March BBC2 treated us to a hugely enjoyable adaptation (yes, another adaptation) of Kingsley Amis's The Old Devils, and May brought one of the major contenders for the year's prizes, ITV's three-part adaptation (yes another . . .) of Angus Wilson's Anglo-Saxon Attitudes which once again starred Richard Johnson. It also starred Douglas Hodge who managed to take the lead simultaneously in BBC1's adaptation (yes . . .) of Ruth Rendell's A Fatal Inversion, a story which, looking back from the year's end, seems to have been pretty nasty. Yet it was undeniably a gripping production. The idea that there is 'Nothing on television' in a week which - apart from everything else - offers two such distinguished dramas surely suggests something more serious than ennui in the viewer. The autumn season was equally generous, and this time all the best material was written specially for television. Downtown Lagos was an eccentric three-part BBC2 production about the English legal system and colonialism, or possibly drug smuggling and racism, or perhaps all four. On the same channel Nice Town was, most unusually, a piece of true satire - ridiculing the hypocrisy and priggishness of British suburban life - and as such seemed to be widely distrusted and disliked. A later generation may find it funny and telling. BBC1's Look At It This Way had an an attitude that was sometimes equally sardonic, plus the advantage of good location filming in yuppy London. But the best of the autumn bunch was BBC1's Between The Lines, a series about an internal police investigation body which provided a new foreground story each week while following background threads throughout the 13-part series. This is another potential award winner. Single dramas were more scarce than ever, and most of the few that did appear were better described as films. My shortlist contains only one non-BBC2 title: Channel 4's A Sense Of History consisting of a single virtuoso performance by Jim Broadbent. He played what seemed at first to be a completely conventional English aristocrat, only slowly revealing himself to be completely loopy and a murderer. Screen 2 accounted for practically all the other impressive single dramas. The Last Romantics was an astonishingly successful piece about FR Leavis and in-fighting among Cambridge academics; and An Ungentlemanly Act gave a graphic account of the extraordinary events at the start of the Falklands war involving the governor, Sir Rex Hunt. With all that on offer solely from the drama departments, what could anybody mean by saying 'There's nothing on'? There were Winter Olympics and The Olympics, a Cricket World Cup which helped Sky sell lots of satellite dishes, though they won few friends with their far too frequent commercial breaks, and in BBC2's Grand Prix we watched Nigel Mansell finally win the Formula 1 World Championship. The March election campaign became notorious for Jennifer Bennett's glue ear, the subject of one of Labour's party political broadcasts, and for John Major's decision to abandon all the ploys of the spin doctors and revert to a soap box. This was the general election where the worm turned and television began to analyse in detail the politicians' attempts to exploit the medium. The programmes intended to mark the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's famous voyage were pretty lacklustre, but good work was done in Spain. Fire In The Blood was an outstanding BBC2 series which conveyed an amazing amount about the Spanish people and their country; Coast Of Dreams an excellent pair of Channel 4 programmes about the British connection; and Floyd On Spain - BBC 2 again - was the best set of cookery/travel/folklore/wine/architecture and gags programmes yet made by Keith Floyd whose series get better and better. Three utterly contrasting productions would have to compete for any prizes in the Documentary Series category. Perpetual Motion was a collection of fond reports on BBC2 of long-lasting vehicles such as the Morris 1000 and the FX4 London cab; in Brother Felix And The Virgin Saint Bamber Gascoigne offered highly entertaining reports on European tourism in the 15th century (rules for pilgrims included 'Don't paint your coat of arms on monuments') on Channel 4; and The Kennedys was ITV's autumn series of classic documentaries about the No. 1 political family in the US. Virtually all the BBC's regular series produced at least one more-than-usually-impressive programme. Inside Story screened an important up-date on 'Bloody Sunday'; Timewatch showed how 'Bridge On The River Kwai' marginalised the significance of Asian prisoners in the building of the Burma railway; Bookmark combined drama and documentary flawlessly to describe 'Miss Pym's Day Out'; 40 Minutes told the story of Radio Luxembourg in 'Farewell Fab 208'; and the Video Diaries series included one of the most poignant documents of any year when it showed the material shot by an Albanian doctor about the pitiful state of his country. Then in October Kenneth Griffith finally managed to bring to the screen an account of the life of one of his heroes in Roger Casement, Heart Of Darkness. There is another category of programmes which becomes increasingly important and might, perhaps, be called 'Current Affairs Series' since they deal with the present rather than the past. The Racing Game on BBC2 in May was far more interesting about horse racing than any non-enthusiast might have dreamed possible. States Of Mind in August, also on BBC2, was fascinating on attitudes and lifestyles in the US. Some programmes in the Video Diaries series already mentioned were less successful than others, but generally this was a triumphant use of amateur video at a time when such footage is exploited more and more elsewhere on television for embarrassment series. Highly original and worryingly revealing was BBC1's autumn series Off The Back Of A Lorry in which Mike Scott and a large lorry criss-crossed Europe investigating the way that the new regulations operate (almost invariably against British interests). Two types of programme which have often been so strong in Britain - comedy and arts - were less impressive in 1992. But nearly everyone seemed to enjoy Absolutely Fabulous on BBC2, especially Joanna Lumley's performance as the drunk sidekick. The only other notable newcomer was The Big One in which Sandy Toksvig got away with some of the most explicit gags ever used on British television either because nobody understood them or because nobody believed such a sweet little thing could be so rude. The other good series - Red Dwarf, Waiting For God and Have I Got News For You - all began before 1992. There was even less originality in the arts. As usual several editions of ITV's South Bank Show remain memorable at year's end: one which deconstructed the 'Sgt Pepper' recording; and another that looked at the lives of two young female stars in the Royal Ballet. The Late Show on BBC2 maintained its standard though as ever it sometimes felt like a private club. If you had to name an arts series of the year it would probably be Channel 4's Without Walls which proved with its treatment of 'The End Of History', Shakespeare's sexuality, and much besides that there are really no limits to what can be described as 'art and culture'. The steady growth of tabloid TV continued, manifested largely in a passion for 'real life' crime stories. BBC1 gave us Crime Limited and 999, and ITV contributed Michael Winner's True Crimes and Crime Story. In July ITV launched a morning studio series called The Richard And Judy Show which was like an electronic edition of 'Peg's Paper' and in October BBC1 dutifully followed suit with Good Morning . . . With Anne And Nick. Channel 4 disregarded its famous 'remit' and launched The Big Breakfast Show which took the 'television for morons' notion further than ever before. Deaths are always sad, but the 1992 list seemed even more so than usual. Frankie Howerd and Benny Hill, two of the greatest clowns of their generation, died within 24 hours of one another in April. In June, Juris Podnieks was killed, apparently while scuba diving on holiday, a terrible irony for a man who had come so close to death so often while filming the collapse of the communist regimes in the Soviet Union. It was Podnieks who brought us the outstanding series Hallo, Do You Hear Us? Then in December, only six months after retiring, Dan Maskell, the voice of Wimbledon, died. Tomorrow will see the last of TV-am across the country, Thames Television in London, TVS in southern England, and TSW in the west country. On Friday they will be replaced by a new ultra-competitive market driven ITV. On the same day John Birt will take over from Sir Michael Checkland as director-general of the BBC and will begin his self-appointed task of overseeing the decline of BBC audiences by one third. Will 1993 be as good for the viewer as 1992? It seems unlikely. True, the British have muddled through to remarkably effective broadcasting systems, producing, more by luck than judgment, structures and organisations which have served us peculiarly well. But load too much on her back and even Lady Luck will stumble and fall. Perhaps 1993 will be the year when we really shall have cause to say 'There's nothing on television these days, is there?'</p>

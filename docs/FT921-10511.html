			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / EC acts over Dutch construction cartel THE European Commission has begun legal proceedings against the Dutch government, which the EC believes condoned an illegal cartel operated by the country's industry federation involving up to 7,000 builders. According to the Commission, the cartel has dominated the Dutch construction industry for the last 12 years, and accounts for about 40 per cent of the sector's turnover. Brussels yesterday imposed fines of Ecu22.5m (Pounds 16.04m) on the 28 construction associations which are members of the federation, the SPO. The Commission has been investigating the cartel, which operated quite openly, for more than three years and had to examine tens of thousands of invoices to uncover the exact structure of the organisation. The SPO had offered to amend its methods - which involved deciding in advance the terms and candidates for contract tenders - but could not go far enough to satisfy Brussels. 'It's over now,' said one Commission official yesterday. 'It will have to go, as of tonight.' The Commission said it had imposed only a token fine on the members of the SPO partly because of the federation's 'relatively co-operative attitude'. The Commission has also attempted to play down the involvement of the Netherlands government, which could be taken to the European Court of Justice if it fails to satisfy Brussels about its role in the cartel. Apart from 4,000 builders linked directly to the SPO, some 3,000 others were involved in the cartel on a case-by-case basis. According to the Commission, 150 of those were established in other member states. All three Baltic states will reach trade and co-operation agreements with the EC this month, as a first step to formal association with the Community. Terms will be similar to those negotiated with central European states, writes David Buchan in Brussels. Following the initialling of trade and co-operation accords with Lithuania and Latvia on February 1 and 4, the Commission said yesterday a similar arrangement would be reached with Estonia on February 24. The economic section of the agreements, which remove discriminatory quotas and tariffs and set up joint co-operation bodies, confers little more benefit on the Baltic states than they had enjoyed under the defunct EC-Soviet agreement. But the agreements go further politically, with the EC committing itself to drawing the new states into its foreign policy consultations and the Baltics pledging observance of individual and minority rights.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Ford set to dispatch full-time executives to help Mazda Mazda, the troubled Japanese carmaker, will accept three senior executives from Ford, the US carmaker which is its largest shareholder, in a move aimed at ensuring its long-term survival. Ford has agreed to send three full-time executives, including a senior vice president, to Mazda. The appointments will increase the number of Ford executives at Mazda from one to four and the number of seats Ford has on Mazda's 42-member board from four to seven. Mr Yoshihiro Wada, Mazda's president, said the move - to be formally approved at a shareholder meeting in June - aimed to extend co-operation in areas such as product development and use of global facilities. However, the appointment of high-level executives from Ford highlights the difficulties Mazda faces amid economic slowdown in Japan and overcapacity in other world markets. The Ford appointments were announced alongside a revamp of top management at Mazda, with five board members retiring and Mr Wada assuming responsibility for domestic marketing and sales. The move ties in with recognition within Mazda that as markets have become saturated, carmakers must co-operate to survive. Mazda is suffering from the twin burdens of an underused state-of-the-art manufacturing plant, in which it invested heavily, and a large distribution network. It expects to post a Y32bn (Pounds 200m) pre-tax loss for the year to March and is restructuring to regain profitability. Meanwhile, ambitions to set up a manufacturing facility in Europe were quashed when a plan to use Ford's manufacturing facility there fell apart earlier this year. While no plans have been announced on how the two could co-operate further, Mazda said it hoped independent tie-ups with Ford, such as Mazda's production of Ford Festivas in Japan and Ford's manufacturing of the Navaho for Mazda in the US, could be developed into more long-term arrangements.</p>

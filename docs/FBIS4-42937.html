			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has  said that Turkey is justified regarding its requests concerning  the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline.    Cetin was speaking after his 50-minute meeting with British  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd held during the North Atlantic  Council meetings in Istanbul today. He said that he told his  British counterpart that Turkey's sole aim is to save the  pipeline. Cetin continued:    I explained to him that this cannot be compared to other  countries' relations with Iraq, that it is a very special  problem, and that we are justified in trying to save the  pipeline.    Cetin noted that relations with the European Union [EU] were  also discussed in detail at the meeting.    Recalling that Germany and France will be chairing the EU  meetings consecutively as of July, Cetin said: We view this  period as a significant one in Turkey's relations with the  Customs Union as well as the EU.    Cetin stated that the situation in Iraq and the  Azerbaijani-Armenian clashes were also discussed at the meeting.    Pointing out that they also dwelt on the benefits of  extending the tripartite meetings process among Turkey, Britain,  and Germany to include France as well, Cetin concluded by saying  that the tripartite meetings can be converted into quadripartite  ones.</p>

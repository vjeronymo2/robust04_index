			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA;  </P> <P> MEETING TO EXPLAIN RECYCLING PROGRAM  </P> <P> The first of four town meetings will be held today by the city of Placentia and  Placentia Disposal Inc. to inform residents of a new recycling program and  changes in disposal service.  </P> <P> Beginning next month, the city will implement a recycling program that uses  automated waste collection devices and containers to collect recyclables,  similar to programs in Brea and Anaheim.  </P> <P> The first meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. today at Tuffree Junior High School,  2151 N. Kraemer Blvd. A short video will be presented along with a  demonstration of the 110-gallon containers soon to be distributed by the city.  Officials will explain what is considered recyclable and answer questions.  </P> <P> "This program not only changes the way the city will collect the trash but also  asks residents to do their part by altering their waste disposal habits," said  Robert D'Amato, city administrator.  </P> <P> The city will provide residents with two containers -- black for regular,  nonrecyclable waste materials, and green for recyclable items, which include  newspapers, glass, aluminum, tin cans and plastics. The special containers will  replace residents' old trash cans and will begin to be distributed in the  second week of June.  </P> <P> Pickup schedules throughout the city will remain the same with the new system.  Collection of the black trash containers will be made weekly, and green  recyclable containers will be picked up every other week. Effective July, 1990,  rates for residential disposal will be $9.99 per month, an increase of $1.59.  </P> <P> Additional meetings are scheduled for 7 p.m. Thursday at the Gomez Center, 1701  Atwood Ave.; 7:30 p.m. Monday at the Backs Community Building, 201 N. Bradford  Ave.; and 7 p.m. May 17 at Oberly Gym, 974 S. Melrose St. Residents unable to  attend the meetings may call Placentia Disposal at (714) 632-1576.JULIE ESPY  </P></p>

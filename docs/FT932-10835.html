			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Brittan's plan for Gatt deal THE European Community will today ask the US to ease market access for European exporters, as part of a 'fair and balanced' settlement of outstanding disagreements in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner for external relations, is looking for significant concessions from the US in areas such as textiles and services, in order to persuade EC member states that the whole package - including liberalised farm trade - is acceptable. His idea seems to be to put together a broad enough package deal to persuade the French government, in particular, to drop its objections to the farm trade compromise negotiated by the European Commission last year. After talks in Bonn yesterday with Chancellor Helmut Kohl Sir Leon held out the hope of EC and US trade negotiators reaching 'some kind of breakthrough' in the Gatt negotiations in time for the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven industrialised states in July. A timetable of negotiations, including a meeting including Canada and Japan, has been agreed with that aim in mind. Sir Leon is flying today to Washington with Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, for meetings with both President Bill Clinton and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, at which both sides hope to reopen the remaining issues in the Gatt trade talks. 'We have a long way to go, but I have no doubt of the American desire to go the whole way,' he said. 'They have joined me in setting a series of dates for meetings which will show our resolve. The aim is to reach some kind of breakthrough in time for the G7 summit in Tokyo,' said Sir Leon. A final agreement would have to be reached by December 15, the date when the 'fast track' negotiating authority granted to the US administration by Congress finally expires. 'I really do believe this deadline is the last one,' Sir Leon said. He said the EC would now focus on the key question of market access. US import tariffs were in general much higher than EC tariffs, with textiles and services two areas showing a big disparity. 'We want to show the people of Europe that we gain something from an agreement,' Sir Leon said. He is simply turning a blind eye to French demands for renegotiation of the agricultural part of the EC-US package, insisting that a deal has been done.</p>

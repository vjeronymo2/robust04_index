			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Croatia/Italy: Fears Over Borders </F> Unjustified, Ministers Say"]    [Text] (ANSA) Washington, May 23 -- Both Italian Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino, here, and Defense Minister Cesare  Preveti, in Brussels, said on Monday [23 May] that no problem  existed regarding the borders between Italy and Croatia and that  fears in this regard, voiced by Croatian president Franjo  Tudjman, were unjustified.    During his press conference here, Foreign Minister Martino  said "the position adopted by President Tudjman is not justified  by any attitude or position on our part.... Italy's position is  that we see absolutely no problem about borders. We have never  considered treaties to be pieces of paper to be torn up.  Bilateral questions may exist, obviously, and we hope they can  be resolved in a friendly way on a bilateral level and which  satisfies both sides."    President Tudjman had said, at the weekend, that die-hard  Italian fascists had to give up, once and for all, any and all  claims to coastal provinces of Croatia.    Asked whether the treaty of Osimo, which defined the  Italo-Yugoslav border, could be re-opened, the Italian  diplomatic chief recalled how Slovenia and Croatia had legally  replaced Yugoslavia and that the treaty "must be respected and,  in some cases, even applied."    The existing bilateral questions were listed by the minister  as those regarding the real estate purchases by Italians and  free circulation of persons.    (In Brussels, Defense Minister Preveti said no disputes were  open between Italy and Croatia and that, at most, only  adjustments needed to be made which took into account the new  political reality.)</p>

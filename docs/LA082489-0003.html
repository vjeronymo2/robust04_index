			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MADAGASCAR SWAP  </P> <P> I am almost certain to be the only one from Madagascar to live in Southern  California. So when I saw the article Aug. 4 about the $1 million  debt-for-nature swap, I decided to write.  </P> <P> Thank you America.  </P> <P> I know there must have been official thanks, but this is from a simple citizen  who often feels sorry for his country. The idea is good. I thought of other  ones: how about debt-for industrialization, debt-for education, debt-for  transportation, debt-for-hygiene?  </P> <P> Madagascar is a precious country, and not enough people know that. Madagascar  needs help. That's why I came to study here. Thanks again.  </P> <P> DOMINIQUE  </P> <P> ANDRIAMANANTOA  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

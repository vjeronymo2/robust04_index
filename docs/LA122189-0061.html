			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS FEASTS;  </P> <P> THE LAST THING ANYONE EMBROILED IN NORMAL CHRISTMAS DAY FESTIVITIES NEEDS IS TO  BE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING A HUGE HOLIDAY DINNER ON THE TABLE. THAT'S WHY IT'S  WISE TO CHOOSE A MENU BUILT AROUND FOODS THAT REQUIRE ONLY A MODICUM OF  ATTENTION WHILE THEY COOK.  </P> <P> If ever a celebration meal was served under duress, it is Christmas dinner. By  the time it is ready to serve, the initial excitement of opening gifts and  playing with new toys and games has wound down and hunger pangs are rife. But  in all likelihood, the family cook has had to somehow get it all together with  children, family and guests all happily underfoot or teeming in and out of the  kitchen.  </P> <P> Whether one does all the cooking and planning or settles for a family potluck,  there's a lot of work behind every successful Christmas dinner. But the fun of  having family and friends together to celebrate the occasion is worth it.  </P> <P> With turkey so much in the limelight at Thanksgiving, and since it appears so  often on our tables during the year these days, why not choose something very  different for your Christmas menu this year? A rack of lamb, separated into  double chops and served on a bed of barley mixed with pine nuts, raisins, an  orange and mint leaves will make a welcome change.  </P> <P> Or, you might like to consider serving a juicy Christmas goose stuffed with a  dried fruit and chestnut-flavored bread dressing. If you want a large goose,  one big enough to serve a crowd, you may need to ask your butcher to order it  for you. For the photo appearing with this story, however, we had little  trouble finding a 15-pound goose. A couple of telephone calls quickly located  the large goose in the frozen foods section at one of the major markets.  </P> <P> Another elegant centerpiece to consider for a wonderful celebration dinner is a  boned and stuffed leg of lamb. Fresh spinach leaves, onion, garlic and oyster  mushrooms are used in the delicate stuffing for this aromatic holiday roast.  </P> <P> A more traditional Christmas menu might feature a standing beef rib roast.  Serve this one with old-fashioned Yorkshire pudding and a rich mushroom-laden  brown gravy.  </P> <P> Still other suggestions for an easy holiday menu include a succulent ham served  with Quick-Glazed Sweet Potatoes or possibly a lean and flavorful pork roast  served with baked apples.  </P> <P> Whatever you choose to serve for your holiday meal, we hope it's a happy one  for you and yours.  </P> <P> ROAST GOOSE WITH CHESTNUT-FIG STUFFING  </P> <P> 1 (12 to 15-pound) goose  </P> <P> 1 cut lemon  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Chestnut-Fig Stuffing  </P> <P> Thaw bird if frozen. Remove neck and giblets from body cavity. Remove excess  fat from body cavity and neck skin. Rub inside and out with cut lemon. Season  with salt and pepper. With sharp-tined fork, pierce goose all over at 2-inch  intervals. Wings may be removed at second joint or tucked akimbo against body.  </P> <P> Fill neck and body cavities loosely with stuffing. Fasten neck skin to back  with skewer. Tie legs together, or tuck under skin at tail, if present (no need  to truss.)  </P> <P> Place goose, breast side up, on rack in large roasting pan. Insert meat  thermometer deep into thigh muscle. Roast uncovered at 400 degrees 45 minutes  to 1 hour, depending on size of bird. Do not baste.  </P> <P> Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees and roast until thermometer in thigh  registers 180 degrees, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. During roasting spoon or siphon off  accumulated fat about every hour to prevent excessing browning of fat. To  serve, place on platter and surround with medley of fresh or dried fruits, if  desired.

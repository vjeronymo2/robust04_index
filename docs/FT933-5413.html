			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Arts: A minimalist's material - Sculpture THE CENTRAL exhibition space at the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, is occupied by an enormous six metre high tower made out of 21 tons of cinder blocks. Constructed and installed under the supervision of Sol LeWitt, it is the culmination of an exhibition of structures from 1963 to the present on view at the Institute and in the adjoining Leeds City Art Gallery. A large body of drawings, most of which are an integral part of his sculptural practice, are also on show. The very early drawings, from 1958, are copies, or 'transcriptions', as he prefers to call them, of Old Master paintings, ranging from Piero della Francesca to Velasquez and Goya. That he should have been attracted to Piero is interesting, since LeWitt's subsequent work, both sculpture and drawings, has been rigorously abstract and geometric. Piero was the first early Renaissance artist to construct his frescoes on geometric principles, and therefore a timely beacon to the young LeWitt. In the 1960s LeWitt, along with Donal Judd and Carl Andre, was a founder member of the minimalist and conceptualist coterie. It was he who, in 1967, adumbrated the principle that 'in conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work . . .' The exhibition holds a great number of explicatory drawings, with texts explaining how LeWitt reached a certain position intellectually, at which point the structure could be, and was, fabricated by a technician. The rigorously pared-down quality of many of the structures is exemplified in the room populated by 122 Incomplete Open Cubes, 1974, which are painted wood structures 8 x 8 x 8 inches, mounted on a 12 inch high painted wood base on the floor; 122 framed photographs and drawings hang like doppelgangers on the wall. The systematic geometric variations forbid any figurative associations: 'what you see is what you see', as Frank Stella declared in 1966. A historical curiosity is Muybridge II of 1964, which caused a furore as recently as 1991, when a feminist curator refused to exhibit it at the National Museum of American Art in Washington DC on the grounds that it was obscene. This structure consists of a long box with 10 tiny holes containing frontal photographs of a nude woman, which progressively advance until the final focus is the navel. Perhaps it makes peeping Toms of us all, but truly pornography is in the eye of the beholder. From the mid-1980s LeWitt gave himself permission to enjoy the sensuous properties of colour. The results are some gorgeously rich gouaches in deep, Egyptian tomb-painting colours - dark reds, burgundies and ochres - starting in 1985 with pyramidal shapes progressing to regular horizontal and vertical bands of colour until, in 1992, he lets rip, painting wavy irregular bands in luscious tones. At the Yorkshire Sculpture Park LeWitt has installed another cinder block piece entitled 123454321. The numbers refer to the stepped blocks which rise from a small cube at either end to one large cube in the middle. The cinder blocks, essentially urban materials, unpleasant to the touch and to the sight, sit uneasily in the lush landscape. It is LeWitt's only structure sited in the British landscape and I hope it remains so. The sculptures of Fritz Wotruba (1907-74) are more comfortable inhabitants of the formal parts of the Sculpture Park. Smaller sculptures, maquettes and drawings are displayed in the Pavilion Gallery and the newly-opened Bothy Gallery. Wotruba, who was born in Vienna, was part of the modern movement. His abiding concern was that the solidity of the material remained with him throughout his career. During the war, which he spent in exile in Switzerland, his sculptures became more representational, owing much to the elongated figures of Wilhelm Lehmbruck. Perhaps his most enduring monument, represented here by photographs, was his design for the Church of the Most Holy Trinity, Vienna Mauer. Composed of rectangular blocks and cubes, it is as uncompromisingly modern as was Gerrit Rietveld's Schroer House in Utrecht in 1924. New granite sculptures were made on site by Michael Dan Archer. Archer lived in Japan for three years, which clearly influenced his attitude to the physical characteristics of the stone he is working. The abstract shapes are evocative of ancient architecture and prehistoric menhirs, teasing our imaginations with their secret histories. The Sol LeWitt Exhibition is at the Henry Moore Institute and the Leeds City Gallery until October 16 (telephone: 0532-343158). Fritz Wotruba Sculptures is at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Wakefield (0924-830302) until October 31.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / People: Ayling changes his crew Valerie Scoular, general manager of British Airways' ground operations in London, has been promoted to be director of human resources. She will be responsible for the administration and development of 49,000 staff. Scoular's promotion is part of the second big reorganisation of BA's marketing and operations team in less than 18 months. The last time the changes were precipitated by the abrupt departure of BA marketing chief Liam Strong to become chief executive at Sears. This time they have been triggered by the promotion of Robert Ayling, Strong's successor at BA, to be group managing director. Ayling has taken the opportunity to reorganise his old marketing and operations department. In addition to the existing flight operations, human resources and engineering and information management departments, Ayling has set up seven new units: regions and sales; marketing; network management; operations; service delivery; cargo and business units. Scoular, 37, who joined BA as a graduate trainee in 1977, is taking over the human resources part of the job being done by John Watson, director of human resources and information management. Brian Haydon, the current deputy, has been made director of information management. Meanwhile, Watson has been appointed director of regions and sales and takes charge of the airline's sales activities worldwide as well as regional management. Among the other new appointments are Mike Street, director of service delivery; Kevin Hatton, director, cargo; and Mike Batt, director of marketing. BA is looking for a head of business units, who will be responsible for airline subsidiaries. However, Ayling's new empire is not as big as it sounds. BA has confirmed that Sir Colin Marshall, the new chairman, retains direct executive responsibility for finance, corporate strategy, safety, security and environment, health services, company secretariat, legal, communications and public relations. The respective directors and heads of these departments report directly to him. ***** For the first time since the summer of 1991, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi will have a finance director on the main board. Wendy Smyth, who has been chief financial officer, is promoted with effect from April 1. Charles Scott, who joined the company at the same time as Robert Louis-Dreyfus in January 1990 and helped steer it through a period of much-needed restructuring, had been finance director until July 1991. He then became chief operating officer but retained board-level responsibilities for finance as well. Now Louis-Dreyfus has departed for Adidas, and Scott has stepped up to become chief executive. The company says that the title of chief operating officer has been lost; it had been appropriate when Scott was sorting out the individual operating units, 'but now that task is completed and we are paired down to a minimum,' according to a spokeswoman . Smyth, 39, who trained at Thomson McLintock, joined Saatchis in the US in 1982, before becoming UK regional finance director in 1984. Between 1986 and 1989 she was finance director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising International, and then held the same position in the communications division. Saatchis will in fact be without a finance director for another three months because in late March Smyth goes on maternity leave - timed when it had been expected that Louis-Dreyfus would stay until June. Her responsibilities will be spread around the finance department, although the break comes at a quiet time, after the year's results are announced on March 9. ***** Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Courtaulds, has been appointed to the board of SMITHKLINE BEECHAM on the resignation of Alain Gomez, chairman and chief executive of Thomson SA. Sir Archibald Forster (right), recently retired chairman and chief executive of Esso UK, has been appointed a non-executive director at UNITED NEWSPAPERS. ***** Frank Amhurst has retired from HARMONY LEISURE. ***** Big business comes to town. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, chaired the first board meeting last week of London Forum, a group of business leaders who want to help promote London overseas. Seated to the left of Sir Allen are Jan Hall, chief executive of Coley Porter Hall, and Michael Howard, the environment secretary. Back row from left: Brian Pearce, chairman Pearce Signs; Clyde Williams, chief executive WWA; Nigel Fox-Bassett, senior Partner Clifford Chance; Sir Brian Jenkins, partner, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and former Lord Mayor of London; Sir Idris Pearce, chairman English Estates; Sir David Scholey, chairman S G Warburg, and Sir Colin Marshall, chairman British Airways. The other members of the board are Sir Hugh Bidwell, chairman London Tourist Board, Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman Wembley, Sir Christopher Bland, chairman LWT, Harvey Goldsmith, director Allied Entertainments, David Goldstone, chairman Regalian Properties, Ian Reeves, chairman Highpoint and Maurice Saatchi, chairman Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.</p>

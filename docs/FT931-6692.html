			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel Focus (France): Wilderness where horses know best WHENEVER the horses reached high ground, Henri would sing, quietly and exultantly. Years in the French colonial service had earned him early retirement from the drudgery of a Toulouse bank. His great passion was to explore his beloved Languedoc on Brigand, his Roman-nosed bay. And so, at evening, while the rest of us were untacking and grooming, Henri and Brigand would canter off for a solitary hour as the sun set behind the foothills of the Pyrenees. Henri was not the only one reluctant to turn in after a day on horseback. The Corbieres, a remote inland corner of south-west France, is a varied and beautiful region of barren hills, limestone peaks, forests and gorges. Eight years ago, the owners of 12 gites, or farmhouses, banded together as Les Sentiers du Sud. They offer accommodation and mounts for visitors attracted by the local network of sentiers: 800 kilometres of well-maintained paths. Inntravel, of York, a specialist in independent travel, uses Sentiers du Sud to offer week-long riding holidays. A guide takes groups of six to nine from one isolated farmhouse to another, rarely setting hoof on a road. Self-piloting circuits can be made by really experienced riders, and there is a gentle, confidence-building option for novices. The stone farmhouses all belong to working farms, some of them as old as the 14th century. Before the depopulation wreaked by this century's wars, some 40 individuals would have lived in crowded squalor at La Bastide, an upland farm beneath the frowning peak of Bugarach. These days, the massive walls shelter just two families: a Catalan activist and the gite's owner, a sheep breeder-cum-jazz musician. Our guide, Jean-Claude Pons, succeeded in being calmly authoritative without being bossy. He is typical of the Sentiers du Sud crowd in being a refugee from city life. Recent decades have seen an influx of settlers in search of rural simplicity. Tourism apart, the newcomers produce herbs, organic grapes, honey and wild-boar pate. They weave, dye silk scarves, and breed the black Merens mountain horses. But life gets no easier in this wild, barren region and locals complain bitterly of neglect by the bureaucrats in Paris. Social life lacks sparkle so the gite owners seem genuinely happy to dine with their guests in the evening. Rooms in converted out-buildings are simple and comfortable. Each morning, the saddle-bags are filled with pies of vegetable and wild boar, cheeses, and flasks of red wine. The food is welcome on a ride which can last six hours, across gruellingly steep terrain. The horses are part-Arab, agile and brave, with good mouths, iron legs and no aversion to a gallop. A rider needs to be competent and prepared to accept that, whatever goes on in the covered school in Wimbledon, on the Sentiers du Sud the horse knows best. On our visit, the days were so lovely, they almost hurt. There were no car fumes, no articulated lorries, hardly a gate. How would it be possible to endure Oxfordshire mud, hostile farmers and murderous drivers again? Here, at least, riders were not the enemy. That role was played by Spaniards roaring up the tracks in their off-road vehicles to steal the pink mushrooms called laiteuses de delice. As late as the 18th century, the fortresses of southern Corbieres guarded what was still the Spanish-French border. Approached slowly on horseback, the magnificent castles at Arques, Puilaurens and Peyrepertuse are more evocative than ever. In the castle at Arques, a newsletter for latter-day Cathars offered proof of the romantic, quasi-historical baloney which is such an abundant crop in the Pays de Cathares. The myth is that every castle was a nest of millennarian, vegetarian, free-loving Cathar heretics. In reality, the castles say more about the rivalries of seigneurs rich from dues on wine and wool, and from excursions against the Moors across the mountains. Today, the rise of sentimental Catharism is just one more expression of enduring southern hostility towards the north. Impoverished, yet fiercely proud of its past, the Corbieres is a place of rare beauty. Explored on horseback, its solitude seems to enter your soul.

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> VIRGINIA WINS, 59-0, BUT WELSH COMPLAINS  </P> <P> Virginia rolled up 543 yards of offense, forced seven turnovers and pranced to  a 59-0 victory over Duke Saturday at Durham, N.C.  </P> <P> But Coach George Welsh wasn't raving about his 10th-ranked Cavaliers.  </P> <P> "We weren't that sharp," an unsmiling Welsh said after Virginia scored its  biggest Atlantic Coast Conference victory ever.  </P> <P> "We missed blocks, we didn't pick up blitzes," Welsh said. "We're not that much  better than Duke. They helped us a lot. They moved the ball, but they had too  many turnovers."  </P> <P> Virginia is 4-0 overall and 2-0 in ACC play. Duke is 1-2 and 0-1. The two teams  tied for the ACC championship last season.  </P> <P> Virginia quarterback Shawn Moore ran one yard for a touchdown in the second  quarter and hit Herman Moore on scoring pass plays of 36 and 40 yards. Moore,  the wide receiver, now has 20 touchdown receptions in his career, which equals  the school record set by John Ford.  </P> <P> By the time Shawn Moore was finished midway through the third quarter, he had  completed 11 of 17 passes for 181 yards. He is 19-2 as a starter.  </P> <P> No. 2 Florida State 31, Tulane 13 -- Brad Johnson completed 13 of 17 passes for  170 yards and one touchdown and ran for another score to lead the Seminoles  (3-0) at New Orleans.  </P> <P> Florida State led, 24-0, after three quarters.  </P> <P> Johnson's touchdown pass came on a six-play drive from the Florida State 13. He  completed three straight passes for 35 yards, and on first down from the Tulane  44 found Edgar Bennett alone in the right flat, and Bennett, breaking three  tackles along the way, went the distance.  </P> <P> Tulane is 2-2.  </P> <P> Clemson 48, Appalachian State 0 -- Clemson got what it wanted. The 17th-ranked  Tigers, whose offense had scored only two touchdowns in the past two weeks,  scored often and quickly against the Division I-AA Mountaineers at Clemson,  S.C.  </P> <P> "One of our goals was to either score 40 points or have over 500 yards total  offense," Coach Ken Hatfield said. "Another goal was to shut out Appalachian  State. . . . We challenged our players on this."  </P> <P> The Tigers (3-1) had 493 yards total offense.  </P> <P> Freshman tailback Ronald Williams, playing in place of injured Rodney Blunt,  ran for 183 yards and three touchdowns. Derrick Witherspoon, another freshman,  gained 123 yards and scored on an 81-yard run in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Maryland 13, North Carolina State 12 -- Dan DeArmas kicked a 25-yard field goal  with 11 seconds left to give the Terrapins an ACC victory at College Park, Md.  </P> <P> An interception by Fernandus Vinson -- the Wolfpack's fourth of the game --  gave N.C. State the ball with a 12-10 lead and only 1:27 left. But the  Wolfpack's Greg Manior fumbled and the Terrapins recovered at midfield and  drove to the winning field goal.  </P> <P> Maryland is 3-1 and 1-1; N.C. State 2-2 and 1-2.  </P> <P> South Carolina 35, Virginia Tech 24 -- Running back Mike Dingle scored four  touchdowns, two in the fourth quarter, and the Gamecocks came from behind to  defeat the Hokies in a nonconference game at Blacksburg, Va.  </P> <P> Quarterback Bobby Fuller completed 15 of 25 passes for 251 yards and two  touchdowns for South Carolina (3-0). Dingle had 137 yards in 33 carries.  </P> <P> Virginia Tech (2-2) had the ball and led, 24-13, with less than eight minutes  to play, but Fuller brought the Gamecocks back with an eight-yard touchdown  pass to Dingle, a two-point conversion pass to Robert Brooks and, after a  Virginia Tech fumble, a 26-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Miller to give South  Carolina the lead.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech 44, Tennessee Chattanooga 9 -- Sophomore quarterback Shawn Jones  ran for a touchdown, threw for another and set up two field goals with his  passing to lead the Yellow Jackets over the Division I-AA Moccasins at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech (2-0), with Jones completing 15 of 23 passes for a career-high 265  yards, has won eight consecutive games at home.  </P> <P> Memphis State 37, Central Florida 28 -- Keith Benton threw for 197 yards and  two touchdowns in leading the Tigers (1-1-1) over the Division I-AA Knights  (2-2).  </P></p>

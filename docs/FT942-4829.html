			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Customers ready to lay their accounts on the line: The growth of services available by phone from banks and other financial institutions BT's recent advertising campaign encouraging people to spend more time talking on the telephone will have sounded familiar to senior management in high street banks and in insurance companies. The growth in the range of telephone services offered by financial institutions, leading to calls that can take as long as a trip to the bank or a visit from a life insurance sales agent, has been rapid and is continuing. Just last month Direct Line, the telephone insurance company owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, indicated that it was considering launching a credit card. National &amp; Provincial building society has recently launched a telephone branch offering a full mortgage service, and Abbey National Direct, the first organisation to offer a telephone mortgage service, plans to expand services for current account customers later this year. After the success of First Direct, the telephone banking subsidiary of Midland Bank, all the leading banks and some larger building societies have now launched some form of telephone banking. 'People are much more ready to sort out their affairs on the telephone,' said Mr John Spence, London and south-east regional manager for Lloyds Bank. But First Direct remains the only stand-alone operation: the others are all complementary to the branches, and are intended to improve the service to customers by giving them another way of communicating with the bank. While routine business, such as changes to standing orders or obtaining personal loans, is now commonplace, most high street banks are still cautious about executing complex transactions by phone. Mr Malcolm Oliver, marketing director of Barclay Life, said: 'Some customers prefer to deal over the phone all the time - if they're asking for a loan, they find it easier to be turned down by a voice than turned down face-to-face.' He made an important distinction, however, between the day-to-day banking transactions with which customers now feel confident on the telephone and the detailed decision-making process involved in more complicated products. Predictably, First Direct is bullish that its customers are as comfortable dealing with mortgages and investment portfolios as with more straightforward products and services such as motor insurance. Among its self-selecting customer base this may be so, but it is not necessarily true elsewhere. Mr Charles Toner, managing director of Abbey National's retail division, underlined that customers need to feel confident in dealing on the telephone, when he pointed out that Abbey National Direct had hardly any first-time buyers among its customers. Alongside the growth in telephone mortgages is an increase in the range of financial products such as life policies, pensions and investments that can be bought by telephone. Apart from Abbey's telephone operation, which has experimented on a small scale with selling pensions, the drive in financial services products has come not so much from the banks as insurers. As Ms Sarah Deaves, senior manager with National Westminster Bank's remote banking development, admitted: 'It may well not be appropriate to do it over the phone. From September last year we have been experimenting with a financial adviser at Prime Line (NatWest's premium telephone service) but the process is quite cumbersome.' Insurers tend to have a greater incentive in this sector. Without a branch network to support, they see the opportunity to make the most of a low-cost distribution channel, and pass savings on to the customer. 'The whole life and pensions world is looking at reducing costs,' said Mr Alistair Milne, Prudential's managing director of direct marketing. 'There are opportunities with certain product lines to be able to look at differential pricing.' Mr Bill Jack, general manager of GA Life, has predicted that writing business over the telephone 'could even rival bancassurance' - the selling of life and investment products by banks and building societies through branch networks. At present, the emphasis is on term assurance, which many insurers believe can be segmented in a similar way to motor and household insurance, which have been successfully sold over the phone. But GA Life is among those already selling simple, single-premium investment products by phone, and over time the range is expected to increase. The rising regulatory standards for financial advice have not been a problem: no organisation would be so foolish as to neglect to record calls between customers and staff. Against such a background, the determinant for expansion will be customer comfort. 'The consumer ultimately will determine when the time is right,' said Mr Milne. On that basis, the end of the line for telephone banking and financial services is a long way away.</p>

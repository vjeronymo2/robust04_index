			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Charter slips to Pounds 37.1m CHARTER Consolidated, the industrial holding company in which Minorco, the investment vehicle of Anglo-American, holds 36 per cent, announced a slight fall in profits due to lower interest earnings. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 37.1m in the six months to September 30. A seasonal cash outflow, and lower interest rates, cut Charter's net interest receivable by Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 5.8m as net cash fell Pounds 20m to Pounds 122m. Turnover increased 4.3 per cent to Pounds 605.7m, helped by growth in the rail track equipment and building services divisions. Operating profits increased from Pounds 30.2m to Pounds 31.3m. Pandrol International, which makes rail fasteners and track maintenance equipment, recorded operating profits of Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 6.6m). Cape, the building products and services division, increased turnover 31 per cent to Pounds 127.9m but operating profits were unchanged at Pounds 6.4m. Mining equipment reported unchanged profits of Pounds 2m while quarrying and mining increased profits slightly to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.6m). Johnson Matthey, the metals company in which Charter owns 38.4 per cent, increased its contribution to Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 12.5m). Mr Nigel Robson, finance director, said capital expenditure increased from Pounds 9m to Pounds 11.9m. High average exchange rates, especially for the dollar, cost the company Pounds 175,000. There was an extraordinary profit of Pounds 1.4m on the write-back of prior-year provisions against an overseas investment, Mr Robson said. Earnings fell to 21.8p (22.4p). The interim dividend is maintained at 7p.</p>

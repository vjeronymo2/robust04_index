			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: A new perspective on rankings / A look at a revamped league table of M&amp;A advisers Quarterly league tables of mergers and acquisitions arouse as much scorn as fascination on the part of the financial advisers they measure. Investment banks - especially those disappointed with their standing - complain that all they provide is a snapshot, and a blurred one at that. A single deal can upturn the rankings and the criteria including a transaction can be arbitrary. Next week however Acquisitions Monthly, the leading compiler of M&amp;A data in the UK, will publish a league table less vulnerable to dispute. Covering public takeovers, both completed and failed, the report goes back nearly 10 years to the magazine's foundation in 1985. SG Warburg heads the list, putting recent losses on trading and disappointing interim results into perspective. Hoylake's abortive Pounds 13bn bid for BAT Industries in 1989 was the largest of Pounds 65.5bn of bids in which Warburg was involved. Morgan Grenfell and Schroders emerge as the other pre-eminent takeover advisers of the decade. Morgan Grenfell has had its downs: the Guinness affair damaged the firm's reputation, and this year has been quiet. But the house, owned by and growing closer to Deutsche Bank, has been adviser to one side or the other in more bids than any other: 226 to Warburg's 198. 'I think it absolutely demonstrates that we dealt with the Guinness situation and put it behind us,' said Mr Guy Dawson, a director of Morgan Grenfell. Goldman Sachs comes in as the highest placed US investment bank. UK competitors caution that Goldman achieved its position by taking mainly subsidiary roles in a few large deals. But the US house's speciality of bid defence has paid off. Rivals admit Goldman has made inroads and the firm is increasingly acting as lead adviser. Calculating the volume of deals is controversial enough, but Acquisitions Monthly has ventured into even more dangerous territory by producing figures on financial advisers' success rate in hostile bids. Few conclusions can be drawn, however, from what remain small samples. Nevertheless traditional reputations, Warburg's for defence and Morgan Grenfell's for attack, are borne out. Schroders and Goldman Sachs also stand out as effective defenders of hostile bid targets, with Schroders helping to fend off challenges in 59 per cent of the cases in which it was involved. Morgan Grenfell and NM Rothschild offset apparently worse than average records in defence with the strongest performances of the top 10 in advising aggressors. 'We have a very high hit rate,' said Mr Russell Edey, head of corporate finance at NM Rothschild. The pair's clients managed to take over target companies more than half of the time. Lazard Brothers, by contrast, is recorded as having won only two of 14 hostile bids on which it advised the aggressor. 'You have to be terribly careful about what constitutes success,' warned Mr John Dear, head of corporate finance. 'We are never afraid of advising a client that he should walk away rather than pay a silly price. The winner of a bid can turn out to be the loser in the long run.' That is just one of several flaws remarked upon in Acquisition Monthly's findings. One bid, that by Hoylake which failed, catapulted Warburg into first place. Most important perhaps, public takeover activity has declined since the 1980s and represents only a small part of investment banking. One banker damns the league table with faint praise: 'It is an interesting historical record.' As long as compilers produce M&amp;A league tables, investment bankers will gripe, no matter how broad the timespan. And they will continue to pore over them.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                FINANCIAL ADVISERS ON UK PUBLIC TAKEOVERS                     JANUARY 1985 - SEPTEMBER 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Adviser                     No of       No of       Total      Value                              bids     defences                Pounds m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SG Warburg (2*)               97          101         198      65,451 Morgan Grenfell (1)          122          104         226      55,903 Schroders (4)                104           81         185      51,395 Goldman Sachs (-)             12           20          32      43,904 Lazard Brothers (14)          75           53         128      39,163 Kleinwort Benson (3)          74          111         185      37,424 NM Rothschild (6)             69           59         128      26,919 Hambros Bank (10)             62           41         103      26,807 Lehman Brothers (-)            8           12          20      23,277 Samuel Montagu (11)           69           59         128      23,199  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * 1985 ranking.

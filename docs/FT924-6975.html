			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Maxwell raider in London REPRESENTATIVES of Mr Robert Bass, the corporate raider, turned up in London yesterday for talks with banks who are creditors of the late Mr Robert Maxwell. They are trying to persuade individual banks to consider an offer for the main Maxwell US interests - Official Airline Guides and Macmillan, the American publishing group. Some banks, apparently acting on the advice of administrators Arthur Andersen and their advisers JP Morgan, have refused to see them. But enough said yes to make the trip worthwhile. The group led by Keystone, formerly the Robert M Bass Group and Acadia Partners, another Bass vehicle and including Bain Capital, Bear, Streans and DLJ Merchant Banking has bid Dollars 725m (Pounds 480m) cash for the US businesses. When liabilities are included Keystone says the total value of their offer is Dollars 1.2bn. The administrators say they are looking for Dollars 700m-Dollars 1.1bn net of liabilities and that the Keystone approach is too far to the bottom range of their expectations. Because of this the administrators and their advisers say they are sticking to their stated policy of selling off OAG and floating Macmillan sometime next year. The Bass Group is now approaching individual banks to try to get what they regard as a proper hearing for their case - that their offer, which is close to being fully financed, represents value for assets they believe have deteriorated by as much as 20 per cent since the original targets were set. Above all the Keystone team want access to up to date information on the businesses so that they can carry out due diligence to see whether their valuation of OAG and Macmillan is realistic or whether there is room for further negotiation on price. Keystone is understood to be angry that it has been asked to bid more for the businesses while being denied information</p>

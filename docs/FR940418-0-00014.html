The O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area includes the following counties: Durham, Wake, and the Dutchville Township portion of Granville. Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed if sufficient data are available to warrant such changes. In this action, EPA is approving the State of North Carolina's submittal because it meets the maintenance plan and redesignation requirements. The approved maintenance plan will become a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Raleigh/Durham area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 15, 1993, in a letter from Patrick Tobin to Governor James Hunt, the EPA notified the State of North Carolina that the EPA had made a finding of failure to submit required programs for the nonattainment area. EPA's redesignation of the Raleigh/Durham area to attainment abrogates those requirements for this area. Therefore, the sanctions and federal implementation plan clocks begun by those findings are stopped at the time of the redesignation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule will be effective June 17, 1994, unless notice is received by May 18, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments.

(Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q.) Under section 107(d)(1), in conjunction with the Governor of North Carolina, EPA designated the Raleigh/Durham area as nonattainment because the area violated the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  standard during the period from 1987 through 1989. Furthermore, upon designation, the Raleigh/Durham area was classified as moderate under section 181(a)(1). (See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.334.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Raleigh/Durham area more recently has ambient monitoring data that show no violations of the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), during the period from 1989 through 1992. Therefore, in an effort to comply with the CAA and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on November 13, 1992, the State of North Carolina submitted for parallel processing an O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  maintenance SIP for the Raleigh/Durham area and requested redesignation of the area to attainment with respect to the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS. On January 13, 1993, the NCDEHNR submitted evidence that a public hearing was held on the maintenance plan and on July 8, 1993, the maintenance plan became State effective. In addition, there have been no violations reported for the 1993 O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 11, 1993, Region IV determined that the information received from the NCDEHNR constituted a complete redesignation request under the general completeness criteria of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V, sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, for purposes of determining what requirements are applicable for redesignation purposes, EPA believes it is necessary to identify when NCDEHNR first submitted a redesignation request that meets the completeness criteria. EPA noted in a previous policy memorandum that parallel processing requests for submittals under the CAA, including redesignation submittals, would not be determined complete. See the memorandum entitled ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Actions Submitted in Response to Clean Air Act (Act) Deadlines'' from John Calcagni to Air Programs Division Directors, Regions I&hyph;X, dated October 28, 1992 (Memorandum). The rationale for this conclusion was that the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria (40 CFR part 51, appendix V, section 2.3) was not intended to extend statutory due dates for mandatory submittals. (See Memorandum at 3&hyph;4.) However, since requests for redesignation are not mandatory submittals under the CAA, EPA believes that it must change its policy with respect to redesignation submittals to conform to the existing completeness criteria. Therefore, EPA believes, the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria may be applied to redesignation request submittals, at least until such time as the EPA decides to revise that exception. NCDEHNR submitted a redesignation request on November 13, 1992. In the November 13 submittal, NCDEHNR submitted the maintenance plan, thereby including the final element to make the November 13, 1992, request for parallel processing complete under the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria. When the maintenance plan became state effective on July 8, 1993, the State of North Carolina no longer needed parallel processing for the redesignation request and maintenance plan. Therefore, the EPA informed the State of North Carolina on August 11, 1993, that the redesignation request and maintenance plan submittals were complete under the general completeness criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The North Carolina redesignation request for the Raleigh/Durham area meets the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation to attainment. The following is a brief description of how the State of North Carolina has fulfilled each of these requirements. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kampala 7 Jun (PANA) -- President Yoweri Museveni of  Uganda has urged the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) to  accept a ceasefire and work toward power sharing. Addressing  newsmen in Kampala Monday [6 June], he said RPF has no capacity  to capture power and topple the current Rwandan Government  quickly.    Museveni was addressing the press for the first time after  his return Saturday from a 12-day working trip to the Nordic  countries. He said that a quick victory for the RPF which lacked  equipment, would be long and elusive. "Even if you win totally,  you would have to share power" said the Ugandan president, who  came to power in January 1986 after a gruelling five-year  guerrilla war. He said condemnation of the on-going genocide by  the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human  Rights Commission was a sound basis for the rebels to accept a  ceasefire. The latter would even help in having the  perpetrators of genocide tried.    "If RPF insists on fighting, I think they are making a  mistake in my view -- fighting has its own problems," added  Museveni, who has been accused by Rwanda of aiding the rebels.    Reacting to international suspicions that his government was  backing the RPF he said "if we armed them, it would be a  different story. Without equipment, RPF would never get a quick  victory. My advice was and is -- you don't have equipment and  the international community is willing to investigate -- why  don't you have a ceasefire instead of wasting our time."    Asked why there were numerous international delegations  jetting into Uganda in search of a solution to the Rwanda war,  the president said they had the wrong address. "The suspicion  about Uganda being the RPF's quartermasters, [words indistinct]  from the history of the Rwandan diaspora, because most of them  had been in Uganda and in the National Resistance Army (NRA).  The problem is they (international community) tend to have  stereotype perceptions" Museveni added. He said it was  ignorance on the part of the accusers to imagine the RPF or any  other force could never fight a war without being externally  aided with arms. He cited his NRA as an example. "I smuggled  arms through Rwanda without the knowledge of (the late Gen.  Habyarimana's government). He said fighting forces could secure  arms from several states without incumbent government knowing  about it. He said he had written to the UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali to stop involving Uganda in the crisis.</p>

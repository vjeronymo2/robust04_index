			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> CITY MAKES PUSH FOR CORPORATE CENTER  </P> <P> In an attempt to expand San Clemente's economy, the City Council plans to  encourage large companies to move their headquarters here.  </P> <P> At its last meeting, the council directed Community Development Director Jim  Holloway to lobby the Arvida Co. to establish a corporate center in the  proposed Tallega Valley development.  </P> <P> The company plans to build 5,000 homes, a business park and two golf courses on  2,200 acres on Avenida Pico, northeast of the downtown area.  </P> <P> City officials say the development is ideal for a corporate center.  </P> <P> "We in San Clemente have a lot to offer," Holloway said. "We have a great  environment, clean air, no traffic congestion, relatively cheap land and a  great quality of life."  </P> <P> Holloway said he plans to meet with Arvida officials to discuss the council's  suggestion.  </P> <P> Several years ago, the city hoped that the Rancho San Clemente business park  would be a magnet for major corporations, but the site has attracted only small  and mid-sized companies.  </P> <P> Councilman Thomas Lorch suggested that the city maintain large parcels of land  at Rancho San Clemente to attract businesses.  </P> <P> But officials voted 4 to 1 against imposing a halt on additional subdivisions.  </P> <P> "There are benefits for the company and the city," Holloway said. "Arvida can  enhance the value of its property and we can expand our tax base." DAVAN  MAHARAJ  </P></p>

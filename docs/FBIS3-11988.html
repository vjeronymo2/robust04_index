It is now U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Ron Brown's turn to comment on the issue. A source  linked to this newspaper reported that on 16 February Brown sent  Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas a letter  complaining about the difficulties U.S. companies had competing  in the Brazilian market.    The letters exchanged between Brown and Vargas do not cite  the names of the enterprises allegedly harmed, but one of the  minister's advisers pointed out that, among the largest ones,  the only one that does not have a manufacturing plant in Brazil  is AT&amp;T. He added that by not having plants in the country or  producing anything locally, AT&amp;T might be at a disadvantage  in  relation to competitors who are manufacturing their products in  Brazil such as Ericsson and NEC.    The Science and Technology Ministry source said: "No country  in the world has policies against industrialization." He said  that referring to the fact that in an official bidding between  two companies offering the same price, the company producing in  the country is always the one chosen.    On 23 March, the boards of U.S. AT&amp;T and its local  branch in  Brazil met former Communications Minister Hugo Napoleao (Liberal  Front Party-Piaui). Eduardo Calmon Costa, vice president and  director of governmental and institutional relations for Brazil,  said he had the opportunity to exchange ideas about  privatization and ways to increase competitiveness in the  telecommunications area.    In his letter dated 11 March, Vargas points out that "more  recently, AT&amp;T, Corning, Sprint, Hughes, Continental,  American  Note Bank (Thomas de la Rue), Motorola, and Texas Instruments,  just to cite a few, have been intensely supplying Brazil with  telecommunications equipment." The science and technology  minister said: "The Brazilian telecommunications sector is open  to foreign participation and everything depends only on the  companies' competitive skill.    In the area of informatics, IBM, Unisys, Allen-Bradley and  several other subsidiaries of U.S. companies have been  establishing themselves in Brazil in the last decades and been  benefiting from tax exemptions. U.S. telecommunications  companies should not have any difficulty in facing these fair  and modern rules, which are being complied with by an impressive  number of multinational companies specializing in the field."</p>

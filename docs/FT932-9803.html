			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: General Accident General Accident continues to defy those expecting it to launch a rights issue. First-quarter results showing a solvency margin of over 46 per cent, despite an 11 per cent increase in premium income on general business, leave plenty of room for further expansion. There are some technical factors behind the Pounds 71m swing in profits. Two successive preference share issues have allowed the company to pay down debt, helping reduce the interest charge by Pounds 8m. Last year's generous transfers to technical reserves have the indirect effect of boosting investment income. Marginally smaller transfers this year accentuated the improvement in the underwriting result. Still, the extent of the underwriting turnround came as a surprise, particularly in the UK which is almost breaking even. Since the first quarter is traditionally weak, one can now pencil in pre-tax profits in excess of Pounds 200m for the year as a whole. Coupled with the absence of a rights issue, this was enough to drive the shares 3 per cent higher. In its excitement, though, the market appears to have overlooked the limited room for dividend growth. Retained earnings in GA's balance sheet have fallen to just Pounds 44m at the end of last year from a peak of Pounds 660m in 1989. Despite this year's more optimistic outlook, the company will scarcely manage more than a token increase in the dividend without dipping in to reserves again. General Accident has not launched a rights issue like Royal and Commercial Union, but nor has it cut its dividend like GRE. Its reluctance to break what has become a habit of overpayment will limit its ability to rebuild its reserves in the recovery. Not a happy thought for a company which is trading at a hefty premium to book.</p>

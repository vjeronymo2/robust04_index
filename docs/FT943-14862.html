			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / RAI board named after coalition row The heads of Italy's two houses of parliament last night named a new five-member board of directors for Italy's state broadcasting organisation, the RAI, following a row over the appointments between the coalition partners in the right-wing government. The announcement was made by Mr Carlo Scognamiglio, the Senate speaker, and Ms Irene Pivetti, his counterpart in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. Ms Pivetti, a member of the populist Northern League - one of the coalition members - was instrumental in blocking the first board list presented. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, through last night's announcement, appears to have acted quickly to limit the damage from a dispute that had threatened his own authority. He had not wished to be seen making too many concessions to the individual interests of the coalition partners and, at Naples at the weekend, where he attended the Group of Seven summit, he refused the call for a special coalition meeting to discuss the RAI board. The new board members have apparently been chosen for their management flair and are representative of both the League and Forza Italia, another coalition member and the party of Mr Berlusconi. The five include Mr Ennio Presutti, head of the Assolombarda industrialists' association in Lombardy, academic Mr Franco Cardini, and Mr Mauro Miccio, head of Asca news agency. The list is completed by businessman Mr Alfio Marchini and Ms Letizia Brichetti Moratti, head of the insurance brokers' association. The dispute had centred on moves by Forza Italia, the League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, the third coalition partner, to ensure they all had their own nominees represented on the board of what continues to be Italy's most influential media network. This is a classic example of the fights to carve up influence in a state body which so discredited successive post-war governments and which Mr Berlusconi himself has sought to avoid. The one-year-old RAI board was forced to step down on June 30 following the government's threat to refuse to accept its financial reorganisation plan and emergency funding. The members, though installed as technicians, were considered too close to the previous governing parties. But the government had previously been critical of the RAI's bias against Mr Berlusconi.</p>

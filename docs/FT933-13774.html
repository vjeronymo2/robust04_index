			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Authorities urge 6.5% rise LOCAL authorities yesterday called for a 6.5 per cent rise in government grants for 1994-95. Their call followed the leak of a letter sent to the Treasury in May by Mr Michael Howard, the then environment secretary, which accepted a rise of only 3.5 per cent. According to Mr Howard, this could be 'lived with'. However, a joint submission by all five local authority associations - the associations of County Councils, District Councils, London Authorities and Metropolitan Authorities, and the London Boroughs Association - said that budgeted spending on services for 1993-94 was Pounds 42.6bn, 'well over' the settlement from government of Pounds 41.2bn. The associations said this level of spending was achieved 'by a substantial withdrawal from authorities' rapidly diminishing reserves'. It was also a real reduction of 0.3 per cent in the volume of services, after adjusting for changes in responsibilities. Spending would need to rise further because of new government measures, they said. The document also took issue with the government's planned extra expenditure of Pounds 700m on the care in the community programme, claiming Pounds 1.2bn was needed. It predicted that the shortfall could grow 'still wider' in later years. The associations meet Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, next Thursday.</p>

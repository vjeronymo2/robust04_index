Entrusted by Comrade Jiang Zemin and on behalf of the CPC  Central Committee, Li Ruihuan first extended Spring Festival  greetings to leaders of religious organization across the  country and to the broad religious masses.    At the discussion, Li Dezhu, deputy director of the United  Front Work Department, briefed those present on a national  seminar of leaders of religious organizations recently held in  Hainan. The main topic of the seminar was discussing how to  adapt religion to a socialist society. From the standpoint of  integrating theory with practice, participants in the seminar  profoundly discussed the historical inevitability and  feasibility of adapting religion to a socialist society and put  forward some constructive opinions and suggestions in this  regard.    At today's discussion, those who spoke on how to perform  religious work more effectively and how to adapt religion to a  socialist society included Zhao Puchu, vice chairman of the  CPPCC National Committee and president of the Buddhist  Association of China; Ding Guangxun, vice chairman of the CPPCC  National Committee, chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic  Movement Committee of Protestant Churches of China, and  president of the Christian Council of China; Zong Huaide,  chairman of the Chinese Catholic Bishops College and chairman of  the China Patriotic Catholic Association; An Shiwei, president  of the China Islamic Association; and Xie Zhongxin, vice  chairman of the China Taoist Association.    In his speech at the discussion, Li Ruihuan said: The  present situation is good in our country's religious work. In  the past year, party and government organizations and religious  administration departments at various levels have  conscientiously implemented the party's religious policy,  scoring remarkable achievements. Cooperating closely with the  party and government, religious circles have done a lot of work  in uniting the broad religious masses, promoting the building of  material and spiritual civilization, maintaining social  stability, advancing the reunification of the motherland, and  increasing exchanges with foreign countries.    Li Ruihuan said: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, people across  the country are establishing a new socialist market economic  structure. So our religious work is now facing a new situation.  Party and government departments at all levels should  profoundly study, accurately understand, and conscientiously  implement the party's religious policy, assist patriotic  religious organizations and personages in solving practical  difficulties and problems, and manage religious affairs  according to law. Religious circles should actively assist the  party and government in implementing the religious policy; unite  and guide the religious masses to participate in reform, opening  up, and the modernization drive; improve themselves by raising  their quality; and learn to find their appropriate positions and  bring their specific role into full play so as to adapt  themselves to the new, rigorously developing situation. Li  Ruihuan expressed the hope that religious work departments and  religious circles would make concerted efforts to strengthen  their ties, enhance their mutual understanding, and shape an  ever more harmonious relationship between them in order to do  religious work more efficiently.    Other leaders of religious organizations attending the  discussion included Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Jamyang Losang Jigme  Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, Ming yang, Dao shuren, Fu Yuantian, Li  Yuhang, Min Zhiting, Shen Xiaxi, Abudula Damaola, Wan Yaobin, A  Yiming, Jin luxian, Fu Tieshan, Luo Guanzong, and Shen Yifan.

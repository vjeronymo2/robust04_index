			<p>BFN     [Text] In their talks in Bucharest today Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres and PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, agreed to establish  and man three committees which will operate during the overlap  period between the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal and  the establishment of autonomy: a committee on routine security,  a committee on joint patrols, and a committee on the transfer of  administration powers.    Our correspondent Gid'on Kouts reports that Peres and  'Arafat  will meet again in an hour for the fourth time. They will then  decide whether they will meet in Cairo next weekend. The two  sides apparently set the first week of May as a target date for  the signing of the agreement.    In a speech before the economic forum in Bucharest Minister  Peres said that the peace process is irreversible. In his  speech, 'Arafat condemned acts of violence by both sides, saying  the PLO is committed to democracy and a market economy. He  again warned that if an agreement is not achieved, balkanization  of the Middle East is expected.    An agreement was achieved in the Paris economic talks  between  Israel and the PLO on free tourism traffic between Israel and  the autonomy. At the same time, our correspondent Yo'av Tocker  notes that the dispute on customs issues remains.</p>

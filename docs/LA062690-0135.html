			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> ESTANCIA HIGH POOL CLOSED FOR SUMMER  </P> <P> The Estancia High School swimming pool will not be open to the public this  summer because of a shortage of water-safety instructors, city officials said.  </P> <P> In addition to the shortage of instructors, the pool also experienced a  decrease in the number of people signing up for swim classes, said Costa Mesa  Aquatics Director Tom Edson.  </P> <P> "It's unfair, but our community is sort of divided between rich and poor,"  Edson said. "It's based on the mere fact that they have had one-third to  one-fourth of the enrollment we need to keep it open. They may have been unable  to afford the fees in the first place." The fees started at $30 for a two-week  class.  </P> <P> After deciding to close the pool to the public, Edson tried to keep it open for  a summer swimming team for children 11 through 14. However, too few children  showed up for the first practice.  </P> <P> A shortage of instructors has also led other Orange County cities to close  their pools and to reduce the number of class offerings.  </P> <P> City officials cite a number of reasons for the shortages, including low wages  and changes in Red Cross training requirements. (The Red Cross trains the  majority of the area's lifeguards and swimming teachers.) MARY ANNE PEREZ  </P></p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Observer: Quislings Hope that Alan Bowkett and his team at Berisford International, poised to take over the troubled Magnet business, are better prepared for today's shareholder meeting to agree the deal, than they were when quizzed last week. Observer hears that whilst Berisford's top team might be good at financial figuring, it is a bit short on general knowledge, judging by its performance at a corporate quiz night organised by headhunters Whitehead Mann last Thursday. Rather foolishly, Berisford fielded its top team of chief executive Alan Bowkett, Denis Mulhall, finance director, and company secretary, Barry O'Connor, rather than a bunch of unknowns from its personnel department. The Berisford big-wigs got into trouble early on when Bowkett (geography 'A' level with distinction) admitted that he had no idea of the length of the Amazon and his finance director confused miles with kilometres. After Bowkett had correctly identified a picture of Caernarvon Castle, only to be over-ruled by his company secretary, Berisford's position in bottom place was invincible.</p>

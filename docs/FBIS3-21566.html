The report "does not correspond to reality and is wishful  thinking of reporters," General Vitaliy Yakovlev told TASS on  Thursday commenting on a Wednesday report of the "SEGONYA" daily.    "No train with nuclear charges has departed from the  neighbouring country to Russia so far," he added, but expressed  hope that Ukraine's nuclear disarmament will begin soon.    Ukraine pledged to give up its nuclear weapons under an  agreement signed with Russia and the United States in Moscow in  January.    According to Yakovlev, there are nearly 2,000 nuclear  charges  in Ukraine at present. Their safety level causes great concern  of experts and delays in their transportation to Russia can  result in unpredictable consequences, he warned.    Russia guarantees to Ukraine safety of all work during  transportation and scrapping of the nuclear weapons, according  to the general.</p>

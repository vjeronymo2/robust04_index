			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Back in the hunt for acquisitions - Etienne Davignon, La Generale chairman, speaks to Andrew Hill After four years of retrenchment and cost-cutting, Societe Generale de Belgique may be back in the market for acquisitions. Yesterday, the group agreed to sell its 43 per cent stake in CBR, the Belgian cement company, to Heidelberger Zement of Germany for BFr22.5bn. This is not money which will be frittered away on small investments, or used as a cushion against economic bad times. Instead, Viscount Etienne Davignon, the group's ebullient pipe-smoking chairman, says he can now back up his well-known eloquence with hard cash, by giving subsidiaries - or the group itself - the ability to make large acquisitions. According to Mr Davignon, La Generale can fulfil what he always said was its ideal role: that of a professional investor, actively participating in the strategy of its portfolio companies. Much has changed since the early 1980s, when La Generale's lordly demands on its subsidiaries led to frequent grumbles from Brussels about autocratic or bureaucratic management by the 'Vielle Dame', ensconced in her Brussels headquarters. La Generale now claims it operates with a lighter touch - only 45 staff at the holding company are directly concerned with the surveillance of the subsidiaries. However, it is still a complex operation for outsiders to understand. La Generale, itself 61 per cent-owned by Compagnie Suez of France, has been weathering deep recession at the head of a portfolio of highly-cyclical stocks, including Union-Miniere, Arbed, and CBR. Between 1989 and 1992 net profits dropped from BFr20.1bn to BFr6.22bn, after extraordinary items. Suez, which rescued La Generale from the aggressive advances of Mr Carlo De Benedetti in 1988, was said to be disappointed, and keen for La Generale to dump some of its smokestack stocks. Many Belgian observers claimed the jewel in the country's economy had been sold to Paris. This suggestion that La Generale is not in charge of its own destiny particularly riles Mr Davignon, a former EC commissioner and one of Belgium's most prominent businessmen. Suez's relationship with La Generale, he says, is much less active than that of La Generale with its holdings. And he adds that the Belgian group would have started to reduce the impact of cyclical industrial stocks on its results, with or without the influence of Suez. Yesterday's sale of CBR was only the latest in a series of moves to cut La Generale's exposure to the cycles of heavy industry. This year alone, the group has reduced its stake in Union Miniere, the metals company, from 80 per cent to 75 per cent, and is looking to sell down to 50 per cent. The impact of the company's 25 per cent stake in Arbed, the Luxembourg steelmaker, has been completely eliminated from the results through a typically complex deal with the Luxembourg government. On the positive side, the group has increased its stake in Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, and is eyeing the possibility of bringing Accor, the French hotels and tourism group, into the consolidated accounts. Services companies seemed to have a stronger influence on yesterday's interim results. As Mr Gerard Mestrallet, chief executive, pointed out, for the first time in many years the group's operating results are edging in the opposite direction from those of Union Miniere - that is, upwards. At the same time, a services company - albeit an industrial one, electricity and gas utility Tractebel - has overtaken the metals group as La Generale's weightiest holding. However, many analysts believe the group has not yet answered the fundamental question: what is a holding company for in a turbulent international economy? Several brokers suggest investors seeking recovery stocks would be better advised to buy shares in the industrial companies themselves, rather than the lumbering giant which oversees them. La Generale's management is unapologetic. If nothing else, Mr Davignon says, the holding company provides the stability for those industries to grow. As Mr Mestrallet pointed out: 'We are not a unit trust, with a spread of minority participations. We're a diversified group with interests in services and industry.' Mr Davignon adds that La Generale provides the stability for those industries to grow. 'We have moved away from the parochialism of the past, when Generale's horizon was Belgium,' he said. 'But what we have kept is this idea that it's not stupid, not disgraceful to be more than a financial holding company which swaps its investments every time an opportunity comes up.'</p>

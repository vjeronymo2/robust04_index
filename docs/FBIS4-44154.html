			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 27 (AFP) -- One thousand Rwandan  orphans were evacuated from the village of Nyanza to the Burundi  border after renewed fighting in the region, a spokesman for the  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Monday [27  June].    The orphans who were taken by the ICRC to the border village  of Rilima had been tended by Belgian and Italian nuns.    ICRC spokesman Paul-Henri Morard said most children were  ethnic Tutsis.    Trucks which made the Nyanza trip also carried 250 patients  from a Nyanza hospital and 250 ICRC staff and local workers.    Since the weekend the ICRC has also evacuated 105 patients  from its overcrowded hospital in a government-controlled area of  the capital to the King Faisal hospital in a district held by  the rebels, according to Morard.    Five hundred wounded are still in the ICRC hospital.    French General Raymond Germanos meanwhile said in Paris  French troops would evacuate 40 nuns from the west Rwandan  village of Kibuye to the headquarters of the French intervention  force in Goma, Zaire, on Tuesday.    The nuns from Canada, Rwanda, the United States and other  countries were "highly afraid" after threats, he said.</p>

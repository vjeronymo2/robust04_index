			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Danger in safe havens: Quarrelling Kurdish parties must look to Iraqi democratsfor assistance The 'success' of Operation Provide Comfort, which established northern Iraq as a 'safe haven', off limits to Saddam Hussein's forces, has come to be taken for granted: the one clear demonstration that international force can be used to humanitarian effect, given a clear objective and the political will to pursue it. The Kurds of Iraq having been out of the headlines for some time, it is assumed that, with them at least, all must be well. Alas, not so. The latest news is that they have fallen out among themselves. Since early this month there has been fighting in many parts of Iraqi Kurdistan between the two main Kurdish parties: the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Massoud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by Jalal Talabani. The rivalry between these two parties is deep-seated, going back to the 1960s when the original KDP split because Mr Barzani's father, a charismatic tribal leader, quarrelled with the urban intellectuals, including Mr Talabani, who controlled the party structure. Broadly speaking, the Barzanis dominate the northern area along the Turkish border, and have had good relations with successive regimes in Iran, while Mr Talabani's followers are strongest in the southern area around Sulaimaniyya, and have tended to support fellow Kurds demanding autonomy in Iran and Turkey. The two groups' co-operation in holding elections in the safe haven in 1992, and in administering it on a 50:50 basis since then, has astonished those familiar with their earlier history. It began to unravel last winter when there was fierce fighting between the PUK and an Islamic group backed by Iran. Mr Barzani intervened to stop the fighting, and in the process quarrelled with Mr Jabar Farman, a PUK military leader who is defence minister in the nominally united administration. Since then Mr Barzani has been pressing for Mr Farman's resignation, and it appears Mr Farman may have been largely responsible for the escalation of what started on May 1 as a local vendetta about a piece of land into a general conflict between the two parties. They have now virtually partitioned the haven, forcibly closing down each other's offices in their respective territories. While the conflict is essentially intra-Kurdish, it has no doubt been exacerbated by the haven's isolation and its lack of clear political perspectives. The Iranian regime, always ambivalent about this experiment in democracy on its frontiers, is now openly hostile to it, and to the PUK in particular. Meanwhile the Turkish army is engaged in an all-out effort to stamp out the guerrillas of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) on their side of the frontier. Many civilians have fled from Turkey into Iraq, by the same mountain paths used by Iraqi Kurds to reach Turkey three years ago. At that time Mr Talabani established a good relationship with the then Turkish president, Turgut Ozal, and acted as unofficial mediator between him and the PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who lives in Lebanon under Syrian protection. In March last year Mr Ocalan declared a ceasefire, saying he wanted to convert the PKK into a non-violent political movement, working for Kurdish rights within Turkey. But after Ozal's death a month later the ceasefire soon broke down. Since then the violence in south-eastern Turkey has escalated, and the Turks suspect Mr Talabani's followers of helping the PKK. Last week the Turkish air force bombed a PKK camp 70 miles inside Iraq in an area controlled by Mr Talabani's party. Mr Talabani himself, meanwhile, is in Damascus, apparently unable or unwilling to pass through Turkey on his way back to Iraqi Kurdistan, where his presence is needed to impose discipline on his followers and restore a working relationship with Mr Barzani. The haven in northern Iraq is also isolated economically. It is blockaded by Saddam from the south and is subject to UN sanctions on the grounds that it is part of Iraq. By the same twisted logic Mr John Major, the British prime minister - who could claim to be the architect of the safe haven - explained in a recent letter to Lord Avebury, the Liberal peer, that it would be 'impossible' to station UN human rights monitors in northern Iraq 'without the permission of the Iraqi government'. To do so, he said, 'would call into question the territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq, as recognised by the United Nations'. Surely he should have thought of that in 1991 when he sent British troops into northern Iraq to secure the safe haven, but told them to stop at the 36th parallel. In so doing he helped create a de facto Kurdish state, but one whose leaders have had the wisdom not to declare independence. In inviting human rights monitors, whose brief would be to monitor the situation in Iraq as a whole, those leaders are reaffirming the haven as a liberated area of Iraq, not an independent state. And in this month's fighting it is the Iraqi National Congress (INC), based in Kurdistan but composed mainly of Arab opponents of Saddam from southern and central Iraq, which has been accepted as an honest broker by both Kurdish parties and has had some success in negotiating ceasefires. One good result of this sad episode is that Kurds have acquired respect for the INC and have seen that Arab Iraqis can play a constructive role, even in Kurdish affairs. The Kurdish parties, which both belong to the INC, should now place themselves formally under its authority, and the west should recognise it as the legitimate alternative to Saddam. From then on, sanctions should be applied only to the parts of Iraq which are still under Saddam's control.</p>

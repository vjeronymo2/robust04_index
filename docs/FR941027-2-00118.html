Pursuant to the reporting requirements under Articles 4.2 and 12 of the Convention, the United States has prepared and submitted the U.S. Climate Action Report (USCAR) in fulfillment of these requirements to the UNFCCC Secretariat. The USCAR provides a description of the current U.S. program designed to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The information presented in the USCAR, together with information provided by other Annex I Parties (developed country Parties and Parties with economies in transition to market economies), will be reviewed and discussed by the Parties to the UNFCCC beginning at the first session of the Conference of the Parties in early 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In keeping with international guidelines, the USCAR provides an inventory of current U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, estimates effects of current mitigation measures and policies on future emissions levels, and describes U.S. involvement in international programs including associated financial transfers and contributions. In addition, the USCAR includes a discussion of U.S. national circumstances which affect its vulnerability and responses to climate change. Information on adaptation programs and the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the largest climate change research program in the world, is also presented. While it briefly discusses the future direction of the U.S. effort, the USCAR does not seek to identify policies or measures additional to those described in the Climate Action Plan, announced by President Clinton and Vice President Gore on October 19, 1993, that might ultimately be taken as the United States continues to move forward in addressing climate change. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> In June 1992, at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the ``Earth Summit''), the United States signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The ultimate objective of this Convention is to: ``Achieve *&blank;*&blank;* stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food productions is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been predicted that human produced greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) will cause change in global average climate at a rate that could far exceed any natural change that has occurred in the last 10,000 years. Although there are uncertainties regarding the magnitude, timing and regional patterns of global climate change, any human-induced change that does occur is not likely to be reversed for decades_or even centuries_because of the long lifetimes of the greenhouse gases and the inertia of the climatic system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the UNFCCC's reporting requirements as specified in Articles 4.2 and 12, the United States has prepared the U.S. Climate Action Report (USCAR) and submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat. The USCAR represents the United States' first formal communication to the Secretariat under these Articles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

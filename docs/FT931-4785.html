			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Besnier sells cheese unit to banks BESNIER, the acquisitive French dairy group, has sold a 40 per cent stake in Sofil, the company through which it controls the Caves du Roquefort cheese concern, to three banks in a FFr700m capital-raising exercise. Sofil was formed last autumn as the vehicle with which Besnier, already one of the largest participants in the European cheese industry, bought a 57 per cent stake in Roquefort for FFr862m (Dollars 153.38m) from Nestle, the Swiss food group, following the latter's successful bid for Perrier mineral water. The Sofil stake in Roquefort has since been raised to 69.5 per cent (with 55 per cent of the voting rights). Sofil has also bought an 8.1 per cent holding in Bel, another leading French cheese producer, reportedly as a precursor to taking a larger investment. However, Besnier and Roquefort are heavily indebted. As a result, Besnier has ceded 40 per cent of Sofil in equal shares to three French banks - Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale - in a FFr700m to FFr800m capital increase. The deal should alleviate the financial pressure on Besnier, a private company run by Mr Michel Besnier, which expanded rapidly by acquisition in the 1980s and was burdened by net debt of FFr2.5bn before the Roquefort deal. Besnier is trying to address the operational difficulties at Roquefort which last month reported a net consolidated loss of FFr148m for 1992, against a pre-tax profit of FFr37.28m in 1991.</p>

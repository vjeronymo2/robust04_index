			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Fishing rights BRITAIN, in common with many nations, has too many fishermen chasing too few fish. Measures to curb overfishing are unavoidable, otherwise the sea will be progressively robbed of its wealth and the industry will lurch from crisis to crisis. This much is accepted by government and industry alike. But all schemes to curb overfishing are not equally good, as today's House of Commons agriculture committee's report makes clear. The committee urges the government to abandon a plan, which has already been suspended following a campaign by fishermen, to require trawlers to be tied up in port for half the year or more. Instead, a twin-track approach should be adopted, whereby fishermen would be bought out of the industry and fishing rights then sold to those who remained. This proposal has much to commend it. Although the government already has a Pounds 25m scheme to buy fishermen out and decommission their boats, the committee criticises it as half-hearted. A more generous approach would mean there was no need for fishermen to remain idle for half the year, while insurance and other fixed costs of maintaining boats mounted. Those bought out of the industry could seek productive employment elsewhere. The main drawback of paying fishermen to sell their boats is, of course, money. But this is where the committee's second proposal of selling fishermen individual transferable quotas (ITQs), specifying the amount of fish they were allowed to catch, could come in. The cash raised could pay for decommissioning costs. While fishermen would balk at having to pay for fishing rights which they previously received free, the pill would be sweetened if coated with a generous decommissioning scheme. It might also be less unpalatable than the government's tie-up plans. Introducing ITQs would have other benefits too. Because fishing rights could be traded, fishermen who needed bigger quotas would be able to buy them from those with spare capacity. Such a system, already successfully implemented in Australia and New Zealand, could also curb overfishing and boost incomes of those who remained in the industry. Critics of ITQs say they could not be introduced in the UK alone because of the European Community's common fisheries policy. But this ignores the fact that once the Community's annual fishing catch is divided between nations, each country is free to distribute quotas to its fishermen however it chooses. While it would be desirable if other European Community countries embraced ITQs as well, that is no reason for Britain holding back. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture secretary, should take note.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Fluctuations in the Japanese bond market this week will depend heavily on currency movements - especially the yen's strength. If the dollar stabilises against the yen due to the past week's heavy central bank intervention, profit-taking may hurt bond prices. However, the yen is unlikely to plunge and its continued strength, in the Y100 to Y105 range against the dollar, is expected to weigh on profits of corporations dependent on exports. 'The yen's firmness, continued economic weakness and sluggish inflation will continue to keep the bond market well underpinned,' says DKB International. If the yen appreciates further, hopes of a cut in the official discount rate, or at least an easing in short-term rates, will rise. The official view on the yen's strength is expected to be aired on Wednesday by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan. Asset allocation by domestic institutions, which have expressed caution over the increased risk in the stock market, is expected to provide support for the bond market. With concerns of oversupply due to increased municipal issues gradually receding, bond prices may receive a boost from such purchases. Meanwhile, traders say the bond market's upside is limited due to continued turmoil in US financial markets.</p>

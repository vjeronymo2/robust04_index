			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Chong Chol-kon and Yi Hun-pom: </F> "Left-Leaning Trend in Student and Labor Movements Causes  Worries"]    [Text] In addition to the recent investigation of core  members of the National Federation of University Student  Councils [Hanchongnyon], the prosecutor's office and police  began to investigate dissident and labor movements that are  carrying out procommunist acts benefiting the enemy. This being  the recent situation, the people are seriously worried about  left-leaning procommunist forces. These forces, who were held  back in the past, have become active recently. People pointed  out this is the result of relaxed anticommunist consciousness  and of failure to properly implement the functions of public  security organizations since the civilian government was  inaugurated. This paper carries an in-depth examination of the  true aspects of the "left-leaning procommunist forces" in our  society, as well as of the failure in public security functions.    As clearly elucidated by party Secretary Kim Chong-il in his  work, "Historic Experiences in Socialist Construction and Our  Party's General Line: Let us have a sense of confidence to  enter a new stage of socialist construction by firmly  maintaining the chuche cause expelling all challenges at home  and abroad." This article, which reminds one of a teaching of  the North Korean Workers' Party, was carried in a document of  the Hanchongnyon's Central Standing Committee last February.    Even though the entire student movement has been recently  weakened, the prosecutor office's and police have launched a  roundup of core members of Hanchongnyon because they accept  North Korean allegations without questions and because their  "ideological radicalism" has deepened.    Besides, this year the student movement has launched a  powerful offensive against the incumbent regime, unlike last  year. This worked as a factor that keyed up public security  authorities, whose main mission is to maintain public order and  stability of the system.    The 1994 document of Hanchongnyon's deputies defined the  incumbent regime as a "colonial regime with subordinative and a  comprador nature to the U.S. imperialists." Thus, public  security authorities observe that the degree of attack on the  present regime has strengthened remarkably compared to that in  the early stage of the civilian government.    It is a general view that such "ideological radicalism" of  the student movement has deepened since the collapse of Eastern  Europe.    So-called Marxism-Leninism believers and the chuche idea  faction [Chusapa]--two leading factions of the student movement  in the 1980's--have been unable to clearly explain the collapse  of the socialist camp with existing theories.    This being the case, the Marxist-Leninist camp developed a  "Trotsky faction," which inherited Trotsky's idea, Russia's  communist, on international communism, while Chusapa's  ideological dependence on Kim Il-song's chuche idea has been  deepened.    "The Revolutionary International Socialist Workers Union"  [Hyoksano]--a transformed Marxist-Leninist faction--was formed  in November 1992. Since Hyoksano was formed, it organized  regional committees in Seoul, Ulsan, Masan, and Changwon, and  branch chapters in Inchon and Anyang. Thus, it has a nationwide  organizational system.    Hyoksano even dispatched its members to the consultation  office for foreign workers located in Kurodong, Seoul, and  propagandized the idea of international communism to the illegal  foreign workers. Thus, Hyoksano is keenly interested in  international solidarity of socialist workers.    The prosecutor's office arrested 11 major class members of  Hyoksano in November 1993. However, the people view that the  forces of this organization, which has a deep and firm  foundation in labor circles, have not been completely eliminated.    In particular, the prosecutor's office revealed that North  Korean revolutionary songs, including "The Fatherland Is One,"  were among the songs sung by the workers of the "K" industrial  firm in Inchon during their strike, and 170 out of 366 leaflets  spread in industrial sites last year propagandized the socialist  revolutionary idea, going beyond the limit of the average  workers movement. Thus, the prosecutor's office believes that  left-leaning ideology is expanding.    Meanwhile, the Chusapa, which is leading the student  movement, maintains that the collapse of Eastern Europe is an  inevitable result of following Marxism-Leninism without  criticism, and to solve this problem, people should assume the  chuche idea as an ideological base.    "Let us decorate the anti-U.S. and antiwar struggle with  victory with indomitable spirit, and achieve the brilliant cause  of great national unity amid the fierce wind of a confederal  system."    This is the content of leaflets spread during the meeting of  unification forerunners in Suwon campus of Kyonghui University  last March. As shown in their leaflets, the students use the  exact same words as North Korea.    The result of the prosecutor's office investigation of  documents confiscated from Hanchongnyon's planning department  last April shows that the recordings of the "Voice of National  Salvation," North Korea's clandestine broadcasting network  directed at South Korea, numbered more than half of the total of  149, and that most of the leaflets they spread were  reproductions of North Korean allegations.    People also point out that animation of the movement of some  "left-leaning procommunist" forces is a result of the  curtailment of public security functions. Thus, the people call  for "early recovery" of public security functions.    It is true that the Agency for National Security Planning,  the prosecutor's office, the police, and other public  security-related agencies dealing with procommunist criminals,  were criticized as an advance guard for security of the regime  and as a means to suppress democratic movements under the  authoritarian governments in the past. The scale of these  organizations was also expanded according to the degree of  necessity for maintaining their political system.    However, since the civilian government was inaugurated, the  number of student movement organizations has decreased, and  dissident figures, who carried out antigovernment struggles,  have now joined the government, thus changing the atmosphere. As  a result, consciousness of the importance of public security has  been relatively weakened, and each public security office  reduced its staff or transferred its members to public welfare  and intelligence fields.    Public security-related officials candidly admit that  because  of this atmosphere, investigators in the anticommunist domain  almost suspended their operation until Hanchongnyon's  procommunist acts benefiting the enemy became an issue.    The number of criminals who were detained on charges of  violating the National Security Law was 449 in 1990; 320 in  1991, and 305 in 1992. However, as if to prove the  security-related officials' remarks, the number of criminals  drastically decreased to 122 in 1993 when the civilian  government was inaugurated. As of late May this year, 69 figures  are detained.    Reduction in the number of detainees reflects the gradual  disappearance of cases in which public security authorities  unreasonably applied laws and regulations, and curtailment of  the overall movement. On the other hand, this means that the  morale of anticommunist investigators declined because  security-related authorities were treated lightly and  accordingly, their investigations were passive.    The investigators complain that with the demoted position of  security-related offices, they can hardly carry out even  essential investigations.    A security-related official in the prosecutor's office said  that it is true that the past regimes abused public security to  maintain security of the regime, and carried out unreasonable  investigations. As a result, disputes over human rights  violations took place ceaselessly, and people held unfavorable  views about security- related authorities. However, since the  times have changed, consciousness of the authorities and people  should also change. Besides, support for security-related  offices should increase so public security functions can  actively cope with recent left-leaning procommunist movements.</p>

In Hawaii, the two  sides discussed ways and means of expanding bilateral economic  cooperation in the future. We also briefed the U.S. side on  Hainan's latest developments, gave an account of those projects  still awaiting foreign investment in Hainan, and expressed the  hope that U.S. entrepreneurs and businessmen will come and  invest in Hainan, thereby further expanding bilateral  cooperation.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] European Union [EU] Commissioner Jacques Delors has  sent another letter to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou asking  the Greek Government to raise the issue of the embargo against  The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] at the EU  Council of Ministers. According to Community observers, this  request indicates that the possibility of referring Greece to  the European Court has lost momentum. Correspondent Mairi Savva  reports from Brussels:    [Savva] EU Commission President Jacques Delors has sent  another letter to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou regarding  the FYROM. In his letter, Delors asks the Greek Government to  raise the issue of the economic embargo at the EU Council of  Foreign Ministers. Political observers in Brussels view this  move as another goodwill gesture from the Commission, which  right now does not want to lodge a complaint against Greece at  the European Court.    After the extraordinary Council of Ministers meeting ended,  Delors and Theodhoros Pangalos, the alternate foreign affairs  minister and EU president, gave a joint news conference.  Unfortunately, no agreement was reached on the major political  issue of how to make decisions after the EU expands. The  Commission and 10 member states favor an arithmetical adjustment  when decisions are made, with a special majority so as not to  make decisionmaking any more difficult. Britain and Spain have  strongly protested; and the European Parliament now may not  ratify the expansion if this is done according to the solution  proposed by these two countries. The issue will be discussed  next weekend during the informal EU Foreign Ministers meetings  in Ioannina, which will not deal exclusively with the great  political problems that concern the EU, such as the former  Yugoslavia and the situation in the Middle East.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Prague plods on towards a regulated stock market - Czech privatisation plans Czechoslovakia's progress towards an efficient and regulated stock market system remains painfully slow, in spite of the urgent pressures arising from the government's privatisation plans. Under the privatisation programme, an estimated Dollars 8.6bn of equity from some 2,000 enterprises will be distributed to the 8.5m Czechs and Slovaks who bought a voucher book for a small fee earlier this year. Voucher holders will start bidding for enterprises from Monday, and vouchers are expected to become tradeable shares in newly privatised enterprises by the end of this year. Much will depend on the speed of the complex bidding process, which includes five rounds during which over-subscribed enterprises will be re-offered to bidders for more investment points. Without the development of an efficient stock market trading system the privatisation programme could become paralysed. Two private stock exchange companies are to be set up, in Prague and Bratislava. These will be independent market institutions, interlinked by computers and supervised by the finance ministries in the Czech and Slovak republics. Shareholders for the Prague Stock Exchange will include Czech financial institutions. The law allows foreign banks to become shareholders but foreign participation is limited at 30 per cent of the stock exchange's capital. So far, the only foreign banks holding a stake in the future stock exchange company are Credit Suisse First Boston and Creditanstalt. However, five or six applications from other foreign banks are being processed, according to officials from the Prague Stock Exchange Association, According to Mr Petr Vyroubal, legal specialist at the association, 50 listed companies will first be traded on the exchange's first section, with 300 to 400 unlisted ones traded on a second section. The remaining newly privatised companies are likely to be traded on an OTC basis among banks. However, the federal ministry of finance has proposed that these shares be traded through the local computer offices which have monitored the registration of citizens' vouchers. The stock exchange will be equipped with the CAC trading system, received under French government aid. This has prompted some bankers to say that such state of the art technology could justify trading through the computer network directly and not on the physical exchange. Bankers have also expressed fears about the legal basis of Czech trading operations. A draft of a securities act has been awaiting parliamentary review for months. And also the relevant authorities have also not defined listing procedures.</p>

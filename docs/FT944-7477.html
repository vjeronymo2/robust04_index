			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire cuts 600 more jobs - Water utility to lose a quarter of its workforce as profits fall 10% Yorkshire Water yesterday announced plans to cut another 600 jobs. The latest cuts are in addition to the 400 redundancies announced four months ago, before the July price review. The news came as Yorkshire Water reported a 10 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits and the season's lowest percentage dividend rise so far for the sector. Mr Malcolm Batty, finance director, said he expected further job losses in future but could not yet quantify their scale or timing. Yorkshire, which in June announced 400 job losses for 1994, has decided to cut 100 more this year and another 500 over the next two years, accounting for about 25 per cent of the regulated utility workforce. Yorkshire's profits were depressed by the Pounds 25m charge to pay for the rationalisation. This is in addition to the Pounds 10m provision last year. It said it expected a two-year payback on the Pounds 35m provisions. Pre-tax profits for the half-year to September 30 fell from Pounds 74.8m to Pounds 67.2m. Sales were 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 275.4m (Pounds 259.4m). Profits were helped by a higher than expected reduction in the pipe maintenance charge from Pounds 35.4m to Pounds 23.4m. Cashflow was also enhanced by a substantial reduction in utility investment from Pounds 112m to Pounds 72m. Yorkshire, along with other water companies which have reported so far this season, also announced plans to devote extra funds to issues such as foul flooding and discoloured water, which were not allowed for in the price review. The company said it would devote Pounds 316m this year to such discretionary spending. The core utility business reported an 11 per cent decline in operating profits, after exceptionals, to Pounds 72.2m on sales 4 per cent ahead at Pounds 249.1m. The non-regulated activities contributed pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m against Pounds 900,000 last time. Yorkshire increased its interim payout by 9.2 per cent to 8.3p and said it intended to maintain dividend growth of at least 5 per cent above inflation for the next five years. This would be achieved without substantially eroding its dividend cover of about three times, the group said. Earnings fell as a result of the exceptionals from 36.1p to 31.9p. COMMENT The market's reaction to a better than expected payout and the promise of at least 5 per cent real dividend growth to 2000 might be seen as rather ungrateful. However, there is a perception that Yorkshire has been held back by fears that higher dividend growth would rekindle local controversy and further damage its battered public image. Financially, Yorkshire is one of the strongest water and sewerage companies and it could afford to increase the payout by substantially more. There is also the argument that dividend cover should be lower than the 3.4 times projected by analysts for the year 2000. Forecasts are for about Pounds 157m this year after exceptionals. The group's non-core success and strong financials make Yorkshire a solid hold, in spite of a yield just below the sector average.</p>

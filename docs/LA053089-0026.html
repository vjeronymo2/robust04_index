			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Controversial director and writer Charles Marowitz is expected to replace the  recently resigned Richard Stayton as theater critic at the Los Angeles  Herald-Examiner, beginning next week. Except for two previously contracted  directing jobs, Marowitz will suspend his work in the theater while serving as  the newspaper's critic, he said. A resident of Los Angeles since 1981, he is  best known locally for his work at Los Angeles Theatre Center and its  predecessor, Los Angeles Actors' Theatre; he resigned in March as the theater's  associate director in charge of dramaturgy and editor of its magazine Alarums  &amp; Excursions.

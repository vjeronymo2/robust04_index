			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Observer: Pilk's outsider When a company has to look outside for a new chief executive, it is usually an admission of failure. When the company in question is a world leader like Pilkington, it is doubly so. After more than 150 years in business, there is now only one Pilkington among the famous glass-maker's leading lights. And while Sir Antony Pilkington, the fifth generation of the family, is still chairman, he will almost certainly be the last of the line. Like many dynasties Pilkington has had trouble moving with the times and, despite boasting one of the best-connected boards of non-executive directors, its management team has long looked too inbred. Roger Leverton, the new chief executive, is an international manager rather than a glass man. Running RTZ's loss-making Indal business in North America, he knows all about cyclical industries. He seems to made a success of reshaping Indal's 28 subsidiaries and 8,000 staff in the depths of a recession far worse than in the UK. He also has the benefit of a marketing as distinct from a technical background. That said, he still has to work under an executive chairman who has dominated the company for more than a decade. Even though Leverton's title is group chief executive, the City will need a lot of convincing that his arrival at Pilkington means that there has been a significant change in the power structure.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Michael Prowse On America: Time to rethink US federalism On a recent trip to Oregon and California, I was prompted to think anew about a principle that seems to exercise many minds in Europe. In integrating the European Community, it is widely argued, political leaders should try not to violate the principle of subsidiarity. What this means in English is that decisions should be devolved to the lowest level of government capable of handling them. To what extent does the US honour this principle? And can Europe learn any lessons from the way the US divides responsibilities between Washington and the states? Historically, the US had a small federal government which mostly restricted itself to functions which could not be performed by individual states - such as national defence and foreign policy. It played little or no role in social policy. As recently as 1929, federal expenditure was less than 3 per cent of gross domestic product, or less than a third of state and local spending. In the past half century, two forces have disturbed this equilibrium. First, state governments were overwhelmed by the economic distress caused by the Great Depression. Led by Franklin Roosevelt, the federal government assumed an array of new duties including sole responsibility for social security (pensions) and joint responsibility for welfare and unemployment benefits. A second phase of federal expansion occurred in the 1960s partly out of a growing conviction that state governments were incompetent and unresponsive to social needs. Led by Lyndon Johnson, the federal government took sole responsibility for health care for the elderly, set up Medicaid, a joint federal/state health scheme for the indigent, and unleashed a flood of programmes to combat poverty, widen educational opportunities and enforce civil rights. Most of these interventions made sense at the time. But the justification for Washington's continuing role in so many spheres now seems doubtful. For one thing, the quality of state government has improved enormously. On my travels I was repeatedly struck by the competence and dedication of state officials. In Salem, Oregon, for example, Ms Jean Thorne, the articulate head of the Medicaid programme, is chaffing at the arbitrary rules and restrictions imposed from Washington. Under federal 'mandates' certain categories of the poor, such as families with young children, are entitled to the most expensive high-tech medicine while others, such as childless single women, qualify for nothing. A few blocks away, I found Mr Duncan Wyse sitting at a computer screen planning the state's economic development. Sporting an MBA from Stanford University, his role is to use business principles to improve the effectiveness of public policy. As director of the Oregon Progress Board, he has developed a series of precise economic and social targets known as 'benchmarks'. These are designed to provide concrete measures of the state's progress towards its longer-term strategic goals. If Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas were to win the presidential race, something akin to Oregon's benchmarks would probably be introduced on a national scale. The renaissance of state governments suggests a rethinking of their role is now overdue. (The Nixon and Reagan administrations made half-hearted attempts to transfer duties to the states but achieved relatively little.) One of the few analysts to come up with concrete proposals is Ms Alice Rivlin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. In 'Reviving the American Dream', published last month, she argues that America's poor performance in many fields reflects the blurring of state and federal responsibilities. She believes the states should assume full responsibility for what she calls the US's 'productivity agenda'. By this she means all the policies - from education, skills training, childcare, social services, industrial policy and the modernisation of infrastructure - that have a bearing on microeconomic productivity. The federal government should remain responsible for macroeconomic policy (where the priority is to raise national savings by cutting the deficit), pensions, and expand its role in health care. The notion that the states must take the lead in enhancing US productivity seems inherently plausible. The nation is so diverse that Washington-based officials inevitably lack the necessary detailed knowledge of local economic and social conditions. Ms Rivlin is also right to point out that states will need more robust sources of revenue if they are to undertake new responsibilities. Taking the fiscal arrangements of German Lander as a model, she argues for new national taxes shared on a per capita basis among the states. Translated into Eurospeak, the message is clear: in the past 50 years the US federal government ignored the importance of subsidiarity and took on many duties that might have been better left to individual states. If Ms Rivlin's programme were adopted, dozens of federal programmes could be profitably axed. She may, indeed, be too cautious: many states or consortia of states could quite easily assume full responsibility for managing health care. Whether Congress and the White House will ever agree to hand back functions (and revenue) to the states is, of course, doubtful.</p>

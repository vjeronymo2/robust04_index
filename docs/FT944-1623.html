			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (2): Raising efficiency is vital - Economic prospects The Czechs have managed better than most to shift from a command to a market economy while maintaining macro-economic stability through the transitional recession. The issue for next year and beyond is how far and how fast the owners and managers of the newly privatised enterprises and start-up companies can raise efficiency against a backdrop of resumed economic growth and rising foreign reserves and investment. The government likes to boast that 80 per cent of the economy will be in private hands once the second round of mass privatisation is concluded early next year. It exaggerates. The state retains majority stakes through the national property funds in what socialists used to call 'the commanding heights of the economy' - energy, steel, telecommunications and the like. What is more, the still indirectly state-controlled commercial banks themselves control hundreds of the newly privatised enterprises through their ownership of most of the top 10 investment funds which have sprung up over the past three years. The revamped state-owned banks still control about 80 per cent of banking business and have received large-scale state aid in order to clear their balance sheets of inherited bad debts. They still have to prove their efficiency as risk assessors and capital providers to private business. The banks insist that they have erected Chinese walls between their banking and fund management activities. Independent fund managers are not so sure that the state banks would be willing to take painful bankruptcy decisions, for example, if the net result was to expose their own bad loans to the company concerned. Economic policymakers also face some difficult decisions in the new year if they are to satisfy demands for clarity on the future tariff structures of public utilities. Last but not least, the recent inflow of foreign funds into the country also demands action if the Czech Republic is to maintain macro-economic stability and progress securely to single-digit inflation as desired in 1995. The government and the Czech National Bank have different views on how to profit from the capital inflows. The CNB would like to see faster progress towards full convertibility for the Koruna and argues that policy should concentrate on removing labour, housing and other physical bottlenecks to faster, investment-led growth. The government, which means the prime minister himself as the ultimate decision-maker, is more cautious. With elections due in mid-1996 at the latest, ministers fear the electoral fall-out from over-hasty moves to raise utility tariffs or radically reduce the security of tenants in low-cost apartments. Construction was the first sector to pick up, with a 20 per cent rebound in 1992 as the new owners of shops and apartments refurbished and modernised property restored to them as previous owners or bought at auction. But broader signs of an economic upturn appeared only in May this year, fuelled by rising industrial and construction activity and a surge in tourism and other service industries, including banking and finance. Gross domestic product is expected to expand by 2.5 per cent in 1994, after four years of declining output and incomes accompanied by far-reaching structural changes in the economy. Next year the CNB forecasts GDP growth of 3 to 4 per cent while Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister, told parliament in early December that the 1995 budget estimates were predicated on a 3.3 per cent rise. The pace of growth will depend partly on the performance of the German economy, and partly on how the government decides to use the capital inflows that are currently being absorbed by the CNB's open market operations and domestic bond issues. So far, most of the foreign capital inflows have been in the form of hard currency credits by overseas banks to Czech enterprises. The loans have been used to finance the purchase of capital equipment or for working capital, on terms cheaper than those available from Czech banks. The inflows are reflected in the Czech Republic's trade statistics, which show that import growth was much higher than the 13 per cent dollar increase in exports in 1994, leading to the virtual elimination of last year's trade surplus. With gross tourist revenues running at more than Dollars 1.5bn over the first nine months of 1994, the overall current account is expected to show a surplus of about Dollars 600m in 1994. But if the government opts for a strategy of investment-led growth next year, the most likely result would be a substantial trade deficit, although again the high rate of tourist and other invisible earnings should allow for a surge in imports without pushing the current account of the balance of payments into deficit. The government has agreed to consider higher energy prices from next year, but the proposed increases, averaging about 12 per cent, have not satisfied producers. CEZ, the electricity monopoly, says it will lose money on domestic customers even with the price rises. A test of the government's attitude to higher utility prices will come when it formulates a price structure for SPT Telecom, the national telecommunications company. The state is selling 27 per cent of SPT to a foreign investor and the new structure will have a crucial bearing on the price to be paid for the stake. The overall aim is to 'rebalance' prices, raising domestic call charges while lowering international charges, currently among the highest in the region. It is a delicate political and commercial balancing act. Despite the government's ceaseless free market rhetoric, it remains actively involved in big strategic investment and privatisation projects such as Skoda/VW and the choice of strategic partners for SPT and the petrochemical industry. Both telecoms and petrochemicals are billion-dollar projects that are designed to bring key industrial and service sectors up to international standards. That task is relatively easy and will follow well-trodden paths. The principal challenge in 1995 will be to raise the level of managerial skills and efficiency in thousands of privatised former state enterprises across the country. Where the strategic vision has succeeded is in ensuring that this is no longer a job for the government but for Mr Klaus's army of new shareholders, investment funds, managers and workers. They now hold the fate of most Czech enterprises in their own hands. Good corporate governance is the need now and will decide how the economy as a whole shapes up in preparation for full membership of the EU early next century.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE MAIN ECONOMIC INDICATORS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Unit     1990     1991     1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real industrial growth                   %     -1.2    -14.2     -6.6 Industrial production*/**                %     -3.5    -24.4    -10.6 Consumer prices**                        %      9.7     56.7     11.1 Unemployment rate***                     %      0.8      4.1      2.6 Convertible exports               USDlrs m    4,668    5,816    7,850 Convertible imports               USDlrs m    4,920    5,476    9,222 Convertible trade balance         USDlrs m     -252      340   -1,372 Convertible current account   balance                         USDlrs m     -127    1,186       53 Foreign direct investment***     USDlrs bn      0.3      0.8      1.8 Convertible external debt***     USDlrs bn        -        -      7.5 Official foreign exchange   reserves***                    USDlrs bn        -        -      0.8 Debt ratio                           Years        -        -      0.5 Interest service ratio                   %        -        -        5 Official gold reserves***         m ounces        -        -        - Exchange rate vs US   dollar***/****                       CZK     28.0     27.8     28.9  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         1993       1994        Latest  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real industrial growth                  -0.3        2.2     June-June Industrial production*/**               -5.3        1.2     July-July Consumer prices**                       20.8       10.2           Aug Unemployment rate***                     3.5        3.2           Aug Convertible exports                   10,006     10,200      Forecast Convertible imports                   10,504     11,100      Forecast Convertible trade balance               -498       -900      Forecast Convertible current account balance      279        637     June-June Foreign direct investment***             2.3        2.5          June Convertible external debt***             8.7        8.7         March Official foreign exchange reserves***    3.8        5.4          July Debt ratio                               0.3        0.4      Forecast Interest service ratio                     4          5      Forecast Official gold reserves***               1.95       1.95         March Exchange rate vs US dollar***/****      30.0       27.7         Nov 4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    * = Until 1991: companies with more than 100 employees.

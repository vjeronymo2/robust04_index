			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: Claims provisions hit earnings at Aetna Earnings at Aetna, the US insurance group, were hit by further additions to reserves to meet environmental claims during the third quarter, contributing to a 25 per cent fall in operating earnings. The Dollars 23m of extra reserves in the latest period come on top of a Dollars 64m charge to cover indemnity-related pollution costs taken during the previous quarter. The earlier provision had shocked investors, and prompted concern that big environmental-related liabilities might lie buried at other insurers as well. Hopes that a reform of the US Superfund environmental clean-up law would ease insurers' liabilities in this area have been dampened by the Clinton administration's failure to push through legislation in recent months. The addition to reserves announced yesterday, although causing less consternation than the second-quarter charge, contributed to a slight fall in Aetna's share price during the morning, against the background of a strongly rising stock market. Aetna's latest results were also held back by higher catastrophe insurance losses, as the company added further to its estimate of the cost of the Los Angeles earthquake at the beginning of the year. Catastrophe losses during the third quarter were Dollars 28m, Dollars 10m more than the third quarter of 1993. These factors, along with capital losses of Dollars 11m compared with gains of Dollars 13m a year ago, helped to mask an increase in underlying operating profits in the commercial property/casualty business, from Dollars 48m to Dollars 59. Personal property/casualty profits slipped on higher reinsurance costs. Aetna's health and life insurance business, along with financial services, posted profit gains, while it took net capital losses of Dollars 20m, compared with gains of Dollars 29m the year before. Overall net income of Dollars 129m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, was down from Dollars 226m, or Dollars 2.03 a share.</p>

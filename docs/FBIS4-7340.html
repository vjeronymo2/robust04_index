			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA)--The South Korean  authorities, ignoring the unanimous demand of people at home and  abroad, are persistently refusing to send back to the North Kim  In-so and Ham Se-hwan who spent long years in prison,  unconverted, after being taken prisoners during the war. This  comes under fire in papers here today.    The South Korean Red Cross, in a telephone message to the  North side on April 22, categorically refused their  repatriation, alleging that they were not prisoners of war, but  "offenders who killed innocent people" and they "acquired the  nationality of South Korea of their own accord."    A NODONG SINMUN analyst says:    This is nothing but a far-fetched argument aimed at evading  the responsibility for such criminal acts as unjustifiably  detaining and persecuting them and keeping them in South Korea.    As the South Korean authorities kept them in South Korea,  they had no other choice but to "acquire the nationality of  South Korea" to eke out existence. If they wanted to remain in  South Korea, why did they request the International Committee of  the Red Cross to cooperate in their repatriation?    Still more preposterous is the allegation of the South  Korean  Red Cross that they are "offenders who killed innocent people."  They were soldiers of the Korean People's Army and patriots who  fought against the aggression of outside forces and for the  peace and reunification of the country in the Fatherland  Liberation War.    Thd assertion of the South Korean Red Cross that they do not  fall under the category of the POW is a challenge to the  international law and humanitarian idea and a sophism  unacceptable to anyone.    The lonely old valetudinarian men with not many remain years  are now maintaining the barest existence with toilsome physical  labour. It is an humanitarian issue awaiting urgent solution to  send them back to the North where there are their home towns and  families and relatives.    If the South Korean Red Cross had a shred of national  conscience and respected the humanitarian idea, it must send  them back to the North at an early date in compliance with the  Korean armistice agreement and the international law on pows,  instead of obstructing their repatriation by raising  unreasonable conditions under the manipulation of the  authorities.    MINJU CHOSON says if the South Korean rulers persistently  evaded their responsibility, they will face a stern judgement by  the nation.</p>

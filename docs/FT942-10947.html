			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: The wealth protector - Roger Harris &amp; Company / 15th in a series on fee-based advisers Roger Harris is quite clear about his role as an independent financial adviser. He wants to help his clients solve their financial challenges, minimise their tax bills and maximise their investment returns. Above all else, he is there to help them protect their capital. 'That is paramount,' he says. Harris spent 15 years helping to build a broadly-based financial services group before he founded his Leicester-based firm, Roger Harris &amp; Company, in 1988. He set up as a sole trader 'in order to spend more time doing a better job'. He felt that his previous firm was trying too hard to be all things to all clients. As Harris explains: 'Because the majority of the business was commission-based, you always had to say, right, I've dealt with that client, now I must find another to sell products to. 'I was also convinced that the boom of the 1980s was coming to an end. It was fairly obvious that it was a peak of a cycle and I felt that our financial services group, which was surviving on commissions and mortgages, would suffer.' His solution was to specialise. He established a small financial planning practice, aimed mainly at high-earning and high net worth people. The firm has been fee-based since the start; any commissions received are placed against the client's account and deducted from the fees, all of which are time-based. Hourly rates have been reduced recently to Pounds 20-Pounds 90 because Harris cut his overheads when he moved his office out of Leicester's city centre. 'There is a cost for taking advice and there is also a cost for not taking advice,' Harris says. 'The sadness is that the majority of the investing public, quite rightly, could not justify paying our sort of fee.' His clients tend to live within 25 miles of Leicester and, collectively, his 25 largest have assets of Pounds 30m. But this evidence of wealth does not mean new clients are in control of their financial affairs. Some have arrived at his office with what Harris describes as 'a Marks and Spencer shopping bag with 20 years' accumulation of endowment policies and unit trusts which they bought because it seemed a good idea at the time. I get great pleasure from clearing through this paperwork.' This haphazard approach to investment is the antithesis of Harris's own philosophy. He finds that many new clients have bought nearly all their investments from off-the-page advertisements, mail shots, or from direct salesman. 'In no case have they ever been advised to sell an investment and secure a profit,' he says. 'I believe investment advice to sell is just as important, if not more so, than when to buy.' Harris feels investment management is the backbone of all financial planning, although he will not reveal the size of the client funds he has under management and says they are impossible to quantify. 'For instance, I have introduced millions of pounds to building society postal accounts. Do you include this?' He is no believer in buying investments for the long term. 'Investment is all about trends and cycles. Perfect investment is to buy lowish and sell highish. Talking about paper profits is a pointless exercise. It is not a profit until you sell it and put it on the table.' He is particularly critical of the way life assurance managed funds are presented to potential investors. 'I have never been able to understand why companies are allowed to refer to what is, effectively, a fairly static mixed fund as a 'managed' fund. I think the insurance industry is just misleading customers. 'The public expects there to be a manager, who is watching over funds daily and who will switch between different markets and sectors. A client close to retirement, who came to me recently, was horrifed to find that his substantial pension fund was in a managed fund that was 80 per cent exposed to the market.' Harris believes all investments need a pre-determined exit point. 'I put stop losses on every investment that is asset-backed. This way, there is a better chance that clients will not suffer if the next stock market fall is similar to October 1987 or, worse, to the collapse in 1974. 'My overall exit point now for anyone in UK equities is a Footsie index of 3,000. We have already sold a lot of investments because we had a stop loss on the Footsie at 3,200. So, the majority of clients are already out and sitting on cash. 'Certainly, this is the case with the Peps we manage on a discretionary basis. I think the only sensible Pep is the one you can move into cash. And although we have done very well on zeros over the past couple of years, we are very close to stop losses at the moment.' Harris uses his first meeting with a prospective client to 'interrogate and find out exactly what they want to achieve'. This results in a detailed financial planning report, updated annually. He considers empathy with clients to be crucial and says: 'Clients will telephone me as their first port of call when they have a query on financial matters, so there must be trust. If I think there isn't any chemistry at the first meeting, I would rather say there and then that this isn't going to work.' Harris, who admits to being 'a bit of a loner', adds: 'I suspect the majority of financial advisers obtain a lot of their views from seminars run by unit trust groups. I don't have a very high opinion of the industry. It's going to be a long time before this is a true profession.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              THE INDEPENDENTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Name of financial adviser:          Roger Harris &amp; Company Address of head office:             Launde House,                                     Harborough road,                                     Oadby, Leicester LE2 4LE Date firm was established:          1988 Regulator:                          Fimbra Funds under management:             Not disclosed Number of clients:                  100 Number of offices:                  One Minimum investment accepted:        No minimum Services offered:                   Comprehensive personal financial                                     planning and investment advice Fees:                               Pounds 20 - Pounds 90 and hour  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

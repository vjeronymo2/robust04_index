			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Recovery boosts Dawsongroup Dawsongroup, the truck and trailer rental company, yesterday revealed a 41 per cent increase in interim profits, as economic recovery was translated into significantly higher utilisation rates for its fleet. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 5.02m for the six months to June 30, up from Pounds 3.55m, on turnover ahead 14 per cent to Pounds 28.2m (Pounds 24.8m), reflecting the high proportion of fixed costs which means that additional sales feed more directly into profits. Profits from rentals increased by 46 per cent to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 3.36m), as utilisation of the truck fleet rose from 72 per cent to 87 per cent, and average rates were pushed up by 4 per cent. Trailer utilisation rose from 81 per cent to 84 per cent, and rates increased by 6 per cent. There was also an Pounds 825,000 profit from the sale of used vehicles, although management said such sales would slow in the second half. The company's performance was skewed towards short-term leasing contracts, but it is increasing emphasis on contract hire (of one year or longer) to improve earnings stability. Commercial sales, primarily from the Volvo truck dealership, contributed a reduced profit of Pounds 124,000 (Pounds 191,000), but the comparable figure included used vehicle proceeds. On a like-for-like basis, profits were up 19 per cent. Gearing at the interim stage stood at 118 per cent. However, capital spending will more than double to Pounds 26m in the second half. The group has just completed its first acquisition, in the form of the Pounds 5.26m (including debt repayment) purchase of Morgan Varylease, a vehicle and trailer rental company. Gearing is expected to rise to about 170 per cent by the year end. Further investment may come in Europe, where expansion opportunities are being sought. Earnings per share were 10.8p (7.7p). An interim dividend of 1.8p (1.5p) is declared. COMMENT Vehicle leasing is a business where success depends upon the management and its control structures, and Dawsongroup has demonstrated a solid formula. It has a substantial fleet with an average truck age of only 20 months, and has successfully expanded product lines. It also boasts the rarity of never suffering overall losses from asset disposals. High operational gearing and solid management justify a premium p/e of 17.5, based on a 1994 profits forecast of Pounds 10m; but there appears to be little more to go for in the short-term.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 24 May (TANJUG) -- A delegation of the  republic of Srpska -- made up of Momcilo Krajisnik, president of  the republic of Srpska people's assembly, and foreign minister  Aleksa Buha -- left for Geneva today where a meeting between the  contact group and the cochairmen of the conference on the former  Yugoslavia, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, is being held.    The republic of Srpska's press office has announced that the  delegation is to present to representatives of the international  community and cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg the Serb side's  stance on the possible resumption of the peace talks, stressing  the establishment of a lasting cease-fire in all parts of that  former Yugoslav republic and the equal treatment of all sides in  the conflict. This is in line with the conclusions of the  republic of Srpska assembly adopted at a recent session in Brcko.    The Serbian side will warn of the Muslim offensive that has  been going on with unabated intensity, and will insist that the  unfair and inadequate behavior of the Muslim side hampers any  resumption of talks, a statement says. The republic of Srpska's  delegation is expected to take part in consultative meetings  with important personalities from the international community  who are interested in the speedy creation of conditions  necessary for the resumption of talks.    Immediately before departure, Krajisnik said that there were  considerable problems in creating conditions for the resumption  of talks. The statement stresses that the contact group for  Bosnia-Herzegovina has ignored the solving of these problems,  underestimating their importance.</p>

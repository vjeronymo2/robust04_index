			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc output forecast to fall 1.1% in 1992 EUROPE WILL continue to bear the brunt of cuts in production capacity caused by present low zinc prices, a report from the Metal Bulletin Research organisation suggests. This year concentrate production is likely to cease at Outokumpu's Vihanti smelter in Finland, Metallgesselschaft's Meggen smelter in Germany and the Rubiales smelter owned by Exminesa in Spain. More closures can be expected in 1993, the report adds. In 1993, however, Asturiana de Zinc's San Juan de Nieva smelter will eventually help to restore world-wide cuts in refined zinc production. Closures already announced include those by Cominco in Canada and Ruhrzink in Germany as well as Vieille Montagne's Overpelt plant in the Netherlands and the temporary shutdown of Nouva Samin's Crontone plant in Spain. These will 'more than outweigh the modest additions to capacity scheduled to come on stream this year,' says Metal Bulletin Research. Analysts Ms Rosalind Stewart and Mr Neil Buxton forecast a 1.1 per cent fall in refined zinc output this year to 5.24m tonnes and then a 2.4 per cent increase in 1993 to 5.365m tonnes. They suggest the zinc market was oversupplied by 185,000 tonnes last year, the largest surplus since the mid-1970s. In 1992 the surplus is forecast to fall to 46,000 tonnes which would leave stocks at the end of this year at 700,000 tonnes, or 6.9 weeks of consumption - the highest since 1984. In 1993 stocks should be cut by a supply deficit of 145,000 tonnes. The report suggests there is little room for zinc prices to fall far - a move below Dollars 1,000 a tonne would probably prompt more output cuts - and there should be rallies towards Dollars 1,400. For 1992 the report expects cash zinc prices to average Dollars 1,200 a tonne. Next year's average predicted to be Dollars 1,450 a tonne, with prices ranging between Dollars 1,250 and Dollars 1,650.  ---------------------------------------------------------            LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium          +4,325    to    1,119,375 Copper                +25    to      302,750 Lead               +1,725    to      134,825 Nickel               +918    to       22,350 Zinc               +3,050    to      206,300 Tin                  +195    to       12,615  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKINHEADS WHO TRY TO DO RIGHT THING;  </P> <P> NOT ALL YOUTHS SPORTING CLOSE-CROPPED HAIR AND WEARING COMBAT BOOTS ARE  NEO-NAZI THUGS, AND SOME ARE EVEN ORGANIZING TO CLEAN UP THEIR RACIST, VIOLENT  IMAGE.  </P> <P> Subdued in a manner belying their image, about 50 "skinheads" gathered at a San  Fernando Valley park on a recent Saturday to listen in respectful silence to  the words of one of their leaders.  </P> <P> "Wear your (identity) with pride," said Todd Schwartz, glancing at his yellow  armband. "You got to know who and what you are."  </P> <P> Meet the self-described anti-racist skinheads, a breed apart from the  better-known, hard-core variety. While they share many of the same interests of  other skinheads, they also claim to pursue racial harmony and pacifism.  </P> <P> Indeed, certain elements of these youths' appearances made them readily  identifiable as partisans of the youth subculture whose name of late has become  almost synonymous with neo-Nazism. Nearly all of the boys and many of the girls  sported short-cropped hair. Most wore combat boots. Many wore odd-colored  suspenders.  </P> <P> But scattered among what has come to be widely regarded as such easily  recognizable symbols of defiance were some surprises as well. More than a third  of the youths in the park were black, Latino or Asian. And they sported yellow  armbands marked with the letters SHARP, an acronym for Skinheads Against Racial  Prejudice.  </P> <P> "Real skinheads aren't racist," said Iby Miranda, 16, a dark-skinned Latino  high school student who favors short hair and black army boots. "Those who are  are just bald punks."  </P> <P> Amid the barrage of media coverage depicting skinheads as neo-Nazi thugs, this  new voice is quietly attempting to gather strength.  </P> <P> Members of these groups claim there are hundreds of anti-racist skinheads in  Southern California. To make their points they are meeting in parks, picketing  at concerts, distributing leaflets, recruiting members, holding rallies,  publishing newsletters and generally conducting an aggressive grass-roots  public relations campaign to get the word out that not all skinheads are  racist.  </P> <P> "We're providing the kids with an alternative," said Schwartz, 21.  </P> <P> A U.S. Marine with the rank of lance corporal based at Camp Pendleton, Schwartz  -- who is Jewish -- is the West Coast coordinator of SHARP, one of the largest  and most visible of the loosely organized skinhead groups that call themselves  "two-tone" to describe their racially integrated membership. Other such groups  spotted in Southern California, police say, have included United Skins, the  Mickey Mouse Club, the Mods, West Coast Front, Brotherhood Skins, Mad Skins and  Anti-Racist Action.  </P> <P> "The Nazis offered them a group," Schwartz said, "now we're offering them a  group on the other side."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Roots in '60s England  </P> <P> The association between skinheads and racist sentiments goes back at least 20  years to the British working-class neighborhoods in which the gangs of mostly  white youth first began appearing. One of their favorite activities back then  was beating up on Third World immigrants.  </P> <P> Except for a general identification with the white working class, however, the  violence never seemed attached to any particular ideology. That began changing  a few years ago when American skinheads started mingling with organized  neo-Nazi groups. And indeed, in the last three years law enforcement officials  in 24 states have reported violent attacks by hard-core skinheads, whose number  they estimate at about 3,500 nationwide.  </P> <P> But two-tone skinheads say they are getting a bum rap. The vast majority of  skinheads, Schwartz and others insist, are not neo-Nazi sympathizers at all.  </P> <P> Largely nonviolent, these young people simply consider themselves  nonconformists and embody a sort of ethic of individualism, they say. By  focusing on the neo-Nazi skinheads, Schwartz said, the media have made life  precarious for the others, many of whom have become the unwitting objects of  ridicule and hostility that occasionally erupt into attacks on the skinheads.  </P> <P> One ordinarily quiet Long Beach neighborhood, for instance, has been plagued  all summer by violent altercations that local skinheads claim are provoked by  more conservatively dressed youths ranging from surfers to preppies. The  teen-age vigilantes, the skinheads said, attack them, wrongly assuming that  they are Nazi sympathizers.  </P> <P> Such anti-racist claims are finding the support of a Southern California  psychologist who studied skinheads after counseling some of them for doing  poorly in school. After conducting random interviews with more than 150  skinheads over several months at public gatherings in San Francisco, Boston and  Los Angeles, psychologist Robert Butterworth said he found fewer than 10% who  seemed to hold white supremacist views.  </P> <P> "I got the sense that they are very angry toward the media," said Butterworth,  who has offices in Downey and Los Angeles. "They feel that nobody is listening  to their side."  </P> <P> Many of them are simply young people who have a tremendous need to identify  with their peers during the transition from childhood to independence,  Butterworth said. "We are making them more dangerous than they really are," he  said. "They have a hard edge, but I don't see them as hard on the inside."  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials say they haven't yet seen any evidence of the  "softer" side of skinheads. "The only skinheads who come to our attention are  the ones that are (racist)," said Detective Michael Brandt, hate-crime  coordinator for the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division.  </P> <P> After outgrowing the private San Fernando Valley garage in which it began  meeting a year ago, SHARP -- whose meetings have reportedly been attended by as  many as 200 youths -- recently moved its "headquarters" outdoors to the nearby  park. Although the majority of members are male, there are also a significant  number of female members who play equally active roles.  </P> <P> Schwartz estimates national membership at about 2,000, including 500 in seven  California chapters. About 40% of the membership, he said, consists of  skinheads who are members of racial and ethnic minorities.  </P> <P> But firm numbers are elusive, Schwartz admits, because the organization -- like  the life style it represents -- remains unstructured.  </P> <P> "It's all informal networking," said Schwartz, adding that meetings are  announced by word of mouth and activities financed by special collections.  "SHARP is more of a belief than an organization."  </P> <P> While that belief officially shuns violence, many SHARP members say they will  fight back against attackers. "We're passive aggressors," Miranda explained.  "We won't go out and commit a violent act, but we will defend ourselves."  </P> <P> That seemed evident in May when the group picketed an appearance at The Country  Club -- a Reseda concert hall -- by the Cro-Mags, a band known to attract Nazi  skinheads. Supported by a large crowd, some SHARP members got involved in a  series of scuffles that drew coverage by several local television stations. And  a protest at the Glendale Masonic Lodge resulted in cancellation of part of a  conservative Bible study conference that the protesters considered racist.  </P> <P> The atmosphere during the recent meeting in the park, however, was decidedly  nonviolent. Conducted by Schwartz and Greg Lee, a black Granada Hills high  school student who oversees the Los Angeles/Valley chapter, the meeting  included the announcement of a proposed anti-graffiti project, discussion of an  upcoming camp-out at Lake Elsinore and an impromptu birthday party for  Schwartz.  </P> <P> Afterward the young skinheads, reveling in their camaraderie through a  childlike game of tag, spoke of the dilemma they face.  </P> <P> "I believe in this," said Paula Lazear, 15, a Reseda high school student of  Filipino and French descent. "We're getting screwed both ways. We're getting  jumped by 'white power' and jumped by people who think that we're 'white  power.' "  </P> <P> Dan Jones, a 20-year-old Marine from Camp Pendleton, boiled his philosophy down  to a simple equation. "Skinheads are pro-American," he said. "Nazis don't  support America."  </P></p>

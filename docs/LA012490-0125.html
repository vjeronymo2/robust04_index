			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> POLLUTION MARS SUNNY BEACH DAY  </P> <P> Though tempted by the high waves and sunny skies, sunbathers and surfers stayed  out of the ocean and on their towels Tuesday as contaminated waters washed  before them.  </P> <P> Dotting the water's edge were red-and-white signs: "Warning. Keep Out.  Contaminated Water. By Order of the Health Officer, County of Orange."  </P> <P> A four-mile stretch of beach between Newport Pier and Huntington Beach at Beach  Boulevard remained closed after a sewage spill last week at a regional  treatment plant in Fountain Valley prompted health authorities to quarantine  the waters. The sewage spilled into storm drains leading to the Santa Ana  River, and flowed into the ocean.  </P> <P> "We expect to see most of the area opened by Wednesday afternoon," said Mike  Wehner, chief of the Orange County environmental health water quality program.  "It depends on the sample results. We are now waiting for results from tests  taken Monday."  </P> <P> Swimmers who come in contact with the bacteria-laden waters risk catching  hepatitis or contacting a skin rash, depending on their length of exposure and  the bacterial concentration, Wehner said. A more typical illness,  gastroenteritis, which includes symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and nausea, can  result if a person swallows the water, he added.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, two toddlers ran bare-footed through the waters at Huntington  Beach. Their parents, who asked not to be named, said, "We figure as long as  they don't drink the water we can always wash off their feet."  </P> <P> Even with the contaminated water, sunny skies and temperatures in the 70s  brought people to the beaches. Similar weather is expected today.  </P> <P> "The signs scare me away from the water, but not from the beach," said Teri  Benner of Costa Mesa, as she took pictures of two friends posing on the rocks  at Newport Beach.  </P> <P> She was concerned that there were not enough signs warning of the  contamination. "People might not have seen them and entered the water." The  signs are posted about every 200 yards.  </P> <P> A couple, Kathy and Bill Kellog, strolled along the beach picking up sea shells  Tuesday morning. Kathy Kellog said, "I worry about the fish and other sea  creatures more than humans going out there and swimming. The poor things have  to live in this filth.  </P> <P> "Humans fouled the water, not the fishes," she said.  </P> <P> Others were disappointed that the sewage spill cost them a good day of surfing.  </P> <P> Heavy surf pumping in from the northwest reached 6 feet at many beaches, the  National Weather Service said.

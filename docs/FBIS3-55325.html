Bill and Hillary Clinton are  driving down a country road. They stop to fill up. "Hey," says  Hillary, looking at the pump attendant, "I know that guy....  He's someone I used to date at school." "So if you'd married  him," Bill replies, "you'd be filling someone's car up now too."  "No," Hillary objects confidently, "that guy'd be president."    There are not very many people in the United States who  would  argue that without Hillary, without her ambition, without her  fierce self-discipline, and without her brilliant political  instinct enabling her to recognize not so much current as future  enemies and friends -- without all this Bill would most probably  have remained a provincial politician, even if he had managed to  make it to Washington by becoming, for instance, senator for his  native Arkansas.    It is said -- and this is the truth, not a joke -- that  Clinton's daughter Chelsea phoned the White House from her  Washington school to check with her parents on whether  "America's first child" was allowed to have some injections.  They went straight to the President, as Chelsea had  recommended, citing the fact that "Mommy's always busy, so it's  better to ask Daddy."    But both Bill and Hillary are workaholics able to work late  into the night and start again early next morning. I would note  that in this sense Washington is a rather strange town. Press  conferences starting at seven or seven-thirty are a tradition  here rather than a rarity.    It is hard to be U.S. President without being a workaholic  --  although it is possible. One need only recall Ronald Reagan,  one of the most successful presidents of this century --  successful in the sense that he fundamentally carried out, and  even exceeded, his agenda which, I would recall, combined a  policy of exhausting and shaking up the Soviet empire while  simultaneously building up America's prosperity. But this same  Reagan had a truly legendary capacity to snooze through Cabinet  sessions and limit his working day to four or, at most, five  hours of normal presidential activity, devoting the rest of his  time to pleasant pursuits such as riding or talking with his  wife Nancy.    But Reagan had a surprising ability -- he was excellent at  delegating. This ability is almost an art -- few politicians or  statesmen have it. Those who do almost always win -- they can  focus seriously and thoroughly on the main, strategic, long-term  issues, while letting their ministers, advisers, and other  clerks handle the details.    One of Bill Clinton's problems, which was evident almost as  soon as he became President, is his insatiable need to decide a  lot -- if not everything -- himself. Which, incidentally, was a  characteristic of one of Clinton's predecessors -- the  Democratic President Jimmy Carter. He himself decided which of  his advisers and aides would play at what times and how often on  the White House tennis courts. Any independence for the clerks  was completely ruled out.    Carter often lost sight of what was important in a mass of  trivia. Not for nothing is his presidency (while undoubtedly  burdened by objective factors such as the very serious world  energy crisis) considered one of the weakest in America's recent  history -- symbolized by the crushing and tragic failure of the  attempt to free the American hostages held in revolutionary  Iran. Carter took part at first hand in the job of working out  the rescue mission -- which required excellent military  knowledge -- often "knocking down" the opinions of genuine  specialists.    Clinton too plunged into the job straight after the day in  1992 when the presidential election left him victorious over his  rival -- the Republican George Bush. Bill took on everything,  quite forgetting that he was no longer governor of Arkansas but  the president of a superpower where the budget for military  bands is more than some other countries' state budgets.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Mexico vulnerable to shifts in Nafta talks - Economic woes also persist If you like to gamble,' says Mr Felix Boni, head of research at the Mexican brokerage, Interacciones, 'gamble that there will be a North American Free Trade Agreement by January, and buy Mexican stocks.' Mr Boni sums up the driving force behind the equity market: with Nafta in trouble for much of this year, the market has drifted from 1,759 at the beginning of January to 1,710.65 at the close yesterday. Occasional good news on Nafta has sent the market up, only for it to fall again on some unexpected bad news. The last two weeks have been no different. Ten days ago, the market fell by nearly 2 per cent in a few hours as a US federal judge ordered the Clinton administration to conduct a lengthy study of Nafta's environmental impact, potentially delaying the treaty to next year, or even derailing it. But this week the bolsa has surged, partly as investors reckoned that last week's pessimism over Nafta had been overdone. Salomon Brothers, for instance, argues that last week's ruling by the judge will be repealed, or ignored, and that negotiations on parallel agreements on labour and the environment will be wrapped up by the end of August. If the economy was in better shape, then the Nafta talks would doubtless be less important to investors. But the government has been forced this year to run a budget surplus and push interest rates over 5 per cent in real terms to slow inflation, reduce demand for imports, and finance a Dollars 20bn trade deficit. However, if Nafta is passed, more foreign capital is likely to flow into Mexico, and the government could lower interest rates and increase spending without endangering its exchange and inflation rate targets. An agreement should, therefore, boost company sales and lower their financial costs. Under this scenario equities would look a bargain: the 30 largest listed stocks tracked by Baring Securities are trading at an estimated 1993 p/e ratio of just 10.3, compared with 14.9 in Chile, 12.5 in Argentina, and 10.4 in Brazil. But, as yet, there is no sign of a pick-up in the economy: first quarter growth was a modest 2.4 per cent, with some manufacturing sectors actually shrinking, and no-one is forecasting an expansion of more than 3 per cent for the year. The sluggish economy helped lower first quarter average earnings of the top 60 companies by some 10 per cent in real terms. But not all were affected equally. Some sectors, mainly in manufacturing, consumer goods, and heavy industry, fared worse than the average, while construction continued to expand. The result is that some stocks, mostly construction and mining, have risen in the past three months, while others, such as Telmex, Alfa, Tamsa and TMM, have slid on fears of lower earnings. 'Share prices have even varied within sectors as individual companies successfully adjust to growing competition and tighter margins, while competitors do not', says Mr Timothy Heyman, head of the Baring Securities office in Mexico City. Investors are now bracing themselves for second quarter results. Mr Pyers Griffith at James Capel in Mexico City says that sentiment in the corporate sector is depressed, and reckons earnings will be flat, or possibly down. Mr Heyman says that there will be a wide disparity in performance both between and within sectors, suggesting the importance of individual stock selection. Investors's attention will be fixed on Telmex, the exchange's largest stock in terms of market capitalisation, whose share price is already down nearly 20 per cent in the past six months. Telmex reported a 4.3 per cent decrease in profits and a worse than expected increase in revenues for the first quarter. Last month it warned that the second quarter was going to be difficult, causing another precipitous slide in the price. After the second quarter reporting season is over prospects for the market may improve. Mexico's inflation rate has finally reached single digits, while the trade balance has stopped growing. The government, therefore, has been able to allow interest rates on short-term government paper to fall to a year's low of 14.1 per cent without provoking capital outflows. If inflation continues to fall, and the trade balance shows further improvement, then the government could afford a further loosening in monetary and fiscal policy without raising the spectre of a devaluation. With a number of Mexican companies  - Aeromexico, ICA, Tamsa and Cemex among others  - heavily indebted in foreign currency, a devaluation would hit the market hard. Even during the bolsa's falls, foreign investors have shown a surprising interest in individual equity offerings. In the past couple of months a number of companies have made initial public offerings successfully in Mexican and international markets. A year ago such offerings would have been scuttled in a weak market; but foreign investors are showing more ability at discriminating between the market and individual stocks.</p>

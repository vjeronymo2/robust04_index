			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / DTI helps to finance late payments to construction industry The Department of Trade and Industry is helping to finance measures to combat late payment in the construction industry, Andrew Taylor writes. The department is giving Pounds 30,000 to the Federation of Master Builders, which yesterday launched a code of practice for its 17,500 members to encourage them and their customers to pay on time. The federation provides a telephone hot-line to members seeking legal advice on how to recover money they are owed. It also offers a credit check service in association with Infocheck, which allows companies to investigate the payment record of prospective employers, main contractors and sub-contractors. Under the voluntary code of practice, members will be expected to agree payment terms before signing contracts and honour these agreements. Lord Strathclyde, minister for small businesses, welcomed the code and urged other trade bodies to follow the federation's example. The grant runs until November.</p>

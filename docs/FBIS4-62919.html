			<p>BFN     [Text] The press service of the Ukrainian president and  Cabinet of Ministers has issued a statement on the situation in  Crimea. Here is the text:    The latest events in Crimea, the statements and practical  steps by officials of the Republic of Crimea, cause concern in  Ukraine and in international circles because of the possibility  of a sharp exacerbation of the sociopolitical situation on the  peninsula, the creation in the center of Europe of a hotbed of  danger, and instability.    The new leadership of the autonomy has gone from a  declaration of intent to concrete actions aimed at changing the  legal status of the autonomous republic of Crimea as a  constituent part of Ukraine. In particular, it has become known  that a regular meeting of the Crimean Supreme Council plans to  discuss the issue on returning to individual provisions of the 6  May 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, which  contravenes the Constitution of Ukraine and which were changed  by the Supreme Council of Crimea itself in September 1992. At  the same time there is an attempt to carry out the current  constitution of the Republic of Crimea and to create the basis  for Crimea's secession from Ukraine which would be a blatant  violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.    Attempts by the leadership of the Republic of Crimea to  legally introduce its own citizenship, to create its own  military formations, and to change the status of Sevastopol  cause concern. All of this contravenes the Constitution and the  laws of Ukraine and the generally recognized principles of  international law. The ambitious attempts by individual Crimean  politicians also go against the goodwill of Ukraine to  contribute to Crimea's all-round social, economic, and cultural  development. The Supreme Council of Ukraine itself gave the  Crimean oblast the status of an autonomous republic within the  composition of Ukraine. It adopted a law of Ukraine on the  delimitation of powers between the bodies of power of Ukraine  and the Republic of Crimea. The president of Ukraine adopted a  law on an open economy regime on the territory of the Republic  of Crimea. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers regulated,  together with the Crimean Government, issues of ownership,  formulation of the budget, and carried out a number of measures  to stabilize the economy in the Republic of Crimea. Ukraine is  genuinely carrying out a policy of renewing historical justice  with regard to the deported peoples and is contributing to the  return of the Crimean Tatar people to their historical homeland.    Crimea is and will remain a part of Ukraine, says the  Ukranian president's statement. However, instead of fully  exploiting the given opportunities to pull Crimea's economy out  of the crisis situation, certain political circles in the  autonomous republic have recently adopted a different course.  There is open speculation on the economic difficulties that  Ukraine as well as other CIS countries are suffering today, even  though in such difficult conditions Ukraine has, to a  considerable extent, found the possibility to cover Crimea's  deficit in financial and material resources. Despite these  objective realities, anti-Ukrainian and antistate feelings are  constantly being stirred up among the population of Crimea.  Facts prove that dangerous processes in the Republic of Crimea  do not have an exclusively internal Crimean origin but to a  considerable extent are stimulated by individual political  forces in Russia, whose actions have recently taken on signs of  open interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine.    In accordance with the Constitution and current Ukrainian  legislation, the Republic of Crimea is an autonomous and  constituent part of Ukraine which has wide powers in the  economic sphere, makes use of the natural wealth, ecology,  culture, and organizes community life. The Republic of Crimea,  as an autonomous and constituent part of Ukraine, is not a  bearer of state sovereignty and cannot enter into political  relations with foreign states. The validity of the Constitution  of Ukraine extends over the whole territory of Ukraine,  including Crimea. The territory of Ukraine is single,  indivisible, inviolable, and complete. Crimea cannot have its  own citizenship which is separate from Ukraine. Citizens of the  Republic of Crimea are citizens of Ukraine. The autonomy may  not have its own armed forces.    The press service of the president and the Cabinet of  Ministers of Ukraine is authorized to state that all necessary  measures will be adopted by the Ukrainian president and the  Supreme Council of Ukraine to stabilize the political situation  in Crimea and to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity. The  president of Ukraine will ensure absolute adherence to the  constitution and laws of Ukraine on the entire territory of the  state, including Crimea as a constituent part of Ukraine.    The press service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet  of Ministers of Ukraine notes that some political and public  figures of Russia are violating the rules and norms of behavior  on the territory of another state. In connection with this, in  the future, any attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of  Ukraine will be resolutely stopped in accordance with Ukraine's  legislation.</p>

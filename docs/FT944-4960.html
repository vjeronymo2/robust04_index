			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: The rising cost of running Kwik Save Mr Graeme Bowler, chief executive of grocery discounter Kwik Save since July 1993, was paid a total of Pounds 586,000 in his first year - 72 per cent more than his predecessor Mr Graeme Seabrook received in his final nine months with the company. Kwik Save's annual report, published yesterday, showed that it had to pay Mr Bowler a substantial premium to lure him away from his position as managing director of Franklins discount stores in Australia. On an annualised basis, Mr Bowler received about 30 per cent more than his predecessor. 'We paid a lot to get the right man,' the company said. 'Discounting is a very competitive business, and this is a man we went half-way round the world to get.' Kwik Save added that Mr Bowler, 55, had to be persuaded to leave an attractive position in Australia, and spend what may be the rest of his working life in the UK. The report shows that Mr Bowler earned a basic Pounds 260,000 in the year to August 27, some 45 per cent higher than Mr Seabrook's Pounds 179,000 in his final nine months. His benefits in kind were 53 per cent greater, at Pounds 40,000, while his bonus was more than twice as much, at Pounds 245,000 compared with Mr Seabrook's Pounds 105,000. His pension contributions were Pounds 41,000, against Mr Seabrook's Pounds 31,000.</p>

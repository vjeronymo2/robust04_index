			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Guzman 'peace offer' may bring end to Peru terror: Sally Bowen on imprisoned guerrilla leader's videotape call for his followers to end their struggle THE long war waged by hard-line Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas against the Peruvian state could be drawing to a close that would have been inconceivable little more than a year ago. President Alberto Fujimori made public at the weekend a video recording in which Abimael Guzman, Sendero's founder-leader, repeated his call for peace talks. In a script which could almost have been written by Mr Fujimori himself, Mr Guzman admitted the success of the Peruvian government's counter-subversion strategy, 'especially in the area of intelligence.' Mr Guzman said his capture and that of other high-ranking Sendero leaders had raised 'fundamental questions of leadership' within the organisation. The party confronted 'a great and historical decision,' he said. With the same 'firmness and resolution' that they had embarked upon the 'people's war' 13 years ago, they should now 'fight for a peace accord,' he said. The self-styled 'fourth sword of Marxism' (after Marx, Lenin and Mao), however, has not recanted. On the contrary, he claimed to have used classic communist concepts to 'make a concrete analysis of a concrete situation.' Mr Fujimori, for his part, has repeated what he said in his address to the UN general assembly on September 30 - that there can be no negotiations, only 'conversations.' Mr Guzman, after all, has been convicted of terrorism and, under Peruvian law, sentenced to life imprisonment; Sendero Luminoso has never been accorded belligerent status. Concessions would be limited to a relaxation of Mr Guzman's rigorous prison conditions, which appear to have affected him profoundly. In the video recording, the long-feared Sendero leader looked a shadow of his former combative self. Clean-shaven, smartly dressed, much slimmer and with his greying hair apparently tinted, he was filmed alongside companion and chief lieutenant Ms Elena Iparraguirre, obediently copying out his peace letter and signing it. Although Mr Fujimori coyly refuses to confirm it, the psychological victory over Mr Guzman seems to belong to Mr Vladimiro Montesinos, the shadowy former army captain who has become the president's chief adviser. Mr Montesinos first made contact with Mr Guzman last October in the early days of his captivity when their conversations ranged over philosophy, history and politics. In recent months, Mr Montesinos has frequently been the president's emissary to the Callao naval prison. It seems clear from the recent series of Guzman-Iparraguirre videos that Mr Montesinos succeeded in winning their confidence. Part of what Mr Fujimori called the 'psychological war' against Mr Guzman included allowing the pair to celebrate Ms Iparraguirre's birthday together. Mr Fujimori himself sent a cake and a small personal gift. Military experts interpret the two Guzman letters as a message to Sendero militants that the 'sixth plan' - which commenced in January 1992 and which the captured Mr Guzman had previously urged followers to continue with - should be abandoned. Some analysts believe the 'peace offer' may be a strategy to allow the hard-hit organisation to gain time and regroup. But, even if it is sincere, it may not be obeyed. An anonymous member of Sendero's 'metropolitan committee,' quoted in a Lima magazine, denounced the videos as 'a government trick to deceive the people.' He said the armed struggle would continue and forecast attacks in the near future against banks and selected government officials. Within hours of the most recent video broadcast, a Sendero column attacked a village in Ayacucho province and hacked 15 villagers to death in reprisal for forming an army-backed civilian militia. 'In far-flung areas of Peru, it may take longer for pacification to come about,' Mr Fujimori said. The government is planning to modify the current 'repentance laws' to encourage more disaffected Sendero supporters to surrender. Sendero expert Mr Carlos Tapia estimates some 600 militants have been killed and another 2,400 captured, accounting for about two-thirds of the group's active combatants. Few have voluntarily surrendered.</p>

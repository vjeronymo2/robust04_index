			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Chechnya accuses Moscow The break-away Caucasian republic of Chechnya accused Russia of open aggression against a sovereign state as unidentified helicopters attacked the airport in Grozny yesterday morning inflicting several casualties. Chechen officials threatened to wage a terrorist war against Russian cities unless the provovation ceased, local newsagencies said. Chechen opposition forces, which have been overtly backed by Moscow, were also reported to have issued an ultimatum that they would storm the capital unless Mr Dzhokhar Dudayev stood down as president yesterday. But in an interview with the Itar-Tass newsagency, Mr Dudayev denied he had received any ultimatum and Grozny was reported to be calm yesterday afternoon.</p>

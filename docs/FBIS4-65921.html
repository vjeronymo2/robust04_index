			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Philip Johnston article: "Britain Seeking EC Overhaul to </F> Curb Powers"]    [Text] An overhaul of the European Commission involving a  reduction of its powers to initiate legislation was proposed  last night by Britain's European Minister, Mr David  Heathcoat-Amory.    He gave the first insight into the radical reforms that  Britain will seek at the 1996 inter-governmental conference on  the future of Europe to try to hold back its centralising  tendencies.    Mr Heathcoat-Amory suggested that instead of a flood of  often  unwanted legislation from Brussels, the Council of Ministers  should agree a programme each year based on suggestions from the  Commission and after consultations with the European parliament.  The Commission would then oversee its implementation in member  states.    He also questioned the proliferation of Commissioners, whose  number is set to rise to 21 with the accession of four new  countries to the EC, and urged the next President of the  Commission after M Jacques Delors to place internal management  and restructuring at the centre of his concerns.    "This is not a suggestion made to try and weaken or derail  the European Union or to deny the Commission the powers they  need," Mr Heathcoat-Amory said.    "The need is rather to recognise that the European Union has  entered a new phase. There is now a substantial body of  European law. The emphasis should be on simplification, respect  for subsidiarity and ensuring compliance."    Mr Heathcoat-Amory, addressing the European Policy Forum in  London, said the case for a serious review of the Commission had  been established. Like many governments, it had caught the bug  of over-legislation .    Although the Commission does not pass its own laws once it  had made a proposal and launched a draft measure, it often  became impossible to stop, only to amend and modify.    "The legislation acquires a momentum of its own... Other  considerations, like cost, intrusiveness, effect of other  legislation and practicality, often take a back seat," said Mr  Heathcoat-Amory. "Too much legislation of the wrong sort can  weaken and discredit the European Union it is designed to  promote."</p>

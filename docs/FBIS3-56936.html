Yet  Commanders May Come to Agreement"]    [Excerpts] Recently Black Sea Fleet servicemen have often  been showing their concern over the failure to resolve the Black  Sea Fleet issue. [passage omitted]    In light of this the Black Sea Fleet Press Center has been  authorized to make it known to personnel that documents have  been submitted to the command indicating that the Russian Navy  leadership shares the Black Sea Fleet servicemen's concern over  the dragging out of the talks on the fleet's fate. The Russian  Federation Navy Command has sent a telegram to the Ukrainian  Defense Ministry pointing to the impermissibility of unilateral  actions with respect to the Black Sea Fleet.    "The Russian Federation Navy Command is doing everything  possible to ensure the implementation of the Massandra  agreements whereby the Black Sea Fleet with its infrastructure  is to pass under Russia's jurisdiction," the press center's  release stresses.    Attention in being drawn to the fact that the Russian  president has sent a letter to the Ukrainian president  suggesting that a detailed investigation be held into the  circumstances surrounding the death of Captain 1st Rank Andrey  Lazebnikov, head of the Black Sea Fleet press center, and  expressing concern over the deterioration of the crime situation  in Sevastopol.    On 17 January a telephone conversation took place between  Black Sea Fleet Acting Commander Vice Admiral Vitaliy Larionov  (Black Sea Fleet commander Admiral Eduard Baltin is currently on  vacation) and Vladimir Beskaravaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian  Navy. The sides discussed the current state of relations  between the two fleets, recognizing the impermissibility of  unilateral actions prior to top- level decisions on the Black  Sea Fleet being made.</p>
